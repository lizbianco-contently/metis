Mr. President, yesterday I witnessed what I think was \nprobably the best day of legislating on both sides of the aisle and on \nboth sides of the Capitol that I have seen in many, many years. \nBeginning here in the Senate, we did complete action on the nuclear \nwaste disposal legislation. It took a lot of effort, a lot of \ncooperation, and I think everybody deserves a lot of credit for the way \nit was handled.\n  Also, I want to commend the chairman of the Transportation \nAppropriations Committee and his ranking member. I think they put in an \nOlympic performance. Even though the hurdles were movable at times, \nthey continued to persist and were able to complete the transportation \nappropriations bill, and we appreciate the chairman's efforts on that; \nalso on a whole variety of conferences. Conferences were literally \nmeeting all over the Capitol yesterday, on MilCon appropriations, on \nhealth insurance reform, small business relief package, minimum wage, \non safe drinking water, on the terrorism task force. Everybody was \nworking hard, and I really was very impressed with the effort that \neverybody put into the day yesterday. I hope we can replicate that \nagain today.\n  This morning the Senate will immediately turn to the consideration of \nthe reconciliation bill conference report regarding welfare reform. \nThat conference report will be considered under the statutory debate \ntime limitation of 10 hours equally divided. I hope it will not take \nthe full 10 hours. I know a lot of Senators want to be heard, and \ncertainly they have that right in this time limit. But I hope maybe we \ncan yield back some of that time so that we can take up conference \nreports. We have a couple of them that we will probably have to vote \non. The D.C. appropriations conference report and military construction \nconference report will probably both have to be voted on.\n\n  This conference report is not amendable. Therefore, a vote on the \nadoption of the report will occur on the expiration or yielding back of \ndebate time. Following disposition of the reconciliation bill \nconference report, the Senate may be asked to turn to consideration of \nother available conference reports or appropriations bills.\n  After we have votes on the conference reports, it is my intention at \nthis time to go to the HUD-VA appropriations bill. The chairman, the \nSenator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, and the ranking member, Ms. Mikulski, \nhave been very patient and understanding; their bill has slipped so we \ncould move other, supposedly less controversial bills, but I hope we \ncan take up the HUD-VA appropriations bill late this afternoon or even \ntonight. Therefore, rollcall votes can be expected throughout today's \nsession and probably into the night.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me say to the majority leader on behalf \nof the Democratic leader that we intend to cooperate with him as much \nas we can, but I might say to the majority leader, as he understood, \nthe Democratic leader was quite upset last night when one of the judges \nhad an objection. That level of cooperation kind of broke open last \nnight.\n  So I just want to advise the majority leader that we will be \nattempting to continue to help him through the day, but it received a \nbump last evening.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand that, and I understand that we \nwill be in very close touch with the distinguished assistant minority \nleader, the whip, to make sure that when votes do occur today they are \nin coordination with the Democratic leader's\n\n[[Page S9322]]\n\nschedule, because we know he has some other things with which he is \nconcerned.\n  We understand about the bumps in the road, but it is kind of like the \nhurdles on the Transportation appropriations bill the Senator from New \nJersey helped work through. You just keep moving forward. You deal with \nthem, and you find a way to handle these problems, and we will keep \nworking with Senators to see that we can do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9321-4", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as I understand it, there are 10 hours \nequally divided. I hope we do not use 10 hours, and I will not take \nvery long. I will yield rather quickly to the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. If he would permit me to give just a quick oversight, I will \nyield on our side. But I do wish to announce there are a number of \nSenators who want to speak. I hope we do not have any lag time between \nspeakers. The Senators who have asked to speak are Hatch, Gramm, \nSpecter, Hutchison, Simpson, Coats, and Gorton. Some have indicated \nthey want to speak as much as 10 to 20 minutes. I am clearly going to \nhave plenty of time to accommodate them. I hope they will be watching \nhere so that we do not have big periods of time when we are in a quorum \ncall.\n  Mr. President, we come to the end of a long journey today to reform \nour Federal-State welfare programs. We take this final step today to \nsend to the President of the United States for his announced signature \nthe Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n1996.\n  As vice chairman of the welfare reconciliation conference, I wish to \nfirst thank the people who did the bulk of the work to bring this \nconference to a quick conclusion. On our side, I thank in particular \nSenator Roth, the chairman of the Finance Committee, who sits here. \nWithout his diligent work and that of his excellent staff, we would not \nbe here. I also thank, Senator Lugar, who chairs the Agriculture \nCommittee. For some it is not quite understood why a welfare bill can \ninclude agriculture issues. Of all of the nutrition programs that are a \npart of this package, most of them come within the jurisdiction of the \nAgriculture Committee, from food stamps on down. Obviously Senator \nLugar and his very dedicated staff must be given very high praise on \nour side of the aisle for their work.\n  These two distinguished chairmen and their staffs, from what I \nunderstood, worked tirelessly this last week. I was with them some of \nthe time. I know of no other budget reconciliation conference in our \nhistory that was completed as quickly as this--less than 1 week.\n  Now, obviously, the House and Senate have passed bills that were \nsomewhat similar--we have been at this a number of times. In fact, we \nhave heretofore sent to the President two bills that passed both the \nHouse and Senate and he vetoed them. So, completing the conference \nreport in 1 week seemed to us to be an achievable goal. And, indeed, \nthey have exceeded our expectation and finished in slightly less than a \nweek.\n\n  I believe part of the reason why this conference was completed so \nquickly is because the work on this issue has been in progress since \nthe beginning of the 104th Congress, which began almost a year and a \nhalf ago. Welfare reform was one of the top legislative agenda items of \nthis Congress. The former Republican leader, Senator Bob Dole, our \ncandidate for President, made welfare reform a centerpiece of our \nbroader effort to reform the Federal Government and return power back \nto the States and communities. For that, I want to indicate my great \npraise for our candidate for President, and our former leader. He had a \nlot to do with us being here today.\n  In addition, the national Governors, both Republicans and Democrats, \nhave worked over the last year, both with the Congress and the \nadministration, to help us make as informed judgments as we can.\n  This legislation truly represents and reflects the beginning of an \nopen partnership with the States. This openness will be critical to its \nlong-term success. We finally have decided what we should have decided \na long time ago, that the States should not be our junior partners: who \nwe tell how to do everything, do not listen to, and do not let make any \ninnovative changes or do anything different from State to State. For \ntoo long we have assumed that one shoe fits all and that the States \nbetter do as we say because we are paying some or most of the bill.\n  We have decided that the States and Governors and legislatures out \nthere in America are as concerned about the poor as we are. They are \nconcerned about their well-being and as concerned, if not more so, \nabout the status of welfare in their States--a program that was built \nupon and built upon over the past 60 years, but never contained any \nelements which were truly an incentive to go to work, or to improve \nyour own personal responsibility and take better care of yourselves, \nand thus of your children. It had become as if people were locked in \npoverty, kind of waiting around for the next minimal cash benefit check \nand whatever else went with it. The rewards were not great. The money \nwas not very much. But of those who got on it, many of them stayed on \nit forever because there were no tools to help them get their \neducations and look for jobs. There were not job placement approaches.\n  All of that will change when this bill becomes law. The essence of \nthe new welfare will be more like workfare. Welfare offices will turn \ninto work placement offices, into job training offices, into places \nwhere people can go to find out how to improve their skills and what \nhelp they can have while they are doing that, such as enhanced child \ncare. We put a great deal of resources in here, because we want many of \nthe people who are single heads of households, who have a couple of \nchildren, to be able to become trained and educated. So we have \nprovided about $14 billion over the next 6 years in this bill, in order \nto help parents who want to go find jobs with those things that they \nneed to take care of their children in the interim.\n  The spirit of bipartisanship is here today also. The President's \nstatement yesterday indicates he would sign this legislation, after \nhaving vetoed two previous attempts at welfare reform.\n  Our Senators may describe what we have done differently, but from my \nstandpoint I describe it in five simple ways:\n  First, we want to encourage and make people work. We believe work is \nthe best thing to make people feel more self-esteem. It builds personal \nresponsibility--which is precisely the opposite of the ethic we have \nbuilt into the welfare program heretofore. Able-bodied persons who seek \nassistance should seek work and employment, and only after failing to \nfind employment should they turn to the taxpayer for assistance.\n  Second, simple as it sounds, we ask parents to take care of their \nchildren. We stress personal responsibility and create incentives for \nfamilies to stay together. We reestablish one simple rule, parents \nshould take care of their children first. Accordingly, we track down \nand punish deadbeat fathers and mothers. Third, we change the culture \nof welfare. This is a culture that has\n\n[[Page S9323]]\n\ndominated and poisoned our good intentions for the last 61 years. We do \naway with the concept of an entitlement to a cash benefit. Welfare will \nhave a 5-year time limit for any recipients. No longer will welfare be \na way of life. It will be a helping hand--and not a handout.\n\n  Fourth, we cut endless, unnecessary Federal regulations and \nbureaucracies and bureaucrats by turning power and flexibility over to \nthe States and communities. That is where help for those in need can \nbest be determined and best be delivered, and where innovation will \nflourish. Better ways to do things will be found.\n  Fifth, and finally, this is a budget reconciliation bill, and these \nreforms will slow the growth of Federal and State spending for these \nprograms. Spending on the programs in this bill: the new temporary \nassistance for needy families block grant--temporary assistance for \nneedy families block grant, I repeat that--this is a new program, and a \nnew child care block grant program, and the reformed food stamp, SSI, \nchild nutrition, foster care--all of these, along with the earned-\nincome tax credit and other programs will increase from $100 billion \nthis year to nearly $130 billion per year 6 years from now. Total \nspending over the next 6 years for these programs will exceed $700 \nbillion.\n  For those who say we are not going to provide for those in need that \nwere heretofore on welfare, let me repeat: The combined programs will \nincrease from nearly $100 billion this year to $130 billion per year in \n6 years, hardly a reduction in expenditures. Let me repeat, the total \nprograms that I have just described, food stamps, SSI, child nutrition, \nfoster care, the block grant program for child care, the new block \ngrant to take the place of AFDC, which we will call temporary \nassistance for needy families--all of those programs will seek, from \nthe taxpayers of America, $700 billion over the next 6 years.\n  Nevertheless, our taxpayers should know that we will save, we will \nsave them, about $55 billion. This program in its reformed and more \nefficient mode will cost $55 billion less than it was assumed to cost \nif we had left everything alone and kept the entitlements wherever they \nwere.\n  I believe much of these savings are going to be achieved because we \nare making the programs work better. We are going to be pushing people \nto do what they should have been doing all along--get off the rolls \ninto work, off dependence into independence, off looking to somebody \nelse for responsibility and looking to themselves. And everywhere we \nturn, in this bill, there are provisions for those who just cannot do \nit. There are emergency set-asides, emergency allowances, there are \nprovisions, where it just cannot be done, to provide some of what must \nbe provided in addition to the basic program.\n  I would like to quote one of our very distinguished Senators, Senator \nRick Santorum--for whom I also extend my great appreciation for his \nhelp on the floor on many occasions during the debate on welfare. He \nstood here in my stead and he did a remarkable job. He came to the \nSenate well informed on this subject. He, at one point, said: ``Welfare \nreform has been and will continue to be a contentious issue. This \nlegislation is tough love.''\n  I concur. And I do not believe there is anything wrong with that \neither. I have some concerns about provisions in this legislation. \nOther Members will have their particular concerns, and the President \nhas expressed his. Unfortunately or fortunately, depending on your \nphilosophy of governance, it is possible and probable that even with \nthe President's signature we will not have seen the last of welfare \nreform. When he has signed it, we will probably see a completed law and \nwe will carry it out. In due course, we will see there are some areas \nthat need some repair, some fixing. But I believe, under any \ncircumstance, with a bill that is as much on the right track as this--\nalthough perhaps imperfect in certain areas--we should proceed. We \nshould let the reform move along.\n  For today, I believe, that the best hope we have to fulfill the \npromise we all made to the American public to change these programs as \nwe have known them--is to pass this bill overwhelmingly.\n  Making such fundamental changes to programs, some of which are 60 \nyears old, will surely require adjustments and additional tuning as we \nbegin to see how this legislation unfolds. But for those who seem \nfrightened of this change, and for those who want to find the areas \nwhere they have concern and that might need some repair in the future, \nI merely ask, is it possible that this welfare reform program can be \nworse than what we have?\n  I cannot believe that it is; because in a land of opportunity with \nuntold chances for people to succeed on their own and move ahead with \npersonal achievement and responsibility, in a land with plenty of that, \none thing that stands out as a testimonial to failure on the part of \nour legislative bodies and the executive branch is the welfare program \nof this country. This program, for the most part, moves people in the \nopposite direction of mainstream opportunity in America, and for many \nit locks them there. We must unlock their opportunity potential.\n  For today, I believe this is our best opportunity to change the \nculture of welfare and, once again, I repeat, to provide in every way \npossible a hand up, an opportunity up, not a handout. I believe these \nAmericans who are locked in welfare as we know it today are anxiously \nwaiting in their minds and in their hearts for a better way of life. \nWhat we are saying, is we hope we are providing that for you. We hope \nwe are giving many of you an opportunity to get out of welfare and get \ninto something that is more like what most Americans have the \nopportunity to be a part of.\n  In short, I believe this legislation is the best hope we have today \nto provide some real hope for a future for those families and children \nin our society who, in many, many instances, are totally without hope. \nBut we need to be honest and sober. I believe proponents and opponents \nmay be overstating the results, but I believe the overwhelming \nconsequences of this bill will be positive. The legislation represents \na fundamental change in social policy. We elected officials should not \nassume that this legislation is perfect. The one thing the last 61 \nyears should have taught us is that no one can be all-knowing.\n  So let us be proud of this significant accomplishment today. I \nbelieve it is the right legislation for the future. But let us also \nremain vigilant and sober. Many people's lives will be affected by this \ncritical legislation, and we hope for most of the overwhelming \npercentage it is for the better.\n  Again, I congratulate the Members of the House and Senate who have \nworked to help bring this legislation before us today. I am hopeful \nthat we will put an end shortly to welfare as it is.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, let me start off by saying that I \ngreatly respect my colleague on the other side of the aisle, the \nmanager and the chairman of the Budget Committee. I listened to him \ncarefully, and I know that he is a man of compassion and concern. I \nhave seen it manifested in many ways: his interest in the mentally ill, \nhis interest in the disabled. This is someone who cares about people. \nSo when I talk about my difference in view, this is my personal \nperspective and, by no means do I intend to criticize the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I take this opportunity, acting as the minority \nmanager on this conference report, to make my remarks, and they reflect \nmy opinion. This is not a consensus view that I have mustered; this is \nthe opinion of the Senator from New Jersey, who has been on the Budget \nCommittee for some time and draws on some experience from my corporate \nworld, as I discuss my perspective.\n  This is a historic and peculiar time for the U.S. Senate. The body is \non the verge of ending a 60-year guarantee that poor children in this \ncountry might not go hungry. I salute the attempts to solve the \nproblem. I am right with all the others, including the President of the \nUnited States, in wanting to solve the problem.\n\n[[Page S9324]]\n\n  The question is not whether one wants to solve the problem; the \nquestion is, how do you solve it? This is going to be a test not only \nof our pocketbooks and our resources, but of our hearts as well. Though \nI have heard it described as bleeding hearts, I am willing to accept \nthe nomenclature that has applied, because having had my life \nexperience when in the Depression years my family was, to use the \nexpression, dirt poor, and my father had to go to work on a WPA \nprogram, it was a humiliating experience for him to have to go to work \non a Government program. But he buried his pride for a moment, and he \ndid what he could to support his family.\n  I don't know many people who want to humiliate themselves standing in \na line waiting for their welfare check. Yes, there are some cheats out \nthere and there are druggies and there are drunks. They are out there, \nthere is no question about it, but a lot of those people are simply \npeople who have not yet discovered a way out of their misery and their \npoverty.\n  Women with children, many of them unwed--I do not approve of that \ncondition, but that is life. The punishment should never exceed the \ndeed, and that is what I fear, Mr. President, we are about to do in \nthis body of ours, in our beloved country. For 60 years, we could rest \neasier at night and be sure American children had a minimum safety net. \nThe bill before us takes away this peace of mind and throws up to \n1,100,000 children into poverty, according to a study by the Urban \nInstitute.\n  I agree, the welfare system is in need of repair, and I believe that \nit needs to promote work and self-sufficiency, pride and dignity. That \nis going to make the difference.\n  I think it should also, however, protect children and, unfortunately, \nI am not certain at all that this so-called welfare reform does it.\n  First, the Republican bill does not promote work. It asks for work. \nIt demands work. I heard the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee say we can make people work. That is a requirement for \nwelfare recipients. But it does not require the resources to put people \nto work.\n  In fact, CBO said that most States would be unlikely to satisfy this \nwork requirement for several reasons. One major reason is that this \nbill cuts funding for work programs by combining all welfare programs \ninto a capped block grant.\n  Second, the Republican bill hurts children. It would make deep cuts \nin the Food Stamp Program, which millions of children rely on for their \nnutritional needs. It would also end the guarantee that children will \nalways have the safety net. Under this bill, a State could adopt a 60-\nday time limit, and after that the children would be cut off from the \nsafety net entirely.\n  The State would not even be required to provide a child with a \nvoucher for food, clothing, or medical care. When you take all of these \npolicies together, this bill will put an estimated approximately 1.1 \nmillion children into poverty. And this is a conservative estimate. It \ncould be higher.\n  Mr. President, my conscience does not permit me to vote for a bill \nthat will likely plunge children into poverty.\n  I had an experience some years ago when I was at the Earth summit in \nBrazil with the now Vice President of the United States and other \nSenators, Republican and Democrat. We were dining at a restaurant, \nfacing a beautiful harbor in Rio. The restaurants were separated by \nrows of shrubs--beautiful places, a marvelous atmosphere. I saw a light \nbrown hand reach through the bush and take food off the table. Children \nstarving, thousands of them, sometimes chased by the police, sometimes \nshot at because they crowded the doors.\n  Mr. President, a child who is hungry will go to any means, as will an \nadult, to satisfy their hunger. I am worried about that. I cannot vote \nto leave our children unprotected. I was one of only 11 Democrats to \nvote against the original Senate welfare bill that would have put 1.2 \nmillion children into poverty. I voted against the conference report on \nthis bill that would have doomed 1.5 million children to the same fate. \nI will vote against this bill for the same reason. We dare not abandon \nour children.\n  Mr. President, I hold a different vision of what the safety net in \nthis country should be. I am concerned, frightened, that this bill will \nleave children hungry and homeless. I am afraid the streets of our \nNation's cities might someday look like the streets of the cities of \nBrazil. Walk around there and you see children begging for money, \nbegging for food, and even at 8 and 9 years old engaging in \nprostitution.\n  Tragically, that is what happens to societies that abandon their \nchildren. When we don't protect our kids, they resort to their own \nmeans to survive. I do not want to see that happen in this country. I \nwant to see this country invest in children.\n  I think we should invest more in child care and health and nutrition \nso that our kids can become independent, productive citizens. I want to \ngive them the opportunity to live the American dream like I and so many \nin this room had the good fortune to do. If we do not, we will create a \npermanent underclass in this country. We will have millions of children \nwith no protection, and we are going to doom them to failure.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Budget Committee, I also want to \ncomment on the priorities that are reflected in this reconciliation \nbill. Despite the fact that this bill is only limited to safety net \nprograms, it is still considered a reconciliation bill. The bill \nreceives the same protections as a budget-balancing bill, but there is \nno balanced budget in it. This reconciliation bill seeks to cut the \ndeficit only by attacking safety net programs for poor children, for \nlegal immigrants.\n\n  There are no cuts in corporate loopholes or tax breaks, despite the \nfact that the tax expenditures cost the Federal Treasury over $400 \nbillion a year. There are no such savings in this bill. There are no \ngrazing fee increases, no mining royalties, no savings in the military \nbudget or NASA's budget.\n  The only cuts in this bill come from women and children. This \nreconciliation bill gives new meaning to putting women and children \nfirst.\n  Mr. President, I realize that this bill is going to pass. I \nunderstand the President clearly has indicated that he is going to sign \nit. However, as the distinguished Senator from New Mexico mentioned, \nthe President and many of us are determined to examine a package of \nchanges next year to soften the blow of the harsh provisions in this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, we have seen the reaction of people regarding this \nbill. When you hear from the mayor of one of the world's most \ndistinguished cities, New York City Mayor Giuliani, he is worried about \nwhere they get the money in the block grants to supply the job \ntraining, the child care support. He is concerned, as are many mayors \nacross the country we have heard from.\n  Mr. President, I will, for a moment, just relate an experience that I \nhad when I ran a corporation, a big corporation. When I left to come to \nthe U.S. Senate, we had over 16,000 employees, a very successful \ncompany. We were a company, founded in New Jersey, that tried to work \nwithin our community. The company still has its headquarters in New \nJersey and employs almost 30,000 people today.\n  I always tried, since I came from a poor background of hard-working, \nhonest people who always wanted to keep their heads high and always \nwanted to do the right thing and not ask anybody for anything--but \nthere were times when we needed help. If I did not have the GI bill, \nMr. President, I doubt that I would be standing in front of the U.S. \nSenate and the American people today. So, we were very conscientious, \nmy partners and I, about trying to understand what was happening around \nus. We began to hire people, or we attempted to hire people, who were \nliterally unemployable with job after job, short-term employment, and \nthen back on the streets.\n  We brought people into the computer room, not into the factory. We \ndid not have a factory. I was in the computer business. We brought them \ninto the computer room, and we had one startling success among several \npeople that we worked with. The reason for that success was very \ninteresting. The reasons for failure were obvious, because though we \nwould give these people a job, and they would be enthusiastic about it \nfor a couple days, as soon as they got back into their environment and \nas soon as they were faced with\n\n[[Page S9325]]\n\npoverty and despair and drugs and crime, they fell right back in the \ntrap. They were useless as employees in very short order.\n  But the one person who succeeded so well, we got an apartment for \nher, and we moved her, helped her move from her ghetto area to a more \nmiddle-class area. The success was astounding. This woman, when we \nhired her, she was 25 years old. She had very limited education. She \nbecame a computer room supervisor--a good job--and went on to become a \npart of management in the company. It was a startling success, because \nit was not that we said, you have to go to work and have to show up on \ntime. We said that to everybody. You say that to all of your employees. \nAll of them do not do it. It needs training. It needs commitment.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that this bill that is being considered today, \nthis reconciliation bill, will not be the first step toward larger \nproblems than we can understand today, toward the kind of situation \nwhere America turns its heart into stone and says, OK, we are here as \naccountants, we are here to cut the budget.\n  I want to cut the budget. I have programs to cut the budget to arrive \nat a balanced budget. I know what happens in the corporate world when \nyour expenses get too high and your revenues too low. You make changes, \nmake them selectively. We did not just cut every department if we had \nto reduce expenses. Maybe it was time to cut the marketing department \nor the production department or the products design department. But I \nalways thought about the long term. We are abandoning the long term. \nWhat we are doing is giving a lot of people political satisfaction, \nthose who work here and those who are outside who hear us on TV and the \nradio.\n  Mr. President, I make my remarks in the full context of the \nrealization of where we are. This bill has lots of support. I am not, I \npromise you--not--attempting or trying to influence people to vote \nagainst it. I am stating the case as I see it. I hope it will in some \nway encourage others to think very deeply about their decision to vote. \nI thank you and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time does the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware desire?\n  Mr. ROTH. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield up to 15 minutes to the Senator from Delaware, \nSenator Roth.\n  Mr. ROTH. First of all, let me thank the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico for his gracious remarks about me and my staff. I just point \nout that we would not have been able to complete the reconciliation \nwithin a week if it had not been for his leadership, for the assistance \nand help that he provided at any time when it became necessary in the \ndifficult negotiations that had to take place. I want to publicly thank \nthe Senator for his contribution.\n  Mr. President, this day is a remarkable turning point in the lives of \nmillions of American families and generations to come. This is the day \nwe will reorder our confused and confounding system of welfare. A world \nspinning out of control will be brought back into proper course. It \nwill return to order not through the power of Washington but through \npersonal responsibility and work opportunity, the very title of this \nimportant legislation.\n  I say to my distinguished friend from New Jersey that what we seek to \ndo here is to provide the same kind of opportunity that was given to \nhim, through help to go to college, but particularly as he tried to \nhelp that lady into the mainstream of life by giving her meaningful \nwork. I think that is what we are all seeking to do together.\n  Mr. President, this is the third time welfare reform will have passed \nin the 104th Congress. The issue of welfare reform has been frequently \nand passionately debated over these past months, and rightly so. The \neffects and consequences of the welfare system in some way touches us \nall.\n  During this time, the Finance Committee has held 19 hearings and \ntaken testimony from 90 witnesses. We have found that the current AFDC \nprogram, as it was designed in the 1930's, abandoned many families long \nago as a statistic of long-term dependency in contemporary society. The \ncurrent welfare system has failed the very families it was intended to \nserve.\n  If the present welfare system was working so well we would not be \nhere today. I think that is a point well worth underscoring because the \nfact is, as the record shows, that this current system has not been \ngood for children. For anyone who believes that it has, I recommend you \nread the findings section of this legislation. I have yet to hear \nanyone defend the present system as good for children.\n  I point out that in 1965 there were 3.3 million children on AFDC; by \n1992, that had risen to over 9 million children. In 1992, 9 million \nchildren were on welfare, AFDC, despite the fact that the total number \nof children in this country has declined. Last year, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services estimated if we do nothing, 12 million will \nbe on AFDC in 10 years.\n  I reemphasize once again that the present system is not good for \nchildren. But the record clearly demonstrates the contrary--that \ninstead of being good, we find more and more children being trapped in \na system and into dependency on welfare.\n  As I said, to do nothing is absolutely unacceptable. Mr. President, \n90 percent of the children on AFDC live without one of their parents. \nOnly a fraction of welfare families are engaged in work. The current \nwelfare system has cheated the children of what they need most--among \nthese is hope, the necessary condition of liberation from dependency. \nThe key to their success will not be found in Washington but in the \ntimeless values of family and work.\n\n  Opponents of welfare believe that the States lack either the \ncompassion or the capacity, or both, to serve needy families. They are \nwrong. We promised welfare reform and we have kept our promise. Our \nlegislation is built upon the original principles from which we have \nnever waivered. This is a bipartisan bill. Half of the Senate \nDemocratic Members who served on the conference voted for the bill when \nit passed the Senate by an overwhelming margin. Yesterday, this \nconference report passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 328 \nto 101. Half of the Democrats in the House of Representatives voted for \nthis bill. I believe that demonstrates the bipartisan spirit upon which \nwe have approached welfare reform.\n  A number of people deserve our thanks and credit for giving us this \nopportunity today. First, let me give credit and thanks to Senator Bob \nDole, our former majority leader. Even after welfare reform had been \nvetoed twice, Bob Dole insisted that we could and should remain \nsteadfast in our fundamental principles and achieve welfare reform. Bob \nDole introduced a welfare bill before he left the Senate which was, \nfrankly, the benchmark of our conference report before us. His last \nadvice to me was to make sure this job gets done this year. I have to \nsay, Mr. President, today's action reflects his work, reflects his \nvision, reflects his leadership.\n  Our Nation's Governors, most especially the lead Governors on welfare \nand Medicaid reform, people like John Engler, Tommy Thompson, Mike \nLeavitt, Tom Carper, Bob Miller, Lawton Chiles, and Roy Romer deserve \nour thanks and credit for their work to make welfare reform a reality. \nI look forward to working with them again to face the challenge of \nMedicaid reform.\n  Even though Senator Moynihan does not support our legislation, I want \nto thank him for his work and insights into this extremely complex \nworld of welfare. Perhaps no one has done more over the past three \ndecades than Senator Moynihan to bring the alarming growth in welfare \nto the Nation's attention.\n  President Clinton has announced his support for this hard-won \nconference report and he is to be congratulated for that decision. It \nis the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, while the present welfare system is full of excuses, \nthe welfare reform legislation being presented to the American people \ntoday is indeed a bold challenge. And while the present system quietly \naccepts the dependency of more than 9 million children, our proposal \nspeaks loudly to them and insists that they, too, must be among the \nheirs to the blessings of this great Nation.\n  Welfare reform is about helping families find the freedom and \nindependence we take so much for granted.\n  Mr. President, this legislation clearly points the way to that \nindependence.\n\n[[Page S9326]]\n\n But the road to independence does not begin or end in Washington. \nIndependence begins with living up to one's responsibilities. This is \nechoed through the legislation with the provisions on work, time-\nlimited benefits, limits on benefits for noncitizens, and strong child \nsupport enforcement reforms.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes. Mr. President, \nthere is a concrete reason for voting for this less-than-perfect bill. \nFor millions of Americans, this legislation can be a tool for turning \nthe welfare check into a trampoline for opportunity and independence. I \nknow this because my home State of Oregon has achieved it.\n  Once more, the State of Oregon has marked a path for the Nation. By \nputting in place our welfare reform program, known as Jobs Plus, we \nhave shown the Nation that it is possible to be both tough and \ncompassionate. With our Jobs Plus Program, we have been able to have \nstrong work requirements and critically needed child care and medical \ncare for folks coming off of welfare. The plan is working for both \ntaxpayers and those coming off of welfare. And as the President said \nyesterday, today's legislation can spark more States into going with \nthe kind of approach we have at home.\n  Mr. President, a few years ago, an Oregonian approached me on the \nstreet and said, ``You know, for me, welfare is kind of like `economic \nmethadone.' You guys send me a check. The checks always come, but you \npeople never let me do anything to break out, to get off welfare.''\n  This legislation provides the way to break out--a real key for \nunlocking the riddle of welfare dependency. I think it is an \nopportunity to remake this system that doesn't work for those who are \nin it and doesn't work for the taxpayers who pay for it.\n  Take child care, for example. Child care is an absolute prerequisite \nto changing welfare. I chaired hearings looking at the child care \nissue, and we heard heartbreaking accounts of how, again and again, \nwomen would get off of welfare, they would be doing well in the private \nsector, but their child care would fall apart just as they were getting \nback on their feet.\n  This bill provides $3.5 billion more than current law for that \ncritically needed child care. That increase of $3.5 billion in child \ncare is going to be absolutely critical to helping folks get off \nwelfare.\n  In addition, as several of my colleagues have noted, child support is \nstrengthened. I am also pleased that Medicaid is protected as a \nguarantee for all of our Nation's children.\n  Now, at the beginning of this Congress, there was a lot of talk about \norphanages. A lot of us did not particularly think that all of these \norphanages were exactly Boys Town, and nobody seemed to zero in on the \nquestion that if an orphanage was Boys Town, it would come with a big \nprice tag for taxpayers. So a lot of us thought that we ought to do \nsomething better. I worked very hard to develop a new approach known as \n``Kinship Care.'' What the Kinship Care amendment says is that the \nNation's grandparents--the millions of loving grandparents--would get \nfirst preference when a youngster from a broken home needs help. \nInstead of sending the children away, the grandparents, if they met the \nchild custody standards, would get first preference. Along with \nCongresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, Congressman Clay Shaw, and Senator \nDan Coats, on a bipartisan basis, we all worked together on this \nkinship care amendment.\n\n  Now, as we look to the 21st century when, as a result of the \npopulation trends and demographics, there are going to be many more \ngrandparents, we have an opportunity to keep families together, to use \na new model known as kinship care to provide loving care for youngsters \nin a cost-effective way.\n  Mr. President, this legislation doesn't meet my definition of \nperfection. I will say that I, frankly, detest a couple of these \nprovisions--particularly, what was done with the food stamp shelter \ndeduction and the legal immigrant provisions. So this legislation \ndoesn't meet my textbook standard of what would constitute perfection. \nI, like a number of our other Senators, am going to fight very hard to \nmake changes in this area. As I think it is critical to do, we ought to \nbe constructive and we ought to look at useful ways that Senators can \nwork on a bipartisan basis for changes.\n  For example, there has been a lot of talk in this Congress about the \nidea of a lock box, the idea of special accounts so that when the \nspending is reduced, those funds are protected for deficit reduction. I \nhave supported that concept. I think the lock box makes sense. Frankly, \nI think we ought to look at a new idea, and we can call it the lunch \nbox. We could make sure that when you eliminate some of those tax \nloopholes, when you go after wasteful spending, some of those funds \ncould be put in what I call the lunch box, and we could use these \nsavings to try fresh approaches to ensure that all Americans have \naccess to good nutrition. I think there are a number of new, innovative \napproaches that we ought to try and that are going to be needed, even \nafter this bill is enacted and signed into law.\n  At the end of the day, Mr. President, the question, to me, is \nstraightforward: Is this legislation better than the status quo? Is it \nbetter than the system that an Oregonian told me was like economic \nmethadone? I think that when you look at the child care provisions, at \nthe Medicaid guarantee, when you look at the opportunity for States to \nfollow the path that Oregon has followed with our Jobs Plus Program, I \nbelieve you see the case for supporting this legislation. I intend to \nvote for it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as manager of the time on this side, I \nwant to indicate that Senator Gorton will be recognized to take my \nplace, and he will have up to 15 minutes, and then he will indicate \nthereafter the sequence until I arrive back on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWashington State.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I greatly admire those who, during the \ncourse of this debate over the last year and a half, expressed great \nconfidence in the consequences of the passage of this bill or of its \npredecessors. I expressed that admiration both for those who are as \nconfident that the bill will end a culture of dependency as for those \nwho view with alarm what they believe will vastly increase poverty \namong the people of the United States. While I admire their certainty, \nI cannot join in it.\n\n  I must say, Mr. President, that I am not at all certain of what the \nconsequences of the passage of this bill will be. I hope and I am \ninclined to believe that they will primarily be positive, but I cannot \nbe certain. In that regard, Mr. President, I agree fully with the views \nexpressed yesterday in the Washington Post by Robert Samuelson, and I \nwill quote three sentences of his review:\n\n       The exercise aims to promote self-reliance by making it \n     harder for people to rely on government. Without the threat \n     of extra suffering, people would have no reason to change. \n     What can't be predicted is how the good and bad will balance.\n\n  Mr. President, I find that entire column to be so persuasive--and not \nat all, incidentally, to be so similar to my own views--that I ask \nunanimous consent that the entire column be printed in full at the end \nof my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on the other hand, what I do know and what \nI feel confident in stating is that our present welfare system is a \ntragic and destructive failure. At the very least, the present system \nhas been accompanied by a massive increase in the very conditions that \nit was designed to alleviate: illegitimacy, family breakup, a negative \nattitude toward work, a culture of dependency. At most, our present \nsystem has been a contributing cause to those conditions.\n  I should also like to observe, Mr. President, that those who oppose \nthis bill, by and large, are those who individually--or whose \nphilosophy--have guided and managed the system that this bill in large \npart dismantles. These people, these ideas clearly represent the \nconventional wisdom, a conventional wisdom that has guided and produced \nevery change in welfare policy in\n\n[[Page S9327]]\n\nthis country, or almost every such change, for at least the past 30 \nyears. Their present advice is to view with alarm these changes, to \nattempt to preserve the status quo, except to ask that we do a little \nbit more of what we have been doing with these last several decades.\n  Mr. President, that conventional wisdom is bankrupt and ought to be \nabandoned, not only for the sake of our society as a whole but for the \nsake of the supposed beneficiaries of these welfare policies.\n  Those of us who support this legislation, these changes, hope with \nsome reason that this bill will increase incentives to work, some of \nthose incentives being positive and some negative. We hope, with some \nreason, that it will result in strong disincentives for teenage \npregnancy and illegitimacy. We are convinced that it will require \ngreater male parental support for their children.\n  But the heart of this bill--not with total consistency, after all, \nwith the compromises that have entered into it--but the heart of this \nproposal is consistent with my own uncertainties about specific \nconsequences resulting from specific policies. That central feature is \nto end the absolute entitlement to welfare, to end the detailed Federal \nregulation of the way in which welfare policies are administered by \nthe State, to end the massive bureaucratic interference with every \ndetail of welfare policy, and to encourage--for that matter, to \nrequire--a wide range of experimentation in welfare policies among our \n50 States.\n\n  I suppose that States which really want to pay for even more generous \nwelfare systems than they have at the present time will be able to find \na way to do so, and that there may be a handful of such States. Perhaps \nmore significantly, those States that want to adopt tough work \nrequirements will be able to do so. Those States that want to provide \nfor greater training and child care will be able to do so. Those States \nthat want to impose strong disincentives against dependency will be \nable to do so.\n  In fact, in a relatively short period of time after the passage of \nthis bill, we will have 50 distinct and different systems of welfare in \nthe United States. We will learn just how much private sector charities \ncan and will do in the welfare field. We know that in certain areas \nthey have been magnificently successful at much lower cost than any \ngovernment-run program. How much that private sector effort can be \nincreased we simply do not know at the present time, but we will learn \nas a result of this bill.\n  As a consequence, 5 years from now or 10 years from now, I believe \nthat we will know far more about which welfare policies work and which \ndo not. Perhaps we will even know enough to lead us wisely to a more \ncentralized system of adopting those policies which seem to have worked \nwell. I suspect, I hope, and I think this 50-State experimentation will \nprobably be successful enough so that our successors will wish it to \ncontinue.\n  Mr. President, I am gratified but not at all surprised that a poll-\ndriven President of the United States has agreed to sign this bill. \nThat agreement means that we are talking here, debating here, something \nreal--real changes in policy with a real impact on our society and on \nour citizens.\n  It would be very difficult to do worse than we have been doing over \nthe course of the last several decades. We have a marvelous opportunity \nto do far better. The time has come to act. The day is at hand on which \nwe will act.\n  I commend this magnificent new experiment to my colleagues.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 31, 1996]\n\n                          For Better or Worse?\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       We are now hearing a lot about the promise and peril of \n     ``welfare reform.'' To its champions, the legislation nearing \n     congressional approval would destroy the ``culture of \n     dependency.'' Critics see it as further impoverishing many \n     poor families. Both are correct. The exercise aims to promote \n     self-reliance by making it harder for people to rely on \n     government. Without the threat of extra suffering, people \n     would have no reason to change. What can't be predicted is \n     how the good and bad will balance.\n       I have put ``welfare reform'' in quotes, precisely because \n     ``reform'' is a term of art. It is automatically attached to \n     any scheme for social change, from ``campaign finance \n     reform'' to ``school reform.'' In debates about these \n     proposals, the protagonists act as if they can easily \n     foretell the effects, for good or ill. As often as not, this \n     convenient fiction spawns ``reforms'' with many unintended \n     consequences. The process is now in full swing with ``welfare \n     reform.''\n       The combatants regularly issue confident predictions and \n     shrill denunciations that depict a fixed future. Last week, \n     for example, the Urban Institute, a research group, released \n     a study estimating that the House-passed welfare bill would \n     increase the number of people in poverty by 2.6 million \n     people, including 1.1 million children. Naturally, opponents \n     of the legislation seized upon this to emphasize how bad it \n     is. But a close look at the study shows that its conclusions \n     ought to be highly qualified.\n       The House and Senate bills would give states great \n     flexibility to run their welfare programs within broad \n     federal guidelines. Total lifetime federal benefits would be \n     limited to five years, though states could exempt 20 percent \n     of their caseloads. States would be pressured through complex \n     regulations to move most mothers into some type of ``work'' \n     within two years. After making some assumptions about state \n     programs, the Urban Institute study estimates that the loss \n     of benefits would outweigh the increase in earnings from \n     jobs.\n       This could happen. The study's assumptions aren't \n     implausible. But uncertainties abound. First, the full rise \n     of people in poverty would occur only in 2002 after all the \n     bill's provisions took effect. Between now and then, Congress \n     (or the states) could make changes if things went badly. This \n     is especially true of one of the bill's worst provisions: the \n     denial of many benefits, including food stamps, to legal \n     immigrants. That alone accounts for about two-fifths of the \n     bills' benefit cuts.\n       Second, the increase in the poor would be much less--only \n     800,000 and not 2.6 million--if the Urban Institute had used \n     the government's official definition of poverty. I cite this \n     difference not because I think the Urban Institute \n     deliberately inflated the impact of ``welfare reform'' but \n     because it shows how perceptions can be shaped by somewhat \n     arbitrary statistics.\n       (For numbers freaks, the difference arises because the \n     government definition counts only cash income to determine \n     who falls below the poverty line: $15,141 for a family of \n     four in 1994. Excluded are benefits such as food stamps that \n     substitute for cash. The Urban Institute counts many of these \n     benefits. As a result, the Urban Institute finds many fewer \n     poor people; but if welfare reform cuts non-cash benefits, \n     the impact on recorded poverty is greater. Still, the number \n     of poor by the Urban Institute's count--even after adding 2.6 \n     million--would be almost 25 percent lower than under the \n     government count).\n       Statistics aside, what matters are people. Would more be \n     made better or worse off by ``welfare reform''? \n     Unfortunately, we can't answer that, because we can't predict \n     all of ``reform's'' effects. The Urban Institute examines one \n     aspect of change: the shift from welfare to work. The study \n     assumes that two-thirds of mothers who lost welfare would get \n     jobs--many part-time--paying about $6 an hour. That wouldn't \n     offset all the lost benefits. But this may miss some other \n     favorable effects. Stingy welfare would discourage some out-\n     of-wedlock births and prompt some parents to marry. ``The \n     main route off welfare for good is marriage,'' says Douglas \n     Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute.\n       How large might these changes be? Neither Besharov nor \n     anyone else knows. But the social climate is shifting, and \n     ``welfare reform'' is simply a part of the change. Harsher \n     welfare may reinforce the message that many teens are hearing \n     elsewhere; and the impact may be amplified by tougher \n     enforcement of child support payments and more prosecution \n     for statutory rape of older men who prey on young girls. \n     Teens account for 29 percent of out-of-wedlock births; the \n     worst aspects of the ``welfare problem'' would diminish if, \n     somehow, these pregnancies would drop.\n       The case for the present ``welfare reform'' is that, \n     despite many flaws, it would disrupt the existing system. As \n     Mickey Kaus argues in Newsweek, we may discover what works \n     and what doesn't. Some states would emphasize job training \n     and child care for welfare mothers; others would impose harsh \n     time limits. All could be forced to examine how charities, \n     churches and self-help groups can best aid vulnerable \n     families. This process is already occurring through \n     ``waivers'' granted to states to modify existing federal \n     rules; the legislation would give change further impetus.\n       We ought to be sober about the possibilities. We are \n     dealing with the most stubborn problems of poverty--family \n     breakdown, low skills and human relationships. Changing how \n     people behave isn't easy. Indeed, new government figures show \n     that out-of-wedlock births continue to rise, as Charles \n     Murray notes in the Weekly Standard. In 1994, they were 32.6 \n     percent of all births, up from 23 percent in 1990. These \n     numbers are an argument for assaulting the status quo and a \n     reminder of how hard it will be to change.\n       The remaining drama over the welfare bill is mostly \n     political: Will President Clinton sign it? And who then--a \n     Republican Congress or a Democratic president--will get the \n     credit or blame for enacting or killing ``reform''? However \n     the drama ends, the welfare dilemma will endure. It is this: \n     How can a\n\n[[Page S9328]]\n\n     decent society protect those who can't protect themselves \n     without being so generous that it subverts personal \n     responsibility? No one on either side of this bitter debate \n     has an obvious answer.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am here to speak, but out of deference to Senator \nMoynihan, who is ranking member of the Finance Committee and, more \nimportantly, who has shown an intellectual and personal public policy \ncommitment, probably unlike anyone in the Senate, I will suggest the \nabsence of a quorum so we can see whether or not Senator Moynihan wants \nto speak now. If not, I will speak.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, while we are waiting, I wish to insert \ninto the Record an op-ed piece today by Frances Fox Piven in the New \nYork Times called ``From Workhouse to Workfare.''\n  This is a very powerful piece. It concludes with the statement that \nthe ``facts don't seem to matter'' in the debate over this welfare \nbill. ``We may have to relive the misery and moral disintegration of \nEngland in the 19th century to learn what happens when society deserts \nits most vulnerable members.''\n  That is the conclusion of this article.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n                       From Workhouse to Workfare\n\n                         (By Frances Fox Piven)\n\n       If Bill Clinton, as an Oxford student, had studied the \n     history of the poor in early 19th century England, he might \n     not have decided to sign the welfare reform bill.\n       Eminent English social thinkers developed a justification \n     for an 1834 law that eliminated relief for the poor. Learned \n     arguments showed that giving them even meager quantities of \n     bread and coal harmed both the larger society and the poor \n     themselves.\n       Never mind the rapid enclosure by the rich of commonly used \n     agricultural land; never mind the displacement of hand-loom \n     weavers by mechanized factories; never mind the decline in \n     the earnings of rural workers. The real causes of poverty and \n     demoralization were not to be found in these large economic \n     changes, the thinkers said, but rather in the too-generous \n     relief for the poor. The solution was to stop giving relief \n     to people in their own homes; instead, survival for the \n     family meant entering prison-like workhouses.\n       The misery and reduced life spans that ensued were well-\n     documented not only by historians but ultimately by \n     Parliament, which investigated the workhouses and the riots \n     against them. England came to learn that the theory that \n     relief itself caused poverty was wrong, and replaced the Poor \n     Law with a modern system of social assistance.\n       No matter what England learned, the United States \n     Government is eagerly following the 1834 script by ending \n     Federal responsibility for welfare and turning it over to the \n     states. The arguments are the same: welfare encourages young \n     women to quit school or work and have out-of-wedlock babies. \n     Once on the doll these women become trapped in dependency, \n     unable to summon the initiative to get a job or to raise \n     their children property. Welfare, in short is responsible for \n     the spread of moral rot in society.\n       Never mind low wages and irregular work; never mind the \n     spreading social disorganization to which they lead; never \n     mind changes in family and sexual norms occurring among all \n     classes and in all Western countries. The solution is to \n     slash welfare. ``Tough love,'' it is said, will deter young \n     women from having babies and force those already raising \n     children to go to work.\n       But slashing welfare does not create stable jobs or raise \n     wages. It will have the opposite effect. By crowding the low-\n     wage labor market with hundreds of thousands of desperate \n     mothers, it will drive wages down.\n       The basic economic realities of high unemployment levels \n     and falling wages for less-educated workers; guarantee a \n     clamaity in the making--and not only for welfare mothers\n       It is true that the United States has a higher proportion \n     of single-parent families than other Western countries. But \n     since other rich countries provide far more generous \n     assistance to single mothers, this very fact suggests that \n     welfare has little to do with it.\n       Other facts also argue against the welfare-causes-\n     illegitimacy argument. Most obvious, welfare benefits set by \n     the states have declined sharply since 1975, while the out-\n     of-wedlock birth rate has risen nationwide. In addition, \n     there is no discernible relationship between the widely \n     varying levels of benefits provided by the states and the \n     out-of-wedlock birth rates in the states.\n       But fact don't seem to matter. We may have to relive the \n     misery and moral distintegration of England in the 19th \n     century to learn with happens when a society deserts its most \n     vulnerable members.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, yesterday, after the President announced \nhe would sign this legislation, I said: ``The President has made his \ndecision. Let us hope that it is for the best.''\n  Today, I continue to hope for the best, even if I fear the worst.\n  As I have stated on this floor many times, this legislation does not \nreform aid to families with dependent children; it simply abolishes it. \nIt terminates the basic Federal commitment of support for dependent \nchildren in hopes of altering the behavior of their mothers. We are \nputting those children at risk with absolutely no evidence that this \nradical idea has even the slightest chance of success.\n  In our haste to enact this bill--any bill--before the November \nelections, we have chosen to ignore what little we do know about the \nsubject of poverty. Just 2 days ago, on July 30, 11 of the Nation's \nleading researchers in this field issued a statement urging us not to \ndo this. Among them were seven current and former directors of the \nInstitute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin \nestablished in the aftermath of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. \nScholars of the stature of Sheldon Danziger of the University of \nMichigan; Irwin Garfinkel of Columbia University; Eugene Smolensky of \nthe University of California at Berkeley; and Edward Gramlich of the \nUniversity of Michigan. They write:\n\n       As researchers who have dedicated years to the study of \n     poverty, the labor market, and public assistance, we oppose \n     the welfare reform legislation under consideration by \n     Congress. The best available evidence is that this \n     legislation would substantially increase poverty and \n     destitution while doing too little to change the welfare \n     system to one that provides greater opportunity for families \n     in return for demanding greater responsibility.\n       Real welfare reform would not impose deep food stamp cuts \n     on poor families with children, the working poor, the \n     elderly, the disabled, and the unemployed. It would not \n     eliminate the safety net for most poor legal immigrants, \n     including the very old and the infirm. It would not place at \n     risk poor children whose parents are willing to work but are \n     unable to find unsubsidized employment. It would not back up \n     work requirements with the resources needed to make them \n     effective.\n       We strongly support an overhaul of the nation's welfare \n     system. But the pending legislation will make a troubled \n     welfare system worse. It is not meaningful welfare reform. It \n     should not become law.\n\n  I repeat what these social scientists have concluded: ``The best \navailable evidence is that this legislation would substantially \nincrease poverty and destitution.''\n  What is the evidence? Dr. Paul Offner, the distinguished Commissioner \nof Health Care Finance for the District of Columbia, summarized it \nnicely last week. Respected research organizations such as the Urban \nInstitute here in Washington, and the Manpower Demonstration Research \nCorporation in New York have, over the years, undertaken careful \nevaluations of various welfare reform demonstration projects. As Offner \nrecounts, they found that welfare caseloads were reduced in only 4 of \nthe 23 welfare demonstrations they studied.\n  Dr. Offner points out that even the program in Riverside, CA, which \nis regarded by many experts as the most successful ever, has achieved \ncaseload reductions of less than 10 percent.\n  This should not surprise us; it is not easy to change human behavior. \nNotwithstanding this fact, the premise of this legislation is that the \nbehavior of certain adults can be changed by making the lives of their \nchildren as\n\n[[Page S9329]]\n\nwretched as possible. This is a fearsome assumption. In my view. It is \ncertainly not a conservative one.\n  If we acknowledge the difficulty in bringing about the transition \nfrom welfare to work, we must recognize that putting people to work on \na large scale would require a large-scale public jobs program, and that \nwould require a great deal of money.\n  Let me say that Democrats were the first to fail in this regard. In \nthe company of Sargent Shriver and Adam Yarmolinsky, I attended the \nCabinet meeting in the spring of 1964 where we presented the plans for \na war on poverty. Our principal proposal, backed by Secretary of Labor \nWillard Wirtz, was a massive jobs program, along Works Progress \nAdministration lines, to be financed by a cigarette tax. President \nJohnson listened for a moment or two; announced that in that election \nyear we were cutting taxes, not raising them. He thereupon picked up \nthe telephone attached to the Cabinet table, called someone, somewhere, \nabout something else, and the war on poverty was lost before it began.\n  This legislation is even worse.\n  In fact, this legislation provides some $55 billion less over the \nnext 6 years. There are work requirements in the bill, but we seem \ntacitly willing to admit they will never be met. Dr. June O'Neill, \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office, has been most forthcoming \non this subject. The CBO report on this bill bluntly states that\n\n       Given the costs and administrative complexities involved, \n     CBO assumes that most states would simply accept penalties \n     rather than implement the [work] requirements.\n\n  What else does the evidence show? It shows quite clearly that the \ncentral feature of this legislation, the time limit, will affect \nmillions of children. CBO estimates that ``under current demographic \nassumptions, this provision could reduce cash assistance rolls by 30 to \n40 percent'' within the decade. I should say that again: 30 to 40 \npercent of the caseload will be cut off in less than 10 years' time.\n  Let me put that in terms of how many children will be cut off. \nAccording to the Urban Institute, 3,500,000 children will be dropped \nfrom the rolls in 2001. By 2005, 4,896,000 children will be cut off.\n\n  The Urban Institute has also estimated, in a report released just \nlast Friday, July 26, that this bill will cause 2.6 million persons to \nfall below the poverty line; 1.1 million of those impoverished will be \nchildren. To say nothing of those persons already living in poverty. \nThey will be pushed even further below the poverty line; The average \nloss in income for families already below the poverty line will be \n$1,040 per year. I note that the Urban Institute's estimates are based \non quite conservative assumptions, so the actual impact could well be \neven worse than predicted.\n  I cite this evidence because it is important that we cast our votes \nwith full knowledge of the consequences. This information has been \nwidely available, and I have made these arguments on the floor \npreviously, so I believe we are all on notice of the implications for \nchildren.\n  The implications of this legislation for our State and local \ngovernments are another matter. These are not widely known, but they \nwill be very real indeed. On Thursday of last week, 2 days after the \nSenate passed its version of this legislation, I received in the mail a \nfour-page letter from the Honorable Rudolph W. Giuliani, mayor of the \ncity of New York. He wrote of his concern that the major provisions of \nthe bill would impose huge new costs on New York City totaling some \n$900 million per year. The mayor listed the added costs to New York \nCity as follows: $380 million for child care for welfare recipients; \n$290 million for aid to legal immigrants; $100 million to support \npersons dropped from Federal rolls due to time limits; $100 million for \nwork programs.\n  Mayor Giuliani wrote that the bill's ban on Federal assistance for \nlegal immigrants was of particular concern to New York City, where 30 \npercent of the population is foreign-born.\n  The sum of $900 million a year is a lot of money. New York City's \ntotal annual budget is $33 billion. And other, smaller local \ngovernments will also be hit hard.\n  The total additional cost to New York State will be in the \nneighborhood of $1.3 billion per year. We estimate the loss of Federal \nfunds to some of our larger counties as follows: Albany County $15 \nmillion; Erie County $75 million; Monroe County $60 million; Onondaga \nCounty $30 million; Westchester County $45 million.\n  These are sums that New York State and New York City simply cannot \nafford. It will be ruinous for us. In March of this year, the New York \nState Financial Control Board reported that ``the city's finances \ncontinue to deteriorate.'' The board said that over the next 4 years, \nthe growth in New York City's spending will be more than double the \ngrowth in its income. Spending will grow by approximately 2 percent per \nyear, while revenues will grow by less than 1 percent. In the absence \nof this welfare legislation, the gap between the city's outlays and \nrevenues will increase by $400 million annually. With the new \nadditional costs imposed by this bill, the annual increase in the \nshortfall will more than triple.\n  New York will not be alone in this, of course. Senator Feinstein said \non the floor last week that the bill will cost California $17 billion \nover 6 years, or about $3 billion annually. Other States--Illinois, \nTexas, Florida--will also bear immense new burdens. I wonder if they \nare ready for what is coming.\n  More importantly, I wonder if the Nation is ready for the social \nchange this legislation will set in motion. There are great issues of \nprinciple at stake here, as leaders of the religious community have \nsaid with such clarity and force. Bishop Anthony M. Pilla, president of \nthe National Conference of Catholic Bishops, wrote to the President on \nFriday to urge that this bill be vetoed. Quoting St. Matthew's Gospel, \nBishop Pilla wrote that ``the moral measure of our society is how we \ntreat `the least among us.' ''\n\n  I know what the outcome will be today, but before we cast our votes, \nI hope Senators will ask themselves how this legislation will treat the \nleast among us.\n  I began these remarks with a comment on language. The conference \nreport before us is not welfare reform, it is welfare repeal. It is the \nfirst step in dismantling the social contract that has been in place in \nthe United States since at least the 1930's. Do not doubt that Social \nSecurity itself, which is to say insured retirement benefits, will be \nnext. The bill will be called the Individual Retirement Account \nInsurance Act. Something such. John Westergaard points out that this \nlegislation breaks the social contract of the 1930's. We would care for \nthe elderly, the unemployed, the dependent children. Drop the latter; \nwatch the others fall.\n  Fred C. Ikle has coined the fine term ``semantic infiltration'' to \ndescribe the technique in international relations whereby one party \npersuades another to use its terms to discuss the issues being \nnegotiated. We now have its domestic counterpart in egregious display. \nRecalling George Orwell's essay, ``Politics and the English Language,'' \nwe would do well to be wary. Henry Friedlander has reminded us recently \nof the stages by which genocide evolved from the soothing and \nsupportive notion of euthanasia.\n  And so to one other matter of language. We are told that this \nlegislation is a defeat for liberals. We are assured in private, and it \nis hinted at in print, that many of the President's most liberal \nadvisers opposed this legislation. Liberals are said to have lost.\n  This is nonsense. It is conservatives who have lost.\n  For the best part of 2 years now, I have pointed out that the \nprincipal--and most principled--opponents of this legislation were \nconservative social scientists who for years have argued against \nliberal nostrums for changing society with the argument that no one \nknows enough to mechanistically change society. Typically liberals \nthink otherwise; to the extent that liberals can be said to think at \nall. The current batch in the White House, now busily assuring us they \nwere against this all along, are simply lying, albeit they probably \ndon't know when they are lying. They have only the flimsiest grasp of \nsocial reality; thinking all things doable and equally undoable. As, \nfor example, the horror of this legislation. By contrast, the \nconservative social scientists--James Q. Wilson, Lawrence Mead, John \nDeIulio, William\n\n[[Page S9330]]\n\nBennett--have warned over and over that this is radical legislation, \nwith altogether unforeseeable consequences, many of which will surely \nbe loathsome.\n\n  All honor to them. They have kept to their principles. Honor on high \nas well to the Catholic bishops, who admittedly have an easier task \nwith matters of this sort. When principles are at issue, they simply \nlook them up. Too many liberals, alas, simply make them up.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senate for its courteous attention. I \nthank my friend from Minnesota for reserving this time for me, seeing \nto it I was able to speak, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, under the assumed rotation, I now yield \n10 minutes to Senator Ashcroft of Missouri, and then I assume we will \ngo back to the other side.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am not sure that I am managing the \ntime. I am ranking member of finance here. I yield, in sequence, the \nSenator from Minnesota as much time as he requires.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the Senator proceeds, might I \njust say to Republican Senators, we have a very long list of those who \nwould like to speak. It seems now that you can kind of judge that in 25 \nminutes or so we will need another Senator. I hope you can contact us \nand see if we can arrange it so there are no big lulls on the floor and \nwe can get our work done as soon as possible.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from New \nMexico for yielding me the time.\n  Our responsibility in acting on a failed welfare system is as \nprofound a responsibility in responding to the people of this country \nas we have ever had. The fundamental role and responsibility of \nGovernment is to call people to their highest and best, not trap them \nat their lowest and least.\n  In spite of the good intentions of the welfare program, which we have \npoured billions of dollars into, hundreds of billions of dollars, we \nhave ended up trapping people at their lowest and least rather than \ncalling people or prompting people to their highest and best.\n  The real objective of our legislation here ought to be to change the \ncharacter of welfare. We need to change it from a system which has \nprovided careers and conditions that lasted a lifetime to a system that \ninstead of providing a condition provides a transition, that moves \npeople from poverty into opportunity, that moves people from indolence \ninto industry, that moves people from welfare into work. No longer can \nwe afford a system that not only provides people a condition or a \ncareer, but goes beyond trapping individuals and goes to trapping \ngenerations.\n  One of the real problems of our welfare system is that we have \nchildren who are trapped in welfare and they become welfare careerists \nthemselves, and their children are then trapped in welfare. The truth \nof the matter is that the prisoners of war in the war on poverty have \nbeen the children of America. There are more children in poverty today \nthan there were when we started the war on poverty, and it is a clear \nindication that the system is a tragic failure as it relates to human \nbeings--children who have lost their lives, children who have lost \ntheir opportunity, children who have lost their spirit, children who \nfall into a net which was designed to save them, but instead becomes a \nnet to ensnare them.\n  A good industrialist friend of mine says that your system is \nperfectly designed to give you what you are getting. I do not know \nanyone in America who believes that what we are getting is the right \nthing. We are getting higher rates of illegitimacy. We are getting \nhigher rates of dependency. We are finding ourselves with individuals \nstaying on welfare longer and longer periods of time. Is that what we \nwant? Is what we are getting what we need? Absolutely not.\n  The system may not have been intended to give us what we are getting, \nbut the design of the system is what causes us to get what we are \ngetting, and it is our responsibility, it is a sacred charge of ours \ngiven to us by the American people, and they have made it fundamentally \nand unmistakably clear that they want different outcomes, they want \ndifferent results. They do not want more dependency, they do not want \nmore illegitimacy, they do not want more careers and generations on \nwelfare.\n  They want less, because they want people to be free. They want \nchildren to have an opportunity to look toward the U.S. Senate or \ntoward the Presidency or toward being a captain of industry or \ndeveloping their own business. They do not want people trapped in an \nintergenerational net of ensnarement, rather than a net of safety.\n  So it is incumbent upon us to make fundamental changes, fundamental \nchanges in the way this system treats people.\n  We can no longer allow Government to be the instrument of \nensnarement, of entrapment. We must make Government an instrument of \nliberation, of opportunity, of industry and development. That is why it \nis so important that we end this one-size-fits-all Washington approach \nwhich says that everybody will respond the same and all the systems are \nto be uniform, and move welfare programs back to the States and allow \nthem to experiment and do what works.\n  I often laugh when I think of the one-size-fits-all term. We have \nalmost come to believe it. Can you imagine if we were to send off for a \ncatalog and get a catalog that said, ``One size of pajamas fits all for \nyour family''? I know what would happen in my family. We would get five \npairs of pajamas. They would be one size but they would fit none \nbecause we are pretty different.\n  The great family of America is different. States and communities have \ndifferent characteristics and attributes, and they need to be able to \nshape, to tailor, to fashion what they do from a block grant that gives \nthem broad discretion and authority. Yes, they need for the block grant \nto be limited. They need to have the energy of limited resources to \ndrive the creativity of solving the problem.\n  No one ever solved a problem when the supply was infinite. No one \never works to conserve energy as long as it is free. You start to pay \nthe heating bill and you learn to close the door, you learn to shut the \nwindows, you learn to caulk the cracks. And when we put limits on the \namount of money we are going to spend on welfare, we will start \ncaulking the cracks and start stopping up the places where we have \nleakage. And it is not a leakage financially. We are talking about \nleakage of the great human resource of America.\n  We are looking at the Olympics. Boy, they are inspiring. But how much \nchance would we have in basketball or volleyball or baseball if we did \nnot send our full team onto the field, if we told some of them, \n``You're to sit over there on the side and not to be productive. We'll \ncall you the welfare reserves''? We would not win. And we will not win \nas a Nation if we do not get all of our players into the operation of \nbeing what this Nation is all about. That is being capable of helping \nyourselves and helping others and being so good at what you are doing \nthat the world beats a path to your door.\n  That is why we need these block grants where States will tailor their \nprograms to meet the needs in their own States and do what is necessary \nto move people out of conditions, lifelong conditions of welfare, to \nsignal that this is a transition, not a condition. You are to be moving \nout of here. And fundamental, one of the acts of genius in this bill, \nin addition to the block grant, is the fact that there is a 5-year \nlimit.\n  We say to people, it is an insurance policy, so that when you have \ntrouble you can fall into the welfare net but you cannot live there, \nyou cannot stay there. It is not a place for you to be forever because, \nonce 5 years is used up, that is a lifetime limit. We really should be \nsaying to people, do not ever be on there for more than 2 consecutive \nyears, ever. Frankly, our welfare system should never be a place where \nyou are not preparing for the next stage of your life. Welfare becomes \na transition instead of a condition, a fundamental characteristic. The \nblock grant is important about that.\n  The senior Senator from Missouri, Kit Bond, is a personal friend of \nmine.\n\n[[Page S9331]]\n\n He has a phrase, ``experience is what you get when you expected \nsomething else.'' Over the last 30 years, I think we expected something \nelse from this so-called War on Poverty and Great Society program, but \nwe got something different from what we expected. We got children \nwithout fathers and we got homes without discipline and we got streets \nwithout safety and we got generations locked--locked--out of \nopportunity, without education.\n  We expected something different. But our experience is what we got. \nAnd our experience has not been very positive. But I want you to know \nthat there have been a few bright lights over the last 30 years that \nsignal to us how we could make changes, how we could actually change \nthe behavior of people, how we could help them move from being \ndependent to being independent, the glorious state of liberty and \nfreedom, what America is all about.\n\n  Those bright lights have been in the nongovernmental sector \nprimarily. They have been the Salvation Army, the Boys and Girls Clubs, \nthe missions, and homeless shelters that have been run by the \nnongovernmental entities who are energized by a calling which is beyond \nthe calling of duty that comes from government. It is a calling of \nhumanity that God stirs in our hearts.\n  One of the primary features of this bill is that States will be \nallowed to contract with organizations like the Boys and Girls Clubs \nand the Salvation Army and charitable organizations that specialize in \nhope and opportunity and who care, who care for the people trapped on \nwelfare, not just as welfare statistics, but care for them after they \nleave the condition of welfare. These groups have a lifelong interest \nin helping people make it all the way to the top, not just over the \nthreshold.\n  I have to say that our experience tells us that not everyone in the \nwelfare system has wanted to see everyone leave the system. Sometimes \nwe have had too much interest in how many people we could have on \nwelfare instead of how many people we could move off welfare. \nSignificantly, the provisions of this bill would allow charitable and \neven faith-based operations to compete for contracts or to participate \nin voucher programs to help people. It does it with safeguards, so that \nif a person is offended by virtue of being involved with a faith-based \norganization, they would be free to get their assistance from some \nother provider.\n  These faith-based organizations have in the past--many times the \nsmaller ones who did not have large legal departments--have been afraid \nof accepting governmental funds in order to help the poor. They have \nbeen afraid of being sued. I know the Salvation Army, in one setting, \nwas sued and had to settle for a quarter of a million dollars, a matter \nwhich absolutely undermined and eroded the capacity of the Salvation \nArmy to help the poor. We know they do as good a job as any.\n  I just want to say that this bill is the kind of change that America \nhas been asking for. Is it perfect? No. At least the way I was raised, \nin order to get perfection you had to die and go to Heaven. I want to \ngo to Heaven. But I had not planned on going today. And since we ought \nto do what we can while we are here, let us take as good as we can get \nand shape it and fashion it, but not assume we have all the answers in \nWashington. Send it back to the States, give States the opportunity to \ntailor it in ways that will help people simply move from dependence to \nindependence, from careers of welfare and the condition of welfare, the \nintergenerational things of welfare, to a transition of welfare that \nmoves from welfare to work.\n  I believe that it is fundamentally important that we carry through \nand pass this measure. And I thank the President of the United States \nfor his willingness to sign this measure. I believe this measure will \nhelp save the lives of children and it will help save the lives of \nindividuals for generations to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, may I ask of my colleague if he would \nconsent that after he finishes I be recognized?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, that would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Missouri \nthat arrangement has been made, and the Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent \nthat a representative sample of editorials on this subject be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Star Tribune, July 31, 1996]\n\n              Welfare Bill--It Deserves a Forthright Veto\n\n       For most of his presidency, Bill Clinton has tried to have \n     it both ways on welfare. He's curried favor with both \n     welfare's tough-talking reformers and its defenders. He's \n     argued both for changes, such as work requirements and time \n     limits, and for preservation of welfare's protections for \n     poor children.\n       It's understandable that congressional Republicans would \n     want their final-offer, election-year welfare bill to force \n     the president to show his true stripes. They've crafted a \n     bill that ought to do just that.\n       The bill that's moving toward the House and Senate floors \n     is one Clinton might be tempted to sign for political \n     reasons. But he should veto it, for moral reasons. If he \n     doesn't, he will have put the lie to all his claims of \n     concern for the well-being of the nation's most vulnerable \n     children.\n       For all its reformist window-dressing, the bill that \n     emerged from conference committee Monday is too hard on \n     America's poor. It doesn't spend enough money to hold the \n     line against hunger, or to make workable the requirement that \n     a job take the place of welfare within two years after \n     benefits start.\n       The bill's goal of quickly replacing welfare checks with \n     paychecks is something most Americans support. But making \n     that happen in a way that gives poor families lasting self-\n     sufficiency takes more than the hammer of a time limit. It \n     takes job training, counseling, public-works jobs where \n     private employment is unavailable, child care and \n     transportation. Those tools cost money. This bill doesn't \n     provide it.\n       As a result, in the name of overcoming poverty, this bill \n     would likely push some of America's least employable adults \n     and their children into more desperate circumstances.\n       And, because of the bill's big cuts in food-stamp spending, \n     that desperation could well include hunger. Admittedly, the \n     food-stamp provisions in the final bill aren't as extreme as \n     earlier versions. A guarantee of food-stamp eligibility--\n     though not of food-stamp amounts--was preserved for families \n     with children. No so for unemployed adults without \n     dependents. They'd be cut off from the government's food \n     lifeline after six months.\n       The welfare bill is especially punitive toward legal \n     immigrants. Under this legislation, the nation's official \n     message to its legitimate newcomers would be, ``You are \n     welcome only as long as you remain gainfully employed.'' A \n     down-on-his-luck immigrant could get no cash assistance \n     whatsoever from his new country.\n       Had Clinton more boldly taken sides in the nation's welfare \n     debate earlier in his presidency, a bill this harsh might not \n     be heading toward his desk a few months before an election. \n     He should have been calling all along for more realistic and \n     compassionate reform, the kind that spends more in the short \n     term in order to redeem lives in the long term.\n       Here's hoping Clinton has learned that presidential \n     equivocation carries a high price--and that his equivocation \n     on welfare ends with a forthright veto of the bill Congress \n     is about to send him.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, July 22, 1996]\n\n                          Reform on the Cheap\n\nWho'll blink on this latest shot at changing welfare? And, in the long \n                   run, who'll wind up paying for it?\n\n       Voters liked Bill Clinton's promise to ``end welfare as we \n     know it.'' So Republicans are aching to show he didn't mean \n     it. The result is a game of political chicken that's far more \n     likely to hurt poor Americans than to uplift them.\n       The Republican Congress is about to dare the President to \n     veto a wrong-headed bill that would cut welfare spending, \n     toughen the rules, and shift a lot of decision-making to the \n     states. Since this would be his third straight veto of a so-\n     called welfare reform bill, Mr. Clinton may blink. It's \n     possible he'll sign a bill that pretends the feds can turn \n     welfare into a helpful, job-oriented network even as they \n     squeeze about $10 billion a year in savings from the system. \n     That's a pipe dream.\n       Unfortunately, if he does veto it and a better, bipartisan \n     plan doesn't emerge, Mr. Clinton will have to follow through \n     on a promise that he made last week to give himself political \n     cover on this emotional issue. Absent a bill, he vowed to \n     issue an executive order letting states cut off benefits \n     after two years.\n       The terms of this order are still in the works. But it \n     could let penny-pinching states give welfare recipients far \n     too little help toward employment and self-sufficiency.\n\n[[Page S9332]]\n\n       That's the basic problem with what Congress is cooking up. \n     It pretends that helping poor people become self-sufficient \n     doesn't cost more money in the short term. But it does cost \n     more, for child care, for training, for government-created \n     jobs for those who can't find work in the private sector. \n     Committed reformers such as Gov. Tommy Thompson, the \n     Wisconsin Republican, are up-front about this.\n       Chances are, the public will respond positively to major \n     parts of the GOP package, such as a two-year limit on \n     benefits before work is required, and a lifetime limit of \n     five years. But work requirements are meaningless if there \n     aren't enough low-skilled jobs available. If politicians are \n     serious about breaking the cycle of dependency, government \n     has to be an employer of last resort.\n       By promising to act on his own, Mr. Clinton was trying to \n     show Republicans that--politically--they need a welfare bill \n     more than he does. He was trying to coax Republicans toward \n     compromise.\n       The House did consider a bipartisan plan sponsored by Reps. \n     Mike Castle (R., Del.) and John Tanner (D., Tenn.)--a plan \n     whose spending cuts weren't so extreme. But it died when only \n     eight House Republicans were willing to buck their leaders \n     and line up with Mr. Castle.\n       Since Republicans seem uninterested in a sensible, \n     bipartisan reform, Mr. Clinton should get his veto pen ready. \n     As for the executive order he promised--every bit the \n     political gimmick that Republicans charged--it should be \n     loaded with conditions to protect poor families from \n     politicians peddling welfare reform on a dime.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 25, 1996]\n\n                           A Children's Veto\n\n       ``I just don't want to do anything that hurts kids,'' \n     President Clinton said as the Senate passed its supposed \n     reform of welfare the other day. Why did the sentence strike \n     us as yet another cynical manipulation of the welfare issue \n     for political purposes? Because if Mr. Clinton were \n     determined not to hurt children, he would have indicated days \n     ago that he intended to veto this legislation or any bill \n     remotely like it.\n       Instead, he, the Senate's Democrats and moderate \n     Republicans continued to try to prettify the bill around the \n     edges. A couple of the amendments that they succeeded in \n     making were consequential, and they may yet make more in \n     conference. But mainly these are marginal and cosmetic \n     changes. They are sops to conscience meant to justify a \n     regressive vote that for political reasons these politicians \n     are afraid not to cast. They are determined to vote in this \n     selection year in favor of a bill that bears the label \n     ``welfare reform''; it doesn't matter that the label is not \n     deserved.\n       The president and his followers are the prisoners of four \n     years of sloganeering on the subject that he himself set off. \n     It was he who, in an effort to preempt the welfare issue and \n     show himself to be a different kind of Democrat, famously \n     promised in the 1992 campaign to end the system as we know \n     it. He set off a process that he could not control, in part \n     because he has been unwilling to take the tough and unpopular \n     positions necessary to control it.\n       No one--or very few, anyway--would argue that the current \n     welfare system is a good one. Mr. Clinton was and remains \n     right to try to change it. But his original position also was \n     right--that the change should involve equal amounts of added \n     pressure on welfare mothers to go to work and additional \n     resources to help them make the move successfully. The \n     current bills fail to provide the resources; they walk \n     away from the second half of the strategy. They would \n     dismantle the federal welfare program, limit future \n     federal aid and shift to the states a financial burden \n     that many states will find hard to meet. An eighth of the \n     children in the country now are on welfare. No one can \n     know for sure how many would be affected adversely by the \n     legislation, but the best guess seems to be that at least \n     a million more children would end up living below the \n     poverty line. A fifth of the children in the country \n     already are there.\n       The bills would disestablish or greatly weaken the food \n     stamp program as well, while basically cutting off federal \n     benefits to legal immigrants--people who are legitimately \n     here and theoretically welcome but have not become U.S. \n     citizens. Technically, this is budget-balancing legislation, \n     a reconciliation bill. The noble-sounding legislation, a \n     reconciliation bill. The noble-sounding budget-balancing \n     process of a year ago has come down to a bill that would cut \n     only programs for the poor, and programs on which people who \n     are black and brown particularly depend.\n       This legislation can't be fixed. Senate Minority Leader Tom \n     Daschle, who opposed it the other day, said that even though \n     there were only 25 votes against, he was sure that a veto, if \n     it were cast, would be sustained. We have no doubt that's so. \n     It is another way of saying that if only the president would \n     take the lead and provide the political cover, instead of \n     joining in stripping it away, he could--and should--defend to \n     the voters. If instead he signs the bill, he no doubt will \n     claim it as a triumph, but in moral and policy terms it will \n     be the low point of his presidency.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Buffalo, NY News, July 23, 1996]\n\n  Don't Let Rush to Welfare `Reform' Leave Some of Needy Without Help\n\n        What if time limit is reached and there's no job to get?\n\n       In his eagerness to outflank Republicans on the welfare \n     issue and sign almost anything billed as ``reform,'' \n     President Clinton should resist the urge to abandon the long-\n     established concept that there is a national interest in \n     helping the poor become self-sufficient.\n       That is the chief danger now as Washington's warring \n     factions undertake a mad scramble to produce some sort of \n     welfare legislation before taking time off to go into full \n     campaign mode.\n       The Republican-led Congress made sensible welfare \n     legislation a little more possible last week by dropping \n     plans to attach Medicaid reform to the welfare bill and to \n     turn Medicaid into a block-grant program controlled by the \n     states.\n       Ending the guarantee of medical care for the poor never \n     made any sense because the impoverished deserve health care \n     as much as they deserve help with life's other basic \n     necessities.\n       But it also doesn't make any sense to end the federal \n     guarantee of food and other aid for those who play by the \n     rules and whose only offense is that they're impoverished.\n       Nor does imposing time limits on welfare recipients make \n     sense except in cases where they refuse to work even though a \n     job is available. The poor--and their children--should not be \n     blamed for economic cycles that may well make finding a job \n     impossible at any given time.\n       Those are bedrock principles that the nation--and the \n     president--should not forsake amid an understandable distaste \n     for the small percentage of welfare recipients who are \n     slackers.\n       Unfortunately, the House the other day cast aside those \n     principles by passing a reform plan that ends welfare as a \n     federal entitlement program that takes care of all who \n     deserve help. Instead, the House bill would slash funding and \n     turn the reduced money over to states in block grants.\n       The states could then structure programs largely as they \n     please, ending the national safety net and competing with one \n     another in a ``race to the bottom'' as they cut benefits and \n     drive out the poor.\n       That's no way for an enlightened nation to lift its most \n     vulnerable people. But the final bill that emerges from \n     House-Senate negotiations seems sure now to take that tack.\n       The other failure of the GOP approach is its time limits \n     regardless of job availability. Clinton, too, recently \n     endorsed time limits, saying the White House will \n     administratively impose a two-year limit but that his action \n     would be unnecessary if Congress could produce an acceptable \n     reform plan.\n       Details of the new White House initiative--such as how to \n     protect children whose parents get cut off--have yet to be \n     worked out. But in addition to safeguarding kids, the new \n     rule should safeguard those who simply can't find work \n     through no fault of their own.\n       These basic safeguards should be part of whatever reform \n     bill ultimately reaches the president's desk. If they are \n     not, he should use the same veto pen he's waved at other \n     times--regardless of what the calender says about the \n     election season.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Atlanta Constitution, July 28, 1996]\n\n                   Welfare Bills Suffer From Politics\n\n       The welfare system must be reformed, and the goal of that \n     reform must be twofold:\n       It must reinforce a work ethic that has faltered among some \n     welfare recipients;\n       It must protect the children of poor Americans from hunger \n     and deprivation in an increasingly fickle economy.\n       Unfortunately, the reform effort making its way through \n     Congress focuses too much on the first goal and too little on \n     the second.\n       That's not surprising. From the life experience of \n     prosperous, middle-aged, college-educated white males--which \n     describes most of the members of Congress--the rewards of the \n     work ethic seem obvious. It gives you a six-figure salary, a \n     taxpayer-provided staff and free parking, among other things.\n       But from the perspective of an unemployed mother trying to \n     raise two kids on welfare, the case can seem a little \n     cloudier.\n       Usually, the family lives in an inner city or isolated \n     rural area, where jobs are scarce and transportation \n     difficult. If the mother overcomes those obstacles and gets a \n     job, and if she works 40 hours per week, every week of the \n     year at $5.10 an hour--which is 20 percent above the minimum \n     wage--she stands to make a grand total of $10,608 a year. In \n     the process, she may also lose health insurance for her \n     family, because most low-wage jobs do not include a benefits \n     package.\n       Imagine trying to raise two children on $10,000 a year in \n     today's economy. Child care alone would take a huge chunk of \n     her pay. She has the option, of course, of choosing not to \n     pay for child care, to leave her children on their own while \n     she's working. Given our problems with juvenile crime, that's \n     not a choice to encourage.\n       If welfare reform is to work, it has to make work a viable \n     option. It must subsidize child care for that working mother. \n     It must extend health insurance coverage for the working \n     poor. And it must offer training and education, so that \n     she has at least the hope of rising out of that $5.10-an-\n     hour job into something better.\n       Some of those steps cost money, at least in the short term. \n     In the long term, such reform will benefit the mother; \n     benefit her\n\n[[Page S9333]]\n\n     children, to whom she is a role model; and benefit society, \n     which is currently losing the value of her labor and \n     incurring the expense of supporting her and her children.\n       The House and Senate have passed separate but similar \n     welfare bills, and are trying to resolve their differences \n     and send a measure to President Clinton for his signature. \n     Their effort is fatally flawed, however, because in addition \n     to the goals listed above, Congress is using the legislation \n     to pursue two less admirable goals.\n       It is trying to balance the budget on the backs of the \n     poor. Even though true welfare reform will cost more money in \n     the short term, and even though entitlement programs for the \n     middle class are far more expensive than welfare programs, \n     deficit cutters have focused on the poor, cutting $60 billion \n     from food stamps and other programs over the next six years.\n       The bill is calculated as an election-year dare to Clinton. \n     He has made clear his uneasiness with the bill's impact on \n     poor children, but has nonetheless indicated a willingness to \n     consider signing the Senate's more reasonable approach. But \n     Republicans seem intent on forcing him to veto the \n     legislation. As Bob Dole grumbled on the campaign trail, \n     ``He's not going to get that bill. He's going to get a \n     tougher bill.''\n       And as House Speaker Newt Gingrich put it, ``I believe we \n     win from this point on no matter what happens.''\n       Welfare reform is important, but apparently less important \n     than election-year politicking.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, July 21, 1996]\n\n                  Playing `Gotcha!' on Welfare Reform\n\n       The House passed a new welfare bill Thursday, and the talk \n     afterward was not of what the bill would mean for the \n     children and adults who depend on the kindness of the \n     taxpayers, but of a political calculus.\n       ``In the end,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, \n     ``the president is going to have to make a determination \n     whether or not he's going to sign this bill and satisfy the \n     American people while he alienates his left-wing political \n     base, or if he's going to veto the bill in order to satisfy \n     the left wing of the Democrat Party and thereby alienate the \n     American people.''\n       In other words, ``Gotcha!''\n       And that pretty much captures what's been wrong from the \n     beginning with the effort to legislate welfare reform. \n     Clinton has exploited the issue to establish his bona fides \n     as a ``new Democrat.'' The Republicans, suspecting \n     insincerity on Clinton's part, have used it to bash him and \n     back him into a corner.\n       Suffusing the entire debate have been two notions, one \n     simply wrongheaded and the other both wrongheaded and \n     pernicious.\n       The first is that reforming welfare is a way to save money. \n     It is not, at least initially. Done properly--that is, with \n     the purpose of getting welfare parents into the work force--\n     reform will actually cost more money, for job training, child \n     care and so forth. (And whatever else the 9 million children \n     on welfare suffer from, it is not from having too much money \n     spent on them.)\n       The second notion, which partisans on neither side have \n     done enough to counter, is that welfare reform is about \n     getting black layabouts off the public dole. In fact, most \n     welfare recipients are not black. But that continues to be \n     the accepted stereotype and, one suspects, a substantial \n     motivator of the welfare-reform push.\n       In its broad outlines, the newly passed House bill differs \n     little from the measure that Clinton vetoed earlier this \n     year. It ends welfare as a federal entitlement and converts \n     it into a program of block grants to the states, which would \n     be free, within very broad limits, to devise their own \n     programs of poor support.\n       This devolution is a good idea. Clinton has acknowledged \n     that implicitly by granting numerous waivers for state \n     welfare experiments over the last 3\\1/2\\ years. Perhaps the \n     most promising such experiment, Wisconsin's W-2 program, \n     which substitutes private and public jobs for cash assistance \n     and ought to be the paradigm for all welfare, is awaiting \n     waiver approval even now.\n       But eliminating welfare's entitlement status is a grievous \n     error of historic proportions. Indeed, Sen. Carol Mosely-\n     Braum (D-Ill.) did not exaggerate when she called it an \n     ``abomination.''\n       That the world's richest nation would not guarantee help \n     for poor children--and Aid to Families With Dependent \n     Children is nothing except a vast childcare program--is \n     outrageous. It represents not progress but regression. And \n     while Dick Armey may be convinced that that's what the \n     American people want, we are not.\n\n\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do want to talk about this piece of \nlegislation. I have heard some discussion about doing good. Let me \nstart out with what is a very important framework to me as a Senator \nfrom Minnesota. It is a question. Will this legislation, if passed, \nsigned into law by the President, create more poverty and more hunger \namong children in America? And if the answer to that question is yes, \nthen my vote is no.\n  Mr. President, we were discussing welfare reform several years ago, \nand we said that we should move from welfare to work, that that would \ninclude job training, education training, making sure the jobs were \navailable that single parents--mostly mothers--could support their \nchildren on, and a commitment to child care.\n  Just about every single scholar in the United States of America has \nsaid that this is what reform is all about. You have to invest some \nadditional resources. Then, in the long run, not only are the mothers \nand children better off, but we are all better off. That is real \nwelfare reform. Slashing close to $60 billion in low-income assistance \nis not reform, colleagues. It is punitive, it is harsh, and it is \nextreme.\n  Mr. President, we have been focusing in this Congress on the budget \ndeficit. I think, today, what we see in the U.S. Senate is a spiritual \ndeficit because, Mr. President, I know some of my colleagues do not \nwant to look at this. They push their gaze away from unpleasant facts \nand an unpleasant reality. Sometimes people do not want to know what \nthey do not want to know.\n  Mr. President, the evidence is irrefutable and irreducible: This \nlegislation, once enacted into law, will create more poverty and hunger \namong children in America. That is not reform.\n  Mr. President, we have here about $28 billion of cuts in nutrition \nassistance. I believe when the President spoke yesterday he was trying \nto say that does not have anything to do with reform, and he intends to \nfix that next Congress. But I worry about what will happen now. Mr. \nPresident, 70 percent of the citizens that will be affected by these \ncuts in food nutrition programs are children, 50 percent of the \nfamilies have incomes of under $6,300 a year. Our incomes are $130,000 \na year.\n  Mr. President, there will be a $3 billion cut over the next 6 years \nin food assistance, nutrition assistance, even for families who pay \nover 50 percent of their monthly income for housing costs. So now we \nput families in our country--poor families, poor children--in the \nsituation of ``eat or heat,'' but they do not get both. At the same \ntime, my colleagues keep wanting to cut low-income energy assistance \nprograms. This is goodness? This is goodness?\n  Mr. President, I was involved in the anti-hunger struggles in the \nSouth. I saw it in North Carolina, and I remind my colleagues, maybe \nthey want to go back and look at the exposes, look at the Field \nFoundation report, look at the CBS report, ``Hunger USA.'' Where are \nthe national media? Why are we not seeing documentaries right now about \npoverty in America?\n  Mr. President, the Food Stamp Program, which we dramatically expanded \nin the late 1960's and early 1970's, with Richard Nixon, a Republican, \nleading the way, has been the most effective and important safety-net \npractice in this country. As a result of expanding that program, we \ndramatically reduce hunger and malnutrition among children in America.\n  Now we are turning the clock back, and some of my colleagues are \ncalling this reform. Mr. President, how did it get to be reform, to cut \nby 20 percent food nutrition assistance for a poor, 80-year-old woman? \nHow dare you call it reform. That is not reform. How did it get to be \nreform to slash nutrition programs that are so important in making sure \nthat children have an adequate diet? How dare you call it reform. That \nis not reform. How did it get to be reform to essentially eliminate all \nof the assistance for legal immigrants, people who pay taxes and work? \nHow dare you call that reform. That has not a thing to do with reform.\n  The Urban Institute came out with a report several weeks ago. Isabel \nSawhill, one of the very best, said this legislation will impoverish an \nadditional 1.1 million children. We have had these analyses before. The \nOffice of Management and Budget had a similar analysis. So did the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. How dare you call a piece of \nlegislation that will lead to more poverty among children in America \nreform?\n  Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund is right: To \ncall this piece of legislation reform is like calling catsup a \nvegetable. Except this time it is more serious, because many \nmore children, many more elderly, many more children with disabilities \nwill be affected.\n\n[[Page S9334]]\n\n  Mr. President, the evidence is really irreducible and irrefutable. \nBob Greenstein, who has won the MacArthur Genius Award for his work, \ncrunched the numbers about what it means in personal terms, real terms \nfor the most vulnerable citizens in America, but my colleagues are too \nworried about polls. They are too worried about the politics of it, and \nthey turn their gaze away from all this.\n  Mr. President, I do not particularly care about words like \n``entitlement.'' But I do think as a nation we are a community, and up \nuntil the passage of this legislation, if signed into law, we as a \nnation said, as a community we will make sure there is a floor beneath \nwhich no child can fall in America. Now we have eliminated that floor. \nWe are now saying as a Senate that there will no longer be any floor \nbeneath which no child can fall. And you call that reform?\n  Mr. President, we had a proposal out here on the floor of the Senate \nthat said, if you are going to cut people off from work, if you are \ngoing to cut people off from welfare, at least require the States to \nprovide vouchers. The CBO tells us we do not have the money for the job \ntraining slots, and people will not necessarily find work, and then you \nwill cut the adult off work. So we added an amendment that said, ``For \nGod's sake, at least make sure there are vouchers for Pampers, for \nhealth care, for food for the children.'' That amendment was rejected.\n  So we have no requirement that at the very minimum, even if you are \ngoing to cut a parent off of welfare, at least make sure the law of the \nland says that every State from Mississippi to Missouri to Minnesota to \nCalifornia to Georgia, that at least there will be vouchers for \nPampers, for food, for medical assistance, and you vote ``no'' and you \nsay there will be no vouchers. And you call that reform?\n  Mr. President, in the Senate, I introduced an amendment, and it was \naccepted. It said in all too many cases, too many of these women have \nbeen victims of domestic violence, they have been battered, and welfare \nis the only alternative for too many women to a very abusive and \ndangerous situation at home. So every State will be required to have \nservices for these women and not force people off the rolls if, in \nfact, there needs to be additional support.\n  It took Monica Seles 2 years to play tennis again after she was \nattacked. Imagine what it would be like to be beaten up over and over \nagain. That amendment was knocked out in the conference--no national \nrequirement, no protection. Maybe it will be done in the States and \nmaybe it won't.\n\n  Mr. President, I had a safety valve amendment. It was defeated. \nSenator Kerry from Massachusetts had another one which was watered \ndown, but important. It was knocked out in conference committee. It \nsaid, why don't we at least look at what we have done, and if in fact \nthere is more poverty and hunger, then we will take corrective action \nin 2 years. That was knocked out in conference committee. You call that \nreform?\n  Mr. President, let me be crystal clear. You focus on work, you focus \non job training, you focus on education, you focus on making sure that \nfamilies can make a transition from welfare to work, and that is great. \nEliminating services for legal immigrants, draconian cuts in food \nnutrition programs for children and the elderly, deep cuts in \nassistance for children with disabilities--none of this has anything to \ndo with reform. This is done in the name of deficit reduction.\n  When I had an amendment on the floor that dealt with all of the \nbreaks that go to some of the oil companies, or tobacco companies, or \npharmaceutical companies, that was defeated. When we had a budget that \ncalled for $12 billion more than the Pentagon wanted and we tried to \neliminate that, that was defeated. But now when it comes to poor \nchildren in America, who clearly are invisible here in Washington, DC--\nat least in the Congress--faceless and voiceless, how generous we are \nwith their suffering. And you dare to call that reform? You dare to say \nthat, in the name of children, when you are passing a piece of \nlegislation that every single study says will increase poverty and \nhunger among children. Vote for it for political reasons, but you can't \nget away with calling it reform. It is reverse reform. It is \nreformatory, it is punitive, it is harsh, it is extreme. It targets the \nmost vulnerable citizens in America--poor children.\n  Mr. President, in this insurance reform bill we are going to be \ndealing with, late last night someone inserted a 2-year monopoly patent \nextension for an anti-arthritis drug, a special interest gift to one \ndrug company, because then you don't have the generic drugs. Late last \nnight, someone put this into the insurance reform bill. There you go. \nThere is some welfare for a pharmaceutical company. But they are the \nheavy hitters. They have the lobbyists. They are well-connected. We do \njust fine by them. But for these poor children, who very few Members of \nthe Senate even know, we are all too generous with their suffering.\n  Mr. President, I had an amendment that was passed by a 99-to-0 vote \nthat said the Senate shall not take any action that shall create more \nhunger or homelessness among children. Now we are slashing $28 billion \nin food nutrition programs with the harshest effect being on children \nin America. Can my colleagues reconcile that for me? I would love to \ndebate someone on this. I doubt whether there will be debate on it, \nbecause the evidence is clear.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton said yesterday that he will sign the \nbill, and he said that he will work hard, I presume next Congress, to \ncorrect what he thinks is wrong. He pointed out that these draconian \ncuts in food nutrition programs and in assistance to legal immigrants \nare wrong, they have nothing to do with reform. He is absolutely right.\n  Personally, it is difficult for me to say, well, with the exception \nof these draconian cuts in food assistance programs for children and \nthe elderly, with the exception of these draconian cuts for children \nwith disabilities, and draconian cuts for legal immigrants, this is a \npretty good bill otherwise. I can't make that argument. But I will work \nwith the President because, clearly, this is going to pass, and, quite \nclearly, corrective action is going to have to be taken next Congress.\n  But, for myself, Mr. President, I am a Senator from the great State \nof Minnesota. As Senator Hubert Humphrey said, the test case for a \nsociety or government is how we treat people in the twilight of their \nlives--the elderly; how we treat people at the dawn of their lives--the \nchildren; and how we treat people in the shadow of their lives--the \npoor, and those that are struggling with disabilities. We have failed \nthat test miserably with this piece of legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, I come from a State that I think leads the Nation in \nits commitment to children and its commitment to fairness and its \ncommitment to opportunity. As a Senator from Minnesota that is up for \nreelection this year, there can be one zillion attack ads--and there \nalready have been many, and there will be many more--and I will not \nvote for legislation that impoverishes more children in America. That \nis not the right thing to do. That is not a Minnesota vote.\n  Mr. President, in my next term as a U.S. Senator from Minnesota, I am \ngoing to embark on a poverty tour in our country. I am going to bring \ntelevision with me, and I am going to bring media with me, and I am \ngoing to visit these children. I am going to visit some of these poor, \nelderly people. I am going to visit these families. I am going to visit \nthese legal immigrants. I am going to have my Nation focus its \nattention, and I am going to have my colleagues, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, focus their attention on these vulnerable \ncitizens. And, if in fact we see the harshness, the additional poverty, \nand the additional malnutrition, which is exactly what is going to \nhappen, I am going to bring all those pictures and all of those voices \nand all of those faces and all of those children and all of those \nelderly people back to the floor of the U.S. Senate, and we will \ncorrect the terrible mistake we are making in this legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9322-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9334-S9337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n      RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997 CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The conference report will be stated.\n\n[[Page S9335]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3603) a bill making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural \n     Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     1997, and for other purposes, having met, after full and free \n     conference, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to \n     their respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of \n     the conferees.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of July 30, 1996.)\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I present for the Senate's approval today \nthe conference report on H.R. 3603, the fiscal year 1997 Agriculture, \nRural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act.\n  The conference agreement provides total appropriations of $53.3 \nbillion. This is $10 billion less than the fiscal year 1996 enacted \nlevel and $5 billion less than the level requested by the President. It \nis $1 billion less than the total appropriations recommended by the \nSenate-passed bill and $228 million more than the level recommended by \nthe House bill.\n  Including congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior-\nyear spending actions, this conference agreement provides total \ndiscretionary spending for fiscal year 1997 of $12.96 billion in budget \nauthority and $13.34 billion in outlays. These amounts are within the \nsubcommittee's discretionary spending allocations.\n  The committee of conference on this bill considered 147 amendments in \ndisagreement between the two Houses. I believe it is a credit to the \nall members of this subcommittee who served as conferees on the part of \nthe Senate and to the House Members who served on the conference \ncommittee that we were able to resolve our differences and reach a \nconference agreement 6 days after the Senate passed the bill. I would \nlike to thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, the Senator from \nArkansas, Mr. Bumpers; the chairman of the House subcommittee who \nchaired the conference, the Congressman from New Mexico, Mr. Skeen; the \nranking member of the House subcommittee, the Congressman from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin; as well as all House and Senate members of the \nconference committee for their support and cooperation in this regard.\n  It is with a great deal of pride that I can say this Appropriations \nSubcommittee has done its work, completing action on this \nappropriations bill to assure that funding for those agencies it covers \nis in place before the start of the new fiscal year. Senate adoption of \nthis conference report today is the final step necessary to allow this \nmeasure to be sent to the President for signature into law. We have \nevery indication that the bill will be signed by the President.\n\n  Approximately $40.4 billion, close to 76 percent of the total new \nbudget authority provided, is provided for domestic food programs \nadministered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These include food \nstamps; commodity assistance; the special supplemental nutrition \nprogram for women, infants, and children; and the school lunch and \nbreakfast programs. This is $58 million below the House bill level and \n$906 million below the Senate level. The difference from the Senate \nrecommended level is principally due to the fact that the Senate \nreceded to the House on the amount for the Food Stamp Program \ncontingency reserve which was $900 million below the Senate bill level.\n  For agriculture programs, the conference report recommends a total of \n$7.5 billion, $104 million more than the House-recommended level and \n$19 million more than the Senate bill level. This amount includes $1.1 \nbillion for agricultural research and education, $426 million for \nextension activities, $438 million for the Animal Plant Health and \nInspection Service, $574 million--the full budget request level--for \nthe Food Safety and Inspection Service, $746 million for the Farm \nService Agency, and $64 million for the Office of Risk Assessment.\n  For conservation programs, the conference report recommends $770 \nmillion, $2 million more than the House bill level and $20 million less \nthan the level recommended by the Senate.\n  For rural economic and community development programs, the bill \nrecommends $2 billion, $136 million more than the House level and $108 \nmillion less than the Senate bill level. Included in this amount is \n$556.9 million for the Rural Utilities Assistance Program, which \ncombines funding for rural water and waste disposal loans and grants \nand solid waste management grants. This represents an increase of $79 \nmillion over the 1996 level. The bill also provides a total loan level \nof $3.5 billion for rural housing loan programs, the same as the level \napproved by the House and Senate, and $519 million over the 1996 level.\n\n  For foreign assistance and related programs of the Department of \nAgriculture, the bill recommends $131 million for the Foreign \nAgricultural Service, including $27.5 million for the Cooperator \nProgram; a total program level of $1.1 billion for the Public Law 480 \nFood for Peace Program, including a program level of $240.8 million for \ntitle I, $837 million for title II, and $29.5 million for title III.\n  Mr. President, this bill provides funding for many essential \nprograms, programs which enhance and support the productivity of our \nagricultural sector, which provide essential services to the small and \nrural communities of this Nation, which conserve and protect our \nnatural resources, and which provide needed food assistance, not only \nto those abroad but to assure no American goes hungry. Many of these \nprograms are worthy of additional funding. However, we are also working \nto reduce the overall costs of Government and to assure efficiencies in \nthe operation of Government programs. This bill is consistent with our \noverall budgetary and policy goals.\n  Mr. President, the conference report we present to the Senate today \nreflects a mutually satisfactory resolution of the differences between \nthe two Houses. It does so in a manner which reflects the funding \nrequirements of the many programs and activities covered by the bill \nwithin the limited resources available.\n  I recommend its adoption by my colleagues.\n\n\n         regarding The Center for Applied Aquaculture in Hawaii\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, over the years, the Congress has been \nsupportive of utilizing Hawaii's unique environment to develop \nimportant science-based aquaculture technology and to demonstrate and \nprovide that technology to the U.S. aquaculture industry. With initial \nconstruction funding for Hawaii's Center for Applied Aquaculture in \n1988 and subsequent installments in 1994 and 1995, enough money has \nbeen appropriated in the Cooperative State Research, Education and \nExtension Service's buildings and facilities account to complete \nconstruction of a full-fledged aquaculture research and \nprecommercialization facility in the Hawaiian Islands.\n  The dynamic proposal for the Center for Applied Aquaculture has grown \nto demonstrate the importance of a core research facility together with \nsatellite facilities, including grow-out ponds to demonstrate new \ntechnology on a larger than laboratory precommercialization scale, \nprotected quarantine facilities to ensure the all-important maintenance \nof disease free fish stock, and a hatchery to supply fry to the \nresearch and demonstration components.\n  Hawaii's island geography and the physical limitations of the core \nresearch facility dictate the establishment of the essential satellite \ndemonstration, quarantine and hatchery facilities on neighboring \nislands. There would be no question about building these integral \ncomponents if the core research site could accommodate them properly. \nHowever, with no further appropriation and with the support of the \nAgriculture Department for the satellite components, all of this can \nstill be accomplished in Hawaii. I would hope that my colleagues, \nChairman Cochran and Senator Bumpers, could support this vision of \nHawaii's Center for Applied Aquaculture, which will not only provide \nfor a total package of groundbreaking aquaculture technology that can \nbe demonstrated at a level to make it viable for private commercial \ninvestment, but will also give the Federal Government the highest and \nbest use of its investment over the last 8 years.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I agree with my colleague from Hawaii and recommend that \nthe Department favorably consider the Center for Applied Aquaculture's \nplans to establish a complete\n\n[[Page S9336]]\n\naquaculture research and precommercialization facility in Hawaii.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I would like to associate myself with Senator Cochran's \ncomments on this matter and urge the Department to respond positively \nto the Center for Applied Aquaculture's proposal for a core aquaculture \ntechnology development facility together with integral satellite \nfacilities to demonstrate those technologies for the benefit of U.S. \naquaculture industry.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I very much appreciate my colleagues' interest and \nsupport for enhancing the U.S. aquaculture industry by developing, \ntesting, and transferring science-based technology to the commercial \naquaculture sector.\n\n\n         Horticultural and Water Management Research Laboratory\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to ask the ranking member of \nthe Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies about a \nfacility important to U.S. agricultural research and the State of \nCalifornia. The President's budget request included $22 million for \nconstruction of a Horticultural and Water Management Research \nLaboratory at Palier, CA. This facility will be operated by the \nAgricultural Research Service [ARS], the research arm of the Department \nof Agriculture.\n  This facility will contribute greatly to solutions for many of the \nproblems facing our farmers and others reliant on proper management of \nour natural resources. The facility will conduct critically important \nresearch on water management, postharvest quality, insect control and \nquarantine operations. All these functions are becoming increasingly \nimportant as we all try to balance the needs of water users, \nenvironmental protection, and the maintenance of a safe and abundant \nfood supply. Currently, this research is housed in inadequate and \ninappropriate space, with many researchers using parked trailers as \noffice and laboratory facilities. I agree with the President that this \nfacility must be completed as soon as possible in order to upgrade our \nNation's research capabilities and continue to make our farmers \ncompetitive in growing world markets.\n  I would like to know if the Senator can share with me the views of \nthe conferees of the pending appropriations bill regarding this \nimportant project.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I would like to respond to the Senator from California \nby stating that I and the other conferees are very aware of this budget \nitem and agree that construction should commence at the earliest \npossible date.\n  I am happy to report that the Senate bill included $11 million for \nthis facility. I wish we could have provided the full amount requested \nby the Senator from California, but our allocation, being severely \nreduced from the previous year, prevented us from meeting her full \nrequest. Unfortunately, the House provided no funding for this project.\n  As the Senator knows, once construction begins, any delays in project \ncompletion eventually result in greater cost. There were a number of \nARS facility projects nearing completion that could be completed in \nfiscal year 1997. Accordingly, the conferees decided to complete those \nprojects before allocating funds for new facilities in order to better \nmanage our limited resources.\n  There was discussion about the merits of the Palier laboratory during \nHouse and Senate conference negotiations. It is intended that by \ncompleting ongoing projects, which will be no longer the subject of \nfuture appropriations, we will be able to provide higher levels of \nfunding for other priority needs. If we can provide full funding for \nthe Palier facility next year, it will serve the double benefits of \nassisting the U.S. agricultural industry and helping us use our fiscal \nresources more efficiently.\n  Although it is impossible now to know what our allocation will be for \nfiscal year 1998, it is clear that if provided adequate resources, it \nwould be to everyone's advantage to provide full funding for the Palier \nlaboratory in the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for his explanation and I look \nforward to working with him again next year on this important project.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is considering the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 3603, the agriculture, rural development and \nrelated agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997.\n  The conference agreement provides $52.3 billion in new budget \nauthority [BA] and $44.9 billion in new outlays to fund most of the \nprograms of the Department of Agriculture and other related agencies. \nAll of the funding in this bill is for nondefense purposes.\n  When outlays from prior-year appropriations and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, the final bill totals $55.3 billion in BA and $54.2 \nbillion in outlays for fiscal year 1997. Including mandatory savings, \nthe subcommittee is $158 million in BA and $71 million in outlays below \nits 602(b) allocation.\n  The final conference agreement includes legislative changes in \nmandatory programs totaling $505 million and $484 million in outlays. \nThe savings from these provisions are then used to pay for \ndiscretionary spending in the bill.\n  The majority of these mandatory savings come from provisions limiting \nthe standard deduction under the Food Stamp Program. CBO scores these \nsavings at $345 million in both BA and outlays for fiscal year 1997.\n  The Senate will soon take up the conference report on the Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996--the \nlong-awaited welfare reform bill--that has gained bipartisan support \nand a commitment from the President to sign this bill into law.\n  This historic measure includes identical savings from freezing the \nfood stamp standard deduction. By counting these savings in both bills, \nwhich are expected to be signed by the President, we give up additional \ndeficit reduction by the amount of the duplicate mandatory savings.\n  These mandatory savings assist the subcommittee in completing the \nappropriations bill well within its current 602(b) allocation. For \ndiscretionary spending, the final bill is $991 million in BA and $774 \nmillion in outlays below the President's budget request. The final bill \nis $159 million in BA above the House-passed bill, and $9 million in \noutlays below the House-passed bill. The conference agreement is $884 \nmillion in BA and $694 million in outlays below the 1996 level.\n  I am pleased that the conferees retained the language I requested \nrequiring competitive bidding for WIC infant formula. This provision \nwill ensure that in these times of tight budgets we maximize the \nbenefits we get from the dollars we spend on this important program.\n  It is estimated that up to one quarter of the WIC caseload--1.5 \nmillion children and pregnant women--is served as a result of the $1 \nbillion in savings generated from competitive bidding for infant \nformula.\n  I thank the distinguished subcommittee chairman for including this \nprovision in the bill and retaining the language in conference.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nSenate Budget Committee scoring of the final bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n      AGRICULTURE SUBCOMMITTEE: SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE REPORT      \n                 [Fiscal year 1997, dollars in millions]                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      Budget            \n                                                    authority   Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed......................................  .........     $3,853\n  H.R. 3603, conference report....................    $12,960      9,487\n  Scorekeeping adjustment.........................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n    Subtotal nondefense discretionary.............     12,960     13,340\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed......................................        497      3,533\n  H.R. 3603, conference report....................     39,385     35,435\n  Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                         \n   Budget.........................................  .........  .........\n    Resolution assumptions........................      2,418      1,845\n                                                   ---------------------\n    Subtotal mandatory............................     42,300     40,813\n                                                   =====================\n    Adjusted bill total...........................     55,260     54,153\n                                                   =====================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n  Defense discretionary...........................  .........  .........\n  Nondefense discretionary........................     13,118     13,411\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund..............  .........  .........\n  Mandatory.......................................     42,300     40,813\n    Total allocation..............................     55,418     54,224\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n  Defense discretionary...........................  .........  .........\n  Nondefense discretionary........................       -158        -71\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund..............  .........  .........\n  Mandatory.......................................  .........  .........\n    Total allocation..............................       -158        -71\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Prepared by SBC    \n  Majority Staff, July 31, 1996, 06:50 p.m.                             \n\n                                Medguide\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I want to engage the Senator from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, the chairman of the\n\n[[Page S9337]]\n\nSenate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, about his \nunderstanding of the provision included in the conference report of the \nfiscal year 1997 Agriculture appropriations bill relating to the FDA's \nproposed medguide regulation.\n  Am I correct in saying that the conferees retained the language in \nthe conference report that was adopted by the full Senate last week?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes, Senator. This conference report retains the \nlanguage, as adopted by the Senate, that prevents further finalization \nor implementation of the medguide regulation.\n  Mr. COATS. At this point, I would like to make sure I understand that \nthis provision does not preclude the FDA from using its existing \nauthority to require, on a drug-by-drug basis, the provision of written \ninformation prepared by the manufacturer to consumers about \nprescription drugs that pose a serious risk.\n  We have been informed by the FDA that it will only be required to use \nits existing authority to require patient information for a very \nlimited number of products.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is the committee's understanding, as well. The \ncommittee believes that the FDA's current authority to require written \npatient information is essential for certain prescription drugs, on a \ndrug-by-drug basis, in cases where they pose a serious risk to the \npatient if used inappropriately.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Chairman for clarifying this and appreciate \nhis leadership and assistance in helping us craft a compromise that is \nacceptable to the committee and to the FDA.\n\n\n                           Medication Guides\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The provision we are enacting on medication guides \nplaces certain limitations on the FDA regarding its pending medication \nguide regulation as it pertains to voluntary information provided by \npharmacists. However, as you know, there was another part of the \npending FDA regulation that was not intended to be affected by this \nprovision. That was the FDA's intention to require FDA-approved patient \nleaflets for drugs that pose a serious and significant public health \nrisk. Those would be drugs that cannot be used appropriately without \nspecific written information provided to the patient. Although the \ninstances in which such leaflets would be required would be very \nsmall--no more than three or four per year--it is critical that FDA \nhave the flexibility to use regulations to ensure that these drugs can \nbe safely used, as was specifically provided for in the House language \nof H.R. 3603 as well as in the Senate report accompanying H.R. 3603 \nwhich stated ``this provision is not to be construed as prohibiting the \nFDA from using its existing authority or regulatory authority to \nrequire as part of the manufacturers' approved product labeling the \ndispensing of written information inserts to consumers on a case-by-\ncase basis with select prescription drugs to meet certain patient \nsafety requirements.''\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Your understanding is correct. As we noted in the Senate \nreport accompanying H.R. 3603 at the time, the provision covering the \nvoluntary medication leaflet program was not to be construed as \napplying in any way to the FDA's use of its existing authority to \nrequire patient leaflets for drugs that can cause severe birth defects, \nhave serious adverse reactions when used with other drugs, and similar \ninstances that pose a serious and significant public health risk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order of yesterday, the 31st of \nJuly, 1996, the Senate having received the conference report on H.R. \n3603, the agriculture appropriations bill, the conference report is \nagreed to, and the motion to reconsider is laid on the table.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9334-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9337-S9341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORK OPPORTUNITY RECONCILIATION ACT OF \n                        1996--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, at the request of the minority, they \ndesire one block of time, instead of rotation, between 12 and 1. I \nchecked with our side. We are willing to do that provided that, for \ninstance, they go from 12 to 1 and then from 1:15 to 2:15 we have a \nblock of time. We assume that while this is the welfare bill that the \nminority intends to speak on a related subject--the economy and the \ncurrent economic news. And we would like from 1:15 to 2:15 to speak to \nthat same subject. I will control that 1 hour and be here myself with \nother Senators.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we proceed now to Senator Bond, 10 \nminutes; Senator Kohl, 3 minutes; if Senator Hutchison arrives, she \ntakes 7; if not, we rotate and have a Democrat; then at the hour of 12 \no'clock the Democrats have 1 hour under the control of whomever they \ndesignate for discussion on the floor of the Senate; and, then at 1:15 \nthe Republicans have 1 hour until 2:15. That means there are 15 minutes \nin between. Let us just say we will fill that in with Senators who \ndesire to speak. I propose that as a consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I begin by expressing my sincere thanks and appreciation to the \nmanagers of the bill, particularly to my good friend, the Budget \nCommittee chairman, the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici. The \nfact that we have this measure before us today reflects not only all \nthe practice we have had in passing welfare bills but reflects the \ngreat skill, the compassion, and the wisdom that he has exercised \nthroughout this process. I think all of us are deeply indebted to the \ntremendous skill he has shown in keeping us on track to bring us to \nthis day.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask whatever time I use be added to his time.\n  Does the Senator recall the hours spent in the Budget Committee \nputting together the first balanced budget resolution in 30 years, and \nthen the floor debate which lasted for the entire time allowed, and \nthen all of the amendments at the end? We did them all with 1 minute \nintervening, and then a reconciliation bill. We did all that was \nrequired to get a balanced budget.\n  Mr. BOND. I recall it as it if were yesterday.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I also managed them both, and I spent more hours on the \nfloor of the Senate and more votes occurred than any period in modern \nhistory of the Senate. I might say from time to time--you would agree, \nwould you not--that we had thought perhaps that work was all in vain, \nat least for this year, but, as a matter of fact, in only a year, we \nhave welfare reform doing away with the 60 years when people have been \nimprisoned by this system. It was all worthwhile.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I say that I well remember that. It only \nheightened my admiration for the Senator from New Mexico. It was a \nwonderful experience which I hope not to have to go through again but \nit was only because of his skill, good humor, wisdom, and kind judgment \nthat we were able to accomplish that work. And it is truly a credit to \nhis ability and his leadership.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate will take another historic step in \ntrying to curb the size of Government and provide for new approaches to \nhelp families in poverty. I am enthusiastic about this welfare reform \nlegislation which we will pass today because it will basically take \ncontrol from the impersonal inefficient Washington welfare \nbureaucracies and the dead hand of Congress and return that to State \nand local governments who are closer to the people, giving them the \nfreedom to implement new ways to fight poverty.\n  There can be no doubt that the current system is a failure. That \nshould be the one thing that is agreed upon by Republicans, Democrats, \nliberals, conservatives, and anyone else who is concerned about their \nfellow man today. It is cruel to adults who are treated like numbers \nwhen they need public assistance. It is even crueler to the children \nbecause it encourages a lifetime of dependency and they are raised in \nan atmosphere without hope. The current system discourages work but it \nencourages illegitimacy. The current welfare\n\n[[Page S9338]]\n\nsystem does not punish poor behavior--even behavior which threatens \nchildren, like not sending them to school, or not seeing that they \nreceive their immunizations. The current welfare system does not even \npunish drug abuse among parents who may be welfare recipients.\n  I am pleased that this conference report contains a provision which I \nauthored that deals with an outrageous problem that came to my \nattention as a result of some efforts by the good folks in my home \nState of Sedalia, MO. In Sedalia, a private employer was trying to hire \nworkers at a $6.50 per hour wage to process food. The employer worked \nwith the local Family Services Division office and had some welfare \nrecipients come out and get jobs. That was a win-win for those folks \nwho got jobs, and for all of us in Missouri as taxpayers. Some of the \nrecipients were interviewed and then hired. They now have good paying \njobs. They are paying taxes. They are not living off the Government. \nThey are contributing members of society. They can take pride in what \nthey are doing for themselves and their families.\n  However, a few folks did not get a job because they failed a \nmandatory drug test. They were not hired, unbelievably and terribly \nunfortunately, because of Federal rules and regulations. The State of \nMissouri cannot sanction those welfare recipients even though they were \nknown to abuse drugs. They simply met their obligation by showing up \nfor the work interview with drugs in their systems, and as a result of \nthe Federal requirements they were sent back to get their food stamps \nwithout having to take a job.\n  Mr. President, what kind of perverse incentive is that? That is the \nincentive we have seen too many times in the welfare system today. The \npeople of Missouri are fed up with it. They know it is not working. It \nis costing money, and not helping the people that it should help. This \nis an absurd result. It harms the recipients because no one forces them \nto be responsible for their actions. It certainly harms the children of \nthe drug users because their parents have no incentive. They need not \nget off drugs to continue to get their assistance. Of course, I would \nsay on a much broader scale it is unfair to all of us as taxpayers who \nhave to finance those habits and provide support for those who are \nusing drugs.\n\n  I think this is just one example that shows clearly that the \nWashington bureaucracy, the congressionally mandated and controlled \nscheme, cannot serve the needs of the millions of poor people in this \ncountry. The fact is in States like Massachusetts, Indiana, Wisconsin, \nand Utah where Governors have been able to take a tougher approach, \nwelfare rolls have dropped, recipients have found jobs, and deadbeat \ndads have been forced to take responsibility for their children. Those \nare the results that we hope to duplicate throughout the country in \nthis reform of welfare.\n  I am pleased that President Clinton has decided to join us, and I \nthink the overwhelming number of Americans who really want to end \nwelfare as we know it. Countless Americans and I have been terribly \ndisappointed. I felt cheated--not just once but on two previous \noccasions--when we worked very hard in this body and with overwhelming \nbipartisan support passed meaningful welfare reform. Those measures \nwere vetoed, protecting the welfare system and its bureaucrats as it \nexists. Apparently the President has decided to give the American \npeople what they want--real welfare reform.\n  For some reason, an old story just came into my mind about a \npolitician back home who had held a position for some time. When the \nclamor of the people got too great, he changed his position. A friend \nof mine went up to him and said, ``Congratulations. I see you finally \nhave seen the light.'' He shook his head sadly, and said, ``No. I just \nfelt the heat.'' But for whatever reason, the change was welcome in \nthat situation.\n  It has been said on this floor to those of us who support this \nwelfare reform, ``How can you dare call it welfare reform?'' How can we \ndare call it reform? And they contend it would lead to more poverty. It \nwas said that the evidence is irrefutable.\n\n  Yes, Mr. President, the evidence is irrefutable. What the current \nsystem has done is to force more and more families and more and more \nchildren into welfare dependency. It has deprived the children and the \nfamilies of the responsibility that each and every American citizen has \nthe right to enjoy and the obligation to use. Those who oppose change \nin the current system must explain and defend the system that has \nforced so many more families and their children into poverty.\n  With this great federally controlled, congressionally mandated, \nWashington-bureaucracy-run poverty system, we have seen the number of \nfamilies and children in poverty skyrocket. Those who take a poverty \ntour and want to go out and look at the faces of the welfare \nrecipients, I tell them I have seen those faces, and I have felt the \nshame that the current system we have is not getting them off welfare.\n  When you go out and look at the people who are trapped in the system \ntoday, remember, it is the current system that has trapped them. Their \nplight is the direct responsibility of the system that we are here \ntoday to change, to give them an opportunity, to give them an \nincentive, to give them some encouragement to get off welfare, to help \nthem reestablish themselves as responsible, contributing members of the \ncommunity, able and willing to take care of their children.\n  To say, as has been said on this floor, that we are abandoning \nchildren because we are turning back to the States the opportunity to \ndevise, revise, improve and implement a welfare system is to ignore \nreality.\n  I had the opportunity to serve on the other side of this \nintergovernmental program for 8 years as Governor of Missouri. As we \ntried to implement the Federal programs handed down from Washington, we \nfound time and time again that what may have been well-intentioned and \nwhat sounded like a good idea when it was expounded upon in this body \nand in the other body, when great ideas from Washington came down as to \nhow we were going to improve the system, what they did was hamstring \nour ability to shape a system that would serve our people and help them \nget off welfare.\n  Too often we have been tied up in red tape and bureaucracy. This now \nis an opportunity to let the States that do care and that are concerned \nabout those in poverty develop means of getting them off welfare and \ninto work.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I thank those who \nhave worked so hard for its passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today, the Senate will take what is perhaps its most \nsignificant action in my years in this body. Today, we will send to the \nPresident a bill that abolishes the failed Federal welfare program. We \nwill send to the President a bill that gives hope to more than 12 \nmillion mothers and children who have too long been left alone in a \nculture of despair and poverty.\n  I want to make clear a point that may have been lost in the partisan \npolitics that has surrounded this legislation. This bill is not about \npunishing welfare recipients. This bill is not about turning our backs \non families that have been broken and impoverished for too long. This \nbill is about hope. It is about giving hope to mothers who want to \nprovide a better life for their children. It is about giving hope to \nchildren who do not deserve to be imprisoned in a life of crime, hunger \nand despair. It is about giving hope to communities that want to see \ntheir tax dollars go to build their neighborhoods up and not to tear \nlocal families down.\n  As a result of bipartisan input, there are many positive changes in \nthis bill that improve upon previous welfare bills. Child care funding \nis increased by $4 billion, while health and safety standards for child \ncare facilities are preserved. The School Lunch Program is maintained. \nThe Food Stamp Program remains a guarantee. Programs to prevent child \nabuse and neglect are continued, and, perhaps most importantly, basic \nMedicaid health coverage is retained.\n\n  There are also provisions in this legislation that I cannot support \nand I will work to change. We will not turn our backs on the people in \ncommunities this legislation is meant to help. As the States submit \ntheir plans and as the provisions in this bill take effect, we will \ncontinue to monitor them. We\n\n[[Page S9339]]\n\nwill make sure that our new welfare system pulls people and communities \nup, gives them hope, gives them opportunity and makes them strong.\n  Yes, today is the beginning of the end of welfare as we know it, and \nit is good news for the families who have been trapped too long by \nhopelessness. Today begins a new commitment to bringing the poorest \nmembers of communities a new beginning, a chance to build their \nfamilies, an opportunity for their children's future. This legislation \nis not about hate. This legislation is about hope. And so I urge my \ncolleagues to support the conference report.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I understand there is unanimous consent for Senator \nHutchison, who is not here, to speak. I ask unanimous consent to be \nallowed to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, many good and honorable Senators will vote \nfor this bill today, and their votes and the signature of the \nPresident, in my judgment, in no way takes away from their good \nintentions to make this welfare system better. I do not intend to say \nor suggest that they are mean-spirited or they are heading in the wrong \ndirection, or anything of the sort.\n  I come to the floor intending to vote against this bill and would \nlike to explain why. I think this piece of legislation in the context \nof our budget and the context of our economy will not make things \nbetter. Those who believe this new law will make life better for poor \nAmericans who depend upon Government payments for family support, for \nfood stamps, for supplemental security income, the earned-income tax \ncredit, child nutrition, foster care, and the social service block \ngrant, have offered at least three, as I have heard them, three \nprincipal arguments with which I strongly agree.\n  First, I agree that our current welfare system has failed because it \npenalizes work and rewards behavior which is contrary to the core \nAmerican values of family, personal responsibility and self-discipline.\n  I agree that States need far more flexibility and authority in \ndesigning systems which are appropriate for their varying needs and \ncircumstances.\n  And I agree that deficit reduction will help low-income Americans by \npromoting growth and job creation.\n  My decision to vote no on this piece of legislation is based upon \ndisagreements, strong disagreements with some of the ideas I have heard \npromoted in favor of this legislation.\n  First, I do not agree that income support all by itself promotes \nself-destructive dependency, lazy behavior, out-of-wedlock births, and \nmany other things that I have heard offered on this floor.\n  I have been dependent on a generous Government check from the \ntaxpayers of this country for 27 years since I was injured in the war \nin Vietnam. That check has not made me lazy. I have not had one child \nout of wedlock. I am not dependent upon the Government. I am grateful \nto my country and willing to give it back in kind.\n  My motivation predated the decision by a generous nation to say that \nif you are disabled in the war, we are going to provide you with \nmonthly income support, and we are not going to torment you and \nconstantly challenge you and require you to come in and justify your \nexistence to a Government bureaucrat every single time we think that \nmaybe we do not like what you are doing.\n\n  I do not agree that increased welfare spending has caused many of the \nsocietal problems we face, nor do I agree with the corollary argument \nthat is oftentimes made that we spend a disproportionate amount of our \nGDP on the poor.\n  First, as to welfare causing problems, Mr. President, I would like to \nread just a few of the economic changes that have occurred in the last \n30 years and ask my colleagues to consider what their impact could have \nbeen.\n  Thirty years ago, most communities had laws that said that you could \nnot open your business on Sunday. But as a consequence of a desire to \ndo more business on Sunday, that seventh day that was reserved for the \nSabbath, we now have in every community not only stores open on Sunday \nbut open 24 hours a day. Guess who is working in those stores? Not \nthose of us who make over $100,000 a year. We are shopping. We are \nplaying golf. But it is those lower income families who are out there \nworking.\n  You could make a much better case, Mr. President, that that change in \nthe law has been destructive of families, has been hurtful of \ncommunities. I do not make this argument, by the way, but there is no \nquestion there have been significant changes in this country as a \nresult of changing our Sunday closing laws.\n  And consider these economic facts. In 1945, 75 percent of the world's \nGNP was in the United States; in 1970, it was 50 percent; in 1992, it \nwas 25 percent; in 1995, it was down to a fifth. In 1969, 9 of the 10 \nlargest banks in the world were in the United States. Today, the top \nU.S. bank is No. 30. In the auto market, the U.S. share was 90 percent, \ntoday it is 55 percent. For manufacturing wages versus the rest of the \nworld, we were No. 1 in 1969. In 1994 we are No. 5, after Japan, \nGermany, France, and Italy.\n\n  We have shifted from a manufacturing to a service economy over the \nlast 30 years, and a worker out there, who is not protected as a \nconsequence of being a Member of Congress, a worker out there has to \ncompete against all of those people in the world. He has to compete \nagainst people in India who are willing to work for 40 cents an hour, \nagainst people in China who are willing to work for 36 cents an hour, \nagainst many nations who are willing to pay their people who work 50 \ncents to a dollar an hour. This has put a tremendous pressure upon \npeople who have lower wages. Mr. President, nearly 30 million people in \nthe work force earn less than $7 an hour.\n  Rather than merely focusing our attention on how to get people off of \nwelfare, it is far more important for us to ask ourselves the question: \nIn an age when we have an international economy, where we have that \nkind of pressure upon wages, where we have that kind of pressure on \nskills--and by the way, I would likely vote for this proposal if it had \nmore money in there for education. We have title 1 students today who \nare not being taken care of. In Nebraska we have 30,000 students who \nqualify based upon their income, another 30,000 who qualify based upon \nmath and science skills. We have 12,000 black students in the Omaha \nPublic School System. Only 25 percent of those who graduate have a \nproficiency in mathematics. We are not fully funding Head Start. We do \nnot say to all Americans, ``Don't worry about it, you will be able to \ngo to college.'' In Nebraska, working families take out a second \nmortgage on their homes in order to be able to send their kids to the \nland grant college--a college that was supposed to make it possible for \neverybody to be able to go to school.\n  If we had money for education in this legislation, if it was said we \nare going to do those things we know work--we know Head Start works, \nparticularly title 1--at a cost of $800 per child per year. And to half \nof the people who need it, based upon their performance in math and \nreading, we say we do not have the money for you.\n  When it comes time to build the next generation of attack fighter, we \nhave the money for that. We have another $30 or $40 billion to build \nthe Harrier, because we are afraid of God knows what. Actually, we are \nafraid of countries to whom we have sold F-16's. All of a sudden we are \nbuilding a great fear of a new threat out there. We are not afraid, but \nwe ought to be afraid, of what happens when our graduates from high \nschool, in an international economy, cannot read, cannot write, cannot \ndo multistat mathematics, cannot do the things that all of us know in \nan international economy they have to be able to do if they expect to \nearn the living that we would like to see all Americans be able to, in \nfact, earn.\n  Another presumption I hear is we are spending too much on the poor. \nThese programs we are addressing--I understand we have Medicaid and it \nis about $25 billion just for acute care for the poor. And we have some \nhousing programs, some are low and moderate, some just for the poor. \nBut just for these programs themselves we are going to spend 1.4 \npercent of the GDP. We have a $7 trillion GDP right now. These programs \nrepresent about $102 billion.\n\n[[Page S9340]]\n\n  We are not going to address Social Security, Medicare, or benefits \nthat go to people like me who have substantial income but still receive \na Government check. We are not going to do any of that. We are going to \ngo after people who have low incomes and we are going to say: You are \nreally the problem. We have to take our deficit toll upon you. Mr. \nPresident, 1.42 percent, going to 1.5 percent of the Nation's economy.\n  By the way, for my colleagues, I believe there is a relationship \nbetween our economy and what we can afford. I am an advocate of \neconomic growth, I want our tax, regulatory, and spending policies to \npromote growth. Our wealth does determine how much we are able to give \nto those who are less fortunate, whose lives have been affected by some \ndisaster or another, who are struggling to compete in this economy of \nours. But, for gosh shakes, 1.5 percent is hardly what I would call an \nexcessive tithe. Indeed, under this proposal instead of going from 1.42 \nand adding 8 hundredths of a percent, we are going to go from 1.42 to \n1.38.\n\n  You have not heard me come and say I think these cuts are draconian \nand people are going to be foraging in the street for food. But I do \nnot think a generous Nation that has our children in the classroom \nsaying we are ``one Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and \njustice for all,'' can look at this and say 1.4 percent of our GDP \ngoing to poor Americans is excessive and it is something we are not \nable to afford.\n  In addition, I make over $100,000 a year. I have not heard anybody \ncome down and say, ``Bob, this is what we think your contribution ought \nto be for deficit reduction.'' I have not heard anybody come to me and \nsay, ``We think you ought to give up a little bit, too.'' I think \nconcerns about equity when we are doing deficit reduction are \nlegitimate and need to be surfaced.\n  I hope, in the aftermath of this bill's passage and signing, we are \nable, in 1997, as we look at our budget, to adjust not just our \nentitlement programs, and those entitlement programs that are going to \nupper-income American, and say we are going to try to provide \nadditional discretionary money for education and for low-income people \nso we can deal with many of the underlying problems that both the \nsupporters and opponents of this legislation have addressed. I do not \nbelieve we can have a liberal democracy and a free enterprise system of \ncapitalism, I do not believe we can say to our people you have to \ncompete in a global society and we are going to try to keep the trade \nbarriers as low as possible, I do not believe that any of that works \nunless we are willing to do those things that we know work. We are not \ndoing them today. We are saying we are short for Titler 1, we are short \nfor Head Start, we are short for college loans, short for all these \nother things. I think it will, indeed, come back to haunt us.\n  We do know what we can do as a follow-on to this legislation. As I \nindicated, if there were more resources here for education, for \ntraining, for those things that would actually provide what I would \nconsider to be a reasonable safety net in an international economy, I \nwould likely support it.\n  Let me give one final example. The previous occupant of the chair, \nSenator Inhofe, introduced a piece of legislation dealing with limbs \nfor low-income working families. He identified a very important \nproblem.\n  The problem is this. We spent $1 billion for all prostheses in \nAmerica, arms and legs. That is about a fourth of what we spend on \nantacids to cure our stress, half of what we spend to feed our dogs and \ncats--hardly what I call an excessive expenditure. But if you are a \nworking family that does not have health insurance and have an income \nof $15,000 a year and your 10-year-old daughter loses her leg above the \nknee and you go to your prosthesist and find out the prosthese will \ncost $12,000, what do you do? You cannot afford it. So you consider \ntrying to do the same sorts of things that are being done for Third \nWorld nations. Can we use used parts to try to assemble a limb and an \narm for this 10-year-old child to be able to make life better?\n  I mention this only because all the arguments about wanting to \nprovide an incentive for work are not going to be effective unless we, \nas a follow-up to this legislation, not only provide in the \nappropriations process the money needed to educate our people, but also \nas a follow-up, we consider this fundamental question: What kind of \nsafety net do we want to provide for the citizens of the world's \nstrongest economy and the world's most successful democracy?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I inquire of the Chair, what is the order \nof business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Democrats control the time between now and 1 \no'clock.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, under that agreement, I yield myself 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Let me start by acknowledging that following my good \nfriend from Nebraska, who is indeed a close friend, I have a great deal \nof respect for his opinions, even though we disagree on the merits of \nthe welfare legislation that will pass the Senate today as it passed \nthe House yesterday.\n\n  There is a great deal of second-guessing about the President's \ndecision yesterday to sign the welfare bill. We have had statements by \nvarious Members as to whether it was a good idea or a bad idea. I think \nhis decision was the correct decision, and it also, at the same time, \nis a very courageous decision. I know it was tough, but I think, \nultimately, in signing the bill, the President will be doing the right \nthing.\n  I think one thing that is clear, certainly when you get outside of \nWashington, is that the American people know that the current welfare \nsystem does not serve very well the people who are on it, who it was \nintended to help, nor does it serve very well the people who are paying \nfor it: the American taxpayer.\n  It simply is not working when you see generation after generation of \nfamilies who have been on welfare assistance continue to be on welfare \nassistance. The goal of any welfare reform is to end welfare, not to \ncontinue it, not to perpetuate it.\n  Since 1935, we have seen families really who have been locked in a \nprison of welfare dependency and have been shackled by the concepts \nthat have continued generation after generation and decade after \ndecade. The question is not should we change the system but how we \nchange it. I think the President was absolutely correct in setting out \nthe priorities. Welfare reform should be tough on work but good for \nkids. While that is a simple and catchy phrase, it also is the basis \nfor the legislation that we are going to adopt.\n  This bill is tough on work, but it says welfare is not going to be \npermanent, that it should be temporary, that it is a maximum of 5 years \nin a person's lifetime, and States can come up with a shorter period if \nthey want.\n  The goal of making work part of welfare reform is that we should be \nturning welfare offices, that for too long have only been an office \ngiving out a check, into an office that helps people find a job. It was \ninteresting this morning, a local TV station was interviewing a number \nof people who were actually on welfare, mothers with small children, \nwho said they agreed with this legislation. They did not want to be on \nwelfare for the rest of their lives. They wanted the welfare office to \nbe a workfare office. They wanted the welfare office to be a job \nplacement office. They wanted the welfare office to help them get off \nwelfare. I think this legislation will do exactly that.\n  The bill, I think, is very important in some of the things it does \ndo, such as child care. This legislation provides about $14 billion for \nchild care, particularly for mothers with small children, so that child \ncare will be available so they can go to work. That is about $5 billion \nmore than under the current law and $4 billion more than in the bill \nthat the President was forced to veto because it was not good for \nchildren. This bill, in fact, is good for children.\n  I was interested in some who have said, ``Well, after 5 years, we're \njust going to abandon families.'' There is nothing further from the \ntruth. We were looking over the various programs that would still be \navailable after the 5-year period is reached. There are some 49 Federal \nprograms that are available for families and would continue to be \navailable for families after they have reached their time limit of 5 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S9341]]\n\n  This country, as strong as we are, is not going to be deserting \nfamilies, is not going to be deserting children of families who have \nexceeded the time limit. There will still be a large number of programs \nthat will provide direct assistance to these families after they have \nreached their time limit.\n  This bill, I think, goes a long ways to correcting problems that the \nPresident addressed when he first vetoed the welfare bill. For \ninstance, we maintain health care coverage through Medicaid for all \nthose families who are eligible today, even though a State may change \ntheir welfare program. We clearly say that families that are on AFDC \ntoday will continue to be eligible for health care, and this, indeed, \nis very important.\n\n  In addition to the child care, the President had very strong concerns \nabout just arbitrarily block granting the Food Stamp Program, which is \na Federal program, to the States. This bill guarantees that additional \nbenefits will be available when need increases, such as during a \nrecession. The program would still essentially be a Federal program. It \nwould not be block granted to the States.\n  I think, on balance, the President of the United States was \nabsolutely correct and being courageous in saying, ``Yes, we are going \nto change the system; yes, we are going to try something different. \nAnd, yes, we are going to be tough on work for people who can work and, \nyet, at the same time, do good for children of those families.'' I \nthink that is incredibly important.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9337-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9341-S9344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, let me take a couple of minutes to comment \non something else, and that is the economic news that was announced \ntoday, which I personally am very proud of, as I think every Member of \nthis Congress can be, and this administration can be proud of the news.\n  I know when I look at my own State of Louisiana, Louisiana's \nunemployment in 1992 was 8.2 percent; 8.2 percent of the people in my \nState did not have a job. Today, the unemployment rate is 6.9 percent, \na substantial drop.\n  In 1992, the growth rate in this country was 2.7 percent, and the \ndeficit stood at $290 billion. Today's growth rate figures of 4.2 \npercent is incredible progress, and we should be proud of it. \nHopefully, we are moving in the right direction with regard to the \nFederal deficit.\n  In 1992, we looked at a Federal deficit that had staggered up to $290 \nbillion. Today's figures we are estimating are somewhere between $115 \nbillion and $130 billion--still too high, but real progress.\n  I was interested in just this week--and these are not just figures \nthat apply in Washington. A lot of people back home say, ``Well, some \nDepartment in Washington issued figures I don't really understand.'' \nThe hometown paper in New Orleans has a special report just this week \non the economy in my State of Louisiana. It shows what we are talking \nabout on the floor today, about this good economic news in Washington \nis good economic news throughout the United States of America.\n  This is a special in the Times-Picayune in New Orleans. It says in \ncomparison:\n\n       A decade ago, the economic world as New Orleans knew it \n     seemed over. The oil boom that had turned into the oil \n     slowdown was now the oil bust.\n       Almost before anyone knew what had happened, tens of \n     thousands of jobs had disappeared from the local economy. . .\n       Fast forward to 1996. Traffic is bustling--\n\n  On all of our roads and highways:\n\n       Houses in prime neighborhoods seemingly sell in seconds. \n     Banks are cheerfully advertising their services or rates. The \n     oil and gas business looks pretty good.\n       Residential building contracts in New Orleans, Baton Rouge \n     and statewide are up through June from a year ago 11 percent \n     for this area, 29 percent for the State.\n       Get the picture?\n       ``Fundamentally, the State's economy is in great shape,'' \n     said Hibernia Corp. President Stephen Hansell.\n\n  What I am trying to point out is that this is good news in my State \nand, I daresay, in the other 49 States as well.\n  I was interested in how the article concluded:\n\n       The Federal Government didn't manufacture it.\n\n  And they talk about other things that didn't have anything to do with \nit. I want to make the point that I think the actions here in \nWashington did, in fact, have something to do with it. I think the 1993 \nDeficit Reduction Act had something to do with this.\n  Many of my colleagues said this is going to destroy the economy of \nAmerica; this Deficit Reduction Act is a terrible thing. The news today \nis that the results are in and the news is good news. The tough things \nthat we had to do in 1993 to get this country back on a course of \neconomic recovery have worked, and there should be celebration in the \nCongress for recognizing that something that was very difficult to do, \nin fact, was done.\n  The deficit went from $290 billion to $115 billion to $130 billion. I \nsay to the writers of this editorial that that had something to do with \nthat economic boom.\n  That meant that there was more money for private citizens, more money \nfor the private economy to be able to borrow, to invest, to expand \ntheir businesses and to create jobs. That had a direct effect on the \nnews today in my State and other States that things are on the right \ntrack, the economy is strong, that more jobs are being created. And it \njust cannot happen by accident.\n  Some of the tough things we had to face when we voted for the 1993 \nDeficit Reduction Act in fact was very much a part of the economic \nrecovery that we are seeing in Louisiana and the other 49 States. So I \nthink we can all be proud to say that Government does sometimes do the \nright thing, even though at the time we do it there may be a great deal \nof questioning whether it is the right thing. Today the results are in \nand it was the right thing to do. And we will continue to do that.\n  I think that we, as Democrats, can be proud of our activity in that \narea. I feel very strongly that we, as Democrats, can still promote \neconomic growth by tax cuts that are paid for, the bipartisan group \nChafee-Breaux, so-called, promoted a capital gains tax cut that was \npaid for. I think that is very important. We should continue to \nconsider tax cuts for the economic growth. But we ought to make sure \nthey are paid for, that they do not increase the deficit. A tax cut \nthat merely increases the deficit may be easy to pass but it is bad \neconomic policy.\n  So I think that we should move forward with tax cuts of which I do \nsupport. The President has supported tax cuts. The $10,000 tuition tax \ndeduction is one. The penalty-free withdrawals from individual \nretirement accounts for educational expenses is another good economic \npolicy that will be paid for. There is the HOPE scholarship tax cut, \n$1,500, again, which is a move in the right direction. So I think that \nwe as Democrats can be proud of the results that are in today, and \ncontinue to look at new ideas in terms of tax cuts that are paid for to \npromote economic growth and development in this country. Mr. President, \nI join with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue to do \nwhat is necessary to promote the economic growth that we now see in the \nUnited States. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, per a previous agreement that I understand \nhas been entered into, at this time I would like to set aside 1 hour of \nthe 5 hours allowed to this side of the aisle on the debate on the \nwelfare conference report to talk about some other economic matters \nthat several Members on this side of the aisle, including this Senator, \nwould like to address. So if it is convenient and agreeable to those on \nthat side of the aisle, we would like to proceed in that fashion at \nthis point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would inform the Senator that the \nDemocrats are in control of time between 12 and 1 o'clock under the \ncurrent order that is under discussion.\n  Mr. EXON. How much time has been consumed on the economic debate up \nuntil now?\n  Mr. CONRAD. None.\n  Mr. EXON. How much of the 1 hour has been used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Twenty-two minutes. Then I would like to ask that the \nremainder of that time proceed, and if\n\n[[Page S9342]]\n\nnecessary, although we hope it will not be necessary, to accommodate \nthose who wish to speak on this subject, I may ask unanimous consent \nfor a few additional minutes after the time expires. I would like to \nadvise those on that side of that fact.\n  I believe the Senator from North Dakota was seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  This morning the Commerce Department delivered extremely good news on \nthe Nation's economy. The Commerce Department reports that the economy \ngrew at a rate of 4.2 percent in the second quarter.\n  Mr. President, these figures confirm that the economy under President \nClinton is strong, it is growing, and it is creating jobs. We all \nrecall what the economy was like before this administration came into \noffice. In 1991 the economy was in recession. By 1992 the budget \ndeficit had ballooned to $290 billion. America was in trouble.\n  Then President Clinton came into office. He offered a bold plan of \ndeficit reduction to strengthen the Nation's economy. That plan passed \nby the Democratic Congress has delivered superb results. And today we \ncan report on what has happened.\n  In August 1993, a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President \nenacted into law a historic deficit-reduction plan. That plan was \ndesigned to reduce the deficit by $500 billion over 5 years. Unlike any \nother deficit-reduction plan that we have seen since I have been here, \nthat plan delivered on its promise.\n  Mr. President, we recall very well what our friends on the other side \nof the aisle said during that historic debate. They said that the \neconomic plan passed by the Democratic Congress and supported by the \nDemocratic President would crater the economy.\n  I can remember so well the Republican majority leader standing at his \ndesk telling us that if we enacted that plan there would be economic \nruination. He was wrong. But he was not alone in being wrong. Virtually \nevery Member on the other side asserted that if we passed this bold \neconomic plan to reduce the deficit and strengthen the economy it would \ndo just the reverse. They said--and they said repeatedly--if we passed \nthat plan the deficit would go up, not down, that economic growth would \nbe reduced, not increased, that joblessness would multiply.\n  Mr. President, they were wrong. They were dead wrong. And now we can \nlook at the record to see precisely what has happened.\n  Former Senator Dole said, ``President Clinton knows * * * the \nAmerican people know that the plan does not tackle the deficit head-\non.'' Mr. Dole was wrong.\n  Representative Armey, now the majority leader in the House of \nRepresentatives said, ``The impact on job creation is going to be \ndevastating.'' Mr. Armey was wrong. He was dead wrong.\n  Senator Gramm of Texas said this: ``I want to predict here tonight if \nwe adopt this bill, the American economy is going to get weaker, not \nstronger. The deficit 4 years from today will be higher than it is \ntoday, and not lower.'' Senator Gramm of Texas was wrong. He was dead \nwrong.\n  Mr. President, all we have to do is look at the record. Let us start \nwith the testimony of the head of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Greenspan, \nbefore the Senate Banking Committee about the economic plan to reduce \nthe deficit. It was supported by the President and passed by Democrats \nin Congress.\n  Mr. Greenspan said about the deficit reduction in President Clinton's \n1993 economic plan--and I quote--``an unquestioned factor in \ncontributing to the improvement in economic activity that occurred \nthereafter.''\n  That is not a spokesman for the Democratic party. That is the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, talking about \nwhat the Clinton economic plan has meant to this country.\n  Just to be certain no one forgets what has happened, with respect to \nthe record on deficit reduction, let's look at this chart, which shows \nthe Reagan record, the Bush record, and the Clinton record on deficit \nreduction.\n  President Reagan came into office in 1981. The deficit stood at just \nunder $80 billion. Under his economic plan that passed the Congress--we \nrecall the Republicans controlled the Senate from 1981 to 1987--he got \nhis economic plan passed, and what happened? The deficit skyrocketed. \nIt just about tripled under President Reagan's economic plan. Then we \nsaw some reduction as steps were taken to rein in the increasing budget \ndeficit.\n  Then President Bush took over. President Bush saw the deficit go, on \nhis watch, from $153 billion a year to $290 billion in 1992. The \ndeficit was out of control.\n  President Clinton came in, in 1993. And each year of his \nadministration the deficit has been reduced, and reduced significantly, \nfrom $290 billion in the last year of the Bush administration to $130 \nbillion estimated this year.\n  In fact, the deficit may come in at less than $120 billion this year. \nThe deficit has been cut more than half during the Clinton \nadministration. It is directly attributable to the plan that we passed, \nthe economic plan that we passed, in 1993.\n  The President also, when he was running for President, promised he \nwould produce with his economic plan 8 million new jobs in the 4 years \nof his first term. We can now look at the record. The President has \ndone better than he promised. Instead of 8 million new jobs, the \neconomy under his economic plan, a plan passed by the Democratic \nCongress, has produced 10 million new jobs. The President has done a \nsuperb job of running this Nation's economy.\n  Not only has the job creation record of this administration been \noutstanding, the economic growth we now see has also been much better \nthan previous administrations. Mr. President, if we look at private \nsector economic growth in the Clinton years, we see it is averaging \nover 3.1 percent. In fact, with the news this morning, we now know it \nhas averaged 3.2 percent. That is in comparison to private sector \neconomic growth in the Bush years of 1.3 percent--a dramatic \nimprovement in economic growth in the private sector in this country \nunder the Clinton economic plan.\n  It does not stop there. There is more good news. The misery index--\nthat is something we have talked a lot about in the past. That is a \ncalculation of the unemployment rate and the rate of inflation. The \nmisery index is at its lowest level since 1968. What a remarkable \neconomic record this administration has to take to the American people.\n  It does not stop there. There is more good news. The unemployment \nrate in December of 1992 was 7.3 percent. In June 1996, the \nunemployment rate has declined to 5.3 percent. The unemployment rate \nhas been below 6 percent for 22 consecutive months. This chart shows \nwhat we have seen in terms of the reduction in unemployed people in \nAmerica from a rate of 7.3 percent when President Clinton came into \noffice to 5.3 percent today--about a 30-percent reduction in \nunemployment.\n  Mr. President, it is clear, the economic game plan that President \nClinton put before this Congress, that was passed without any help from \nRepublican Members, has led to a superb result, a dramatic reduction in \nthe deficit, a dramatic increase in jobs, a dramatic increase in \neconomic growth, a significant reduction in the misery index, the \nlowest level since 1968.\n  Mr. President, the good news does not stop there, either. If we look \nat real business fixed investment, again we see the record from 1985 to \n1996, and we see the real business fixed investment, as a result of the \nClinton economic plan, has taken off like a scalded cat, the largest \nincrease in business fixed investment in over 30 years. This is truly a \nremarkable economic record.\n  I have to remind our friends on the other side of the aisle, when we \nput this plan into place, they predicted it would be nothing but bad \nnews. They said it would crater the economy, it would increase the \ndeficit. They said it would reduce all of the things that we want to \nsee increase, and increase all the things we want to see reduced. They \nwere wrong. They were dead wrong.\n  This economic plan, a plan that was passed without a single \nRepublican vote, has produced remarkable results--by some measures, the \nstrongest economy in 30 years. This is a record of economic success \nthat should not be interrupted.\n  Mr. President, I think the record is clear. The Clinton \nadministration has\n\n[[Page S9343]]\n\ndelivered on its economic promises. In fact, it has exceeded its \npromises on economic performance. That is one significant reason this \nPresident ought to be continued in office.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator have left on \nthe 1 hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-five minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I need about 10 minutes, but we may end up \nin a discussion, so we may take a couple of Members' time and combine \nit, and we may not need quite as much.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Since I have several other requests, I yield 7 minutes to \nthe Senator from Connecticut. I have to do that or we will run right \nout of time.\n  Mr. DODD. I understand. Maybe because we used more time on the \nwelfare debate and we did not start this discussion until about 12:20, \nwe might be able to get an extension.\n  Mr. EXON. I suggested that.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me commend my colleague from North Dakota for his \ncomments and observations--I see both my colleagues from North Dakota \nhere--in talking about this news this morning.\n  This is great news. Obviously, when you have the gross domestic \nproduct growing at an annual rate of 4.2 percent, the strongest growth \nrate in 2 years, that is very, very good news for jobs, security, and \nopportunity for virtually every person in this country.\n  Certainly all of us, regardless of party, I presume, would be \ncelebrating this magnificent news that portends well for this country \nas we, in the remaining years of this decade, get ready to enter the \nnew century.\n  My colleague from North Dakota points out what the situation was like \n3\\1/2\\ years ago. There are many people here who will count on the \nAmerican people having a short memory, that they will forget how things \nwere 36 months ago, what we were living under in this country, where we \nhad unemployment rates of 7 percent. Those were the identifiable rates. \nI argue it was much higher than 7 percent in many parts of the country. \nThe job growth rate, 36 months ago or a little more than that, was at \nits lowest level since the Great Depression. The Federal deficit was \nhovering around $300 billion a year, $290 to $300 billion. The dollar \nwas at the highest level in American history. That was the situation a \nlittle more than 36 months ago.\n  Where are we today? A gross domestic product growth rate of 4.2 \npercent, unemployment a little above 5 percent across the country, 10 \nmillion new jobs created in a little over 36 months, the deficit at its \nlowest level in almost a generation. Back in 1992, the President said, \n``I will cut it in half in 4 years.'' Even the President was wrong. It \nhas been a 60 percent reduction in the deficit rate in the last little \nmore than 36 months. Private sector job growth has soared, soared in \nthe last number of months.\n  I point out, if I can, the deficit reduction numbers on this chart, \nwhich highlight a major issue. We have made a herculean effort over the \nlast several years to reduce this deficit.\n  As my colleague from North Dakota points out, we did not have a \nsingle vote on the other side in the deficit reduction plan, not a \nsingle vote in either body--the House of Representatives or the \nSenate--in support of our deficit reduction plan in 1993. Yet we now \nsee what has happened. In 1980, the annual deficit was at $74 billion; \nbetween 1981 and 1992, the annual deficit rate climbed to almost $300 \nbillion. In around 36 months we have taken that $290 billion figure and \nreduced it to $117 billion. In fact, this very number of $117 billion \nwould be zero were it not for just the deficit that we accumulated \nbetween 1981 and 1992.\n  And let me say this. We would be in balance today, were it not for \nthe debt run up by the previous two Presidents. Just the interest \npayments on the debt accumulated in those 12 years has created this \n$117 billion figure. For the first time in many years, we now find \nourselves where receipts of the Federal Government exceed our \nexpenditures but for interest on the debt that was accumulated in those \nyears. It is a tremendous accomplishment, a tremendous accomplishment. \nIt is really the linchpin, I think, in what has occurred in other \neconomic areas, how the markets are reacting, how Main Street is \nreacting, the fact we have been able to create the kind of growth we \nhave seen.\n  We have had 4 years of deficit reduction. You have to go back to \n1840, more than a century ago, a century and a half ago, when we had \nfour consecutive years of deficit reduction. Miraculously, it has \nhappened because a lot of people cast some courageous votes.\n  In fact, the opposition, the Republicans, tried to shut down the \nGovernment twice over deficit reduction. I raise all of that because, \nnext week, I am told, we are going to have a proposal made by the other \nside--presumably by the presumptive candidate for the Republican \nnomination--that will call for tax cuts of roughly $600 billion. I \nsuspect most of them are going to benefit the more affluent in our \ncountry and are going to blow a $600 billion hole in the progress we've \nmade on deficit reduction.\n  What was all the talk about in this previous Congress if not deficit \nreduction? With 10 weeks to go before election day, all of a sudden we \nget this suggestion of a $600 billion tax cut coming along, and many \npeople are warning the candidate and others that you would create real \nhavoc in the economy if that were adopted. It is certainly going to \nmake it almost impossible for us to reach the goals that I believed we \nwere all committed to achieving here over the next several years. Of \ncourse, where is the savings going to come from in this $600 billion \ntax cut that will be proposed?\n  It is almost as if we are treating the public like they are fools. \nDoes anybody believe, with 10 or 11 weeks to go before election day, \nwith a $600 billion tax proposal, that it isn't totally motivated by \ntrying to bring some life to a moribund campaign and do so by \njeopardizing the economic gains we have made? I think most people are \ngoing to see through that. What is tragic about it is that we have \nCandidate Bob Dole contrasted with Senator and Chairman Bob Dole. If \nBob Dole were sitting in the U.S. Senate or were chairman of the \nFinance Committee, he would ridicule the idea. He would rightly see it \nas unraveling agreements that we have already achieved to try to \nbalance the budget in 7 years. In fact, all the proposals on \nconstitutional amendments to achieve a balanced budget would appear to \nbe nothing more than a lot of rhetoric.\n  We are being told how these tax breaks may be paid for. One report \nsays that, of the $600 billion in tax cuts, $240 billion would be \ncoming from offsets in increased tax revenues resulting from increased \ngrowth--$240 billion is coming from increased revenues from increased \ngrowth. Boy, that is a rosy scenario, if I ever heard one. The same \npeople who proposed this insisted a year or so ago that we use \nconservative economic growth numbers when we start trying to make up \nfor this. Where does the other $360 billion come from if you are going \nto pay for this tax cut you are talking about? Well, stop me if this \nsounds familiar to you, but if last year is any indication, it is going \nto come from Medicaid, education, Medicare, and the environment. That \nis what they tried last time around. One analysis has a $313 billion \ncut coming in the Medicare program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the Senator 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will ask my colleague to engage on this \npoint. I am very concerned. I hope that cooler heads will prevail in \nthis campaign season and that suggestions like this will be put in the \ntrash bin where they belong, at a time when we are moving forward and \nachieving deficit reduction numbers, the economy is growing, the gross \ndomestic product numbers and the unemployment levels are moving in the \nright direction.\n  This is a time to come together. Nobody expects perfection here. Our \nRepublican friends made a huge mistake in their predictions about the \n1993 budget reduction efforts. All of us have made mistakes. So why not \nadmit you made a mistake? It was a bad vote. You should have supported \nit, and you did not. Collectively, we have come together and the \ncountry is moving in the right direction.\n  I hope we won't destroy what has been a very significant effort over \nthe last number of months to move the country in the proper direction \nby reducing this deficit, resulting, I believe,\n\n[[Page S9344]]\n\nin the kind of gross domestic product growth numbers that we are seeing \nhere today, the unemployment numbers that are moving us in the right \ndirection. This is not a time to try to pander to the American public \nwith the suggestion of massive tax cuts for the affluent, paid for by \nrosy economic figures that are unrealistic and cuts in the very \nprograms we have fought to defend.\n\n  Mr. President, I would love to be proven wrong. I would be delighted \nif next week came and went and all the talk about these wild schemes--\nwild schemes--to try to breathe life into a campaign by jeopardizing \nthe American economy and the direction we are going, was shelved and we \ngot back to a more rational, thoughtful approach on how to continue the \nkind of economic growth numbers we have seen here this morning and \noffer some real promise to the American people.\n  With that, Mr. President, I will yield whatever time remains to my \ncolleagues from Nebraska or North Dakota.\n  Mr. EXON. How much time does the Senator from Nebraska have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my friend from North \nDakota, followed by 5 minutes for this Senator from Nebraska and 4 \nminutes to the Senator from Massachusetts, in that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Does the Senator from Nebraska intend to try to get \nadditional time? We had talked about an hour, and we were not able to \nstart because they were talking about welfare reform.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I do not see the Republican leader on the \nfloor at this time. I will try to get that time. If people want more \ntime, I will be glad to yield. We are trying to be very fair with the \ntime. Everybody would like to have lots of time, but I only have 14 \nminutes remaining as of now. I am conserving that as best I can.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we had talked about trying to have a block \nof time to talk about the economy. The reason we wanted to do that is \nbecause this is very important. This is the question that most people \nin this country ask themselves, and families reflect on this: Is this \ncountry moving in the right direction or the wrong direction? Are we on \nthe right track, or are we on the wrong road? Those are the questions \npeople ask.\n  We are not here suggesting that everything is wonderful in America. \nWe have a country that faces a lot of challenges. There is no question \nabout that. But we have a country that has gone through an immediate \npast period causing significant problems, requiring significant \nremedies, but a country that has begun to address those things head-on.\n  I want to take us back just a bit to a new President that came to \ntown, who said, ``I have a new idea. I have consulted with a man named \nLaffer, an economist, who has a new graph and curve, the Laffer \ncurve.'' The Laffer curve says that, if you give folks at the upper end \nof the income brackets big tax cuts, you actually collect more money \nbecause it will filter down and everybody at the bottom will get damp. \nThat is trickle-down economics. So there were big, big tax cuts given, \nespecially to the people at the top. The result was that we ran into \nmassive deficits, unparalleled in the history of this country--massive \nbudget deficits. The rich got richer, the people at the top, during \nthat period. The top 1 percent of Americans had a 66-percent increase \nin their financial wealth just from 1983 to 1989. The bottom 80 percent \nlost 3 percent of their wealth. So some people did very well--just the \ntop 1 percent. But almost all the rest of the people did not do well at \nall under this circumstance.\n  Well, we had a new President come to town again in 1992. He started \nin January 1993. He recognized immediately that we faced an enormously \nserious problem. This country was not going to grow and was not going \nto realize its potential unless we dealt head-on with this deficit \nproblem. We had a vote here in the U.S. Senate on a deficit reduction \nplan. I voted for it. I told the people I represented why I voted for \nit, why I thought it was important for this country. I have never \napologized for voting for it. I felt it was the right thing to do. Was \nit a good political thing to do? No, not at all.\n  There were some people who sat in these chairs who lost their seats \nin the Senate over that vote. They had the courage to stand up and say, \n``Count me in. I want to address this deficit. I want to suggest that \nwe take the medicine necessary to do this.''\n  So the deficit began to come down. We did not get one vote on the \nother side of the aisle. We got a lot of claims on the other side of \nthe aisle. I see the Senator from Texas is here to visit with us today. \nI recall his claim. His claim was it is going to lead directly to a \nrecession. But it was not just him. Many others did the same thing. \n``The sky is going to fall in. There is going to be a big recession.'' \nWhat happened was the deficit fell.\n  This is what happened to the deficit under President Reagan, under \nPresident Bush, and why he did not win reelection, by the way. That \nline was still going up; and the deficit under President Clinton. He \nunderstood that, unless we tackled this problem, this country could not \nrealize its economic potential.\n  Are we done tackling this problem? No. But this has been a success \nbecause we had more jobs and more economic growth.\n  What was the news this morning? The news was in the last quarter this \ncountry grew at 4.2 percent of economic growth, a very robust rate. The \nfact is this economy is still growing. Why? Because we are doing the \nright things. We are not perfect, but we are at least doing the right \nthings.\n  I want to mention one additional point. It is important. We have \nanother plan by a guy who wants to be President next January. He has a \nnew plan--across-the-board massive tax cuts, which, of course, will \nbenefit the high-income people and cause a hemorrhaging of a new \nFederal deficit. That is the new plan. At least it has a new title.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. May I have 1 more minute?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has remaining the time between now \nand 1 o'clock.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 1 more minute to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator's generosity.\n  The plan for across-the-board tax reductions that they would \nimplement next January, which would increase the deficit, is augmented \nby what they are doing with the midnight oil right now. For the last \ncouple of nights they were in the back room and are going to bring a \nbill to the floor of the Senate in a matter of hours, I assume, that \nhas this in it: opening another tax loophole, several hundred millions \nof dollars. Amway has been asking for it. So they get it.\n  Who is going to get the brandnew tax loophole of $300 million? That \nis the solution coming from the other side of the aisle. How do you fix \nwhat is wrong in America? Increase the deficits by cutting taxes for \nupper income folks and do secret deals in the back room to bring to the \nfloor of the Senate something that exports American jobs and gives new \ntax breaks to big corporations that do not need it.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9341-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9344-S9347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORK OPPORTUNITY RECONCILIATION ACT OF \n                        1996--CONFERENCE REPORT.\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, I yield the time remaining between now and 1 \no'clock plus 15 minutes off the bill to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is my understanding, I say to the \nSenator from Texas, that we had the time going up to 1:15. That is what \nI was notified. That is why I am over here, and I arranged my schedule \naccordingly.\n  The honorable and widely shared goal of welfare reform is to end \nwelfare as a way of life and make it a way station to work.\n  If we accept that indisputable proposition, then the two most \nimportant principles of welfare reform should be to move able-bodied \nadults on welfare into the work force, while protecting their children \nfrom hunger and want.\n  This legislation tragically fails on both counts. It fails to provide \nwhat is necessary to move people from welfare to work. But it will push \nover 1 million more children into poverty. People on welfare will get a \nlecture, but they won't get a job, and their children will suffer.\n  To call this bill welfare reform is nonsense. It's welfare retreat. \nReform means improvement--solving the problem. This bill will bring \ndamage to countless families across America. To label this legislation \nreform is no more accurate than to call the demolition of a house \nremodeling.\n  It is also wrong to describe this bill as affecting only families on \nwelfare. Its provisions will harm working families as well. More than a \nfifth of all American families with children--8.2 million households--\nwill see a substantial decline in their family income if this bill \nbecomes law; 1.1 million children will be pushed below the poverty line \nby this bill. The majority of these children live in families headed by \na working parent.\n  What's in a label? For families, this is an abandon-hope-bill, a \nback-to-poverty-bill, a you-don't-count-bill, a deny-the-American-\ndream-bill.\n  The average annual income loss will be significant--$1,300 per \nfamily. This bill is supposed to encourage work. It makes no sense to \nreduce support for low-income working families. Cruelly, and \nintentionally, the authors of this legislation have chosen to do just \nthat. Their real goal is not welfare reform. They are Robin Hoods in \nreverse--robbing the poor to pay for undeserved tax breaks for the \nrich.\n  If this legislation honestly intended to move people from welfare to \nwork, we would focus on steps to make them employable. Of the parents \nwhose families will be denied assistance after the time limits, only a \nthird have a high school degree. Yet three-quarters of the available \njobs in today's economy require a high school diploma. Sixty percent of \nthose jobs require at least some job experience. Yet this legislation \ndoes little about helping recipients obtain the education and job \ntraining they need in order to get real jobs in the real world. In this \nRepublican Congress, even the existing meager level of Federal support \nfor such programs is in jeopardy.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, Federal funding in the \ncoming years is approximately $10 billion less than the amount needed \nto meet the work requirements in the bill. Without adequate job \ntraining, a congressional command that people on welfare go to work is \nno more enforceable than the mythical king's command to the tide not to \nroll in to the shore.\n  Proponents of this bill cannot credibly claim that it is about fiscal \nresponsibility. It is about misguided priorities, for which America \nwill pay an enormous cost in years to come.\n  Some $28 billion of the savings from this legislation will come from \nreductions in food stamps. Approximately 70 percent of the food stamps \nbeing eliminated go to families with children. As a result, 14 million \nchildren will have their food stamp benefits reduced or cut off. \nWhether Republicans admit it or not, passage of this legislation \nclearly demonstrates that this Senate does not consider nutrition and \nhealth a priority for children. The Republican majority obviously \nconsiders billion dollar tax breaks for the wealthy to be a much higher \npriority.\n  All we have to do is look at the most recent Carnegie Commission \nstudy on children and nutrition. Children that do not receive adequate \nnutrition from 18 months to 3 years fail to develop the kind of brain \ndevelopment that is essential and necessary for academic achievement \nand for social adjustment. Numerous studies have shown that children \nwho do not receive balanced meals in the early stages of their lives \nare much less likely to succeed in high school, much more likely to \ndrop out, much more likely to be involved in crime, and much more \nlikely to be on welfare in future years. Yet, this bill includes harsh \ncuts in nutrition programs.\n  Almost half of the $60 billion in cuts are in nutrition programs. Who \nare the beneficiaries of those nutrition programs? By and large they \nare children. The children are the ones who are paying the price of \nthis so-called welfare reform bill so that there can be tax benefits \nand tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals in this country.\n  In all, Republicans are proposing to take the $60 billion over the \nnext 6 years from programs supporting poor children and families. Their \nvotes betray their true priorities. As President Kennedy warned in his \nInaugural Address, ``If a free society cannot help the many who are \npoor, it cannot save the few who are rich.''\n  Our Republican friends claim that they are not abandoning poor \nfamilies. They say they are giving States more flexibility to provide \nfor their needs. But that flexibility is a mirage. Substantial \nrestrictions are being placed on State discretion. This bill will \nactually prevent States from using Federal funds to assist large \nnumbers of children who now have support.\n  No funds contained in the welfare block grant can be used to assist \nchildren whose families reached the 5-year time limit. This harsh bill \neven prohibits Federal welfare funds from being used to provide \nvouchers for the most basic needs of these children. This will be no \nsmall problem for the States. Close to 4 million children will be in \nthis category when the bill is fully implemented.\n  In addition, in another shockingly cruel breach of trust, Federal \nfunds can no longer be used to provide for children who are legal \nimmigrants, who lawfully reside within our communities. Their need for \nfood, clothing, shelter and medical care is being dumped entirely on \nthe States.\n  All the studies that have been done with regard to legal immigrant \nchildren show that they use the AFDC program less than Native Americans \nand they pay their fair share of Federal, State, and local taxes.\n  We are not talking about illegal immigrants. For the first time in \nhistory, Congress will ban legal immigrants from most assistance \nprograms.\n  This Republican bill permanently bans legal immigrants from SSI and \nfood stamps. It bans them for 5 years from Medicaid, AFDC, and other \nprograms. It gives States the option of\n\n[[Page S9346]]\n\ngoing even further and permanently banning them from Medicaid, AFDC, \nand the social service block grants.\n  While we are debating this bill, the Olympics are going on in \nAtlanta. Forty-seven members of the American Olympic team are \nimmigrants--47 of them are representing and competing for the United \nStates of America. But under this legislation, these 47 Americans would \nhave been denied nutrition programs, help, and assistance if they had \nneeded them as children.\n  Hundreds of thousands of legal immigrant children will be robbed of a \nsafety net by this bill. Hopefully, they have sponsors who can care for \nthem when they need help because otherwise this bill leaves them out in \nthe cold. But half of all legal immigrants do not have sponsors. What \nhappens to those children when their families fall on hard times?\n  In our recent immigration bill, we permit 140,000 individuals to come \ninto the United States on special skills programs. They are not \nsponsored. They do not have someone to deem to.\n  Now, what happens to them? What happens to them if they fall on hard \ntimes? They do not have a sponsor. They and their children are \neffectively cut off from any kind of help and assistance--even in an \nemergency.\n  These are individuals and families who come here legally. By and \nlarge, they are family members--sons, daughters, and parents--of \nAmerican citizens. These are people who play our the rules, pay their \ntaxes, and serve in the Armed Forces. They can be drafted. They can \nvolunteer. We have hundreds of them in Bosnia today. But they would \nnot, as children, have been eligible for nutrition programs or even \ntemporary benefits if their parents fell on hard times.\n  They are future citizens trying to make it in this country. When they \ngrow up, they become American citizens. Yet this bill repays them by \nbanning them from assistance if they need any help.\n  Perhaps the cruelest provision in this bill is the ban on assistance \nunder Medicaid for legal immigrants giving birth. Their children being \nborn are American citizens. This outrageous provision means that these \nAmerican citizen babies will not get the care, attention, and healthy \nstart in life that other American children receive. These babies are \ndoomed to unsupervised home deliveries, substandard care, and a \nlifetime of potential handicaps if they fail to get adequate medical \ncare during birth. If Congress will not strike that shameful provision \ndown, perhaps the Supreme Court will.\n\n  The prohibition on assistance to older children also makes no sense. \nMany children will be affected and harmed, but many others will not. It \ndepends entirely on where they are born. Children born in the United \nStates are U.S. citizens and will be eligible for assistance, even if \ntheir parents are legal immigrants. But children born overseas will be \ncaught by the ban. This is a wonderful anomaly. So the children in the \nsame family will be treated differently, depending on where they were \nborn. The older brother will be able to get assistance and the younger \nsister will not. That is the wonderful logic of this so-called welfare \nreform. This result is fundamentally unfair.\n  These children are future citizens. Like all other children in \nAmerica, they need and deserve good health and nutrition. If the \nFederal Government abandons them, communities will suffer.\n  When immigrant children get sick, they infect other children. I \nassume that our good friends on the Ways and Means and Finance \nCommittees understand what happens in every schoolroom in America. When \nchildren get sick, they still communicate. Anybody who has children \nunderstands that when a bug gets into second, third, or fourth grade \nkids--most of his or her classmates will also get sick. By banning \nimmigrant children from Medicaid we are also banning them from school-\nbased care, which is part of Medicaid in most States.\n  These children will not be able to go down to the nurse's office, get \nsome attention, and perhaps be sent home to avoid serious illness and \nto avoid infecting other children in the class. They will not even be \nable to get in the door. If they try to see the nurse, the nurse cannot \ntreat them because they are immigrants. They have no private insurance, \nand they are banned from Medicaid. If the illness gets worse, their \nparents may take them to the local emergency room--a very expensive \nalternative and not likely to be pursued unless the illness seems \nsevere--which will add to the costs of our health care system. This is \nwelfare reform under this bill.\n  The Republican bill also bans legal immigrant children from SSI, \nwhich provides assistance to the blind and disabled. Nine thousand \nlegal immigrant children suffer from those conditions. They have some \nof the most complex and life-threatening needs of all. As a practical \nmatter, such cases often involve tragic accidents, where expensive, \nlong-term care is needed to deal with their debilitating conditions. If \nSSI is not available, children literally will die.\n  Nutrition is vital to the development of a child. Immigrant children \nare no exception. Without access to food stamps, some immigrant \nchildren will suffer a lifetime of anemia, stunted growth, and even \npermanent brain damage. This bill is not welfare reform for legal \nimmigrants. It is cruelty written large into law. It will push families \ndeeper into poverty with no chance of escape, and the victims will be \ninnocent children. Shame on the Republican majority in Congress for \nwashing its hands of their plight.\n  This legislation also contains financial penalties for States unable \nto move children on welfare into employment as quickly as the bill \nmandates. Yet the bill refuses to provide the necessary level of job \ntraining support and child care assistance. It is better in child care \nassistance than previous bills, but still short of what is necessary to \nmeet those employment targets.\n  In fact, many of the strongest advocates of this legislation want to \nreduce Federal funding for job training. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that only 10 to 15 of the 50 States will be able to \nmeet the work requirements in the legislation. So, in reality, we are \nsetting up the States to fail, rather than giving them the tools they \nneed to succeed.\n  Another aspect of this legislation which will seriously hurt the \nStates. The funding which each State will receive is not adjusted for \npopulation growth or for the impact of recessions. If the number of \nfamilies legitimately seeking assistance in a State expands, the State \nwill receive no proportional increase in funds. The small contingency \nfund does not even begin to meet the potential need. The State alone \nwill be responsible for meeting the need, often at a time when that \nState is least able to respond.\n  The inevitable result of this legislation on the States will not be \nsensible new flexibility, but enormous new financial pressures. This \nbill can only encourage a race to the bottom, in which States compete \nto have the harshest climate for low income families. Inevitably, \nStates bow to such pressures. They cannot control the national economy. \nCongress is supposed to represent the national interest. We should not \nbe creating an irresponsible system that punishes States which try to \nmeet the needs of their citizens while rewarding those which do not.\n  Americans want genuine welfare reform. But that does not mean they \nwill support this legislation once they look behind the Republican \nbumper sticker slogan. Genuine welfare reform means moving welfare \nrecipients into jobs, while assuring that the basic needs of their \nchildren are met during the transition. This legislation will not \nachieve either of these goals. It will leave many welfare recipients \nunemployable in the real world. It will leave their children ill-fed, \nill-clothed, and ill-housed. This Republican Congress has nothing to be \nproud of for forcing this bill into law.\n  By the votes we cast today, we are not improving the quality of life \nin America. The gap between rich and poor will be wider, the bonds \nwhich tie families together will be weaker, and the dreams of millions \nof children will be farther from reach.\n  The best that can be said about this bad bill is that the day it is \nsigned into law must be the day we roll up our sleeves and start \nworking together to clean up the mess it will bear. I intend to do all \nI can to persuade Congress to act this year to eliminate at least some\n\n[[Page S9347]]\n\nof the most damaging and least responsible provisions in this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I want to say to Senators who want to \nspeak on the welfare bill, clearly we do not have to use our whole hour \nin rebuttal of the Democrats. If there are a few Senators who want to \ncome down and engage in that, fine. If not, we will move to Senators \nlike Senator Smith, who wants to speak on the subject matter before us.\n  Mr. President, to me it is very interesting that, on a bill dealing \nwith welfare and the most fundamental reform of social policy in 60 \nyears, that Democrats want to change the subject. They want to talk \nabout the economy, so let us talk about the economy for awhile.\n  We are all heartened today to hear that the economy grew by 4.2 \npercent in the second quarter. The administration has certainly taken \nan opportunity to champion today's growth. Let me say, however, that \nbefore we get too exhilarated about today's announcement, I think we \nshould look at some of the less rosy economic facts that the \nadministration is not talking about. These are the major reasons why \nAmericans feel insecure about their future.\n  To start with, we have had the weakest recovery of this century \nduring the early 1990's, with growth averaging only 2.5 percent. In \ncontrast, the 1980's recovery recorded average yearly growth of 4.1 \npercent over the same time period. I guarantee, that while this appears \nto be a small difference, it is enormous. It is enormous. The reason \nwhy growth has been comparatively weak is that President Clinton has \nhad the second weakest productivity growth of any President in the last \n50 years, second only to President Carter. Let me repeat, the second-\nlowest productivity growth in 50 years.\n  What that means is that, clearly, those who worry about inflation and \nare fearful of too much growth find some reason to be worried when they \nfind that productivity increases have been so meager during this \nadministration. Without productivity increases, a increase in \nnoninflationary, trend growth is virtually impossible in today's \ndemographic environment.\n  In keeping with weak productivity growth, there has been virtually no \ngain in real wages, virtually no gain in real wages. Real average \nhourly earnings in 1992 were $7.42. Today, they are $7.43, a very big \ngain of 1 cent. No wonder Americans are worried. No wonder we are \nfinding anxiety about the future. No wonder they are saying that we do \nnot think we are on the right path, because they see taxes going up and \naverage real wages being stagnant. Clearly, the gain in real average \nhourly earnings, from 1992's $7.42 to today's $7.43, is nothing. With \nthis backdrop, you can see how today's impressive headline growth \ndoesn't mean anything to ordinary citizens, since the benefits of \ngrowth are not filtering back to them. They just continue to work hard \nand wonder why they are not getting ahead.\n  Wage stagnancy can be seen in another, equally troubling way as well. \nFamily income is stagnating. Despite the ongoing economic recovery, \naverage annual growth in real median family income has been only 0.2 \npercent under President Clinton. Under Ronald Reagan, the growth in \nreal family income was four times as fast.\n\n  Low productivity, stagnant real wages, and lackluster family income \ngrowth strike a louder chord with the American people than does today's \nannouncement. They are wondering what is happening to their economy as \nit applies to their paycheck and their families, and they are not \nimpressed with announcements that say things are getting better and \nthat this growth is phenomenal, when they are feeling the reality of \nwhat I just described: virtually no gain in real wages and stagnating \nfamily incomes.\n  Another point is being missed, and it is very relevant--rising tax \nburdens. This is one of the main reasons for poor productivity growth, \nno gain in real wages, stagnating family incomes. In 1992, the ratio of \nFederal tax revenues to GDP was 18.4 percent; by 1995, this had climbed \nto 19.3 percent.\n  That means that the portion of GDP going to taxes, went up almost 1 \npercent. Those who think the tax increases of the last 3 years are good \nbecause of who they impact and who they do not, still have to answer \nthe questions: What happened to productivity growth? What happened to \nreal wages, that is real average hourly wages? What happened to family \nincomes? By diverting resources from the private sector toward the less \nefficient public sector, there are fewer funds available for household \nsaving and investment. This leads to lower productivity, lower wages \nand lower standards of living for the average citizen.\n  Let's go on to yet another item that ought to temper the enthusiasm \nabout the announcement of a 4.2 percent GDP growth in the last quarter: \nthe lowest personal savings rate in 50 years. As mentioned above, we \nbelieve that the Clinton tax hikes have played a large role in this \ndubious milestone. Everybody believes that for America to increase its \nproductivity, to get the wages up, to get the family incomes up that we \nmust increase our savings so that American business, large and small, \nhave resources to grow with. And yet, we have the lowest personal \nsavings rate in 50 years. This is unsurprising when much of what is \nsaved is taxed away and, thus, personal savings are reduced.\n  Let's look at another one of President Clinton's economic legacies. \nWe now have the worst income inequality in 50 years. So for those who \nthink they solved the problem of income inequality--the highs and the \nlows--by raising taxes and saying we are only raising taxes on the \nhigher brackets, they are in for a great surprise. It does not generate \nmore equality between the low earners and the high earners in America. \nInequality got worse with the tax increase, the largest in American \nhistory, that apparently prides itself in saying it didn't tax \nmoderate-income people, it only taxed the high brackets.\n  What is the purpose of it? The purpose of it, if we have one, is to \nlower the deficit and make us grow more and perhaps bridge the \ninequality gap by letting the wage-earner part of this go up, none of \nwhich happened. The idea is to use a constructive strategy of boosting \ngrowth for the lower and middle income families and not use a \ndestructive strategy of socking it to the rich. I'll say it again, the \nlatter strategy just doesn't fix the grave problem of inequality.\n  Let's also look at soaring trade deficits--this is something not even \nmentioned these days. It goes right along with the bad news that is \nbeing kind of overshadowed by one fact: That for one quarter, the gross \ndomestic product went up some 4.2 percent.\n  The Clinton trade deficit is three times as large as under President \nBush, despite postwar lows in the dollar versus the German mark and the \nJapanese yen that should have created smaller trade deficits. Instead, \nwe got larger deficits. However, given meager levels of U.S. saving, \nthis worsening external position should not surprise us.\n  A byproduct of accumulated trade and current deficits is soaring \nforeign indebtedness. In 1995, foreigners owned $815 billion more of \nour securities than we owned of theirs. This is a 40-percent increase \nsince 1994. This is not a fear today, but over the long run, we are \nplacing our future in the hands of foreign banks. It is even more of a \nworry when we realize that foreign debt service is a net loss to U.S. \nincomes and constitutes a steady mortgaging away of our children's \nfuture living standards.\n  Lastly, I want to turn to jobs. The administration has been \nparticularly proud of their job growth figures. However, the breakdown \nof these jobs is far less encouraging than they suggest. Do you realize \nthat 10 percent of the jobs created under Clinton have been temporary \njobs. These are not good jobs.\n\n[[Page S9348]]\n\nStudies have shown that temporary workers are paid as much as 34 \npercent below their occupational counterparts. This is a way to get \nlower wages, not higher. I even more troubled when I see the type of \njobs that these temporary positions are displacing. Since 1995, 252,000 \nwell-paying manufacturing jobs have been lost. This is why real average \nhourly earnings have been so stagnant under President Clinton. At day's \nend, I have a hard time understanding why the administration is so \npleased with generating jobs that do not generate rising wages.\n  So those who came to the floor bragging about the performance of this \neconomy did not seek to share with the American people the facts about \nthis economy that cause most Americans to say we are not moving in the \nright direction. You can give all the song and dance about what it \nmeans to have an increase in the gross domestic product in the second \nquarter, but if the American people are feeling what I have just \ndescribed--stagnation in real wages; family income extremely stagnant \nand very, very low; increase in general taxes; lowest personal savings \nrate in 50 years--than this growth means nothing to them. It's time to \nbe honest with the American people about these underlying weaknesses in \nthe economy--if we won't admit to them, how can we set out legislation \nto improve them.\n  I submit that the tax increases imposed under President Clinton, for \nall they can talk about the increases in revenues, I submit that that \nis most responsible for all of these negatives that I have stated here. \nI have begun to believe that it is imperative that we understand we \ncannot have increased productivity, real wage gains, family income, \naverage family income going up if we have higher tax rates. We must \nhave lower tax rates if we expect that to occur. We cannot lose sight \nof things we must be doing. But what I have just been describing seems \nto me, having been briefed by many economists, to be the absolute crux \nof why there is such lack of stability and such anxiety among Americans \nbecause of stagnation in their pocketbooks, in their checkbooks.\n  I will yield the floor to any Senator who wants to speak on this \nsubject. I yield as much time as Senator Mack desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida, [Mr. Mack], is \nrecognized for such time as he desires.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Mack, we have five or \nsix Senators who want to speak along with us. We have assigned 10 \nminutes. Is that satisfactory?\n  Mr. MACK. That will be wonderful.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator for yielding \nme this time.\n  I do believe that the issue we are discussing is an important one, \neven though I must admit many folks, when you start talking about \neconomics and the statistics related to that, have a tendency for their \neyes to glaze over. But we are really talking about the engine that \nprovides the hope and opportunity for the future. The engine of growth \nis what will allow for the formation of new businesses and the creation \nof new jobs in America. So the subject is an extremely important one. I \nappreciate the opportunity to address it.\n  Earlier today, a report came out on the growth rate of the economy. \nThat growth rate for the second quarter of the year was stated at 4.2 \npercent, which is good growth, and I think we ought to be pleased with \nwhat has happened.\n  But what the administration is trying to create, or why they are so \nextremely excited about this growth number, really kind of belies the \nother things that they have been saying. Let me try to put that in \nperspective.\n  Earlier this year the President, during his State of the Union \nMessage to a joint session of the Congress, said that this economy is \nthe strongest economy in three decades. Well, if it is the strongest \neconomy in three decades, then there is no reason to be excited about \n4.2 percent growth. We should have been expecting that kind of growth \neach quarter, quarter after each quarter. But that is simply not the \ncase.\n  In fact, I think the numbers will show that for the four previous \nquarters the economic growth was less than 2 percent. That is nothing \nto get excited about. In fact, the effect on the American families is \nsignificant. I will get back to that point in a few minutes.\n  I want to try to put into context what has happened to the economy, \npicking up on the point of 4.2 percent growth. There is a lot of \nexcitement down at the White House about that. But if we look at the \nrate of growth that the economy has experienced since President Clinton \ntook office, it is 2.4 percent, and that is including this new quarter, \n2.4 percent. Keep that figure in mind. I will continue to mention that \nnumber.\n  I will first compare it to the growth the economy was experiencing \nthe year before President Clinton became President. The growth rate of \nthe economy at that time was 3.7 percent. For the last 3\\1/2\\ years the \ngrowth rate in the economy has been 2.4 percent under President \nClinton.\n  You might say that is not a fair reflection to just pick one year and \ncompare the growth in the economy to that one year. Well, let us take \nthe 10 preceding years, the 10 years prior to President Clinton taking \noffice. The growth in the economy was 3.2 percent.\n  President Clinton wants us to believe that he has created the \nstrongest economy in three decades. I believe he is now using the words \nthe ``strongest economy in a generation.'' I remind you again, the \ngrowth under President Clinton is 2.4 percent.\n  Again, somebody might say that that period of time is not a fair \nreflection of what has happened over a period of time. So I will just \nagain focus in on the last five expansions. If you take the last five \nperiods of growth that the country has experienced, we know that that \ngrowth averaged 4.4 percent. Compare that again to the growth of the \nClinton years of 2.4 percent.\n  To go back even further, since World War II the country's growth rate \nhas averaged 3.3 percent. The President of the United States during his \njoint session speech told the American people that this is the \nstrongest economy in 3 decades.\n  But, Mr. President, I really do not have to worry about those numbers \nin really trying to get that message out because I have listened to the \nAmerican people. I have listened to the people in my State. I have \nlistened to the families who are struggling, who are working harder \ntoday and have less to show for it. We all hear it. We hear it in the \nsense of the anxiety that they express. We hear it in the fears they \nhave about the future. We hear it in their concern about their \nchildren, what their opportunity will be as their children grow up.\n  There is a lot of insecurity in America today. I am not sure that a \nlot of Americans have at this point been able to articulate what that \nis. But they know that there is something wrong. They know that they \nhave not reaped the benefits of the ``strongest economy in three \ndecades.'' All my point there is to say that President Clinton may be \nsaying one thing about the economy, but the people in this country \nunderstand that this is just not right. He is not accurate.\n\n  I have one additional chart, which is the first time I have seen \nthis. It is the first time I have used it. It is a chart that has gone \nback to 1870--not 1970--1870. We have charted out every single \nexpansionary period in the U.S. economy since 1870.\n  We have added the growth during the Clinton years. That is this last \nbar. As we look from now all the way back to 1870, this chart indicates \nthat this is not the fastest growing economy, not the strongest economy \nin three decades. It shows it as being the weakest economy in over 100 \nyears. Let me say that again. This is the weakest economy in over 100 \nyears.\n  So, Mr. President, I am making the point that while we should be \npleased that we have experienced some growth in the economy in this \nlast quarter, people should put it in context. There could be some \nreason for excitement if there was a sense that the number that we \nheard this morning would continue into the third quarter and into the \nfourth quarter and into the next year.\n  But that is not what economists are telling us. They are telling us \nthat the second half of this year is in fact going to be weak. It is \ngoing to be somewhere\n\n[[Page S9349]]\n\nin the 2 to 2.5 percent growth range. That is not coming from just one \neconomist. This is coming from a number of different groups of \neconomists. The so-called blue chip forecasts are in the 2.5 percent \nrange. Wall Street Journal, somewhere in the 2 to 2.5 percent range. \nCBO forecasted I believe about 2.5 percent growth through the balance \nof this year.\n  So while there is excitement, I am telling you, Mr. President, this \nis a short-lived excitement. We are going to hear a lot about it from \nthe Clinton administration. But I suggest that the people in this \ncountry understand from their own experiences that this economy is not \nproviding them with the opportunities that they hope for themselves and \nfor their children.\n  I will use one additional graph here. It compares real median \nhousehold income for the period of time from 1983 to 1992. Real median \nhousehold income, $33,119. The Clinton average, 1993, 1994, $32,153, \nalmost $1,000 less. And, yes, these are figures that have taken \ninflation into consideration. On average $1,000 less.\n  We have also calculated out, for example, what would have happened if \nthe growth rate in the economy had been, say, similar to the 10 years \nprior to President Clinton taking office. How would that have affected \nthe average family in America? And do you know what the number is? It \nis $260 a month in loss of income because we are growing at this rate \nversus this rate.\n  That is why the American people are concerned about the future. That \nis why they are worried about their opportunities. You cannot, Mr. \nPresident, layer on American business and American families a whole new \nlayer of more Government, higher taxes, more spending, more Washington \nintrusions, more Washington involvement. You cannot layer all of that \nadditional Washington interference and not expect the economy to slow \ndown.\n  So in conclusion, I say, Mr. President, that the economic policies of \nthe Clinton administration are robbing America of its economic \npotential. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to thank Senator Mack, not only for what he said \ntoday, but his constant vigilance with regard to what is really \nimportant for the average family.\n\n  I think it is pretty clear, would you not agree, that whatever the \ngood news that is being announced on that side of the aisle, that it is \nthe working people and the average families in America that are asking: \nIf that is true, how come nothing is happening to my paycheck? How come \nnothing is happening to my family income, which is in stagnation? Those \nare the issues causing the anxiety out there. Am I correct in that?\n  Mr. MACK. I say to the Senator, I think you are absolutely correct. \nIf you will give me just a moment to tell one little story.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Please.\n  Mr. MACK. I think it reflects on the feelings of lots of Americans. I \nthink about the family where both the husband and wife work and get up \nway before dawn, and in our large cities in America, commuting for a \nlong period of time to get to work, working all day, both of them, \ngetting back home after dark. The only time that they have off, the \nweekends, if things go right. And they see all of their resources being \ntaxed by every level of government.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You got it.\n  Mr. MACK. For programs and services they believe have failed and do \nnot work. And they are tired of it. And they are not feeling what one \nwould expect would be the results of the fastest growing economy in 3 \ndecades.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before the Senator arrived we spoke of stagnant family \nincome. That is what is causing the anxiety.\n  Real median family income was virtually motionless from 1992 to 1994. \nThat is the last year for which we have data available. Under President \nClinton, it has risen only two-tenths of a percent per year on average. \nFamily income is below the level that it was in 1991 under President \nBush. During the Reagan tenure, yearly family income growth was four \ntimes as fast. That might account for a poll back then saying people \nthought we were on the right track and a poll today saying they think \nwe are on the wrong track.\n  Does that seem to be a correct analysis?\n  Mr. MACK. Absolutely. What concerns me is that most people do not \nknow or have not been told that during the Reagan years, in which we \ntried to reduce the size and scope of Government to reduce the tax \nburden, providing incentives for business creation and capital \nincentive, that during those years family incomes went up. They went up \nconsistently.\n  I can remember our former colleague, Senator Wirth, teaming up with \nnow-Vice President Gore, coming to the floor and talking about this \ntragedy that has occurred in America from roughly 1973 to 1992, just \ntalking about from one point to the next point, how incomes had gone \ndown, but refused to tell people that during the Reagan years, those 7 \nyears of growth, that American families were better off and American \nworkers were better off.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Bennett, I believe, was next, and we have \nreserved 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah, Senator Bennett, is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President. I do not want to repeat some \nof the arguments that have been made, but I want to talk about one \naspect of the numbers that have been discussed today so glowingly \ndescribed by the President.\n  They look upon the last quarter and say, ``Isn't this magnificent? We \nare growing at over 4 percent a year.'' And I agree that a quarter in \nthat atmosphere is a wonderful thing.\n  What were they saying just two quarters ago when they were growing at \n0.3 percent a year? One quarter does not control what happens in a \nyear. It can be a seasonable circumstance. It can respond to any one of \nthe series of one-time events. You need to look at things over time.\n  I would like to look at one number over time that we have been \nhearing about in the Clinton administration crowing about the \ntremendous economic performance, and that is taxes. We all know that \nPresident Clinton made raising taxes the centerpiece of his economic \nprogram. He promised when he ran in 1992 that he would cut taxes. But \nhe said when he got into office: I have suddenly discovered that things \nare far worse than I ever recognized, much worse than I realized. I not \nonly cannot deliver on my promise to cut tax rates, I must give you \nincreased tax rates, or the economy is going to be destroyed. So we had \nincreased tax rates in the United States. He is now saying: Well, you \nsee, because I had the wisdom and the courage to raise tax rates, we \nare getting all this tremendous revenue, and now I am responsible for \nthe fact the deficit is coming down.\n  I point out a few things. If we go back to the last year in which the \nReagan tax structure was in place, which was 1989, taxes from \nindividuals were producing revenue to the Government at the rate of 8.6 \npercent of our gross domestic product. Then President Bush broke his \ntax pledge, and we had the tax increase in rates from President Bush. \nThen Mr. Clinton broke his tax pledge, and we had the increase in \nrates. What happened to revenue? Revenue as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product went down, Mr. President--not up, down--from 8.6, \nwhere it had been in 1989, down to 8 percent. It started to come back \nup in 1995. It was 8.4--still not as good as we had during the Reagan \nyears, but coming back a little.\n\n  How is it possible, people say to me, that when you raise rates you \nsee revenue go down? Stop and think about what happens in the real \nworld all the time. I use the example of Ford Motor. They introduced \nwhat they thought was a marvelous new car, the Ford Taurus. They \nthought there would be so much demand for it they could raise rates. \nThey call them ``prices,'' but since we are talking about Government we \nwill use ``rates.'' They will raise the rates on the new car. It hit \nthe marketplace. The marketplace reacted by not buying Tauruses. What \ndid Ford do? They lowered the rates and increased their sales and \nthereby increased the revenue that they were getting from the sale of \nthe introduction of that new model.\n  Around here we do not understand that principle. But every \nbusinessman in the United States understands it and uses it every day. \nYou raise your\n\n[[Page S9350]]\n\nprices, you lower your prices, depending on what the market tells you. \nHere we just feed the numbers into the computer, and whatever the \ncomputer tells us, we say that is automatically the way it is going to \nbe.\n  So President Bush, and then President Clinton, raised tax rates only \nto see revenue as a percentage of the economy go down, and even now in \nthis wonderful report the President gives us, the tax revenue has not \nyet gotten back to the level that it was prior to the time when they \ntold us that increased taxes were good for us.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that increased tax rates are good for \nus. I think what we should focus on in the Government is tax revenue, \nhow much money we get in from the economy in order to pay our bills and \ndeal with the deficit. I recommend we go back to the revenue levels \nthat we were getting in the days of the Ronald Reagan circumstance when \nwe were getting 8.6 percent of the gross domestic product coming from \nindividual taxpayers, rather than the anemic 8 percent we hit in the \nClinton administration.\n  Referring to the charts quoted by my friend from Florida, Senator \nMack, the increase has been the lowest of any expansion we have had. \nJust think, Mr. President, what we would have in terms of revenue for \nthe Government and relief from the budget deficit if we had had a \nhistoric rate of growth in this expansion and 8.6 percent of that \ncoming in in the form of revenue. We would be better off than the \nClintons are claiming we are today.\n  Do not get carried away with a single order or with rhetoric in an \nelection year. Keep our understanding on the historic pattern that \ntells us the best way to see growth in our economy is when we have tax \nrates that allow Americans to earn more and then to keep more so they \ncan do more in their own lives, instead of having Government make all \nof the decisions. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  First, let me address the good news. Yes, the good news that we \nreceived this morning from the Commerce Department is that the GDP for \nthe second quarter of this year is a strong 4.2 percent. This is up \nfrom the anemic growth rate of 0.3 percent in the last quarter 1995, \nand the first quarter 1996 growth rate of 2 percent.\n  However, Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues that the average \ngrowth rate since 1990 is a weak 1.9 percent. This is, in my opinion, \nunacceptable.\n  Let me refer my colleagues to a Business Week cover story in their \nJuly 8, 1996, edition. The cover reads ``Economic Growth--Don't be \nfooled by today's strong statistics. And don't be suckered by the \npolitical rhetoric. America needs faster growth.''\n  While the Business Week feature story goes on to outline their \nproposals for stronger growth, they highlight critical issues that we \nmust address; namely, increasing savings and investment, balancing the \nbudget, and reforming the Tax Code. Mr. President, it is the \nRepublicans in Congress who have addressed these issues and will \ncontinue to fight for real tax reform in the coming years.\n  Also, a few weeks ago the Office of Management and Budget's new \nestimates of the deficit for fiscal year 1996 is $117 billion, down \nfrom the $211 billion target that Bill Clinton called for in his \nbudget. The deficit is down because a Republican Congress forced the \nPresident to control spending. Despite five Presidential vetoes--\nremember those vetoes--congressional Republicans successfully managed \nto rescind nearly $40 billion in domestic discretionary spending from \nthis administration's top-heavy budget.\n\n  This represents a good start, but it is only a start. Had Bill \nClinton not been so wild with the veto pen--had he not vetoed the \nbalanced budget amendment--we'd be even farther down the road. The \ndeficit reduction we're celebrating is for the short term.\n  Long-term trends show increasing deficits. They show an upward trend, \nand Congress--along with the President--have a responsibility to \nreverse deficit growth.\n  Toward this end, our objective must go beyond controlling the \nspending side of the equation. Excessive taxation is as dangerous to \nthe welfare of American families as is excessive spending, perhaps even \nmore so.\n  These dangerous trends must be reversed. We are moving in the right \ndirection to control Federal spending, now we must also push for tax \nreform to strengthen the economy.\n  Make no mistake about my feelings on this debate. I'm on record as a \nproponent of meaningful tax cuts, and this will be the direction I \nintend to move.\n  Holding the line on spending and stimulating optimal economic growth \nthrough responsible tax reform are the only ways that we will \neffectively find the resources and means necessary to meet the \nchallenges and the enjoy the opportunities the future has to offer.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for making \nthis time available to talk about this important matter this afternoon. \nI was reminded of the fabler, Stephen Leacock, who wrote the story \nabout the fleas riding on the back of a chariot. They looked back and \nsaid, ``My, what a fine cloud of dust we have made.'' It seems to me \nthat Bill Clinton's crowing about the latest GDP figures is analogous. \nIf it were not for the Republican Congress, as Senator Roth just \npointed out, ensuring that the budget deficit went down to the extent \nit did, we would not have these GDP figures that begin to show some \npromise. As Senator Roth pointed out, if the President had not vetoed \nthe balanced budget we sent up, the figures would be even better. So I \ndon't think this is the time for the President to be crowing.\n  There is another point here, too, Mr. President. We should be very \nleery of these preliminary statistics. It has been pointed out that the \nfirst-quarter GDP figures this year were actually overrated by 21 \npercent. The correct number was 2.2 percent growth. But they were \noriginally estimated at 2.8 percent. So we need to be a little cautious \nabout bragging too much about the figures before they are verified.\n  Third, as has been pointed out before in this debate, the overall \neconomic performance during the Clinton administration is very poor. It \nis an annual growth rate of 2.3 percent, compared, for example, with \n3.7 percent growth the year before the President took office. If you \ntake the entire decade before he took office, it was 3.2 percent. So \nthe President has very little to crow about with respect to the overall \nperformance of the economy.\n  There is a final and most important point here, though, that I think \nneeds to be addressed. The Senator from Utah, Senator Bennett, made the \npoint a moment ago. It has to do with the plight of the average \nAmerican. We can quote these GDP statistics all we want. But what about \nthe average American family? How does all of this affect them? The fact \nof the matter is that the average American family is not doing so good. \nThe news there is not good. Households have lost, not gained, $2,100 in \ntake-home pay during the 1990's. That is a 5-percent decline. If you \nlook at the 1980's, families increased their income by 11 percent, or \n$4,100. That was the increase in median family income during the \n1980's, mostly the Reagan decade, but the first part of the Bush \nadministration as well.\n  If you look at the Clinton decade, the 1990's, median household \nincome has actually dropped $2,100. So it is fine for the GDP to be \nfinally showing some strength, but in terms of the average American \nfamily, it has not yet translated into a benefit to them.\n  In the 1990's, by the way, it is the rich who have been gaining, to \nthe extent that there is any gain, and not the middle- and lower-income \nworkers. Consumer debt has hit an all-time high of just over $1 \ntrillion--a 44-percent increase during the Clinton years.\n  Personal bankruptcies were at an all-time high last year. Why is \nthis? Because of the Clinton crunch, Mr. President, and the \nhistorically high tax rates. Americans today are paying the highest \npercentage of taxes in the peacetime history of the Nation--38.2 \npercent. I think it bears repeating that this is the highest percentage \nof their income that Americans have paid in taxes during peacetime in \nthis country's history.\n  That is the Clinton crunch. That is why the GDP statistics, as good \nas they may be, are not being translated into benefit for the average \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S9351]]\n\nfamily. The stagnation of wages and incomes and the economic anxiety \npeople feel is the result of three things--the weak performance of the \neconomy under President Clinton, high taxes, and the burdensome \nregulation of the Clinton administration. These are what have hindered \npeople's ability to get ahead.\n\n  Just a month ago, on July 4, we celebrated Independence Day in this \ncountry. I would note that July 3 is also ``independence day'' for the \npeople in this country, because, until July 3, Americans literally had \nbeen working for the Government. In other words, if they had applied \nall of their income to taxes, it would not have been until July 3 that \nthey would have fulfilled all of their tax obligations. From then on, \nthey began working for themselves.\n  So it is really the Clinton crunch that has caused so many problems \nfor American families. Until we can (a) get the economy moving again, \nand (b) reduce this burden of regulation and taxation on the American \npeople, these generalized statistics are not going to translate into \nany real benefit for the average American family.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield Senator Abraham 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I, too, would like to put into \nperspective the statements made earlier today on the other side of the \naisle relating to the economy. While it may be true that in this one \nquarter, growth statistics are up; the fact is, for this Presidency, as \nwas clearly documented by the Senator from Florida earlier, growth has \nbeen anemic, 2.3 percent, the lowest economic growth for any recovery \nin this country, literally, in this century.\n  What is also important, as was pointed out, is the fact that the \nmedian family income of America's working families has stayed stagnant. \nWhat has not stayed stagnant is the rate of taxes paid by those average \nfamilies. That has been going up, as the Senator just indicated, to an \nall-time record high of over 20 percent. That is why American families \nare feeling a squeeze. They are working harder, their incomes are not \ngoing up, but their Federal taxes are going up. We need to address \nthat, Mr. President.\n  Now, earlier today, we heard from the other side of the aisle several \ncritics of letting Americans keep more of what they earn. Tax cuts were \ncriticized. It is not surprising that it came from the other side of \nthe aisle; it is the other side of this aisle that voted in 1993 for \nthe largest tax increase in the history of this country.\n  Let us talk about the kind of tax cuts that can help America's \nfamilies, like those we saw in the 1960's under a Democratic Presidency \nand in the 1980's under a Republican Presidency. Those tax cuts \nstimulated economic growth and created millions of jobs for working \nAmericans. Those tax cuts also stimulated the chance for this economy \nto grow, and grow at record rates.\n  In the 1980's we saw economic growth that greatly eclipsed what we \nare seeing this year. It is interesting. Notwithstanding the criticism \nthat was leveled earlier at those tax cuts, and notwithstanding the \nmyths that have been created about those tax cuts, the truth is those \ntax cuts did stimulate far greater revenue to the Federal Government \nfrom taxpaying Americans, because the economy did grow, and it grew at \nrecord levels, especially during the 1980's.\n  It is interesting also as to who paid those increased taxes. It was \npeople at the highest ends of the income spectrum who, freed from the \nhigh-tax burdens, decided to invest and risk their dollars in creating \nnew jobs and economic growth. That is what we had. We had economic \ngrowth. We had more jobs, and we had higher tax revenues to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Interestingly, in the 1990's when tax rates were raised, upper income \ngroups are paying less and lower and middle-income groups are paying \nmore because the upper income groups have found ways to shelter their \nincome to avoid taxation. In the 1980's they did not do it. They used \ntheir moneys to create jobs and opportunity, and paid more taxes.\n  The other myth that I think needs to be exploded here today is the \nmyth that somehow cutting taxes created the deficits that we had in the \n1980's. The fact is, revenues increased during the 1980's after the tax \ncuts by approximately 56 percent. What increased faster was Federal \nspending in virtually every dimension by almost 70 percent. That \ndifferential, Mr. President, is the reason we saw deficits increase--\ndeficits increase--under a Democratic-controlled House of \nRepresentatives.\n  So, Mr. President, let us put this in perspective. Under this \nPresidency, median family income has remained stagnant while taxes have \ngone up. Under this Presidency, the growth rate has been the most \nanemic in any recovery of the Nation's history over the past century. \nThat is not a track record of great accomplishment no matter how much \nit is sugar-coated.\n  What we need to do is to give the working families of this country a \nchance to really keep up with the needs that they have by being allowed \nto keep more of what they earn, and a chance for the people who create \njobs and opportunity to have the incentives to invest, to risk and to \ncreate entrepreneurial activity that will give us the jobs we need for \nthe balance of this century and the next.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia, Mr. Coverdell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as everyone has said here this morning, \nwe have had a trail of good news from the other side on the economy. I \ngo back to a quote:\n\n       We have the most solid American economy in a generation.\n\n  That was President Clinton's remark on July 6 of 1996. But perhaps of \nequal standing, perhaps even more, are these quotes. I have heard so \nmuch on this side of the aisle about what the real status of the \neconomy is, but I have been taken with the remarks on the economy from \nthe other side of the aisle:\n\n       We have an anemic rate of economic growth.\n\n  I repeat:\n\n       We have an anemic rate of economic growth.\n\n  Senator Byron Dorgan on June 20, 1996, in the Congressional Record. \nOr how about this one:\n\n       When I go home, I hear a lot of anxiety from farmers, small \n     business people and families just trying to make a living \n     wage. In fact, wages have stagnated. For many middle class \n     working families, every year it seems harder and harder to \n     make ends meet.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the statement of Senator Tom Daschle, the \nminority leader, and that statement was made on June 20, 1996.\n  Here is another:\n\n       Even though some Clinton administration economic advisers \n     have begun to highlight certain positive economic news, it is \n     still true that for many, especially low and moderate income \n     working people, the economic recovery is spotty, partial and \n     has failed to increase their real take home pay.\n\n  That is Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, May 2, 1996.\n  Here is another one:\n\n       We all know that the American people are anxious about \n     their economic future. They are worried about the security of \n     their jobs and their ability to take care of their families.\n\n  That is Senator Joe Lieberman, the colleague of Senator Dodd, who is \non the floor. That was a statement made on May 17, 1996.\n  Daschle, Wellstone, Lieberman, Dorgan, all contemporary statements \nreflecting anxiousness and anxiety among the average working families \nin America, and they are right. In a recent article in the Washington \nTimes, we read that last month 63 percent of the American people said \nthe country was on the wrong track compared with only 24 percent who \nthought it was on the right track. It says:\n\n       A lot of people say their income is not keeping them ahead \n     of the cost of living. Only 10 to 15 percent say they are \n     doing better.\n\n  So the remarks by Dorgan, Daschle, Lieberman, and Wellstone are right \non the mark. The middle class, the average working family does not feel \nvery good today. Why would that be? I can tell you one reason, Mr. \nPresident. It is because their checking account has $2,000 to $3,000 \nless since President Clinton came to office than they had in that \naccount before he came to office.\n  I might add, that is about a 7 percent reduction in their disposable \nincome. The average Georgia family today has to forfeit over half its \nwages to one\n\n[[Page S9352]]\n\ngovernment or another now, over half. If Thomas Jefferson were here \ntoday, he would roll into his grave that it would ever come to the \npoint that over half a family's income is being consumed by the \nFederal, State, or local government. And here we are, with this \nadministration having taken another $2,000 to $3,000 out of a family \nwho only has about $25,000 of disposable income. That is like a 10 \npercent reduction in their disposable income in just 36 months. So it \ndoes not take a rocket scientist to figure out why there is so much \nanxiety in the working family. They have less to work with. The median \nhousehold income has declined from $33,119 to $32,000.\n  Job lock: Anemic economic growth has frozen many workers into jobs \nthey would like to leave for better employment, but they are afraid \nthose jobs will not be there if they try to go someplace else.\n  Or how about credit cards? The delinquent payments on credit cards, \nwhich is a real consumer-connected device across our country, are the \nworst they have ever been in 50 years. Why? Because we have, by Federal \npolicy, pushed the average family to the wall. And the policies of this \nadministration have created the anemic economy, just as Senator Daschle \nhas alluded to. Those policies have reduced the disposable income in \nthat family's checking account and they have made middle America very \nworried.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, but for the strength, determination and \nleadership of the Republicans in the Congress--and I am referring to \nthis and past Congresses--we would not today have a better budget \nsituation or have an article like the one which was printed in the Wall \nStreet Journal this morning.\n  But for the economic wisdom of the Federal Reserve and the steady \nguiding hand of its chairman, Alan Greenspan, we would not today have \nthe economic footing that we need to be closer to a balanced budget \nthan we have been in recent years.\n  There are two facts of economic life. One is that Republicans have \nbeen more steadfast and committed to balancing the budget than has the \nPresident. I remind my colleagues of the vetoes he issued on our \nattempts to balance the budget last year. But for our steadfastness and \ncommitment to this goal, but for Republican leadership, this President \nwould be no where near to working on a balanced budget.\n  The second is a fact that this Senator addressed during Chairman \nGreenspan's confirmation. The Federal Reserve has played, and continues \nto play, a crucial role in stabilizing the economy and maintaining \ninvestor confidence in the face of big spending Congresses. This \nconfidence has lead to increased participation by some Americans in the \nstock market. This increased capital investment is what has led to new \njobs, and expansion.\n  The President has raised taxes, though. The Clinton tax increases \nhave taken away from all Americans' ability to take care of their \nfamilies. The Clinton tax increases have decreased the amount of money \nwhich mothers and fathers have to buy necessities for their children. \nThis is wrong.\n  Several of my colleagues have very accurately described the reality \nof the so-called Clinton economic growth rate. I wish to associate \nmyself with their remarks. The charts which they have shown the Senate \ndepict an economy which is not growing as fast as past economic \nexpansions. In fact one of the charts show that this is the weakest \neconomy in 100 years.\n  Another of the charts clearly shows what has happened to real medium \nhousehold income. It has decreased. As the Senator from Florida pointed \nout, real medium household income in the years between 1983-1992 was \n$33,119. During the Clinton years of 1993-1994 real median household \nincome dropped to $32,153.\n  No wonder American workers are concerned about their future. This \ndrop in income hurts hard working Americans.\n  Let us continue to reform Government programs, as we are with this \nwelfare reform legislation. And let us continue our efforts in Congress \nto balance the budget. This is true economic stimulation. This will \nlead to real economic growth. This will put more money into the pockets \nof Americans.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Excuse me, I thought I had 10 minutes on welfare.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. We are running a little behind. We would appreciate it \nif you could keep it--\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me just reschedule time to talk about \nwelfare.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. If the Senator would like to be yielded 10 minutes, why \ndon't we start, instead of just talking about it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is an incredible paradox that while \ntoday we celebrate one of the most dramatic legislative victories \ncertainly in this Congress and in the last decade, we are here \nresponding to our Democratic colleagues who came over to give us a \nlesson in perverted economics this morning. They tell us how things are \ngreat because they had the courage to raise taxes, and if only we had \nraised taxes more and spent more, things would even be better. I \npersonally do not believe the American people are going to adopt that \nbrand of economics.\n  I would simply like to say that if we had not raised taxes in 1993, \nbut rather had cut spending and adopted the balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution, the economy would be stronger, and we would not be \nhaving an economic recovery, which happens to be one of the weakest \neconomic recoveries in any postwar period.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9347-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9352-S9386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORK OPPORTUNITY RECONCILIATION ACT OF \n                        1996--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me now talk about welfare. We are going \nto pass here in the Senate tonight a welfare reform bill that has the \npromise of dramatically changing a system which has failed in America. \nLet me begin by talking about the failure.\n  In the past 30 years, we have spent $5.4 trillion on welfare \nprograms; programs where we were trying to help poor people. Nobody in \nAmerica knows what a trillion dollars is. So let me try to put that \nnumber in perspective.\n  If you take the total value of all buildings, all plants and \nequipment, and all productive tools in American industry and \nagriculture combined, they are worth about $5 trillion.\n  So if you want to know how much we have invested in the old welfare \nprogram over the past 30 years, it is roughly the equivalent of the \nvalue of all buildings, all plants and equipment, and all of the tools \nof all the workers in the United States of America. No society in \nhistory has ever invested more money trying to help needy people than \nthe United States of America has invested.\n  Yet, what has been the result of all of those good intentions? What \nhas been the result of that investment? The result of that investment, \n30 years later, is that we have as many poor people today as we had 30 \nyears ago. They are poorer today, they are more dependent on the \nGovernment today, and by any definition of quality of life, \nfulfillment, or happiness, people are worse off today than they were \nwhen we started the current welfare system.\n  When we started the War on Poverty in the mid-1960s, two-parent \nfamilies were the norm in poor families in America. Today, two-parent \nfamilies are the exception. Since 1965, the illegitimacy rate has \ntripled.\n  I know that we have colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are \ngoing to lament the passage of this new welfare reform bill. But I do \nnot see how anybody with a straight face, or a clear conscience, can \ndefend the status quo in welfare. Our current welfare program has \nfailed. It has driven fathers out of the household. It has made mothers \ndependent. It has taken away people's dignity. It has bred child abuse \nand neglect, and filled the streets of our cities with crime. And we \nare here today to change it.\n  Let me outline what our program does. I think if each of us looks \nback to a period when our ancestors first came to America, or back to a \ntime when those who have gone before us found themselves poor, we are \ngoing to find that there are two things that get individuals and \nnations out of poverty.\n\n[[Page S9353]]\n\n Those two things are work and family. I think it is instructive to \nnote that those are the two things that we have never applied to the \ncurrent welfare program of the United States of America.\n  The bill before us asks people to work. It says that able-bodied men \nand women will be required to work in order to receive benefits. It \nsets a time limit so that people cannot make welfare a way of life. It \nseeks to change the incentives within the welfare system. And I believe \nthe time has come to change those incentives within the welfare system.\n  So what we have done in adopting this bill is make some very simple \nchanges. No. 1, we have said that unless you are disabled, welfare is \nnot a permanent program. It is a temporary program. We are going to \nhelp you for up to 5 years. We are going to train you. But at the end \nof 5 years, you are going to have to work.\n  We have also in this program given the States the ability to run \ntheir own programs. We believe that the Federal Government does not \nhave all the wisdom in the world, and that States should run welfare. \nWhat we have done is we have taken a federally-run program, we have \ntaken the funds that we have spent on that program, and we have given \nthat money to the States so that, rather than have one program, each \nState in the Union can tailor its program to meet its individual needs.\n  I believe that we have put together a positive program. It is a \nprogram that asks people to work. It is a program that tries to make \nAmericans independent. It is a program that for the first time uses \nwork and family to help families in America escape welfare and to \nescape poverty. I think this is a major achievement. I am very proud of \nthis bill, and I hope we can get a sound vote for it.\n  I know there will be those who say that the President, in committing \nto sign this bill, is going to end up taking credit for it. I do not \nbelieve the American people care who gets credit for this bill. We know \nthat had there been no Republican majority in both Houses of Congress, \nwe would never have passed this bill. We know that without a Republican \nmajority in both Houses of Congress, we would not have a mandatory work \nrequirement. We would not be changing welfare as we know it. But it \nseems to me that the return we are going to get for adopting this bill \nis worth letting the President take a substantial amount of credit for \nit.\n  I think this is a major step in the right direction. I am very proud \nof this bill. I commend it to my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me reflect, if I might, not only on \nthe economy but more particularly as to the impact, the adverse impact \nthat the brutal welfare program--brutal, one that entraps people--has \nhad on this country. It has not been beneficial. We have seen welfare \nspending move from approximately $29 billion in 1980 to something in \nthe area of $128 billion today. Incredible. This is a program that was \nintended to help people temporarily, those people who were disabled, \nthose people who, through no fault of their own, found themselves \nwithout a job.\n\n       The lessons of history, confirmed by the evidence \n     immediately before me, show conclusively that continued \n     dependence upon relief induces a spiritual and moral \n     disintegration fundamentally destructive to the national \n     fiber. To dole out relief in this way is to administer a \n     narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit. It is in \n     violation of the traditions of America.\n\n  Mr. President, those were the words spoken by Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt when President Roosevelt gave his second annual message to \nthe people on January 4, 1935. Indeed, how prophetic; 60 years later we \nsee his admonition that where welfare becomes a long-term program, it \nis fundamentally destructive to the national fiber, and that it is a \nnarcotic to the human spirit, and it is a violation of the traditions \nof America.\n  That is exactly what the welfare programs have done to this country. \nAnd let me say, as difficult as is the political process of campaigns \nand elections, thank God it is an election year; there is one good \nthing that has come about, and that is welfare reform.\n  Let me also suggest that without there having been a Republican \nCongress pushing, working, challenging, there is no way that we would \nhave had any opportunity to pass a bill. And to those who are critical \nof the reform, let me say that no bill is perfect, but to continue \nbusiness as usual, as if all is well, would have been a kind of \nconspiracy, a conspiracy to continue to keep our people on that \nnarcotic. Absolutely not acceptable.\n  I have to tell you, if you want to get this economy going, then we \nhave to give educational opportunity a helping hand and move people who \nhave become dependent, dependent upon that welfare narcotic, that drug, \nthat drug that President Roosevelt warned us about, off of the welfare \nrolls into a system of work.\n  To those of my colleagues who have legitimate concerns that there may \nbe some imperfections, we will deal with those. We have the ability to \nfix them. We have the ability to make the bill a better bill. But to do \nnothing, to sit back, to languish in the bureaucracy of entrapping \npeople, keeping people from meeting the opportunities that this country \nhas of freedom, real freedom, freedom to participate, freedom to \nundertake a challenge, is morally destructive and is wrong. This change \nis long overdue.\n  So if there this is anything good that comes from those elections and \nthe partisanship back and forth and the bickering, I say this welfare \nreform, in my mind, would never have taken place--never, never have \ntaken place were it not for this election.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to have worked for this program. \nWorkfare, not welfare, is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New Hampshire for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from New York could \nmake that 10 minutes?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the \nwelfare reform bill, H.R. 3734, that is before the Senate at this time. \nThis is historic legislation that the Senate later will be passing by \nan overwhelming majority--a bipartisan majority, I might add. There \nwill be some who will be voting for this today because they are caught \nup in the wave of welfare reform and there will be others of us who \nwill be voting for it because we caused the wave. But it really does \nnot matter because the result will be the same. This Republican \nCongress has gotten it done. After all the years and years of talk, we \nhave finally gotten it done. We sent the President two bills. He vetoed \nboth of them. This is the third attempt. He now says he will sign it.\n  The Senator from New York has already quoted President Franklin \nRoosevelt who, in 1935, talked about what welfare, or in those days \nthey called it relief, does to a society and does to a family. It does \ndestroy the human spirit and it is a violation of the traditions of \nAmerica, as Franklin Roosevelt correctly said in 1935.\n  Mr. President, in terms of welfare, we did declare a war on poverty, \nand poverty won. That is the problem. This program has not worked. When \nsomething does not work, we have to try something new. It does not mean \nwe say we have all the answers, but it does mean we have to try.\n  In 1965, per capita welfare spending was $197. By 1993, per capita \nwelfare spending was $1,255. That is a 600-percent increase. For all \nthis increased spending, have we seen a corresponding drop in poverty? \nNo, we have not. In 1965, 17 percent of Americans lived in poverty. In \n1993 it is a little over 15 percent, barely a change. So we need to try \nsomething new, which is why this Republican Party has fought so hard to \nmake these changes.\n  This is historic because it ends a 60-year status of welfare as a \nFederal cash entitlement. As a result, once this bill becomes law, no \nperson will be able to choose welfare as a way of life. And no person \nwill be entitled to cash benefits from the Federal Government simply \nbecause he or she chooses not to work.\n  It is amazing some of my colleagues can defend this failed system, \nwhere people who make $18,000 or $19,000 a year, working hard with \ntheir bare\n\n[[Page S9354]]\n\nhands to make just enough money to put food on their tables and pay \ntaxes, we should ask those people to continue paying forever for \nsomebody who won't work. Won't--not can't, won't. Because that is what \nwelfare is all about.\n  Yes, there are some who cannot and they are not going to slip through \nthe net. It is the ones who won't work. Yet, time after time after \ntime, speaker after speaker after speaker in this body has defended \nthis system, saying people who work hard for a living, trying to put \nfood on the table, trying to pay their mortgages, trying to get their \nkids through college, working hard, paying their taxes--honest, hard-\nworking Americans--should continue to pay for people who won't work.\n  We are changing it. That is why this is historic. The President, in \nannouncing he was going to sign this bill, kind of apologized for \nsigning it, if you listen to his remarks. But again, the result is the \nsame. He is going to sign it. We will get the results. So I give him \ncredit for signing it. It took him a little while to get there, but he \nis there.\n  As the Senator from Texas said a few moments ago, ask yourself this \nquestion. Would we have welfare reform, would we have workfare today, \nwere it not for people in a Republican Congress who pushed and pushed \nand pushed to get it through this Congress and into the White House \nwhere the President can sign it? I think the answer is: Obviously, no, \nwe would not have. By dramatically cutting the Federal welfare \nbureaucracy and replacing it with block grants to the States, this bill \nrecognizes the best hope for making welfare programs successful lies in \nshifting major responsibilities for their administration to a level of \ngovernment where innovation and experimentation can flourish. This is a \ngiant step toward reinvigorating federalism in our system of \nGovernment.\n  I heard the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, earlier in \nthe debate, talking as if somehow all these people were going to slip \nthrough the safety nets because the Federal Government no longer is \nassuming responsibility. We all know that we have 50 Governors out \nthere, frankly, Democrats and Republicans--I have confidence in those \npeople. I do not think any Governor in any State in the Union is going \nto put a starving child on the street. I will believe that when I see \nit. That is not going to happen and we all know it. It is an outrage to \ndefine this welfare reform in those kinds of terms.\n  Governor Steve Merrill, the Governor of New Hampshire, using my State \nas an example, is a compassionate, decent man and a good Governor. He \nis not going to let that happen. I want him to have this program. I \nwant him to be able to administer this program, this block grant, \nbecause in the State of New Hampshire, Governor Merrill and the \nlegislature and the others who work every day in these welfare \nprograms, know who the needy people are. They also know how to help \nthem find work. That is compassion and it is compassion at the local \nlevel, where it should be. Because people in Washington, DC, do not \nknow all the answers, in case you have not figured that out yet.\n\n  No Governor is going to let a child starve and it is an outrage and \nan insult for anybody to even insinuate it rather than say it. Our \nGovernors have been leading the way, from both parties. President \nClinton, when he was Governor, talked about welfare reform and as a \nPresidential candidate said he would end welfare as we know it. He knew \nthen as a Governor it was not working, which is why he spoke out about \nit. This is landmark legislation. This is dramatic. This is the kind of \nthing that I have been working on for all the years that I have been in \nCongress, and I am so happy just to see it come to fruition.\n  I am going to be pleased and proud to work with Governor Merrill and \nsee that this program is administered properly to help the people in \nthe State who need help.\n  This is a huge accomplishment just to get this bill through this \nSenate and the House and on the President's desk.\n  Mr. President, this bill transforms welfare from a handout that \nfosters dependency into a temporary helping hand for those who fall on \nhard times. It places a 5-year lifetime limit on receiving welfare \nbenefits and requires able-bodied adults to work after 2 years.\n  Surely after 5 years, an able-bodied individual can find a job. Of \ncourse, they can find a job, if you want to find a job. But you are not \ngoing to want to find a job if somebody is taking care of you all the \ntime.\n  When I was a kid, I had a favorite uncle, Uncle George. He used to \nsell toys, and I used to look forward to Uncle George coming around \nwith toys. My family at sometime would say, ``If Uncle George keeps \ncoming around, we won't have to buy toys for little Bobby,'' because \nthey expected it.\n  Where is the respect for the people who are paying the bills? It is \nnot the Federal Government paying these bills for people who will not \nwork. It is the taxpayers. It is the hard-working men and women across \nAmerica who work hard for a living. There is no reason why this is an \nentitlement for somebody who does not work.\n  There is not a person out in America today who does not have the \ncompassion in their heart to help somebody who needs help. We see it \nevery time there is a tragedy. Whether it is the TWA bombing, a flood, \nearthquake, American people are always stepping forward in a \ncompassionate, helpful way to help their fellow man. It happens every \nday. It is happening now, and it is not going to stop because we pass a \nbill that says people who will not work cannot get benefits for the \nrest of their lives.\n  Mr. President, another very important point here is that this bill \ncracks down on the so-called deadbeat dad by requiring that father to \npay child support, and it mandates that welfare applicants must assist \nin establishing the paternity of their children in order to qualify for \ntheir benefits.\n  What is wrong with that? That is responsibility, Mr. President.\n  I am also pleased that this bill takes a number of steps toward \nending the abuse of the welfare system by those legal immigrants who \ncome to America, not to go to work but to go on welfare. That is not \ntrue with every person who comes to America, it is not true with most \npeople who come to America, but it is true with some, and they ought \nnot to be getting welfare benefits if they are not an American citizen \nwhile Americans who are working hard, trying to pay their bills are \nproviding it. That is simply wrong. It ought to stop, and this bill \ndoes stop it. But it also provides when you are sponsored, the sponsor \ncan assume some responsibility for you. If they want to bring you to \nAmerica, they can assume some responsibility. That is what built this \ncountry--responsibility, not running away from it.\n  Deeming is a good policy. Noncitizens, after all, remain, by \ndefinition, citizens of other countries. They should not, in all \nfairness, expect to be supported by Americans who are not their fellow \ncitizens.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, H.R. 3734 provides a total of $22 billion to \nhelp the States provide child care for parents who are participating in \nwork and job training programs. It also provides additional grants for \nStates that experience high unemployment or surges in their welfare \npopulations.\n  Mr. President, I commend those among my colleagues in the Senate who \nhave worked long and hard to make this such a strong, landmark welfare \nreform bill. I also commend a former colleague--Senator Bob Dole--for \nworking tirelessly since the beginning of this historic 104th Congress \nto deliver landmark welfare reform for the American people.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. President, a number of my colleagues have talked about their very \ndeep concerns about various aspects of this legislation, including the \nestimates that go as high as 1 million more children being thrown into \npoverty, the very harsh cut in food stamps that is contained in this \nlegislation, the limitation on the time period for receiving food \nstamps, which will hit workers who have been laid off and their \nfamilies very hard in the years to come, the extreme cuts in benefits \nfor disabled children and the treatment of legal--not illegal, but \nlegal, and I stress\n\n[[Page S9355]]\n\nthat--legal immigrants coming into the country. These are people who, \nunder our laws, are legitimately in the country, and yet, if they \nencounter personal disaster financially, we are not going to provide \nany help to them. All of these factors constitute a valid basis for \nvoting against this bill.\n  I am not going to go back over those issues. They have been discussed \nat some length by others. There is another matter I wish to discuss, \nanother dimension to this legislation which I think is another strong \nreason to oppose this legislation which I intend to do. And that \ndimension is the situation we will confront in times of economic \ndownturn and recession. All of the discussion here is about the \nlimitations and constraints that are being placed upon existing \nprograms in the context of current economic circumstances.\n  Current economic circumstances are a 5.3-percent unemployment rate \nacross the country. But we must consider the question of what is going \nto happen when we have a downturn in the business cycle. People are \ndiscussing this legislation almost as though the business cycle has \nbeen repealed and is not going to happen again.\n  This legislation provides block grants to the States. The size of \nthose grants does not vary with such factors as unemployment or the \npoverty rate, and, therefore, in recessions, States will face rising \ncaseloads and corresponding large gaps in funding for assistance \nprograms.\n  The bill has a contingency fund of $2 billion, but it is completely \ninadequate--completely inadequate--it fails to address this issue. Let \nme just give you an example. In our Nation's most recent recession \nduring the Bush administration in the period from 1989 to 1992, the \nFederal share of welfare spending increased 36 percent--an additional \namount of $7.2 billion over the four years--that is, almost four times \nthe contingency fund.\n  There was a 35-percent increase in the number of children in poverty \nover those years. This was a period when the unemployment rate rose \nfrom 5.3 percent to a high of 7.7 percent.\n  What are the States going to do under this legislation when a \nrecession hits and more and more people slip into poverty, people lose \ntheir jobs, they are out of work? Under the current system, the Federal \nGovernment assures to the States additional money for each of the \nadditional persons who are placed into dire circumstances by a \nworsening economy. Under this bill, no such support. This bill \nessentially gives the State a block grant based on 1994 figures, and \nthat's it.\n  Much of the discussion has been about the difficulty of handling the \nsituation under current economic circumstances and the problems are \nvery real and severe. What happens when you get an economic downturn \nand the number of people showing up in the poverty category on the \nunemployment rolls is on the increase, rising very substantially? Are \nthe States then going to come up with more money in order to handle \nthis problem?\n  Our experience to date is every time a recession strikes the States \ncome in and say, ``We need help. We're constrained. We can't deal with \nthis recession. Look what this recession has done to our sources of \nrevenue. Our sources of revenue are down. We can't handle the \nsituation.''\n  That is what they say today when the Federal assistance is \nautomatically adjusted. What are they going to say next year or the \nyear after and the year after that when a recession comes along, when \npeople are added to the unemployment rolls, out of a job, families go \ninto poverty? Where are the resources then going to come from?\n  Under the current system, the Federal Government, since President \nRoosevelt, assumed an obligation to provide help to the States to help \nthem work through this situation. Now the Federal Government \nautomatically steps in when a recession hits. That will not be the case \nin the future under this legislation.\n  It is true there is a contingency fund. But as I said, it is totally \ninadequate for any recession of any consequence, let alone a very deep \nrecession as we experienced under President Reagan in the early 1980's, \nor just the recession we experienced in the early 1990's during the \nBush administration when the unemployment rate went from 5.3 to 7.7 \npercent. That was its peak, 7.7 percent, contrasted with the Reagan \nrecession where it went just shy of 11 percent unemployment.\n  In the Bush recession in the 1990's, the fact of the matter is that \nthere was about a 40-percent increase in the Federal expenditure on \nwelfare during that recession period. This bill fails to address the \nconsequences of such an economic downturn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield me 1 more minute?\n  Mr. EXON. I am glad to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this bill does not do that. The Federal \nGovernment is out of it in terms of assuring the States that the full \nburden of recession will not fall upon them. In the last recession, \nwhen the unemployment rate went close to 8 percent, millions of \nAmericans lost their jobs and had a difficult time finding new jobs.\n  What is going to happen in the next recession? Does anyone \nrealistically believe that the States will step in and pick up the \nburden? Even now with additional Federal assistance the States come in \nduring a recession and say, ``We can't handle our situation because our \nrevenues have been impacted by the recession.'' What is going to happen \nis you will have literally millions of people affected by the economic \ndownturn and without any support. No additional Federal assistance as \nnow, because of the block grant provision. We will pay dearly for \nfailing to provide a fail-safe mechanism against an economic downturn. \nThe consequences will be such that we will rue this day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Chair kindly advise the Senator when I have used \n15 minutes? I yield such time as is necessary to myself.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think we rotate.\n  Mr. EXON. Before the chairman came in, we had three Republicans in a \nrow. I thought that we would proceed----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They were part of the 1 hour where you had 1 hour and--\n--\n  Mr. EXON. No, they were not. They were after that. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask Senator Nickles, do you need 15 minutes?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I wish to congratulate and \ncompliment our colleague from New Mexico for his leadership on this \nbill. In addition, I compliment Senator Roth, Chairman Archer in the \nHouse, and Chairman Clay Shaw for putting this bill together, as well \nas Chairman Kasich in the House. I would like to go back a little \nfarther and also compliment Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich for \nlaying the groundwork for fundamental welfare reform, fundamental \nwelfare reform that is long overdue, fundamental welfare reform that \ntoday will have bipartisan support. I am very pleased with that and I \nam pleased the President said he would sign this bill.\n  He is correct in making that decision. I know he agonized over it. He \nwas not sure what he was going to do. That is evidenced by the fact he \nvetoed two similar bills earlier. He actually vetoed a bill in January, \na bill that passed the Senate with 87 votes. I thought that veto was a \nmistake. I thought that veto was a repudiation of his campaign \nstatement when he said we need to end welfare as we know it.\n  When candidate Bill Clinton made the statement, ``We need to end \nwelfare as we know it,'' I applauded it. I thought he was exactly \nright. Unfortunately, I think welfare had become a way of life for far \ntoo many families. Maybe that was their fault, maybe it was Congress' \nfault. I think most of the welfare programs that we have were well-\nintentioned, but many have had very suspect results.\n\n  In addressing the issue of welfare, on January 4, 1935 Franklin D. \nRoosevelt said that:\n\n       The lessons of history, confirmed by the evidence \n     immediately before me, show conclusively that continued \n     dependence upon relief induces a spiritual and moral \n     disintegration fundamentally destructive to the national \n     fiber. To dole out relief in this way is to administer a \n     narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit. It is \n     inimicable to the dictates of sound policy. It is a violation \n     of the traditions of America.\n\n\n[[Page S9356]]\n\n\n  That was in his second annual message to the country. He was right. \nMaybe he was a little bit prophetic because, if you look at what has \nhappened in our welfare system, we now have under the Federal \nGovernment 334 federally controlled welfare programs.\n  The Federal Government determines who is eligible, for how long, and \nfor how much they will receive. We have 156 job training programs \nstacked on top of each other, all with good intentions but a lot with \nresults that are not very desirable, results that in many cases have \nnot helped a lot of the intended beneficiaries and certainly have not \nhelped taxpayers.\n  This Congress has done several historic things. I have been around \nhere now for 16 years. This Congress, for the first time, has actually \npassed some reform and some curtailment of the growth of entitlement \nprograms.\n  We passed it in the Balanced Budget Act, but the President vetoed it \nso that did not become law. We passed it in the welfare bill, but the \nPresident vetoed that and it did not become law. We passed entitlement \nreform in the farm bill, a historic rewrite of decades of farm policy. \nThat was a good bill. The President signed it. I compliment him for \nsigning it.\n  Now we are passing welfare reform. Is the bill perfect? No. But it is \na good, giant step in the right direction. I am pleased the President \nwill sign it.\n  Mr. President, this bill does change the way we do welfare. The so-\ncalled AFDC, aid to families with dependent children, will no longer be \na cash entitlement. We are reforming its entitlement status. The \ncurrent program says that if you meet eligibility standards--in other \nwords, if you are poor--you can receive this benefit for the rest of \nyour life. There is no real incentive to get off. There is no real \nincentive to go to work. We are really falling into exactly what \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt said. We are destroying human spirit. So now \nwe have a chance to fix that in this bill today. This is a giant leap.\n  Again, I mentioned that I am pleased President Clinton is signing \nthis bill. But if you look at the bill he introduced, his bill was a \ncontinuation of the entitlement of aid to families with dependent \nchildren. They would go on continually. It was a continuation of an \nentitlement.\n  Today we are breaking that continuation. We are going to say that we \ntrust the States. I have heard some of my colleagues say, ``Wait a \nminute. What about the kids?'' What we are doing is taking this money \nand we are going to give this cash welfare program to the States and \nlet them determine eligibility. I happen to think that the States are \njust as concerned, maybe even more concerned than we are about kids in \ntheir own territory.\n  What makes people think that the source of all wisdom comes from \nWashington, DC, that Washington, DC, should determine who is eligible \nand who is not? Who can make the best determination of those \nrequirements? I believe the individual States can.\n  In this bill we have work requirements. We have time limits. We have \na 5-year lifetime limit. I think we have taken some big steps in the \nright direction.\n  So I want to compliment Senator Roth and Senator Domenici, Senator \nDole, and others.\n  Also, I would like to make a couple of other comments. I have heard \nthe President say we have cut too much in food stamps. In this bill we \nrequire able-bodied adults age 18 to 50 with no dependents, no kids, to \nwork 20 hours a week, with the exception that they have 3 months in a \n3-year period when they can receive food stamps. Other than that they \nare going to have to work at least 20 hours a week. That is real \nreform. I know my colleague from North Carolina thinks that is right.\n  Under current law you can receive food stamps forever. Eligibility is \npretty easy. If you meet these income requirements, you can receive \nfood stamps. There is not a time limit. Under this bill we are telling \nable-bodied people, now you are going to have to get a job.\n  There are now going to be work requirements in order to receive \nwelfare. You are going to have to get a job. We turn the money over to \nthe States, yes, but it is a transition. We call it temporary \nassistance for needy families. It is temporary assistance; it is not a \nway of life. It is not a system that we are setting up where people can \nreceive this income forever, as many families do under the current \nsystem.\n  There was an investigation in areas of my State that had drug \nproblems and crime problems, and I learned a little bit about the drugs \nand the crime. But I probably learned a little bit more about welfare. \nThis area had a very high incidence of crime and drug problems but had \nan even higher incidence of welfare dependency.\n  As a matter of fact, I talked to a young person who had a couple of \nkids and found out that, yes, she had been on welfare for a few years \nand her mother had also been on welfare for several years. I was \nthinking, we have to break this cycle. What about the kids? I looked at \nher kids, and I really felt sorry for them, and they were growing up, \nnow the third generation of a welfare family. We have to break that \ntrap of welfare dependency.\n\n  This bill will help give people a hand up and not just a hand out; to \nwhere they will be able to go to work; where we provide job training; \nwhere we have child care; where we have an opportunity for people to \nclimb up out of this welfare dependency cycle. This is a giant step in \nthe right direction.\n  With the old system, if they met the income standards, then they kept \ngetting the cash. There is no limit whatsoever. So this bill is, again, \na very positive step in the right direction toward rewarding work, \nencouraging work, encouraging people to become independent, and not \ndependent on taxpayers. I compliment Senator Dole and others who are \nresponsible.\n  I want to correct some misstatements that have been made by the \nPresident and other people. The President stated yesterday that the \nreason why he is signing the bill is that it allows States to use \nFederal money for vouchers for children and for parents who cannot find \nwork after the time limit has expired. The President says he lobbied \nfor this. To clarify, we did not put money in specifically under the \nwelfare bill, but we have said they can use money under title XX, the \nSocial Services Block Grant, for those purposes. That is the same \npolicy we had in the bill H.R. 4, that unfortunately the President \nvetoed. There was not really a change in that area.\n  President Clinton made a statement saying the congressional \nleadership insisted on attaching to this extraordinarily important bill \na provision that will hurt legal immigrants in America, people working \nhard for their families, paying taxes and serving in our military. \nWell, the President is wrong. Just to state the facts, noncitizens who \nwork for their families, pay taxes, can become eligible for welfare in \ntwo ways under this bill. First, they can become citizens. If they \nbecome citizens, they can qualify for any benefits any other American \ncan. Second, even if they decide not to become citizens, they can \nbecome eligible for welfare by working and paying Social Security \npayroll taxes for 40 quarters, basically 10 years.\n  Third, and this is most important, noncitizens who serve in our \nmilitary are eligible for welfare under this bill. The bill explicitly \nexempts them from the bans on welfare to non-Americans. It is in the \nbill.\n  I was surprised by the President's statement. His statement was this: \n``You can serve in our military, you may get killed for defending \nAmerica, but if somebody mugs you on a street corner or you get cancer \nor get hit by a car, or the same thing happens to your children, we are \nnot going to give you assistance anymore.''\n  Mr. President, President Clinton is wrong. As I mentioned, people who \nserve in our military, veterans and their dependents all continue to be \neligible for assistance under this bill, this is title 4, page 5. So \nare refugee and asylees and people who pay Social Security taxes for 40 \nquarters, title 4, page 5. People mugged on a street corner or hit by a \ncar, whether or not they are citizens and whether or not they work and \nwhether or not they are in the country legally or illegally, qualify \nfor emergency medical assistance under this bill.\n  I think it is important we stay with the facts. President Clinton \nalso said yesterday, ``I challenge every State to adopt the reforms \nthat Wisconsin, Oregon, Missouri, and other States are proposing to \ndo.'' Fact: On May 18, President Clinton spoke favorably of\n\n[[Page S9357]]\n\nthe welfare waiver application submitted by the State of Wisconsin: \n``Wisconsin is making a solid welfare reform plan. I pledge my \nadministration will work with Wisconsin to make an effective transition \nto a new vision of welfare. States can keep on sending me these strong \nwelfare proposals, and I will keep on signing them.'' That was May 18. \nGuess what? Wisconsin's waiver was proposed on May 26, over 2 months \nago, and he has not signed it yet.\n  President Clinton, before a speech of National Governors' Association \nin 1995, told the Governors he would act on their waiver application \nwithin 30 days, some of which have taken well over a year, some almost \n2 years. It has been 60 days since the Wisconsin waiver. We tried to \nput the Wisconsin waiver into the bill to make it applicable. We get a \nmessage, according to Speaker Gingrich, that if it is in the bill, the \nPresident will veto it. At the same time he was bragging on Wisconsin's \nwaiver and their new approach yesterday on national TV, he was telling \nus if we put it in the bill, he would veto the bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I could go on. I think it is important we not try to \nscare people, that we stay with the facts, that we do try to do what is \nright.\n  Let me make a couple of other comments. I heard the President and \nother people saying this bill is too hard on noncitizens, on legal \naliens. We eliminate benefits for illegals; what about noncitizens who \nare legally here? We make some changes. The President and others say we \nwent too far.\n  Let's look at what we did. Our legislation has a priority that says \nfundamentally we should take care of Americans. When aliens come to \nthis country, their sponsors pledge to support them and they sign a \nstatement that says they will not become a public charge. People come \nto this country voluntarily. If noncitizens want to stay in this \ncountry, they sign a statement saying they will not become a public \ncharge. We will start holding them to that statement and hold their \nsponsors who also signed the statement saying, ``We will make sure they \ndo not become a public charge; we will make sure they do what they \ncommitted to do.'' I think that is very important.\n  I might mention a couple things about taxpayers. If you look at the \nnumber of noncitizens currently receiving SSI, Social Security \nsupplemental income, in 1982 there were almost 128,000 noncitizens \nreceiving SSI; in 1994 that number had increased by almost sixfold, and \nthere were 738,000 noncitizens receiving SSI. The program has exploded \nsince 1982--almost six times as many.\n  What happens is a whole lot of people determine they can come to the \nUnited States not asking for a land of opportunity to grow and build \nand expand, they come to the United States for a handout. What did they \ndo? They received SSI and Medicaid. They received a lot of Government \nassistance. Thank you very much, taxpayer, and the sponsors who signed \nstatements saying, ``We will take care of them and make sure they do \nnot become a charge to the Federal Government.'' But who have not done \ntheir share, they have not held up their side of the bargain when they \nsaid they would not become a charge to the American taxpayers, and they \ndid.\n  We are saying they have a couple of choices. If they want to become \ncitizens, they will be eligible for benefits. If they do not become \ncitizens, that is certainly their option, but they do not have the \noption to say, ``Yes, take care of us, taxpayers.'' If they pay taxes \nfor 40 quarters then they could become eligible for benefits.\n  A couple of other comments. We deny noncitizens from receiving food \nstamps until they become citizens or pay taxes for 10 years. We did the \nsame thing with food stamps. Why should someone come to the United \nStates as a noncitizen and say, ``Give me food stamps''? Some people \nhave criticized this by saying, ``Wait, cuts in food stamps are \ndraconian.'' We spent $26.2 billion this year in food stamps. In the \nyear 2002, if you listen to some of the rhetoric, you would think we \ncut that in half. That is not the case. In the year 2002, 6 years from \nnow, we will spend over $30 billion in food stamps. So we are spending \nmore money in food stamps every year, but we are saying to the people \nwho are noncitizens who come to the United States, they are not \nautomatically entitled to continue receiving benefits forever.\n  Mr. President, I have several charts to be printed in the Record, and \nI compliment my friend and colleague from New Mexico for his \nleadership. I mentioned food stamps, and I will mention SSI, the growth \nrates in SSI.\n  In 1980, SSI cost the taxpayers $6 billion; in 1996, it costs $24 \nbillion, four times as much. This program is exploding. The growth \nrates in SSI for the last 5 years are 10 percent, 14 percent, 21 \npercent, 18 percent, and 20 percent. The program has exploded in many, \nmany cases because noncitizens have said this is a good way to get on a \ngravy train. We need to close that abuse. We do that under this bill. I \nthink that is positive reform.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record charts to \nsubstantiate these facts.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               FEDERAL SPENDING ON MAJOR WELFARE PROGRAMS               \n                  [Current law in billions of dollars]

\nPrepared by the Office of Senator Don Nickles.                          \n\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague from New Mexico and my colleague \nfrom Nebraska for yielding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I am not sure everyone that has sent the message \ndown that they want to speak will speak, but without wrap-up by our \nleader and without any wrap-up by me, there are 14 Senators on our side \nwho have requested some time to speak.\n  I ask the Parliamentarian, how much time remains on the Republican \nside under the 5 hours?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That still means with 14 Senators, we clearly will not \nbe able to give 20 or 25 minutes to everyone. We hope we can keep \neveryone to somewhere around 10 minutes or less.\n  Having said that, Senator Exon has not even spoken today. He is next, \nand he will choose as much time as he wants, obviously. Following him, \nmy understanding is that Senator Specter of Pennsylvania will speak on \nour side. Who will speak on your side?\n  Mr. EXON. Senator Moseley-Braun, who was here at 9:30 this morning \ntrying to speak, will follow me.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Faircloth will be next.\n  Mr. EXON. Following Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Bradley.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right. We know that many other Senators on this \nside want to speak. Since Senator Grassley is here, I am going to say \nthat, on our side, he will follow Senator Faircloth. Senator Chafee \nwants to speak, also. Where would the Senator go next on the Democratic \nside?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, may I inquire from the Chair, are there 2 \nhours left on the Republican side? I thought when I inquired a half an \nhour ago, at that time there were 2 hours on the Republican side and 2 \nhours 20 minutes on our side. Now I understand that the Chair said the \nRepublicans had 2 hours 15 minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Republicans have \napproximately 2 hours 15 minutes remaining. The reason is that there \nwas an inadvertent addition that was made on the time allowed.\n  Mr. EXON. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two hours twenty-one minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we go beyond that and get a couple more sequenced \nin? Who was the last one?\n  Mr. EXON. Senator Bradley. I have 8 or 10 other speakers. I do not \nhave a scenario beyond Senator Bradley.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On our side, when the time arrives, the next Senator \nwould be Senator Chafee, and then Senator Gregg is after the Senators I \nhad previously announced. If any other Senators have difficult times, \ncall us and we will try to put them in sooner. As soon as we can \nschedule you in, we will. Come down and tell us.\n  So the order on our side is Senators Specter, Faircloth, Grassley, \nChafee, and Gregg.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, many of my colleagues have given very \nthoughtful and rigorous descriptions of the economic growth of our \nNation under the dedicated leadership of President Clinton. Much of \nthat growth is due to the deficit reduction in the President's 1993 \nbudget that we passed with strictly Democratic votes, and not a single \nRepublican vote in either the House or the Senate. The Federal Reserve \nChairman, Alan Greenspan, agrees. He said, earlier this year, that \nPresident Clinton's budget was ``an unquestioned factor in contributing \nto the improvement in economic activity that occurred thereafter.''\n  Mr. President, we have been on the right course since we passed the \n1993 deficit reduction plan. At that time, dire predictions were made \non that side of the aisle. If anybody is interested in those, I would \nbe glad to supply the doomsday forecast if that became law--which it \ndid--from that side of the aisle.\n  In 1992, the deficit was $290 billion, the highest dollar level in \nhistory. Today, thanks to the President's budget, it has been cut more \nthan in half, to $117 billion. That is living up to both your promises \nand the promises that have been emphasized so often in debate here.\n\n  I don't customarily use charts, but I want to put up a chart that may \nhave been used before, which drives this point home. I suggest, Mr. \nPresident, that this may be the best kept secret in America.\n  In 1980, when President Carter was President of the United States, we \nhad a deficit of $74 billion for that year. That was an awful lot of \nmoney. I remember how concerned we were about that. Several years \nlater, after 1980, in the intervening 12 years of Republican \nPresidents--first Ronald Reagan and then George Bush--and supply side \neconomics, that deficit loomed from a high $74 billion, we thought, to \n$290 billion. When President Bill Clinton became President of the \nUnited States, look what has happened since then under his leadership. \nThat deficit has been more than cut in half, to the 1996 projection of \n$117 billion.\n  I don't know what tells the history of success in this particular \narea more than a chart like this, which is factual. I ask anyone to \nchallenge it. The Republicans like to carp a lot about the President's \n1993 budget. A distinguished Republican said that President Clinton's \ntaking credit for deficit reduction is like a rooster crowing very \nloudly at sunrise. I say to my Republican friend that the President has \nevery right to crow, if you want to use that word. He has every right \nto lay claim to reducing the deficit, because that he has done.\n  That enormous fiscal egg laid by the previous two Republican \nadministrations had to be attacked by someone, and President Bill \nClinton did the job. Facts are facts. He has cut it more than in half.\n  As much as I am gratified by the economic and fiscal performance of \nthe current administration, I am deeply concerned with what is being \nsaid by the Republican campaign to challenge this administration. The \nsame folks who were part of the fiscal wrecking crew in the 1980's, and \nwho voted against the only real deficit reduction plan in the 1990's, \nare now ready to sabotage the 21st century with billions of dollars in \nnew tax cuts, which they don't pay for. That is more of the supply-side \neconomics that got us into this mess in the first place.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues here, and I ask the people of the \nUnited States, why on Earth would Bob Dole change his mind from a \nstrict and sound fiscal conservative and become the Willy Loman of \nsupply-side economics and perhaps destroy the economy by going back on \nthis track?\n  Mr. President, the lessons learned in the 1980's through the 1992 \nperiod are very clear: You can't grow your way out of tax breaks of \nthis magnitude. That is why President Clinton came into office, saddled \nwith a $290 billion deficit. Supply-side economics, or so-called \ndynamic scoring are, at best, a toss of the dice.\n  To gamble the fiscal integrity of our Nation on such speculation is \ntotally irresponsible. It is shameless. It is truly shameless. Only it \nis a way of disguising the true costs of tax cuts.\n  How did they make up for them with the supply-side economics, or \nvoodoo economics, to use a Republican phrase, from the period 1980 to \n1992 that caused this?\n  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said, ``We must avoid resting key \nlegislative decisions on controversial estimates of\n\n[[Page S9359]]\n\nrevenues and outlays.'' We sure did that from the period 1980 to 1992.\n  I find it curious, Mr. President, that the advocates of supply-side \nDole tax cuts seem to be trying to cash two fiscal dividends at the \nsame time. And it will not work. On the one hand, they want to take \ncredit for the fiscal dividend that the Congressional Budget Office \nsaid we will get from the conservative fiscal policies needed to \nbalance the budget. On the other hand, they want to simultaneously take \ncredit for a fiscal dividend that would come from the stimulative \nfiscal policies of a tax cut. We have a record to show what happens \nwhen you go down that road.\n  I hope the American voters will find out quickly what the Dole \nmedicine show is really trying to sell. It is pure poison, and it \nhurts. The American people reject out of hand the heartless reductions, \nindeed, in the latest Republican 7-year budget plan. I tell my fellow \nAmericans that these needs pale in comparison to what may lie ahead if \nwe follow their lead to supply-side economics once more. Those \nreductions from real need will be twice as bad if we have to pay for \nthe total tax breaks that are about to come.\n  That is right, Mr. President. That is right, and all should \nunderstand that President Clinton cut the deficit in half, as evidenced \nby this chart. Bob Dole wants to double the amount that the Republicans \nare taking from ordinary Americans to pay for his $600 billion or so in \ntax breaks for the wealthy. The American people know and the American \npeople understand who is heading in the right direction, and it is \nPresident Bill Clinton.\n  Mr. President, an important part of all of this--to keep the promises \nthat were made during the campaign--is the matter of the welfare reform \nbill that is presently before the body.\n  Mr. President, the conference report that is before us in the Senate \ntoday is not the best possible welfare bill, but it may be the best \nwelfare bill that this divided and weary Congress can pass.\n  I salute my good friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, for \ndoing his able best, and he did a lot to smooth over the rough edges of \nthe House measure, and there were many.\n  I also want to compliment the tenacious and effective work of the \nSenator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, in the conference committee. \nThis is a better bill for their efforts.\n  Throughout the consideration of this bill, my primary concern has \nbeen with our Nation's children. A hungry child should be an affront to \nall men and women of good will.\n  I am at a loss to understand why the Republican leadership felt it \nnecessary to force their caucus to vote against allowing States to \nprovide noncash vouchers for children's food and clothing under the \nState's block grant. The conference report allows States to use another \nprogram for that purpose, but provides no additional funds, and has \neven reduced that program by 15 percent below the baseline.\n  It is certainly not the intention of this Senator to throw more \nchildren into poverty, or to create more want in our land of plenty. \nShould this legislation become law, I would hope that we monitor its \neffects very carefully. We are giving the States more powers and \nflexibility; with that will come new responsibilities. A midcourse \ncorrection may be needed 2 or 3 years hence, if the critics are right \nand the number of children living in poverty swells.\n  I am heartened, however, that the conference moderated some of the \nvery worst of the welfare bill and retained many of the improvements \nadded by the Senate. For example, there was the Kasich food stamp \namendment that was cruel and heartless in the extreme. It limited \nunemployed people without kids to only 3 months of food stamps in their \nadult lifetime. Thank goodness cooler heads prevailed. Eligibility has \nnow been modified to 3 months for any 3-year period, with an additional \n3 months if one is laid off.\n  I was also most gratified that the conference retained the Chafee \namendment maintaining current eligibility standards for Medicaid, as \nwell as the Conrad amendment eliminating the food stamp block grant. \nThese two amendments were critical to this Senator's support of the \nconference report. Removing them would have been tantamount to pulling \nthe keystone from an arch. Bipartisan support for this bill would have \ncollapsed.\n  I and many of my Democratic colleagues will vote for this conference \nreport today. We do so with some misgivings, but also with the sincere \nhope and desire that we are helping our fellow citizens to reclaim the \ndignity and pride that comes from work and providing for one's family--\nno matter how humble the calling. I hope our efforts prove worthy of \nboth those we are trying to help and the American people who have asked \nfor reform.\n  I hear a great deal these days about ending welfare as we know it. \nBut to this Senator, that does not mean ending our responsibility to \nour fellow man. It does not mean just cutting off the welfare check, \nand then cutting and running on our poor.\n   Mr. President, our responsibilities do not end with this bill. Quite \nthe contrary. As we ask those who have been in welfare's rut to become \nbreadwinners, it is our responsibility to provide them with a living \nwage through an increase in the minimum wage.\n  Since few minimum-wage jobs offer it, we must also help them find \naffordable, available, and accessible health care, especially for their \nchildren. We must assist too with education and job training to help \nthem get and hold better jobs.\n   Mr. President, one final observation. I believe that this will be \nthe sole reconciliation bill of the three promised by the Republican \nmajority to make it to the President's desk.\n  Their grotesque Medicare and Medicaid bills are being locked up in \nthe attic, out of sight of the electorate. The tax breaks may, however, \nbe a different story. We hear rumors that, if Bob Dole's numbers \nplummet any further, we may see some tax breaks shoot up to the front \nof the legislative agenda. I am deeply concerned that the Republican \nmajority may try to use the welfare savings we achieve today to justify \ntheir tax breaks. Some things never change.\n  Other things certainly have changed. Senator Bob Dole once scorned \nsupply-siders, but Candidate Dole is now a fellow traveler. He has \njettisoned the hard, dirty work of cutting spending, and now peddles \ncomforting tales about tax cuts that pay for themselves.\n  They did not pay for themselves in the 1980 to 1992 period, and they \nwill not pay for themselves between now and the turn of the century and \nthereafter.\n  These policies that they are trying to invoke once again evidently \nbroke the bank in the 1980's. We will repeat this foolhardiness again \nunder the new name of dynamic scorekeeping and supply-side economics. A \nrosy scenario is a rosy scenario by any name. I pray for the sake of \nour children and grandchildren that the Republican majority reclaims \nits wits.\n  The bill before us today asks those who receive a helping hand to \ntake responsibility for their lives and to find work. I will vote for \nthe bill. In the same vein, I ask those who have been entrusted with \nthe fiscal responsibility of the Nation not to fritter it away. Face up \nto your responsibilities. Do not pander. Do not promise what cannot be \ndelivered. Do not hide behind economic fairy tales. It will take hard \nwork to balance the budget. It is high time that we get back to work \nwith the rest of America and do our job right.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, one further item for insertion into the \nRecord.\n  The President yesterday delivered a statement indicating he would \nsign the welfare bill when it is presented to him. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of that statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                                    July 31, 1996.\n\n                       Statement by the President\n\n       The President. Good afternoon. When I ran for President \n     four years ago, I pledged to end welfare as we know it. I \n     have worked very hard for four years to do just that. Today, \n     the Congress will vote on legislation that gives us a chance \n     to live up to that promise--to transform a broken system that \n     traps too many people in a cycle of dependence to one that \n     emphasizes work and independence; to give people on welfare a \n     chance to draw as paycheck, not a welfare check.\n       It gives us a better chance to give those on welfare what \n     we want for all families in\n\n[[Page S9360]]\n\n     America, the opportunity to succeed at home and at work. For \n     those reasons I will sign it into law. The legislation is, \n     however, far from perfect. These are parts of it that are \n     wrong, and I will address those parts in a moment.\n       But, on balance, this bill is a real step forward for our \n     country, our values and for people who are on welfare. For 15 \n     years I have worked on this problem, as governor and as a \n     President. I've spent time in welfare offices, I have talked \n     to mothers on welfare who desperately want the chance to work \n     and support their families independently. A long time ago I \n     concluded that the current welfare system undermines the \n     basic values of work, responsibility and family, trapping \n     generation after generation in dependency and hurting the \n     very people it was designed to help.\n       Today we have an historic opportunity to make welfare what \n     it was meant to be--a second chance, not a way of life. And \n     even though the bill has serious flaws that are unrelated to \n     welfare reform, I believe we have a duty to seize the \n     opportunity it gives us to end welfare as we know it. Over \n     the past three and a half years I have done everything in my \n     power as President to promote work and responsibility, \n     working with 41 states to give them 69 welfare reform \n     experiments. We have also required teen mothers to stay in \n     school, required federal employees to pay their child \n     support, cracked down on people who owe child support and \n     crossed state lines.\n       As a result, child support collections are up 40 percent, \n     to $11 billion, and there are 1.3 million fewer people on \n     welfare today than there were when I took office. From the \n     outset, however, I have also worked with members of both \n     parties in Congress to achieve a national welfare reform bill \n     that will make work and responsibility the law of the land. I \n     made my principles for real welfare reform very clear from \n     the beginning. First and foremost, it should be about moving \n     people from welfare to work. It should impose time limits on \n     welfare. It should give people the child care and the health \n     care they need to move from welfare to work without hurting \n     their children. It should crack down on child support \n     enforcement and it should protect our children.\n       This legislation meets these principles. It gives us a \n     chance we haven't had before--to break the cycle of \n     dependency that has existed for millions and millions of our \n     fellow citizens, exiling them from the world of work that \n     gives structure, meaning, and dignity to most of our \n     lives.\n       We've come a long way in this debate. It's important to \n     remember that not so very long ago, at the beginning of this \n     very Congress, some wanted to put poor children in orphanages \n     and take away all help for mothers simply because they were \n     poor, young and unmarried. Last year the Republican majority \n     in Congress sent me legislation that had its priorities \n     backward. It was soft on work and tough on children. It \n     failed to provide child care and health care. It imposed deep \n     and unacceptable cuts in school lunches, child welfare and \n     help for disabled children. The bill came to me twice and I \n     vetoed it twice.\n       The bipartisan legislation before the Congress today is \n     significantly better than the bills I vetoed. Many of the \n     worst elements I objected to are out of it. And many of the \n     improvements I asked for are included. First, the new bill is \n     strong on work. It provides $4 billion more for child care so \n     that mothers can move from welfare to work, and protects \n     their children by maintaining health and safety standards for \n     day care. These things are very important. You cannot ask \n     somebody on welfare to go to work if they're going to neglect \n     their children in doing it.\n       It gives states powerful performance incentives to place \n     people in jobs. It requires states to hold up their end of \n     the bargain by maintain their own spending on welfare. And it \n     gives states the capacity to create jobs by taking money now \n     used for welfare checks and giving it to employers as income \n     subsidies as an incentive to hire people, or being used to \n     create community service jobs.\n       Second, this new bill is better for children than the two I \n     vetoed. It keeps the national nutritional safety net intact \n     by eliminating the food stamp cap and the optional block \n     grant. It drops the deep cuts and devastating changes in \n     school lunch, child welfare and help for disabled children. \n     It allow states to use federal money to provide vouchers for \n     children whose parents can't find work after the time limits \n     expire. And it preserves the national guarantee of health \n     care for poor children, the disabled, pregnant women, the \n     elderly and people on welfare.\n       Just as important, this bill continues to include the child \n     support enforcement measures I proposed two years ago, the \n     most sweeping crackdown on deadbeat parents in history. If \n     every parent paid the child support they should, we could \n     move 800,000 women and children off welfare immediately. With \n     this bill we say to parents, if you don't pay the child \n     support you owe, we will garnish your wages, take away your \n     drivers license, track you across state lines and, as \n     necessary, make you work off what you owe. It is a very \n     important advance that could only be achieved in legislation. \n     I did not have the executive authority to do this without a \n     bill.\n       So I will sign this bill. First and foremost because the \n     current system is broken. Second, because Congress has made \n     many of the changes I sought. And, third, because even though \n     serious problems remain in the non-welfare reform provisions \n     of the bill, this is the best chance we will have for a long, \n     long time to complete the work of ending welfare as we know \n     it by moving people from welfare to work, demanding \n     responsibility and doing better by children.\n       However, I want to be very clear. Some parts of this bill \n     still go too far. And I am determined to see that those areas \n     are corrected. First, I am concerned that although we have \n     made great strides to maintain the national nutritional \n     safety net, this bill still cuts deeper than it should in \n     nutritional assistance, mostly for working families with \n     children. In the budget talks, we reached a tentative \n     agreement on $21 billion in food stamp savings over the \n     next several years. They are included in this bill.\n       However, the congressional majority insisted on another cut \n     we did not agree to, repealing a reform adopted four years \n     ago in Congress, which was to go into effect next year. It's \n     called the Excess Shelter Reduction, which helps some of our \n     hardest pressed working families. Finally, we were going to \n     treat working families with children the same way we treat \n     senior citizens who draw food stamps today. Now, blocking \n     this change, I believe--I know--will make it harder for some \n     of our hardest pressed working families with children. This \n     provision is a mistake, and I will work to correct it.\n       Second, I am deeply disappointed that the congressional \n     leadership insisted on attaching to this extraordinarily \n     important bill a provision that will hurt legal immigrants in \n     America, people who work hard for their families, pay taxes, \n     serve in our military. This provision has nothing to do with \n     welfare reform. It is simply a budget-saving measure, and it \n     is not right.\n       These immigrant families with children who fall on hard \n     times through no fault of their own--for example because they \n     face the same risks the rest of us do from accidents, from \n     criminal assaults, from serious illnesses--they should be \n     eligible for medical and other help when they need it. The \n     Republican majority could never have passed such a provision \n     standing alone. You see that in the debate in the immigration \n     bill, for example, over the Gallegly amendment and the \n     question of education of undocumented and illegal immigrant \n     children.\n       This provision will cause great stress for states, for \n     localities, for medical facilities that have to serve large \n     numbers of legal immigrants. It is just wrong to say to \n     people, we'll let you work here, you're helping our country, \n     you'll pay taxes, you serve in our military, you may get \n     killed defending America--but if somebody mugs you on a \n     street corner or you get cancer or you get hit by a car or \n     the same thing happens to your children, we're not going to \n     give you assistance any more. I am convinced this would never \n     have passed alone and I am convinced when we send legislation \n     to Congress to correct it, it will be corrected.\n       In the meantime, let me also say that I intend to take \n     further executive action directing the INS to continue to \n     work to remove the bureaucratic roadblocks to citizenship to \n     all eligible, legal immigrants. I will do everything in my \n     power, in other words, to make sure that this bill lifts \n     people up and does not become an excuse for anyone to turn \n     their backs on this problem or on people who are generally in \n     need through no fault of their own. This bill must also not \n     let anyone off the hook. The states asked for this \n     responsibility, now they have to shoulder it and not run away \n     from it. We have to make sure that in the coming years reform \n     and change actually result in moving people from welfare to \n     work.\n       The business community must provide greater private sector \n     jobs that people on welfare need to build good lives and \n     strong families. I challenge every state to adopt the reforms \n     that Wisconsin, Oregon, Missouri and other states are \n     proposing to do, to take the money that used to be available \n     for welfare checks and offer it to the private sector as wage \n     subsidies to begin to hire these people, to give them a \n     chance to build their families and build their lives. All of \n     us have to rise to this challenge and see that--this reform \n     not as a chance to demonize or demean anyone, but instead as \n     an opportunity to bring everyone fully into the mainstream of \n     American life, to give them a chance to share in the \n     prosperity and the promise that most of our people are \n     enjoying today.\n       And we here in Washington must continue to do everything in \n     our power to reward work and to expand opportunity for all \n     people. The Earned Income Tax Credit which we expanded in \n     1993 dramatically, is now rewarding the work of 15 million \n     working families. I am pleased that congressional efforts to \n     gut this tax cut for the hardest pressed working people have \n     been blocked. This legislation preserves the EITC and its \n     benefits for working families. Now we must increase the \n     minimum wage, which also will benefit millions of working \n     people with families and help them to offset the impact of \n     some of the nutritional cuts in this bill.\n       Through these efforts, we all have to recognize, as I said \n     in 1992, the best anti-poverty program is still a job. I want \n     to congratulate the members of Congress in both parties who \n     worked together on this welfare reform legislation. I want to \n     challenge them to put politics aside and continue to work \n     together to meet our other challenges and to correct the \n     problems that are still there with this legislation. I am \n     convinced that it does present an historic opportunity to \n     finish the work of ending welfare as we know it, and that is \n     why I have decided to sign it.\n       Q. Mr. President, some civil rights groups and children's \n     advocacy groups still say that\n\n[[Page S9361]]\n\n     they believe that this is going to hurt children. I wonder \n     what your response is to that. And, also, it took you a \n     little while to decide whether you would go along with this \n     bill or not. Can you give us some sense of what you and your \n     advisers kind of talked about and the mood in the White House \n     over this?\n       The President. Sure. Well, first of all, the conference was \n     not completed until late last evening, and there were changes \n     being made in the bill right up to the very end. So when I \n     went to bed last night, I didn't know what the bill said. And \n     this was supposed to be a day off for me, and when I got up \n     and I realized that the conference had completed its work \n     late last night and that the bill was scheduled for a vote \n     late this afternoon, after I did a little work around the \n     house this morning, I came in and we went to work I think \n     about 11:00.\n       And we simply--we got everybody in who had an interest in \n     this and we went through every provision of the bill, line by \n     line, so that I made sure that I understood exactly what had \n     come out of the conference. And then I gave everybody in the \n     administration who has there a chance to voice their opinion \n     on it and to explore what their views were and what our \n     options were. And as soon as we finished the meeting, I went \n     in and had a brief talk with the Vice President and with Mr. \n     Panetta, and I told them that I had decided that, on balance, \n     I should sign the bill. And then we called this press \n     conference.\n       Q. And what about the civil rights groups--\n       The President. I would say to them that there are some \n     groups who basically have never agreed with me on this, who \n     never agreed that we should do anything to give the states \n     much greater flexibility on this if it meant doing away with \n     the individual entitlement to the welfare check. And that is \n     still, I think, the central objection to most of the groups.\n       My view about that is that for a very long time it's hard \n     to say that we've had anything that approaches a uniform AFDC \n     system when the benefits range from a low of $187 a month to \n     a high of $655 a month for a family of three or four. And I \n     think that the system we have is not working. It works for \n     half the people who just use it for a little while and get \n     off. It will continue to work for them. I think the states \n     will continue to provide for them.\n       For the other half of the people who are trapped on it, it \n     is not working. And I believe that the child support \n     provisions here, the child care provisions here, the \n     protection of the medical benefits--indeed, the expansion of \n     the medical guarantee now from 1998 to 2002, mean that on \n     balance these families will be better off. I think the \n     problems in this bill are in the non-welfare reform \n     provisions, in the nutritional provisions that I mentioned \n     and especially in the legal immigrant provisions that I \n     mentioned.\n       Q. Mr. President, it seems likely there will be a kind of \n     political contest to see who gets the credit or the blame on \n     this measure. Senator Dole is out with a statement calling--\n     saying that you've been brought along to sign his bill. Are \n     you concerned at all that you will be seen as having been \n     kind of dragged into going along with something that you \n     originally promised to do and that this will look like you \n     signing onto a Republican initiative?\n       The President. No. First of all, because I don't--you know, \n     if we're doing the right thing there will be enough credit to \n     go around. And if we're doing the wrong thing there will be \n     enough blame to go around. I'm not worried about that. I've \n     always wanted to work with Senator Dole and others. And \n     before he left the Senate, I asked him not to leave the \n     budget negotiations. So I'm not worried about that.\n       But that's a pretty hard case to make, since I vetoed their \n     previous bills twice and since while they were talking about \n     it we were doing it. It's now generally accepted by everybody \n     who has looked at the evidence that we effected what the New \n     York Times called a quiet revolution in welfare. There are \n     1.3 million fewer people on welfare today than there were \n     when I took office.\n       But there are limits to what we can do with these waivers. \n     We couldn't get the child support enforcement. We couldn't \n     get the extra child care. Those are two things that we had to \n     have legislation to do. And the third thing is we needed to \n     put all the states in a position where they had to move right \n     now to try to create more jobs. So far--I know that we had \n     Wisconsin and earlier, Oregon, and I believe Missouri. And I \n     think those are the only three states, for example, that had \n     taken up the challenge that I gave to the governors in \n     Vermont a couple of years ago to start taking the welfare \n     payments and use it for wage subsidies to the private sector \n     to actually create jobs. You can't tell people to go to work \n     if there is no job out there.\n       So now they all have the power and they have financial \n     incentives to create jobs, plus we've got the child care \n     locked in and the medical care locked in and the child \n     support enforcement locked in. None of this could have \n     happened without legislation. That's why I thought this \n     legislation was important.\n       Q. Mr. President, some of the critics of this bill say that \n     the flaws will be very hard to fix because that will involve \n     adding to the budget and in the current political climate \n     adding the expenditures is politically impossible. How would \n     you respond to that?\n       The President. Well, it just depends on what your \n     priorities are. For one thing, it will be somewhat easier to \n     balance the budget now in the time period because the deficit \n     this year is $23 billion less than it was the last time we \n     did our budget calculations. So we've lowered that base $23 \n     billion this year. Now, in the out years it still come up, \n     but there's some savings there that we could turn around and \n     put back into this.\n       Next, if you look at--my budget corrects it right now. I \n     had $42 billion in savings, this bill has about $57 billion \n     in savings. You could correct all these problems that I \n     mentioned with money to spare in the gap there. So when we \n     get down to the budget negotiations either at the end of \n     this year or at the beginning of next year, I think the \n     American people will say we can stand marginally smaller \n     tax cuts, for example, or cut somewhere else to cure this \n     problem of immigrants and children, to cure the \n     nutritional problems. We're not talking about vast amounts \n     of money over a six year period. It's not a big budget \n     number and I think it can easily be fixed given where we \n     are in the budget negotiations.\n       Q. The last couple days in these meetings among your staff \n     and this morning, would you say there was no disagreement \n     among people in the administration about what you should do? \n     Some disagreement? A lot of disagreement?\n       The President. No, I would say that there was--first of \n     all, I have rarely been as impressed with the people who work \n     in this administration on any issue as I have been on this. \n     There was significant disagreement among my advisers about \n     whether this bill should be signed or vetoed, but 100 percent \n     of them recognized the power of the arguments on the other \n     side. It was a very moving thing. Today the conversation was \n     almost 100 percent about the merits of the bill and not the \n     political implications of it. Because I think those things \n     are very hard to calculate anyway. I think they're virtually \n     impossible.\n       I have tried to thank all of them personally, including \n     those who are here in the room and those who are not here, \n     because they did have differences of opinion about whether we \n     should sign or veto, but each side recognized the power of \n     the arguments on the other side. And 100 percent of them, \n     just like 100 percent of the Congress, recognized that we \n     needed to change fundamentally the framework within which \n     welfare operates in this country. The only question was \n     whether the problems in the non-welfare reform provisions \n     were so great that they would justify a veto and giving up \n     what might be what I'm convinced is our last best chance to \n     fundamentally change the system.\n       Q. Mr. President, even in spite of all the details of this, \n     you as a Democrat are actually helping to dismantle something \n     that was put in place by Democrats 60 years ago. Did that \n     give you pause, that overarching question?\n       The President. No. No, because it was put in place 60 years \n     ago when the poverty population of America was fundamentally \n     different than it is now. As Senator Moynihan--you know, \n     Senator Moynihan strongly disagrees with me on this--but as \n     he has pointed out repeatedly, when welfare was created the \n     typical welfare recipient was a miner's widow with no \n     education, small children, husband dies in the mine, no \n     expectation that there was a job for the widow to do or that \n     she ever could do it, very few out-of-wedlock pregnancies and \n     births. The whole dynamics were different then.\n       So I have always thought that the Democratic party should \n     be on the side of creating opportunity and promoting \n     empowerment and responsibility for people, and a system that \n     was in place 60 years ago that worked for the poverty \n     population then is not the one we need now. But that's why I \n     have worked so hard too to veto previous bills. That does not \n     mean I think we can walk away from the guarantee that our \n     party gave on Medicaid, the guarantee our party gave on \n     nutrition, the guarantee our party gave in school lunches, \n     because that has not changed. But the nature of the poverty \n     population is so different now that I am convinced we have \n     got to be willing to experiment, to try to work to find ways \n     to break the cycle of dependency that keeps dragging folks \n     down.\n       And I think the states are going to find out pretty quickly \n     that they're going to have to be willing to invest \n     something in these people to make sure that they can go to \n     work in the ways that I suggested.\n       Yes, one last question.\n       Q. Mr. President, you have mentioned Senator Moynihan. Have \n     you spoken to him or other congressional leaders, especially \n     congressional Democrats? And what was the conversation and \n     reaction to your indication?\n       The President. Well, I talked to him as recently, I think, \n     as about a week ago. When we went up to meet with the TWA \n     families, we talked about it again. And, you know, I have an \n     enormous amount of respect for him. And he has been a \n     powerful and cogent critic of this whole move. I'll just have \n     to hope that in this one case I'm right and he's wrong--\n     because I have an enormous regard for him. And I've spoken to \n     a number of other Democrats, and some think I'm right and \n     some don't.\n       This is a case where, you know, I have been working with \n     this issue for such a long time--a long time before it \n     became--to go back to Mr. Hume's question--a long time before \n     it became a cause celeb in Washington or anyone tried to make \n     it a partisan political issue. It wasn't much of a political \n     hot potato when I first started working on it. I just was \n     concerned that the system didn't\n\n[[Page S9362]]\n\n     seem to be working. And I was most concerned about those who \n     were trapped on it and their children and the prospect that \n     their children would be trapped on it.\n       I think we all have to admit here--we all need a certain \n     level of humility today. We are trying to continue a process \n     that I've been pushing for three and a half years. We're \n     trying to get the legal changes we need in federal law that \n     will work to move these folks to a position of independence \n     where they can support their children and their lives as \n     workers and in families will be stronger.\n       But if this were an easy question, we wouldn't have had the \n     two and a half hour discussion with my advisers today and \n     we'd all have a lot more answers than we do. But I'm \n     convinced that we're moving in the right direction. I'm \n     convinced it's an opportunity we should seize. I'm convinced \n     that we have to change the two problems in this bill that are \n     not related to welfare reform, that were just sort of put \n     under the big shade of the tree here, that are part of this \n     budget strategy with which I disagree. And I'm convinced when \n     we bring those things out into the light of day we will be \n     able to do it. And I think some Republicans will agree with \n     us and we'll be able to get what we need to do to change it.\n       Thank you.\n       The Press. Thank you.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand Senator Specter is next, and I might ask, \nwill the Senator yield me 1 minute without losing his right?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, if I was representing President Clinton, \nas my good friend from Nebraska has, I would be trying to divert \nattention to what Senator Dole might do. I would be diverting attention \naway from Senator Dole who might cut taxes for the American people \nbecause, speaking of a dismal record, the President seeks to hide \nbehind a statistic that says we have had great economic growth. But the \nbig fairy tale, to borrow a word from my friend from Nebraska, is that \nwe have had the second lowest productivity growth in 50 years; real-\nwage growth is the lowest in 32 years; stagnant family incomes like we \nhave never seen; tax burdens have risen sharply, almost 1 whole percent \nmore of tax burden on the American people.\n  That is why they do not think we are doing very well. That is why \nthey say: What is happening to our salaries and our wages?\n  Now, having said that, clearly if I had that record, I would be \nworried and trying to set up a smokescreen as to what Bob Dole might do \nwhen they do not even have the slightest idea what Bob Dole is going to \ndo; he has not told anyone. We anxiously await a plan which will \ndramatically improve these kinds of economic facts. That is what we \nhope for.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding time to me.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from \nPennsylvania?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have already yielded to him in sequence. I stated it, \nbut I did not state how much time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I may be able to do it in less than the 20 minutes I \nrequest. I will try to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I hope the Senator will try. The Senator is yielded up \nto 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the welfare reform bill with \nsubstantial reservations. I support the welfare reform bill because I \nthink it is our best chance to break a pattern which has existed for \ndecades where people rely upon welfare and find themselves dependent \nupon welfare and have no way to break out of the welfare cycle, the \nwelfare chain to find jobs. I believe this legislation, while far from \nperfect--it does not contain many amendments that I voted for--is the \nbest chance to do it at this time.\n  This legislation has advanced to this stage with substantial \nbipartisan support; 23 of 46 Democrats voted for this bill. The \nPresident of the United States has stated his intention to sign the \nbill when it reaches his desk if the conference report is passed. It \nseems to be a very high probability.\n  One of my colleagues on the Republican side has voted against the \nbill because it is not tough enough, not strong enough in limiting \nwelfare benefits. Those are some of the indicators that this bill \nperhaps is, if not balanced, about as good a job as we could do given \nthe problems of our society and given the problems of a campaign year.\n  I think it does not advance our cause at all to talk about Bob Dole \nand Willy Loman or to talk about a Republican majority coming to its \nwits, but, instead, to try in a bipartisan way to fashion welfare \nreform which will serve the American people, which will help take those \non welfare off welfare, because I think it is certainly true that \npeople on welfare would much rather have a job and not be on welfare, \nand to try to take away the burden of this entitlement on our society.\n  The issue of welfare reform is something which this Senator has been \nconcerned about for a long time. In the 99th Congress, I cosponsored S. \n2578 and S. 2579 with Senator Moynihan, those bills being directed \ntoward improving the welfare system. In the 100th Congress, I \nintroduced similar legislation on a bipartisan basis with Senator Dodd, \nand then worked closely with Senator Moynihan on the legislation that \nfirst became comprehensive welfare reform on the 1988 Family Welfare \nReform Act, which was signed by President Reagan.\n  This year, after welfare reform had faded from the picture, after the \nPresident's vetoes, I joined my colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, \non June 12 in introducing bipartisan legislation captioned S. 1867, \nwhich was an identical bill to a bipartisan bill introduced by \nCongressman Castle and Congressman Tanner in the House.\n  The Biden-Specter bill was not successful, nor was the Chafee-Breaux \nproposal successful, both of which would have eased the problems for \nchildren and eased the problems for immigrants, and I think made for a \nmore orderly transition on welfare reform.\n  I regret very much that Senator Breaux's amendment did not pass, \nSenator Breaux's amendment being directed to provide vouchers for \nchildren beyond the 5 years. Senator Ford's amendment did not pass. It \nwas a narrow vote. I supported it. It would have provided noncash \nbenefits after 5 years.\n  We have crafted a bill here which takes out a good bit of the \ninflexibility which was presented in the legislation by the House of \nRepresentatives and comes somewhat close to the bill which passed the \nSenate last year by a lopsided vote of 87 to 12.\n  Mr. President, this bill does provide an opportunity for those who \nare on welfare to take a job which they would have never taken before \nbecause there are many jobs which pay less than their welfare benefits. \nWhy would someone take a job which pays less than their welfare \nbenefits? They stay on welfare.\n  This legislation, going to a core issue, will provide an opportunity \nfor someone to take a job which pays less than welfare, which that \nindividual would not now take since welfare pays more, because there \nwill be flexibility to add a supplement, so that there will be a \nsupplement from welfare funds, which means the welfare payment is less \nand the individual will be getting more with his lower wage in the \nprivate sector and the welfare supplement, and will have the benefit of \nMedicaid where the employer does not pay health benefits. So there is \nan opportunity to move from the welfare roll to the payroll.\n\n  This legislation provides that able-bodied individuals will be \nlimited as to how long they can be on welfare, receiving 2 years of \nassistance if they are not working; lifetime benefits are limited to a \nmaximum of 5 years, but the States do have flexibility to provide a \nhardship exemption up to 20 percent of the State's caseload if those \nrequirements are not met. This, I think, is realistically calculated to \nencourage able-bodied men to work.\n  With respect to finding jobs, there is job training provided and \nflexibility to the States, and the States are given substantial \nincentive to take individuals off the welfare rolls.\n  This legislation also moves to a core problem of teenage mothers who \nare on welfare with the requirement that they live at home unless there \nis some showing that there is brutality at home or something which is \nincompatible with living at home. But the teenage mothers are required \nto live at home. They are required either to be in school or on jobs or \nin job training, and there is a very substantial amount of funding in \nthis bill for child care so that mothers can realistically do that.\n  There are some provisions in this legislation which I think should \nhave been\n\n[[Page S9363]]\n\ncorrected. I think the amendments offered to leave noncitizens on the \nwelfare rolls and apply the limitations only to the future would have \nbeen more sensible so people who come into the United States would have \nnotice that they are not going to have the benefits. I think the \nmoratorium which was suggested on Medicaid benefits would have been \nsensible.\n  This bill provides for tough enforcement measures for child support, \nso parents have an obligation to support their children.\n  When you take a look at this legislation in its totality, it is a \nstep in the right direction. It has been crafted in a contentious \npolitical year where there are deep political divisions in the \nCongress, so there is a substantial block of Democratic support--23 \nDemocrat Senators having voted for it; an equal number on the other \nside. The President, a Democrat, has stated his intention to sign the \nconference report. There is very substantial support on the Republican \nside, with one Republican Senator having voted against it because it \ngives too much to welfare recipients. But there is a real need to move \nahead, to try to give people an opportunity to have jobs.\n  During my tenure as district attorney of Philadelphia, I saw many \npeople in that big city trapped in the welfare cycle. I think, when \nthey have an opportunity to take a job which is a low-paying job, they \nare not going to take it today if they lose medical benefits under \nMedicaid and they get less on the low-paying job than they have on \nwelfare. But, when you have flexibility with the States--and there are \nmany examples where the States have moved ahead on a flexible system, \nWisconsin, illustratively, Michigan, illustratively, and other States. \nGovernor Thompson is ending welfare, not just talking about it but \nending welfare in 1997--this welfare bill goes a substantial distance.\n  I know it is going to result in some holes in the safety net. But we \nwill have an opportunity to revisit those issues. But taken as a whole, \nmy view is it is a significant step forward, and that is why I am \nsupporting it.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Illinois? \nThe Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from \nNebraska is not on the floor as yet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may yield herself time.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I will do so.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I yield to the Senator from Nebraska for a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. Before \nshe starts in on her speech, which I assume is on her objection to the \nwelfare bill, but she may be talking about economics because she has \nbeen very much involved in things that we need to do to shape up \nAmerica, I want to ask her a question. Did the Senator hear when the \nSenator from New Mexico made quite a point in answer to my dissertation \non supply-side economics and skyrocketing deficits that have been \ncorrected and turned around by President Clinton? He was complaining \nabout the productivity of America.\n  If we want to look at the productivity of America, I think we ought \nto put that in terms that people can understand: not productivity, but \njob growth. The percentage of change on an annual basis during the \nReagan/Bush years--and I think it is consistent because I talked about \nthe Reagan/Bush years and the skyrocketing deficits that were created \nthen--all during those Reagan/Bush years, the private sector job growth \nwas 1.6 percent. Under President Clinton it is 2.9 percent. That says \nsomething about productivity, does it not?\n  Does that not say also something about jobs and job creation, which \nis what the economy is all about?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. It certainly does.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from \nNebraska, my colleague referenced the fact that I am kind of an \narmchair economist. I like these issues. But I must tell you, I find it \nmore than a little ironic on a day on which we are talking about how \nwell the American economy is doing, we are declaring defeat and failure \non our response to poverty and throwing in the towel on poor children \nin America.\n  I point out, in the first instance, I have heard a lot of discussion \nabout the numbers pertaining to this welfare ``reform'' debate, about \nhow much money is being spent. For the general public, it sounds like \nan awful lot of money because that is what we do here. We talk about a \nbudget that is almost $2 trillion. So the numbers associated with \nwelfare, which impacts very dramatically on the lives of the most \nvulnerable people in our society, sound like an awful lot of money. \nStill, all told, those numbers relate to about--well, actually less \nthan 1 percent of the Federal budget. It is 1 percent of the Federal \nbudget, but that has an impact on Americans, particularly American \nchildren who are poor, greater than the other 99 percent that we spend. \nI just want to put that in context.\n  Mr. President, the French have an expression, if I may in my broken \nFrench, ``plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose,'' and it means \nessentially the more things change the more they remain the same. The \nfact of the matter is, this bill no more warrants the title ``reform'' \nthan any of its predecessors. This bill is still an abomination, which \nis what I called the previous bill, and I intend to vote against it for \nprecisely that reason--and I keep coming back to the question, and no \none has answered the question: What about the children? What happens to \nthem when all is said and done, with all the cuts and the changes that \nwe are making in this legislation?\n  When I talk about the children, I talk about them in the context \nthat, again, welfare is simply a response to poverty. The system is \nbroken. It needs to be reformed and fixed. The problem, however, is \nthat, that is not what this bill does. Welfare reform should not be \nabout pushing people, and pushing children particularly, into poverty.\n  The Urban Institute has concluded that 1.1 million children will be \nthrown into poverty by this bill. Estimates for previous welfare bills \npassed by the Congress were 1.5 million children thrown into poverty. \nNow 1.1 million is less than 1.5 million, but it is still too many. The \nearlier Senate bill would have cut off 170,000 children in my home \nState of Illinois because their families had reached the time limits. \nThat is about 28 percent of the children presently receiving the AFDC \nsubsidy in my State.\n  I want to talk about AFDC again, the misconceptions and the welfare \nmythology, because there has been a whole lot of conversation about how \nthis system is broken, let us turn it over to the States, let us let \nthem do it. That is where I come back to the notion that we have ``been \nthere, done that.'' This is called ``back to the future.''\n  I have to mention that the Presiding Officer and I worked together, \nwhen we first got here, on the whole question of unfunded mandates and \nthe relationship between State and Federal Government. But it is \nprecisely that relationship that is at the base of the debate going on \nhere. For those who do not know the history, I want to refer my \ncolleagues to the history of what happened before we had a national \nsafety net for poor children in this country.\n  I have referenced previously this issue, I am looking at the spring \n1995 issue of Chicago History magazine. I want to read the title of the \narticle, ``Friendless Foundlings and Homeless Half-Orphans.'' I never \nread the first line, which I think I will share with my colleagues. It \nsays:\n\n       In 19th century Chicago, the debate over the care of needy \n     children raised issues of Government versus private control \n     and institutional versus family care.\n\n  Mr. President, that is exactly the argument I have heard all day long \non this welfare debate in this Senate today. So we are facing some of \nthe same issues and some of the same questions that came up in our \ncountry 100 years ago.\n  Let me show you what State flexibility got us last time, Mr. \nPresident. The last time we had State flexibility, we had children \nsleeping in the streets, which was the first poster.\n\n[[Page S9364]]\n\n  Here is another one. This is another part of the experiment, again, \nthe history that people maybe have forgotten. The fact is, they were \nscooping children up from the alleys in New York, shipping them to \nRockford, IL, and auctioning them off. This is what happened with poor \nchildren.\n  This is the ``Asylum Children'':\n\n       A company of children, mostly boys, from the New York \n     juvenile asylum will arrive in Rockford, IL, and remain until \n     evening. * * * they are from 7 to 15 years of age. * * * \n     Homes are wanted for these children with farmers. * * *''\n\n  This is the response States came up with before we had a national \nsafety net.\n  I have another poster which another response by states called the \norphan trains. To be candid, maybe Speaker Gingrich really had studied \nthe history when he talked about we will just have to put these kids in \norphanages. That is what happened at the turn of century. They took \nchildren from the alleys of New York, put them on trains and took them \nout West to give them homes. Some are still living and can give \ntestimony to what happened before we had a national safety net for poor \nchildren in this country, and getting rid of that safety net is what \nthis so-called welfare reform is all about. We are rending that safety \nnet apart just because it has not worked.\n  Mr. President, I submit to you, it may not have worked, but we can do \nbetter by way of reforming it. This is not reform. Real welfare reform \nwould mean we give people jobs, we give them some way to work, we give \nthem some way to take care of themselves, we give them some way to take \ncare of their children. That would be real welfare reform. That is not \nwhat this legislation does.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Only if it will not take from my 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask it be on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In all those cases you described, 1900 in Chicago, 19th \ncentury, do you have any idea how much the States and the National \nGovernment was spending on these kinds of poor people then?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. It depended on the State. In fact, I commend the \narticle to my colleague. What they say here is depending on the State--\nsome States had better programs for handling poor children than \nothers--in fact, one of the tragic things about it, and I was kind of \nashamed, my State of Illinois did not do well with poor children.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was wondering if you knew how much we were going to \nbe spending on these programs, including food stamps, which is an \nentitlement. One-hundred thirty billion dollars.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I say to my colleague, I am prepared to debate \nthis with you, but, in the first place, again, that is less than 1 \npercent of the budget. We spend that much in an afternoon on some other \nprograms that I know my esteemed colleague supports. But I also point \nout to my colleague that this bill cuts $54 billion from these programs \nover the next 6 years in the name of welfare reform, with most of the \ncuts coming out of food stamps and coming out of help for legal \nimmigrants.\n\n  The real problem, Mr. President, is that this bill is not designed to \nmove people from welfare to work. There is not an adequate investment \nin child care, in job training or in job creation, factors which are \ncritical to moving people into the work force.\n  Instead, this bill is arguably about saving money. The $54 billion \ncut simply represents, and I again go back to unfunded mandates, a \nshift in funding from the Federal to the State and the local \ngovernments. Poor people are not going to go away the day this \nlegislation goes into effect, and in light of the fact we have failed \nto provide for any employment, we have failed to create any jobs, we \nhave failed to provide adequate child care funding, we have failed to \naddress the fundamental causations of poverty, the fundamental reasons \nthey are poor to begin with, e.g., they do not have a job to take care \nof themselves. And, we are talking about the able-bodied people. \nUnfortunately, the fine print of this bill also has an effect on non-\nable-bodied people as well.\n  Nonetheless, the fact is, with regard to able-bodied, anybody who can \nwork should work, and anybody who can work ought to take care of their \nown children. But this bill makes no provision for that, and that is \nthe fundamental problem. On October 1, the effective date of this \nlegislation, there still will be areas in this country with excessive \npoverty and excessive unemployment. Those people, Mr. President, are \nnot going to go away.\n  I point out that the Congressional Budget Office has said that most \nStates will not and cannot meet the work requirements in this bill. \nThat alone should tell us that something is wrong with this picture. If \nthe work requirements are not met, and that means the people do not \nhave jobs and families then get cut off because of the time limits in \nthe bill, then what happens? What do these people do with their \nchildren?\n  Do we put them on trains and send them out West? Do we scoop them out \nof alleys and auction them off? What are we going to do with the \nchildren? That is the essential question that has not been answered: \nWhat happens to the children once the time limits are reached, once the \nassistance is cut off?\n  There is no provision for them. Even assuming for a moment the 20-\npercent cushion that is given in here, the kind of hardship exemption \nthat States can use or the title XX funding, the entire program along \nwith the title XX funding are cut about 15 percent in this bill. This \nentire thing is predicated on cutting money. So you are talking about \nless money for a problem that is going to result in the great \nunanswerable about what it is we do with children.\n  Are we going to have the State and local governments pick up the \ncosts associated with the children of the jobless poor? Or are we going \nto then say, ``Well, private charities can pick it up''? What do we do \nabout these children?\n  And then, Mr. President, and this is where we get to Speaker \nGingrich's remark about orphanages, what do you do when you have \nsomeone who has reached the time limit, has children, still does not \nhave a job and cannot feed those children? Do we then start child \ncustody cases in the State courts of this Nation? Do we then put them \nin orphanages, as the Speaker suggested? No one has answered that \nquestion.\n  Mr. President, I have a friend who is a juvenile court judge back in \nIllinois, and she tells me that she already is seeing cases that come \nin as child neglect cases which really are a reflection of people who \ndo not have enough money to take care of their children. She is seeing \nthat happen already.\n  Mr. President, this legislation that we are calling by the misnomer \nof ``reform'' is going to exacerbate that problem. This bill does not \nprovide enough money for people to go to work. It does not provide any \njob training, it does not provide any jobs, it does not provide any \neducation, it does not provide adequate child care, and we are going to \nsee an increase in costs passed along to State and local governments.\n  On the child care question, are we now going to also see an increase \nin latchkey kids and ``home alone'' children, because the bill requires \nfor those who do get employed that they go work. So if you are able-\nbodied and can find a job, you must, under this legislation, come off \nwelfare, you have reached the limit, you have to go to work. What if \nyou have a 3-year old child? Where does that child go? There is \ninadequate money, as the Presiding Officer, I know, is well aware, \ninadequate money to pay for child care.\n  The Governors and the mayors will discover that this bill, which in \nthe beginning looked like it offered them something significant, is \nreally a Trojan horse. We are going to deliver to the Governors and the \nmayors the responsibility for masses of poor children that we, as \nnational legislators, do not want to face.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe National Association of Counties urging us to vote against this \nwelfare bill because, and I quote, ``counties will bear the brunt of \nthe cost shift and will be left with only two options: to cut essential \nservices, such as law enforcement and fire protection, or to raise \nlocal taxes.''\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S9365]]\n\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: The National Association of Counties (NACo) \n     urges you to vote against the conference agreement on welfare \n     reform (H.R. 3747). If this bill is enacted, counties will \n     bear the brunt of the cost shift and will be left with only \n     two options: to cut essential services, such as law \n     enforcement and fire protection, or raise local taxes. \n     Counties are already developing more efficient welfare \n     programs, but there is no way we can absorb the federal \n     government's costs all at once.\n       NACo has long standing policy supporting the entitlement \n     nature of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and \n     opposing funding caps including those in the legislation. \n     Ending the entitlement for AFDC essentially dismantles the \n     federal safety net for children.\n       We also oppose the denial of benefits to legal immigrants. \n     NACo has consistently opposed denying Supplemental Security \n     Income and Food Stamps to this population. These provisions \n     will disproportionately affect counties in states with large \n     immigrant populations. The California State Association of \n     Counties estimates that the legal immigrant exclusions will \n     cost California counties more than $10 billion over six \n     years.\n       Counties are also deeply concerned about the legislation's \n     work requirements. Because of the funding cap, the bill lacks \n     the sufficient funds to meet these requirements and operate \n     welfare to work programs efficiently and could result in \n     substantial unfunded mandates. Minnesota counties alone said \n     that they would need to spend about $44 million to meet the \n     work requirements for FY 1997. Since the participation rates \n     increase every year, this cost will increase as well. Able-\n     bodied individuals should be expected to work, but effective \n     programs require substantial initial investments and counties \n     cannot be expected to pick up the full costs.\n       The bill will ultimately shift costs and liabilities, \n     create new unfunded mandates upon local governments, and \n     penalize low income families. NACo therefore urges you to \n     vote against the conference agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael Hightower,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, no one is here to argue that the \ncurrent welfare system is a wonderful and perfect response to poverty. \nIt is not. We do want to encourage independence. We do want to \nencourage family structure. We want to discourage illegitimacy, give \npeople an opportunity to come together, create families, raise their \nchildren and take care of them themselves.\n  We want to inspire hope in our people. We want to lift Americans out \nof poverty. Poverty should be something we have conquered in this great \nNation with such a healthy economy as we heard tell about today. But we \nhave not gotten there.\n\n  As we tinker with this situation, as we try to work this situation, \nwe cannot just say we are going to slash the money, cut the money, send \nit to the States and try to do reform on the cheap, which is what this \nbill does. Governor Thompson--and it has been talked about as the great \nwelfare experiment out of Wisconsin--Governor Thompson acknowledges \nthat welfare reform has to encompass jobs, child care, and creation of \nreal opportunity for people. That costs money. You cannot do it on the \ncheap. And that is not what is in this legislation.\n  Believe it or not, Mr. President, I actually pray that this approach \nis going to work. I mean, it is hard to say. I pray it will because, \nquite frankly, I do not want to see the harm that this history suggests \nthat we are about to visit again. I do not want to see this happen to \nanybody, particularly poor children in a country as great as ours.\n  But I have to tell you something. I believe that it is a \nfundamentally flawed premise that if you simply stop giving people \nassistance, if you stop helping them with their subsistence, they will \ngo to work and stop having babies. If this bill cures illegitimacy, \ndependency, joblessness and hopelessness, I will congratulate my \ncolleagues who support this legislation. However, Mr. President, I tell \nyou it is not likely to happen.\n  For all of the rhetoric about reforming the welfare system and \nhelping the poor take care of themselves, this bill provides nothing--\nnothing--to help them get there. Cutting the income of the poorest \nAmericans will not reduce the number of poor babies. It will not. It is \nnot likely that we will cure the problem of dependency by just cutting \npeople off and telling them their children's needs can just fall off \nthe edge of the Earth. That is why the legislation is so flawed.\n  Mr. President, I also question whether or not the savings in this \nbill coming from food stamps and the elimination of benefits for \nillegal aliens is going to help move people from dependency to \nindependency. I doubt this legislation is going to do anything about \nproviding protections for children after all title XX, the social \nservices block grants, are cut in this legislation by some 15 percent.\n  So we are doing, I think, great harm to children. There are some, Mr. \nPresident, who suggest that this bill is not perfect, that we can fix \nthe flaws later. I do not think, Mr. President, that it is appropriate \nfor us to play games and to be so generous with the suffering of the \npoor, with the potential and the effect on their lives this legislation \nsuggests. We do not have the luxury of guessing in this area and making \npolicy based on mythology and not on fact. This system may be broken, \nbut the fact is that it affects the lives of real people.\n  We have been talking in this Chamber about the States and their \ninterests, about the system and how it operates or does not operate. \nThe fact is, they are real people, real lives and real faces and real \nfeelings and children who deserve a chance in this, the greatest \ncountry on the planet.\n  We are not giving them this chance, Mr. President, with this \nlegislation. That is why I do not believe that we can call this reform \nin good conscience. I believe that, unfortunately, this is again back \nto the future, to the politics of 100 years ago, where we saw this \nhappen before in history. They were not any more or less compassionate \nthan we are today.\n  This Senate does not hold a monopoly on vision or compassion or \npolitical will. The fact of the matter is, we are responding, this \nlegislation is a response to the same political will that existed at \nthe time.\n  We have met the challenge of poverty, and we have declared failure, \nand we have declared retreat. I think that is a real ironic situation \nfor us to face in light of the good economic news that was given today.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I say to you this. I hope that the \npolitical calculation that says that we can experiment like this based \non the vulnerability and the lack of political clout of people who do \nnot vote or who cannot vote, I believe that that is political \nexpediency. It does a disgrace to the well intentions of the Members of \nthis body.\n\n  I know this bill is going to pass. It has the votes. And this is my \nthird time giving a speech on this subject. But I can tell you, Mr. \nPresident, we are going back to the future. This is history repeating \nitself. And all we can do is pray that the harm to the children does \nnot become what everything tells us it is likely to be. I yield to the \nSenator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Based on a previous agreement, the next \nSenator to be recognized would be the Senator from North Carolina. The \nSenator from Washington, as the floor manager, is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, that is correct. I think we do have an \nagreement to go back and forth. And just simply for----\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Except, I say to my colleague from Washington, I \nbelieve, Mr. President, I had 20 minutes allocated to me. I do not \nbelieve I have used up the 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. All time has expired? All right. Thank you.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, just for Republican purposes, the next \nfour Republicans listed in order are Senators Faircloth, Grassley, \nChafee and Gregg in that order. But, as I understand, we go back and \nforth. So after Senator Faircloth, the Democrat will be--is that \nSenator Bradley or Senator Boxer? Senator Bradley.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair may clarify. The Democratic order \nwould be the Senator from New Jersey, then the Senator from North \nDakota, the junior Senator from the State of Washington, and then the \nSenator from Montana.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that after I \nspeak,\n\n[[Page S9366]]\n\nthen it would be the Senator from California. I know the Senator from \nNew Jersey speaks after the Senator from North Carolina. The Senator \nfrom North Carolina shall speak, and then I will speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I had asked for 15 minutes. I see I was \nallocated 10. I think that will probably handle it. But I had been \ngranted 15.\n  Mr. GORTON. If the Senator would yield, we are beginning to run out \nof time. The next three Republicans are even going to get 10 minutes. \nSo we hope the Senator can do it in that.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I hope I run out of speech before I run out of time.\n  Mr. President, I said many times, and many times over, that in this \nwelfare debate we have not addressed the root cause of welfare, and \nthat is illegitimacy. The root cause of welfare dependency is \nillegitimacy. Until we address that, we will not have addressed the \nroot cause of welfare. And my belief has only been strengthened by what \nI have seen during this year of welfare debate.\n  Some of the weaker points in the welfare bill have been strengthened \nby the conference. The conference report contains a provision for work \nfor welfare recipients, a concept known as pay for performance. If you \nhave ever heard of anything ludicrous, it would be being paid not to \nperform work. Only in the Federal Government, only in the welfare \nsystem could anybody conceive of not having to work to get paid, where \nthat would be an unusual concept that you had to require pay for \nperformance. It is incomprehensible to me that anybody would be paid \nthat did not perform.\n  To truly reform welfare, we have to reverse the current welfare \npolicies which subsidize and promote self-destructive behavior and \nillegitimacy. These policies are and have destroyed the family.\n  This conference report will serve as a good starting point for \nchanging welfare in a culture that is based entirely on a system of \npersonal responsibility. That is where we need to return to--a system \nbased on personal responsibility.\n  I have heard several times here today that we could correct the \nmistakes in this bill at a later date. I think by correcting mistakes, \nthey meant make it a softer, weaker bill. I hope we will correct the \nmistakes by making it a stronger, better bill and put more emphasis on \npersonal responsibility.\n  I had hoped this bill would contain, like a previous conference \nreport, a provision known as the family cap. In plain language, the \nfamily cap says that if you are a welfare recipient drawing AFDC and \nhave more children, you do not get more money for having more children.\n  We did not put that in this bill. We absolutely should have. It is \none of the glaring weaknesses of it, that you can continue to have \nchildren and continue to be paid by the taxpayers. The middle class \nAmerican family that wants to have children has to prepare, to plan, to \nsave, to accept, to take on the responsibility of having children. At \nthe same time, we are taking their tax money to support these people \nwho are not accepting personal responsibility and having children, on \nand on and on. We are taxing the working people that plan to have \nchildren. We are taking their money to pay for this irresponsible \nbehavior.\n\n  Today, more than one in every third child is born out of wedlock, and \nin many communities it can go up to 85 percent. Children born out of \nwedlock are three times more likely to be on welfare when they become \nadults, and children raised in single-parent homes are six times more \nlikely to be poor and twice as likely to commit crimes.\n  It is clear that the cost of this has become an extreme burden on the \nAmerican people. Each year, half a million children are born to teenage \nmothers. Over 75 percent of these occur out of wedlock. The estimated \ncost to the American people, our taxpayers, are $29 billion to care for \nsociety's part in child-bearing adolescents under 18. That is the \nstated cost to the American people.\n  I commend the conferees who were able to restore an important \nprovision of the bill. This is the funding for the abstinence education \nprogram which I initially offered as an amendment to our first Senate \nbill. Abstinence education has worked in those counties, cities, and \nStates that have put it in. It has done as much or more to break the \ncycle of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and teenage welfare recipients as \nanything we have done. I plan to continue to promote this program and \nto introduce it again in later bills.\n  After 30 years of the so-called Great Society, we are on the verge of \npassing legislation that will return welfare to what it was supposed to \nhave been 50 or 60 years ago. Actually, when it was first began, it was \ntemporary help for responsible individuals who had fallen on hard \ntimes. It is no longer that. We have converted it to a way of life in \nwhich generation after generation after generation receive welfare. It \nis not temporary help for those people who have had a hard time. No, we \nhave taxed these people; we have spent $5.2 trillion to create the \nworst system that was ever made. Nobody likes it. It is long since time \nthat we change what we have been doing. It is not designed for people \non hard times. It is designed as a way of life for people who choose \nnot to work.\n  With the $5.2 trillion we put into it--$5.2 trillion is very close to \nthe exact amount of our national debt--we have more poverty than we had \nwhen we started. When we started this program of AFDC about 33 or 34 \nyears ago, less than 7 percent of the children were born out of \nwedlock. By subsidizing illegitimacy, we now have it to over 37 percent \nof the children, and it is rapidly rising. It is even agreed by the \nPresident that it will soon exceed 50 percent of the children in this \ncountry.\n  It is long since time that we do something about it. This bill makes \na start. This bill makes a start. We are going to see the States that \nfully implement the work requirements, that fully implement the \nrequirements that people work for their welfare, they are going to see \nsuch a great response and reduction in their welfare rolls until they \nwill be applauded, and the other States will attempt to emulate and \ncopy what they are doing.\n  I hope most of the States will take advantage of the opportunity \ngiven them to cut their welfare rolls, and they will see a dramatic \nreduction and the other States will attempt to emulate.\n  The real test ahead will be changing the lives of today's welfare \nrecipients by helping them become self-sufficient and ensuring that \nfewer and fewer people will come to need welfare. That is the real \npurpose of what we are trying to do, bring people to accept personal \nresponsibility. I believe this bill will do it. I intend to support it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  How much time does the Senator yield himself?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I yield myself 9 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this conference report on welfare reform is a \npolitician's dream, a poor person's nightmare, and a continuing source \nof anger and frustration for the taxpaying public that wants real \nwelfare reform.\n  First, what about the politician's dream? Welfare, AFDC, $15 billion \nout of a $1.5 trillion budget has been a political football in this \ncountry for generations; in some cases, a racialized political \nfootball, as politician after politician created in the mind of the \npublic the idea that black women had children so they could collect $64 \nper month for that third child in New Jersey. This bill allows those \npoliticians, those Federal politicians, to end welfare and claim they \nwill end poverty and illegitimacy and mind-numbing bureaucracy with one \nstroke. You can send a signal to multiple constituencies under this \nwelfare reform bill.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a poor person's nightmare. The Urban \nInstitute says, as a result of this bill, there will be 2.6 million \nmore people in America living in poverty, 1.1 million more children \nliving in poverty, and they will be living 20 percent deeper in \npoverty. The gap between their income and the poverty level will be 20 \npercent lower.\n  We say to send it back to the States and they can take care of it. \nMr. President, you have an economic downturn in the States, and they \nhave a fixed amount of this money in a block grant. There is nothing \nthat prevents them from cutting this poor person's grant\n\n[[Page S9367]]\n\nmore, cutting benefits, saying you cannot go beyond 3 years, 2 years, 1 \nyear. There are no requirements that we put in this bill. It is a poor \nperson's nightmare.\n  Mr. President, it is a continuing source of anger and frustration for \nour taxpaying public that wants real welfare reform. When the public \nhears ``end welfare as we know it,'' they think ``end welfare.'' When \npeople hear that people are going to have to work for welfare, they \nbelieve what politicians say--beware. If you believe what politicians \nsay in this bill, that you have to work for welfare, imagine how \nsurprised those individuals who have believed the politicians' rhetoric \nabout work and welfare, imagine how surprised they are going to be when \nthey find out that States can pay about a $50 bounty per person instead \nof putting money up to put people to work.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that most States \nwill simply ignore the request to put people to work and instead pay \nthe 5 percent, $50 penalty for the failure to meet the work \nrequirements. It will pay them to do that.\n  Just taking one example, the biggest city, New York City, which \noperates the largest work program in this country. Only 32,000 welfare \nrecipients are in it out of 850,000 New Yorkers on welfare. The reason? \nNot because they do not want to do it--lack of money to create jobs.\n  The mayor of New York City said that to meet the work requirements in \nthe bill, the city would need $100 million more than it will receive in \nthis block grant. It can't do it, and so it will pay less, pay the $50 \nbounty per person, to get out from under that work requirement. The \npoliticians who claim the bill will put people to work will suddenly \ndiscover a lot of people are not working.\n  Imagine, there are those who think this bill will promote marriage. \nThis bill will not promote marriage at all. This bill will not promote \ntwo-parent families. This bill will not promote reward for marriage. \nThis bill will not promote reward for work or penalties for additional \nchildren. This bill will not change the face of the bureaucrat that \nsits in his or her State office listening coldly to whatever is said, \nresponding in a way that is at least insensitive and often demeaning. \nThis bill will not change that.\n  Imagine you are a taxpaying citizen in a State that has tough \neconomic times. The State will have a lot more people on welfare, and \ntheir block grant may not cover them. The only way you are going to get \nmore is by raising taxes. Imagine how you would feel when a State three \nor four States over from you is in good times and it gets its block \ngrant and only has to deploy 80 percent to welfare and can use the rest \nto give its citizens tax cuts. That is why you need a national program, \nnot a program of block grants.\n  For those who believe in this remarkable federalism, anybody who \nthinks the State legislatures in Trenton, Albany, Sacramento, or \nwherever, are going to be more sensitive to issues related to people \nwho are poor or to children who are poor than national legislators, I \nhave a bridge I would like to sell you shortly after I finish speaking.\n  Mr. President, why is this bill such a mistake, in addition to the \npoints that I have made? Well, when I left a small town on the banks of \nthe Mississippi in Missouri, outside St. Louis, and went to college in \nNew Jersey--a decision that changed my life--in St. Louis, 13 percent \nof the kids born that year were born to single parents. In 1994, 63 \npercent were born to single parents, and 85 percent of the black \nchildren were born to single parents. If we were honest about this, Mr. \nPresident, we would admit that no one knows what will change this \naround. No one knows what combination of incentives and penalties and \nvalues will begin to change this. That is why what we need is a Federal \ncommitment and State experimentation, with a lot of different kinds of \ncombinations of programs. Then maybe we can get the mix that will break \nthis rising number of children in this country born into single-parent \nhomes.\n  But what this bill creates is State chaos, not State experimentation. \nWhat this bill does is simply pass the buck from Federal politicians to \nState politicians; one group of politicians take the pot of money and \ngive it to another group. Let us have a baseline. What is the \nillegitimacy rate in cities in this country? What is the poverty rate? \nWhat is the unemployment rate? What is the violence or crime rate? In 5 \nyears, let us see whether this bill has miraculously changed all those \nstatistics for the better because, deep down, that is the claim of this \nkind of legislation, built on generations of using this issue as a code \nword for a lot of other things in American politics.\n  Mr. President, welfare was not the cause of these rising illegitimacy \nrates, and so-called welfare reform in this bill will not be the \nsolution. The silver lining--if there is a silver lining in this bill--\nis the child support enforcement provisions. They are the provisions \nthat say that if you father a child, you have an obligation to support \nthat child. I strongly support those parts of this bill. But, Mr. \nPresident, I regret to say that the rest of this bill is sorely \nlacking. I admit that it is a politician's dream, a message to multiple \nconstituencies. But it is a poor person's nightmare, and it is a source \nof continuing anger and frustration for the taxpaying public that wants \nreal welfare reform and will not get it in this bill.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If it doesn't come off my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that following Senator Grassley, \nI be allowed to address the Senate for 9 minutes on another subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, are we following an order of going back and \nforth?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am on the Democratic list.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a suggested list, but it is not \nformally agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, Mr. President, we all should thank \nPresident Clinton for keeping his campaign promise of 1992 to end \nwelfare as we know it. He announced yesterday that he would sign our \nlegislation. After two vetoes of very similar welfare reform \nlegislation that we passed last year, we were beginning to wonder \nwhether or not he was serious about that campaign promise of 1992. We \nare glad now to know, after 4 years of talk, that he is serious about \nending welfare as we know it and that he won't be stonewalling anymore \nand that he will be doing what he, as a Governor, said ought to be \ndone--return more authority over to the States. So we thank him.\n  We also know that Congress has made a very serious effort to reform \nwelfare. The last was in 1988. Such welfare reform was supposed to move \npeople from welfare to work, to save the taxpayers money, to reduce \nthose on the rolls, to move people to self-sufficiency. All of those \nthings were proclaimed in that 1988 legislation that passed 96 to 1.\n  Now, 8 years later, we see 3 million more people on the welfare \nrolls. We see billions of dollars more being spent, and we also \nconclude that reform of the system, regardless of our good intentions \nand the reform that we were wanting to enact, did not happen.\n  The current welfare system has failed. The programs were well-\nintended, but they proved to be inefficient, they proved to be unfair \nand, most importantly, they proved to damage those they were meant to \nhelp. We are concerned about the children. Our present welfare program \nwas passed decades ago out of concern for children. But after six \ndecades, we find that our children are the POW's of the war on poverty.\n  This has not helped our children. It has not strengthened our \nfamilies. And we are insistent, in this legislation, upon making up for \nthose wrongs of the past. In other words, to help our children.\n  I said that the last time Congress tried reform we failed. We built \nupon what we had been doing for 60 years--to have everything run from \nWashington; to micromanage everything from Washington. But now, as we \nchange the approach for the first time in 6 decades, it is not as, \nSenator Bradley tried to imply, just some casual effort to send it back \nto the States to solve all of our problems. No. We send it\n\n[[Page S9368]]\n\nback to the States because we have seen the States succeed where we \nhave failed. I said that we wanted to move people from welfare to work. \nWe wanted to save the taxpayers' money. We wanted to make people self-\nsufficient. We have failed.\n  But we have seen States succeed.\n  My own State of Iowa in 3 years of reforms has 12 percent less people \non welfare; that is 4,000 less people on welfare. The monthly checks \nhave gone down from $371 to $335, not because we want to spend less to \nhelp families, but because there are more families working and earning \nincome. And as a State we have seen the highest percentage of welfare \nrecipients in the Nation in the work force at over 33 percent. Under \nthe waiver Iowa received, we have a control group which is still under \nthe old program. And in that control group under the old program, only \n19 percent of the people have moved from welfare to work. Of those in \nthe new program, over 33 percent of the people have moved from welfare \nto work.\n  So my State, Wisconsin, Michigan, and many other States, have a track \nrecord of succeeding on welfare reform where the Congress in our last \nattempt in 1988 has failed.\n  These local and State solutions can be--and are--more innovative and \ntargeted. They promote new opportunities. I think they are doing what \nevery welfare reform intends to accomplish--moving people from \ndependency to self-sufficiency, building self-esteem, moving people \nfrom welfare to work, saving the taxpayer dollars, and, most \nimportantly, ending the hopelessness that welfare recipients have \nexperienced.\n  In the process of passing this legislation--we are saving the \ntaxpayers' over $55 billion. We are limiting the amount of time that \npeople can be on welfare to a 5-year lifetime limit. We are helping \nrecipients find jobs because they have to do this within 2 years of \njoining the program.\n  States can do better if they want to. We are turning over the \nmanagement of these programs to the States because they do a better \njob. We do it by block grants to give the States more freedom to use \ntheir money. We are still going to have food stamp programs and child \nnutrition programs. But these programs as well are going to be \nreformed.\n  Most importantly, individual people have a responsibility, other than \nthe taxpayers, to take first and primary care of their own families. \nAbsentee dads are required to do better in providing for their kids. \nThis in the end will do a better job than our giving government aid to \nthe children in need.\n  We are going to get more for our money. Yet, we also provide for \ngrowth in this program at 4.3 percent annually. What we are hoping for \nhere is to make sure that we provide hope for the future. Families that \nwant self-esteem but do not have it will have the opportunity to \nrestore it again as they work off a system that is a dead end.\n  Part of the hope of the future is not only that we pass this welfare \nreform and do good for people who are on welfare, but we hope that we \nare able to energize this economy so that there are more jobs not only \nfor those who are leaving welfare for work but for people who have \nnever been on welfare. We need to create jobs and good paying jobs at \nthat.\n  We have seen during this administration a 2.4-percent growth, the \nslowest growth of any administration since World War II except the \nadministration of President Nixon. If we had been experiencing the \ngrowth on average that other Presidencies have had, we would have had \nmany more jobs created. And we would not have the situation where \nproductivity growth has averaged a meager six-tenths of a percent per \nyear under President Clinton's tenure compared to the 1 and one-tenth \npercent average pace that we have had since 1973. That productivity per \nworker is going to mean more wages, more job opportunities, and more \ntake-home pay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a number \nof editorials from newspapers in my home State of California in \nopposition to this welfare reform bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Fresno Bee, July 27, 1996]\n\n                        Backward Welfare Reform\n\n       Bills passed by Congress go too far; the president should \n     use his veto pen and demand a better legislative effort.\n       Once again, Congress has passed welfare bills that are more \n     about saving dollars and winning votes than reshaping lives. \n     As much as Americans may want to reform welfare, they don't \n     want a system that goes from a hand-out to the back of the \n     hand.\n       The House bill passed last week and a similar bill passed \n     Tuesday by the Senate would end the 60-year-old federal \n     guarantee of assistance to poor children. In its place, the \n     bills substitute block grants to the states, which would have \n     wide power to set eligibility rules for assistance, but would \n     be required to cut off recipients after two years if they did \n     not find work. Aid over a lifetime would be limited to five \n     years.\n       There's a wide consensus that welfare needs to be converted \n     to a jobs-oriented system. But moving welfare recipients, \n     many of whom lack a high school diploma or marketable skills \n     is a complex and expensive business. The most serious of the \n     state workfare reforms, put forward by Republican governors \n     in Michigan and Wisconsin, recognize that reform must make \n     upfront investments--in things like job training, child care \n     and transportation--if long-term welfare recipients or teen-\n     age mothers are going to move into jobs and achieve self-\n     sufficiency.\n       But the bills passed by Congress are more punitive than \n     supportive. The House bill aims to save $60 billion over the \n     next six yeas. That means many states will not receive \n     adequate federal funds to move welfare recipients into work \n     or to provide expanded assistance in times of recession, when \n     job losses push more families into need.\n       Welfare reform doesn't require shredding the safety net for \n     children and workers; the House bill attacks it with a \n     cleaver. It cuts food stamp dollars and removes eligibility \n     for adults after three months if they aren't working. That \n     means people who worked a lifetime would be left in hunger \n     after three months if severe unemployment, such as California \n     has recently endured, prevented them from finding jobs. The \n     bill would also deny food stamps to legal immigrants, \n     regardless how hard they work.\n       Moderate Republicans and Democrats tried to add protections \n     for children and working families with amendments that \n     provide vouchers for services to children whose parents can't \n     find work after the time limits. But the GOP majority \n     defeated them.\n       Now the last line of defense for decency is once again \n     President Clinton's veto pen. Having twice vetoed bad welfare \n     bills, the president's political advisers are pushing him to \n     sign any welfare bill that looks like it will redeem his 1992 \n     pledge to reform welfare. But Clinton has already proved his \n     welfare reform credentials by approving federal waivers for \n     state reforms. He's already ushered in a new era in social \n     policy around the country.\n       It isn't necessary to sign a bad bill to ``end welfare as \n     we know it''; Clinton should demand a bill that replaces \n     welfare with something more promising than a stingy plan that \n     would put a million more kids in poverty, strap local \n     governments and take the safety net away from millions of \n     working families.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Aug. 1, 1996]\n\n              It's Welfare Reform at California's Expense\n\n       When President Clinton signs the compromise welfare bill, \n     as he says he will, the financial brunt will fall on \n     California, home to more immigrants than any other state. \n     This is unfair to California taxpayers. Immigration is a \n     national issue and its effects should be shouldered evenly. \n     But that's not what's going to happen.\n       At least 40% of all legal immigrants live in this state, \n     and half of those in California reside in Los Angeles County. \n     When needy noncitizens lose their federal benefits under the \n     welfare reform most of them obviously will turn to the \n     counties and the state for assistance. They cannot legally be \n     denied. But how to pay for it?\n       State and county governments are required to provide aid to \n     all needy legal residents. Expect lines of elderly, blind or \n     disabled immigrants at relief agencies, for they will no \n     longer be eligible for federal benefits. Needy noncitizens \n     will also lose access to federal food stamps. All this adds \n     up to general relief at local expense.\n       Immigrants have been popular scapegoats in Congress and \n     were especially so in negotiations on welfare reform. Though \n     the immigrant poor account for a mere 5% of federal social \n     spending, cuts in their benefits are expected to produce 60% \n     of the planned welfare savings. For California, that load off \n     the federal budget could stick state taxpayers with more than \n     $1 billion in new bills.\n       The punishing elements of this welfare reform distract from \n     the positive provisions of the bill, such as greater \n     flexibility for states in designing their own programs to put \n     welfare recipients to work, a major theme of the national \n     reform.\n       Another key compromise allows states to provide non-cash \n     vouches for diapers and other child-care items to welfare \n     mothers who have exhausted the five-year limit on cash \n     benefits under the bill.\n\n[[Page S9369]]\n\n       American children, however, will no longer be entitled to \n     federal subsistence aid simply because their families are \n     poor. The national safety net established by President \n     Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s is, in essence, \n     evaporating. The changes could plunge an estimated 1.1 \n     million children deeper into poverty. Poor parents will be \n     able to receive benefits for two years. A time limit is \n     certainly appropriate, but should recipients be cut off if \n     they are responsibly looking for work?\n       Some of these changes are shameful, but it is the political \n     will of a Congress determined to decentralize the system, \n     partly in response to the pressure of a presidential election \n     year.\n       The threat to legal immigrants, people working and living \n     in the United States under a green card or other protection, \n     is the most obvious fault of the legislation. President \n     Clinton says he believes, as do most Americans, that welfare \n     should be a second chance, not a way of life. But legal \n     immigrants won't get even temporary federal aid, even if they \n     had paid taxes for years before losing a job, losing a limb \n     or losing the income provided by spouse.\n       By signing the welfare reform legislation, Clinton will be \n     able to say he fulfilled a key campaign promise to ``end \n     welfare as we know it.'' But he won't be able to say that he \n     lived up to his more recent assertion that children ``need to \n     come out ahead.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Sacramento Bee, July 30, 1996]\n\n                         Clinton's Welfare Test\n\n       Bill Clinton, the man from Hope, ran for president as the \n     candidate who would do something for children and the \n     forgotten working families who played by the rules but found \n     themselves falling behind in the economic race. But that \n     promise won't mean much if he does not veto the misshapen \n     welfare reform bill headed for his desk.\n       No American leader has spoken more passionately than has \n     Clinton about how the declining wages of workers in the \n     bottom half of the job market have dragged millions of full-\n     time workers and their families into poverty and raised child \n     poverty rates to levels unseen anywhere else in the \n     industrialized world. Yet instead of offering hope and \n     assistance to those struggling families, Congress' pending \n     welfare reform bill delivers them a cruel body blow.\n       Lost in the attention lavished on the bill's overhaul of \n     Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the grant program \n     that goes primarily to single, nonworking mothers of poor \n     children, are the totally unnecessary cuts the legislation \n     would make in food stamps, the key safety net program for \n     low-income working people. According to the Congressional \n     Budget Office, nearly half the $61 billion the bill cuts \n     would come from nutrition programs.\n       Those cuts spell more suffering for families and children. \n     An analysis by the Urban Institute projects that the changes \n     would push 2.6 million more people below the poverty level, \n     1.1 million of them children. Altogether more than 5 million \n     working families would lose an average of $1,000 a year in \n     income if the bill becomes law.\n       There's a widespread consensus that welfare must be \n     reformed to reduce long-term dependency and encourage work \n     and personal responsibility. But the current bill, \n     underfunded and overly punitive, ignores everything we have \n     learned over the last decade about moving welfare recipients \n     into the job market.\n       More than half of welfare recipients lack a high school \n     education at a time when labor markets put a premium on \n     education and skills. Two-thirds live in central cities, \n     places from which employers have fled. At their most \n     successful, past efforts to move welfare recipients into \n     jobs, such as the GAIN program in Riverside County, have \n     reduced welfare rolls by only 10 percent and incomes of \n     welfare recipients by a few hundred dollars a month.\n       Yet the welfare bill requires states to move half of all \n     recipients into jobs, even though, according to Congress' own \n     experts, the bill falls $12 billion shy of full funding for \n     the work program. Even if one heroically assumes that two-\n     thirds of welfare families would find permanent employment, \n     the bill's five-year lifetime limit on benefits would leave 1 \n     million families--adults and children alike--without any \n     source of income.\n       The president knows welfare reform doesn't require the \n     sacrifice of millions of young lives. If Clinton doesn't have \n     the gumption and leadership skills to stand up and explain to \n     the country the difference between real welfare reform and \n     Congress' act of callousness, what differentiates him from \n     his Republican opponents?\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                  [From the Fresno Bee, Aug. 1, 1996]\n\n                      Clinton's Welfare Surrender\n\n       President's reasoning for acquiesing on reform bill, \n     despite ``serious flaws,'' is barely credible and clearly a \n     political calculation.\n       President Clinton eloquently explained Wednesday the flaws \n     in Congress' welfare reform bill. It will punish hundreds of \n     thousands of low-income working families by cutting back \n     their food stamps, he said. It will take away the federal \n     safety net from legal resident workers who have paid their \n     taxes and played by the rules. It will leave vulnerable poor \n     children whose parents can't find jobs within the bill's \n     five-year time limits.\n       And after explaining all the reasons why this bill is \n     wrong, Clinton announced he would sign it. It was the least \n     principled act of a presidency in which principle has often \n     run a poor second.\n       Clinton's rationale for signing the bill, despite its \n     ``serious flaws,'' is barely credible.\n       No one doubts that the welfare reform core of the bill, \n     which turns welfare from a federal entitlement into a block \n     grant for state-designed programs to assist needy families \n     and move them into the workplace, could be passed again by \n     this or subsequent Congresses. There's widespread consensus \n     that the current welfare system is broken.\n       But if Clinton truly believes be can fix the flaws in this \n     bill, he belongs to a very small church. In an era of sound \n     bites and attack ads, what Congress, Democratic or \n     Republican, will soon dare to restore federal safety net \n     programs for legal immigrants, no matter how needy or \n     deserving? At a time of growing budget stringency, what are \n     the chances that Congress, once having slashed food stamp \n     spending, will reverse course and come to the aid of the \n     working poor?\n       No matter how hard he tries to decorate his action with \n     policy arguments, Clinton's decision to sign this bill came \n     down to a brutal political calculation born of a failure of \n     leadership on this issue.\n       Had Clinton made welfare reform a top priority in 1993, he \n     could have shaped the national debate and produced a new \n     system that protected children even as it enforced our values \n     about work and personal responsibility. Instead, he left the \n     issues to be defined by a GOP Congress more intent on budget \n     savings than shaping a humane and workable welfare \n     alternative. He thus put himself in a political position \n     where opposing a bad bill could be made to look like \n     opposition to reform.\n       And now, for his failure of leadership and political nerve, \n     children and the working poor will pay.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, July 22, 1996]\n\n                         Welfare Bill Too Harsh\n\n       Members of the U.S. Senate had a chance Friday to maintain \n     a valid 60-year federal commitment to help the truly needy \n     while still moving toward a work-oriented welfare program. \n     They didn't take it, and unless the lawmakers significantly \n     change direction this week, President Clinton has an \n     obligation to veto the third welfare reform bill that comes \n     before him.\n       Clearly, Clinton wants desperately to sign an election-year \n     bill that will allow him to say he made good on his 1992 \n     campaign promise to ``end welfare as we know it.''\n       And the American public is squarely on the side of both the \n     president and the many members of Congress who want welfare \n     to become a work program and not remain in never-ending \n     handout.\n       But the Republican bill as currently constituted goes way \n     too far in taking away the federal government's duty to see \n     that children do not go hungry or homeless.\n       History shows that states do not always take care of the \n     neediest among us, even when they make the best possible \n     effort to find work. The federal government should maintain \n     authority over welfare programs, a responsibility that would \n     be taken away with the Republican plan to give states welfare \n     money in block grants.\n       On Friday, the Senate turned down Democratic amendments \n     that would have altered the Republican plan to ensure that \n     children could continue to receive federal help even after \n     their parents were cut off.\n       For that reason alone, the bill should be rejected. While \n     the culture of welfare as entitlement clearly must change, \n     wholesale abandonment of the most helpless is not acceptable.\n       The Clinton administration has been liberal in its granting \n     of federal waivers to allow states to try their own get-tough \n     welfare-to-work programs, and the president has said he would \n     continue to allow creative state initiatives.\n       Democrats are going to try again this week to amend the GOP \n     bill. But so far, administrative directives, not legislation, \n     offer the best hope for welfare reform.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n\n\n            [From the San Francisco Examiner, July 24, 1996]\n\n                           Punishing the Poor\n\n       The Dictionary defines ``reform'' as ``to make better'' and \n     ``welfare'' as ``the state of being or doing well,'' It's a \n     pity that corruption of the language hasn't been added to the \n     federal Penal Code. Otherwise, members of the 104th Congress \n     would be sentenced to an afternoon in the stocks, splattered \n     with rotten vegetables.\n       Bad enough that they have produced a package of kick-the-\n     poor legislation that is callous, cruel, marble-hearted and \n     mean spirited. Worse, this vote-pandering measure has been \n     given a supremely cynical label, ``welfare reform.''\n       The richest nation on Earth, with a military budget of $260 \n     billion, is led these days by politicians who assert with a \n     straight face that federal funds for public assistance and \n     support services are causes, not symptoms, of what's wrong \n     with our society.\n       In its latest version, the welfare bill would shop federal \n     funds to each of the 50 states in the hopeful expectation \n     that their governors and legislators can come up with \n     effective programs that will end poverty as we know it. This \n     is not a joke.\n       Conservatives say they want to end the propensity on \n     liberals to throw money at the poor without doing much to \n     beak cycles of dependency. And yet, given the punitive\n\n[[Page S9370]]\n\n     rhetoric by well-fed politicians of both parties, we're not \n     surprised that the expulsion of families from welfare is not \n     accompanied by funds or mandates for training, schooling or \n     child-care programs.\n       Sure, let's get able-bodied men and women off the dole. But \n     let's remember that 9 million children are among the 14 \n     million people who now get monthly survival checks under the \n     federal-state programs called AFDC, or Aid of Families With \n     Dependent Children. Most AFDC parents are single moms, few \n     with job skills or work experience. Perhaps their problems \n     will go away if state bureaucrats replace federal \n     bureaucrats, but we doubt it.\n       It's one thing to want to fix the enormous disappointments \n     and dilemmas of the nation's 60-year-old programs of federal \n     aid to the poor, but it's another for Congress to dump the \n     responsibilities on the states in the name of ``reform.'' \n     This is particularly galling for California, because \n     ``welfare reform'' proposals included a cutoff of social and \n     health services for the state's legal immigrants. And we'll \n     have to make up the difference.\n       ``Reform'' is supposed to make things better, not worse. It \n     doesn't make sense from any viewpoint, including the cry for \n     governmental thrift, to create a terrible situation where \n     children will be forced into orphanages or jails at many \n     times the expense of AFDC. Sen Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y. says \n     the ``reform'' amounts to ``legislative child abuse.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, July 18, 1996]\n\n                      Passing the Buck on Welfare\n\n       Tucked into the Republicans' welfare reform package in \n     Congress is a wrongheaded proposal to cut benefits and social \n     services to most immigrants who are legally in the United \n     States but who have not yet become citizens. Under the \n     proposal, Washington, which is seeking ways to finance \n     federal welfare reform, would shift billions of dollars in \n     costs to states and counties. The provision should be \n     rejected.\n       Sen. Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat, plans to offer an \n     amendment to the bill to strike out restrictions on public \n     benefits to legal immigrants. a host of eligibility issues \n     ranging from student aid to Medicaid for legal immigrants \n     already is part of a separate immigration bill now in \n     conference committee. There is no logic in including those \n     matters in a welfare bill. The two issues should be handled \n     separately.\n       The welfare bill now proposes to help finance the costs of \n     reform by cutting $23 billion over six years in benefits to \n     legal immigrants, including children and the elderly. This \n     would be an unfair and punitive move against legal immigrants \n     who have played by the rules.\n       The bill would make most legal immigrants now in the \n     country ineligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and \n     food stamps. Future legal immigrants (except for refugees and \n     asylum seekers) would be ineligible for most other federal \n     means-tested benefits (including AFDC and nonemergency \n     Medicaid services) during their first five years in the \n     country.\n       The cutbacks would disproportionately hit California, \n     Florida, New York and Texas, the states with the biggest \n     immigrant populations. California alone could lose $10 \n     billion, or about 40% of the proposed $23 billion in benefit \n     reductions. Those ineligible for such benefits would have to \n     turn elsewhere for aid. In Los Angeles County, for example, \n     if all affected SSI recipients sought general assistance \n     relief instead it would cost the county $236 million \n     annually. The cost shifting could have potentially disastrous \n     results for the already fiscally strapped county.\n       The immigration bill now under consideration already \n     includes $5.6 billion in savings from tightening eligibility \n     requirements for legal immigrants on a variety of federal \n     programs, including Medicaid. the attempt to use welfare \n     reform to slip through further curbs on public assistance to \n     legal immigrants should be called what it is--a deplorable \n     money grab by Washington that can only hurt California.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I am putting in the Record a number of editorials.\n  From the Fresno Bee in the conservative heartland of my State that \nsays:\n\n       Once again, Congress has passed welfare bills that are more \n     about saving dollars and winning votes than reshaping lives.\n\n  The Los Angeles Times wrote:\n\n       The financial brunt will fall on California, home to more \n     immigrants than any other State. This is unfair to California \n     taxpayers. Immigration is a national issue and its effects \n     should be shouldered evenly.\n\n  In another L.A. Times editorial:\n\n       Passing the Buck on Welfare. U.S. provision affecting \n     immigrants would hit States and counties.\n\n  The one from the San Francisco Examiner:\n\n       Punishing the poor.\n\n  San Francisco Chronicle:\n\n       Welfare Bill Too Harsh. Wholesale desertion of the most \n     helpless is not acceptable.\n\n  And they go on.\n  So, today I stand here for welfare reform but against this bill. I am \nvoting no, because I am not for punishing kids, and I am not for \npunishing California or other States that have most of our legal \nimmigrants.\n  Saying that I am for welfare reform but against this bill is not \ninconsistent. My desire for reform was expressed by my vote for the \nSenate welfare bill last year in the two Democratic leadership welfare \nreform proposals. Mr. President, those bills were tough on work, \ncompassionate to children, and cracked down on parents who were \nirresponsible.\n  It was interesting to note the Senator from Iowa talking about how \nthis bill goes after deadbeat dads. Well, I want to note that my \ndeadbeat parent amendment which unanimously passed in the Senate bill \nlast year is gone from this bill. My amendment would have cut off \nbenefits to deadbeat parents who refuse to pay their overdue child \nsupport. I think the proponents of this bill seem to be more interested \nin getting tough with the kids than their deadbeat parents.\n  The provisions to cut assistance to legal immigrants will cost \nCalifornia an estimated $9 to $10 billion over the 6 years of the bill. \nOf all the legal immigrants in the United States on supplemental \nsecurity income, which is help to the aged, blind, and disabled, and of \nthose on AFDC, which is help for families with children, 52 percent \nlive in my home State of California. Among those who would be cut off \nare elderly immigrants who are too disabled to naturalize and young \nlegal immigrant children.\n\n  Let us face it. For every move we make, there is a counter move. For \nevery action we take, there is a reaction. And speaking as a former \ncounty supervisor from the County of Marin, I can tell you at the \nbottom line it will be California's counties that will feel the brunt. \nWhen your county supervisors come in to see you to tell you about the \nincrease in homelessness and helplessness, I hope then at least you \nwill be ready to take some action.\n  In Los Angeles County, the effects will be staggering. Senator \nFeinstein and I have been contacted by their elected officials. In Los \nAngeles, 190,000 legal residents could be cut off of AFDC; 93,000 legal \nresidents will lose SSI, which is assistance for the aged, the blind, \nand the disabled; 250,000 legal residents will lose their food stamps; \nand 240,000 legal residents could lose their Medicaid.\n  Los Angeles County could be faced with a cost shift of $236 million \nper year under this bill. And if the State of California opts to bar \nMedicaid coverage to legal immigrants, it could shift an additional \n$100 million per year to the County of Los Angeles.\n  The conference report will place California at serious risk of a huge \nnegative impact on health services. Again, for every action there is a \nreaction. Our public hospitals and our children's hospitals that got \nreimbursed for these medical costs will no doubt have to downsize, shut \ndown, cut back, and shift costs. And the bottom line is, if legal \nimmigrants cannot receive Medicaid, all Californians and all Americans \nwill be placed at greater risk of communicable diseases because these \npeople will not be treated.\n  Senator Feinstein and I worked hard on an amendment which said this \nvery simply. This is a massive change of law. Let us phase in the \nchanges to our legal immigrants. Many of these legal immigrants came \nhere escaping persecution. Many of them do not have sponsors to pick up \nthe tab. They have no one else to turn to. If we are going to change \nthe rules, Senator Feinstein and I said, make it prospective. \nUnfortunately, the conference report did not move in that direction.\n  It really amazes me to think about the message we are sending to an \nasylee or a refugee who risked their life to get to this country. Many \nof them are working. Many of them are paying taxes, and doing well. If \nthey fall on hard times, they are out. They are out of luck. And the \ncosts will be shifted to the counties.\n  Many of these legal immigrants are children. We profess to care about \nchildren. Look in the eyes of a child before you cast this vote, \nbecause this bill will subject even more children to poverty.\n  I have to tell you, the Urban Institute says more than 1 million \nchildren will be thrust into poverty under this bill. I hope that we \ncan move quickly after this bill passes and is signed--and we know that \nis going to happen--to soften the blow on children.\n\n[[Page S9371]]\n\n  I could not believe when this Senate turned down the Breaux-Chafee \namendment. The Breaux-Chafee amendment did not get the 60 votes it \nneeded. Do you know what it said? That if little children are cut off \nbecause for some reason their parents cannot find work within the \nmandated time period, children cannot get any help to get diapers; they \ncannot get any help to get special medicine, school supplies, or other \nnecessary items.\n  This is the United States of America. We know that a nation is judged \nby how it treats its most vulnerable people. And I do not think it asks \nvery much of very healthy U.S. Senators with big fat paychecks, big fat \npaychecks, to provide for vouchers for a baby who is unfortunate enough \nto be in a family with a mom who, even if she tries every day, cannot \nland a job. That was it for me.\n  I thank my colleagues very much for bearing with me. This bill is not \nfair to my State. That is clear. That is why nearly every major \nnewspaper in California has said it is wrong. This bill is not fair to \ninnocent children. For that reason, I stand here for welfare reform and \nagainst this bill which will bring harm to children and which will \nbring harm to my State. I hope we can mitigate its ill effects.\n\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would appreciate it if I could be \nnotified when I have 1 minute remaining.\n  I am pleased today to speak in behalf of the welfare proposal which \ncame from conference. It is a good bill, and while there are areas \nwhich still could be improved, overall I think it is a positive first \nstep toward real welfare reform. Indeed, it does represent a \ncompromise. The administration had some thoughts they contributed. \nObviously, the House did, and clearly, of course, the Senate did.\n  We can no longer continue the current welfare system. I think that is \nclear. This system has encouraged long-term dependency, and that has \nbeen addressed several times this afternoon and this morning. There is \none thing we all know, that the surest prescription for a life of \npoverty is to be born to young, to unmarried, and to poor parents. It \nis time to give the States a chance to improve the lives of all these \npoor families.\n  This bill does that. It turns the AFDC Program over to the States and \nallows them, the States, to create programs suited to the needs of the \nresidents of those States. We are doing this with very few restrictions \non the States. Indeed, we can practically rattle off the restrictions. \nThe States will be required to impose time limits on benefits. The \nStates will have to meet tough work participation rates. But how they \nachieve these goals is left almost entirely to the State and to the \nlocal government.\n  I would like to see more Federal oversight of the program. I was on \nthe conference. I presented my views but did not prevail in that \nparticular area.\n  The Governors insist that they will do the right thing and we ought \nto have confidence in them. I am hopeful, indeed optimistic, that they \nwill, but I certainly will be keeping a close eye on the progress in \nthis area.\n  While we are giving the States maximum flexibility, there are several \nimportant protections in this bill. First, we have ensured that \nfamilies who lose cash benefits because of changes in the State's cash \nassistance program, those families will still be entitled to receive \nMedicaid. If the State goes down, lowers the level at which an \nindividual can qualify for cash assistance, the families still receive \nMedicaid based on the old formula. This is the critical provision for \nthe success of welfare reform.\n  In the last 2 years, in the Finance Committee welfare reform \nhearings, one thing we heard over and over is that we cannot pull the \nrug out from beneath these poor families. In order to be able to \nsupport themselves, they must have Medicaid coverage. I am very pleased \nthat this bill includes the amendment Senator Breaux and I sponsored to \ncontinue Medicaid coverage for these individuals.\n  Earlier versions of welfare reform included block grants in several \nchild welfare and foster care programs. I have long believed that \ndespite the name ``child welfare''--that is a misnomer, Mr. President. \nChild welfare is not a cash or an in-kind assistance to poor families. \nChild welfare programs deal with abused children. It deals with \nneglected children regardless of their income. It does not have \nanything to do with a poor child. Child welfare programs deal with \nneglected and abused children regardless of income.\n  So, child welfare has no place in a welfare reform bill, and I am \npleased we were able to have those block grants removed. We stay with \nthe present entitlement system in the child welfare program.\n  The present welfare bill has also made more cuts to the children's \nSSI program than I would have liked to have seen. That is the way it \nstarted off, with rather severe cuts. This bill is much less damaging \nin that area. It does tighten the eligibility for participation in \nchildren's SSI programs, but retains cash assistance for those children \nwho remain eligible. This is the right thing to do. These families are \nunder enormous strains, families with SSI children, and they need the \nbenefits, the cash assistance that comes so they can care for those \nchildren. I want to pay special tribute to Senator Conrad, who worked \nwith me and others to achieve this compromise.\n  Welfare, as we know, has always been a shared responsibility between \nthe States and the Federal Government. That will continue under this \nbill. It is true that States ought to have a financial incentive to \nreduce the welfare caseloads. We all agree with that. However, when \nthey are reducing these caseloads, they should benefit from it, but \nalso the Federal Government ought to benefit from it, too. That is why \nwe provide that, if the States reduce their spending below a percentage \nmark, Federal dollars will be reduced likewise. In other words, the \nFederal Government will share in the savings.\n  There is one thing that does bother me about this bill, and that is \nthe denial of benefits to legal immigrants. I think the bill is harsh \nin that area. We made some improvements, in other words we made it less \nharsh, because we allow States to decide whether to extend Medicaid \ncoverage to legal immigrants. In other words, the States still have the \noption to extend Medicaid coverage to legal immigrants.\n  I had hoped during the legislative process, consideration here and \nthe conference, we might have mitigated some of the harsher provisions, \nespecially those affecting currently elderly and currently disabled \nrecipients. I think it is very tough to take away some of the benefits \nof those individuals that they are currently enjoying.\n  In closing, I congratulate those who worked so hard to reach this \nagreement. Former Senator Dole deserves a lot of credit for laying the \ngroundwork for this bill. Senator Roth picked up after Senator Dole \nleft and helped steer this bill through the Senate. On the other side \nof the aisle, my colleague from the centrist coalition, my colleague \nSenator Breaux, did splendid work to forge a compromise between the two \nparties.\n  On the other side of the Capitol, Congressman Shaw and Congressman \nArcher were dedicated to this cause for some time and deserve a lot of \ncredit. So my congratulations to each and all, and to all here who \nworked hard to make this bill a success, the success I believe it can \nbe. It is not perfect. We all recognize that. But there are a lot of \nvery fine provisions in this bill.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the time is on the other side now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to indicate that I will \nsupport this welfare reform legislation. I do it with some \nreservations. I think anybody who has been deeply involved in this \nprocess understands that there are weaknesses in this legislation and \nthat there are risks. But, make no mistake, there are risks in sticking \nwith the status quo. The status quo cannot be defended. The current \nsystem does not work and is unlikely to work in the future.\n\n  I have visited with literally dozens of welfare recipients and with \npeople who\n\n[[Page S9372]]\n\nwork in the current welfare system. I cannot find anyone who believes \nthe current system is a good one. I cannot find taxpayers who support \nit, who believe in it. I cannot find welfare recipients who believe in \nit. I cannot find the people who work to deliver the services who \nbelieve in it. Without exception they say to me, ``There has to be a \nbetter way.'' I do not know if we found the best way in this welfare \nreform legislation, but I do know it is time to try something \ndifferent.\n  I have concluded from my conversations with welfare recipients that \nthere is very little question that the current system is encouraging \nchildren to have children. I do not know how one can conclude \notherwise. When we set up a system in which we say to a young woman, in \nmany cases a child, that if you leave home, we will see that you have \nan apartment, that you get assistance, the precondition is that you \nhave a child, what kind of system have we set up here? I talked to one \nof my colleagues who met with a number of welfare mothers in the last \nseveral weeks. He asked them the direct question, ``Did the fact that \nthere is a welfare system that you knew would support you and provide \nan apartment to you encourage you to have a child?'' About half of them \ndenied that it contributed to their decision, but about half of them \nsaid, ``Yes, Senator, it did contribute to my making the decision to \nhave a child, because I knew I could get an apartment, I could get \nassistance, and that I could move away from a family situation.'' In \nmany cases that family situation is not a very pleasant one.\n  That does not make sense for our society, to have structured a system \nthat encourages children to have children. That is a disaster. I say to \nmy colleagues who have talked about their concern for children, and in \nevery case I believe they are well motivated and feel deeply that we \nneed to protect children, I share in that belief. The question is, how \nwe do it? It is not in children's interests to be born to children. \nThat is a disaster. We know what happens in those circumstances. In \ncase after case it leads to more poverty, more crime, more abuse. \nChildren are not prepared to have children. We need to take away the \nincentive that is in the current system for that to occur.\n  There are many parts of this bill that concern me. I believe the \npercentage that is allowed for hardship cases, and therefore exempt \nfrom the time limits, is unrealistic. I think that is going to have to \nbe revisited in the future. I personally believe there are marginal \npeople in our society, people who, either because of mental disability \nor physical disability, simply are unable to hold full-time employment. \nA 20-percent hardship exemption is not sufficient to cope with the \npercentage of our population that simply will never be fully \nemployable. I think we are going to have to revisit that issue.\n  But there has been much done to improve this legislation from where \nit started. I was very pleased my amendment to maintain a Federal \nsafety net in the food assistance programs was adopted here on the \nSenate floor and was kept in conference. I think that is critically \nimportant. That provides the food safety net for millions of Americans, \none that adjusts automatically for natural disasters or severe economic \ndownturns.\n  I also think the provisions that were adopted that were offered by \nSenator Chafee and Senator Breaux to maintain the Medicaid coverage was \ncritically important to this legislation.\n  I salute my colleagues, Senator Chafee and Senator Breaux, for their \namendment. That was maintained largely intact in conference and was \ncritically important.\n  So, Mr. President, there are defects here. I think we all recognize \nthat. I think we all understand that this is going to have to be \nrevisited. But we have also heard from the Nation's Governors. They \nhave told us, ``You can trust us, we are going to be responsible with \nthis charge.''\n  I say to them, we will be watching, we will be watching very \ncarefully what you do, and we urge you to step forward and shoulder \nthis responsibility with great seriousness.\n  They have insisted there is not the flexibility and the resources to \naddress the problems of poverty and welfare without these changes. They \nhave assured Congress and the American people they care as much about \nthe well-being of children and other vulnerable populations as Federal \nrepresentatives and that they are in a better situation to target these \nresources. We take them at their word. They have pledged to protect \nthese populations, and Congress is going to hold them to their word.\n  While this bill gives States flexibility they insist they need to end \nthe problems associated with welfare, I want to be clear. Congress \nmaintains the right and the duty to intervene in the future if States, \nin fact, do not live up to their word and run their programs in an \narbitrary or capricious manner.\n  We are counting on the States to live up to this responsibility. I \ntake them at their word, and I have confidence that in each of the \nStates, the Governor and the State legislature will step forward to \nshoulder these obligations in a serious and responsible way.\n  I am confident that in my home State of North Dakota that will be the \ncase. I conclude by saying to my colleagues, in looking at the risk \nassociated with any change, clearly there is a cause for concern, but \nthe status quo cannot be defended. It is time for a change. The time is \nnow. We will have other opportunities to address shortcomings in this \nlegislation. I intend to support this bill.\n  I thank the Chair and yield back any time I have remaining.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the junior Senator \nfrom Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, with the passage of this welfare reform \nlegislation, I think we can confidently state that the New Deal is old \nnews. As we all know, this legislation will end the Federal \nGovernment's entitlement to welfare, an entitlement created 6 decades \nago during the New Deal. Yet, the reason that it must be overturned is \nfound in the reasoning of Franklin Roosevelt himself who said, ``When \nany man or woman goes on the dole, something happens to them mentally, \nand the quicker they're taken off the dole the better it is for them \nthe rest of their lives.''\n  He added: ``We must preserve not only the bodies of the unemployed \nfrom destitution, but also their self-respect, their self-reliance, and \ncourage and determination.''\n  The welfare reforms that we will pass today are designed not just to \nsave money and reduce waste, although those are important goals, but \nthey are also designed to help restore certain basic values: self-\nrespect and self-reliance.\n  Some critics have claimed that these welfare reforms will lead to \ncatastrophe. Mr. President, I suggest the catastrophe has already \narrived. It is obvious in an exploding population of fatherless \nchildren, rising violence in our cities and streets, suburbs and rural \ntowns, endless dependence and fractured families. No one can honestly \ndefend the current system as compassionate. No one can be proud of the \nresults of the last 30 years. We are tired of good intentions and \ndismal results. We need to take another path.\n\n  This legislation that we are proposing is not experimental nor it is \nnot untested. It is rooted in proven principles of American tradition. \nIt transfers powers to the States where that power should have belonged \nall along. It emphasizes the dignity of work. It shows compassion, but \nit also expects individual responsibility, and it begins to encourage \nprivate and religious institutions as partners in social renewal.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the personal responsibility \nagreements that I authored, along with Senator Harkin, are part of this \nfinal welfare package. States like Indiana and Iowa have used these \nagreements as effective tools, moving thousands of citizens from \nwelfare to work. The welfare bill we are passing today gives States the \noptions to include those personal responsibility agreements in their \nwelfare programs, and I hope they will follow the examples of Indiana \nand Iowa.\n  I have argued in the past, Mr. President, that devolution of power to \nthe State governments is necessary but not complete. Such devolution \nencourages innovation, but State government is still government, prone \nto the same problems of ineffective bureaucracy and red tape that we \nsee in Washington, and that is why I am glad this legislation gives \nStates the opportunity\n\n[[Page S9373]]\n\nand the option to contract with faith-based organizations without \nforcing those institutions to compromise their spiritual identity. \nThis, I believe, is the beginning of an important idea.\n  It is also important to remember that the reforms that we are passing \ntoday directly affect human lives. That is the only measure of our \nachievement. I am convinced on the evidence of 3 decades that people \nneed independence, work, responsibility and hope far more than they \nneed endless checks from the Federal Government.\n  Our current system treats the disadvantaged as merely material, to be \nfed and forgotten. We need to be treating them as human beings with \nhigh hopes and high potential. When you expect nothing of an \nindividual, you belittle them. We must stop belittling the able-bodied \npoor in America with low expectations.\n  Mr. President, I argue that there is a next step to welfare reform, a \nstep that this Congress and this President, or whoever occupies the \nPresidency, needs to address in the next Congress. We need to go beyond \nGovernment. We need to begin to encourage and strengthen, nurture and \nexpand those mediating institutions of family, community, volunteer \nassociations of charity, of church, faith-based charities--those \ninstitutions that offer real solutions and real hope.\n  We need to begin to look at transforming our society by transforming \nlives one at a time inside out. For the most part, this is work that \ncannot be done by institutions of government. Government can feed the \nbody and help train the mind, but it cannot nurture the soul or renew \nthe spirit. This is the work of institutions outside of government.\n  This shift of authority in resources can be accomplished in many \nways, but we need to recognize tradition and the time-honored practice \nof reaching out to the poor in effective ways, giving them renewed \nhope, renewed spirit, a renewed place in American society. It has not \nbeen accomplished in an effective way by institutions of government but \ncan be effective by institutions outside of government.\n\n  How do we make this transition? Because it will be a transition, and \nnormally the problem is such that it will require a significant \nincrease in the involvement of these institutions. But it is important \nbecause they are the institutions that bring about the real solutions \nand bring about real hope.\n  I propose the charity tax credit as a means of beginning this \nprocess, a way in which the taxpayer can designate on a joint basis up \nto $1,000 of taxes otherwise due the Government as charitable \ncontributions to institutions that have dedicated themselves to the \nproposition of alleviating or preventing poverty.\n  Who wouldn't rather give $1,000 of their hard-earned money to \ninstitutions like Habitat for Humanity, rather than Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, if you really care about providing decent, affordable \nhousing to low-income individuals?\n  For those concerned about fatherless children, who wouldn't believe \nthat $1,000 of their money would be better served through Boys and \nGirls Clubs or Big Brothers and Big Sisters or other mentoring \norganizations, rather than giving it to ``Big Brother'' in Washington?\n  For those concerned about the homeless on our streets, who wouldn't \nrather support the gospel missions and church feeding programs, \nCatholic Charities and other organizations that reach out to those in \nour local communities, rather than turning the money over to HHS, \nwhere, by some estimates, over two-thirds of the money fueled by the \nFederal social welfare system never goes to the poor? It goes to those \nabove the poverty line; it gets eaten up in bureaucracy, \nadministration, fraud, and abuse. It has created a compassion fatigue \nin this country where people have no faith that their tax dollars, \nsometimes generously given and well-intended to help those most in \nneed, ever reach those most in need.\n  This is a stark alternative that can be provided to the individual \nwithout the constraints of the first amendment. They can give it to \nsecular or nonsecular institutions, faith-based institutions which have \nproven and demonstrated their capability of providing services to the \npoor far more effectively, with far better results, at a fraction of \nthe cost of Government.\n  These are the institutions that we need to strengthen. And this, I \nhope, will be the agenda of the next Congress as we move to the next \nstep of welfare reform, to defining compassion in an effective way, the \nspirit of the American people, which has always been generous, which \nhas always reached out to help those in need, which responds to \nemergencies time and time again, which provides and allows grain \nfarmers from the Midwest to ship grain down to famine areas and drought \nareas of other areas of our country, which cause people to jump on \nplanes and trains and buses and go to the latest hurricane area or \nravaged area to pitch in, on a volunteer basis, to help their fellows \nAmericans.\n  We are a country of generous spirit, yet a country that has lost \nconfidence in the ability of Government to effectively deliver \ncompassion to those in need. So let use energize, renew and strengthen \nand nourish and encourage those institutions in our own communities \nthat are making a difference in people's lives.\n\n  Community activist Robert Woodson makes the point that,\n\n       . . . every social problem [in America], no matter how \n     severe, is currently being defeated somewhere, by some \n     religious or community group. This is one of America's great, \n     untold stories. No alternative approach to our cultural \n     crisis holds such promise, because these institutions have \n     resources denied to government at every level--[the resources \n     of] love, spiritual vitality, and true compassion. It is time \n     to publicly, creatively, and actively take their side in the \n     struggle to recivilize American society.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is clear that most Americans agree we \nneed to change welfare as we know it. Our current system does not work, \nnot for those on public assistance and not for those who pay for it.\n  The American people feel strongly that personal responsibility has to \nbe a part of this country's welfare system. I could not agree more.\n  Mr. President, for nearly 4 years I have spent countless hours \nexamining the current welfare structure, talking to participants and \nlistening to the frustrations of both reformers and people on public \nassistance.\n\n  This Senate has debated many ideas for welfare reform. I have worked \nwith my colleagues to do everything possible to help create a welfare \nbill that will move able-bodied adults off welfare and into work. The \ntransition from welfare to work is the core of this policy debate. But \nmy concern is this. We are creating a system in which people will not \nget a welfare check, but they will not be able to get a paycheck \neither.\n  If people leave welfare, but are not qualified or cannot find work, \nthey are faced with one fundamental problem: The grocery bill is still \nthere, and there is no way to feed their kids.\n  My vote on this final welfare bill is one of the most difficult I \nhave had to cast. There are no easy answers. I want welfare to be \nreformed. I hear from those recipients who complain that the current \nsystem does not work. There is too little job training. There is too \nlittle child care. And the programs try to fit every single welfare \nrecipient into one single mold.\n  As this bill worked its way through the Senate and House, I have \nsponsored and cosponsored numerous amendments to protect the well-being \nof children, from preventive and emergency health care, nutritious \nmeals, safe child care, illiteracy, issues that are important because \nthey affect the ability of parents to move successfully from welfare to \nwork while they are still taking care of their own kids.\n  I agree with President Clinton that this welfare reform bill makes \nsignificant strides toward ending welfare as we know it. It will help \nput some people back to work and end the cycle of dependency that this \nsystem is accused of breeding. It will give more flexibility to the \nStates and allow for more local decisionmaking authority.\n  But I also agree with President Clinton that this bill has serious \nflaws.\n\n[[Page S9374]]\n\n Nine million children will be cut off from services. Legal immigrant \nchildren will be ineligible for almost all Federal and State services, \nother than in an emergency, leaving them hungry, uneducated and \ndesperate on our streets.\n  One-half of the $60 billion cut in spending will come from nutrition \nprograms. It will have a dramatic impact on the very individuals who \nneed the most help today in this country, and that is our children.\n  It has been clear for quite some time that this bill is going to be \npassed by an overwhelming majority and signed by the President, but I \nrealize that I cannot in good conscience support a bill that will put \nso many of our children in jeopardy.\n  Mr. President, I am the only former preschool teacher to serve in the \nU.S. Senate. I have looked into the faces of 2- and 3- and 4-year-olds \nwho are hungry every single day. I have worked as a parent education \ninstructor with adults who have lost their jobs. Food stamps provided \nthe only chance they had to feed their children while they desperately \nwere looking for work. I knew immediately when a child in my class was \nunable to learn and felt frightened because of tough financial times at \nhome, and I saw the effects those kids had on all the other kids in my \nclassroom.\n  Many times I have sat and listened to young women whose lives have \nbeen devastated. They have been left alone to care for young children. \nThey have no job skills and no ability to go to work because their \nfull-time job was being a mom.\n\n  For me, the bottom line in the welfare reform discussion is, what \nwill happen to our Nation's children? What will happen to those \nchildren I held in my lap in my preschool? For me, it is a risk that I \nam not willing to take.\n  It is vital that parents return to work. But we have to help ensure \nthat our children receive adequate health care, nutrition, and are not \nleft home alone or, worse, to wander on our streets.\n  When this welfare reform proposal passes, we have to ask, what is \nnext? This bill only tells people what the Federal Government will not \ndo anymore. In its place will come 50 different experiments in 50 \ndifferent States. It may help some people, and it most certainly will \nhurt others. But whether it works or not, from this day forward I \nbelieve that we have to begin a national commitment to our children and \nto give them a fair chance, every one of them, at succeeding in life.\n  We all want a country where every child is secure, where every person \ncan be a contributing member of our society and our economy, and where \nthe world around us is a healthy and safe place to live. No one \ndisagrees with that. To make sure it happens, we have to start a \ndiscussion in every single community and neighborhood and every single \ndinner table in this Nation. We have to ask, what is important to us as \nAmericans? Are we going to be a compassionate Nation? When push comes \nto shove, are we going to help our neighbors when they need it? And if, \nas I suspect, the answer is yes, we are going to have to say how. In \nthe aftermath of this welfare reform bill, these are the questions that \nevery one of us as adults in this country will have to answer.\n  I am not going to dwell on changes brought about in this welfare \nreform. Instead, I am going to aggressively seek answers to the \nquestions I have raised, and I will reaffirm my own commitment to \nchildren. I will work for constructive solutions to problems that arise \nin the future.\n  I have already formed a bipartisan working group within the Senate to \nhelp develop and create ideas to help adults find more time to spend \nwith our young children. And I formed an advisory group at home in \nWashington on youth involvement to help support this effort. Hopefully, \nthe people of this country will ultimately work to create the kind of \ncommunities that we can all be proud of.\n  But, Mr. President, one good thing will come out of this for sure \nthat will happen as a result of us passing welfare reform. Finally, we \nwill no longer, either here on the floor of the Senate or in living \nrooms across this country, be able to blame welfare as the cause of our \nNation's problems. After today, instead, perhaps, we can all sit down \nand work to agree on what we can do to keep our young children in this \ncountry healthy and secure and educated and growing up in a country \nthat we are all proud of.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I wish to rise in support of this welfare proposal, and I \ncongratulate the Members of the Senate who have worked so hard.\n  I want to mention three reasons why I think this is an appropriate \naction to take. First, this is one of the five major programs which is \nweighing down the Federal budget and which is causing us to careen \ntowards bankruptcy as a Nation in the beginning of the next century if \nwe do not address the Federal spending patterns. The other four are the \nfarm programs, the Medicare and Medicaid Programs, and Social Security.\n  We have addressed the farm programs. Now we are addressing the \nwelfare programs. That is two out of the five major entitlement \nprograms that will be addressed as a result of this bill by this \nCongress. That is a major step forward. If this were a game of Myst--\nwhich it is not, but it is as complicated as a game of Myst--we would \nhave gotten through two levels. We have three levels to go and, \nhopefully, we will continue to pursue those aggressively.\n  The bill involves returning to the States significant flexibility \nover managing the welfare accounts. This means better services for our \ncitizens. It is that simple. There is a certain arrogance in this town, \na certain elitism in this town that tends to believe all the ideas, all \nthe feelings of goodness, all the compassion is confined within the \ncorridors of Washington. Well, it is not true. The fact is, in our \nStates at our State legislative level and in our cities and at our \ncounty level, there is not only great compassion but there is an \nextraordinary knowledge. That knowledge and compassion would be brought \nto bear on the welfare programs of this country as a result of this \nbill.\n  I know, for example, that in New Hampshire we will get a lot more \nservices for actually less dollars, and our people will be better taken \ncare of as a result of this flexibility being returned to the States.\n  Third, there is the cultural issue. This represents a significant \ncultural change in the way we address the issue of welfare in this \ncountry. We are no longer creating this atmosphere of dependency. We \nare no longer undermining generation after generation of individuals \nrelative to their own self-worth. We are saying to people: ``You are \nimportant, you do have self-worth, you should have self-respect, you \nshould be working and taking care of yourself and your families and \nobtaining the personal respect and confidence that comes from \nundertaking that approach.'' It is a cultural shift.\n  Obviously, it will not impact the entire culture. Obviously, there \nare a lot of people on welfare who deserve to be there. For some \npercentage, and it will not be a dramatic percentage, I admit to that, \nthey will be moving off the welfare rolls because they will have to go \nto work, something they have not done before. That will be very \npositive, I think, for them and for this society generally.\n  So I believe this is a very good bill and something that takes us in \nthe right direction in the area of fiscal solvency, in the area of \nmanaging government policy through flexibility at the State level, and \nin the area of how we approach the cultural issue of caring for people \nwho are less fortunate or in hard times.\n  I also want to address today just briefly, because it is a topic that \nI am intimately involved with as chairman of the Commerce, State, and \nJustice Committee, the issue of terrorism--one minor area, a secondary \npoint to what is going on here today, but I want to raise this point at \nthis time.\n  We just reported out of the full Appropriations Committee a bill, the \nCommerce, State, Justice bill, which had a major initiative in the area \nof terrorism, countering terrorism, trying to get some comprehensive \nplanning into the issue of how we approach it as a Federal Government, \nand beefing up those projects that are going on in those agencies, such \nas the FBI, that are trying to counter especially international \nterrorism. It is a major step\n\n[[Page S9375]]\n\nforward. We have actually been working on this for months. It is ironic \nit came to fruition today, so soon after the Atlanta bombing, but it is \na very important step.\n  Second, we cannot do all this at the Federal level. The issue of \ncountering terrorism cannot entirely be accomplished by the Government. \nThere has to be a change of attitude within our population as to how we \napproach the terrorists.\n  I made a proposal today which I think moves along that issue a little \nbit--not dramatically, but a little bit--but it is important. We see on \nthe Internet today a massive amount of information about how to make \nweapons, how to make bombs, how to use instruments of death. Now, the \nInternet is a Wild West of information. I have no interest in \nregulating it. I think that would be a mistake. There are, today, \ndeveloping a whole series of industries that develop the information \nand information access in the area of Internet, people like America \nOnline, Comp USA, Yahoo, Netscape, Magellan--the list goes on and on.\n  What I have done today is write a letter to the CEO's of these \nvarious organizations and asked them to exercise a little common sense \nand a little community value and to expunge from their database access \ncapability of items which are clearly directed at creating bombs. I had \nmy staff quickly run the Internet. I wanted to do it quickly, so I had \nmy staff do it. They came up with, on their first test under the \nquestion of ``explosive,'' they came up with an identification of how \nto make a bomb, which was followed by ``leaving your bomb in your \nfavorite airport and Government building.''\n  That is the type of information that should not be accessed easily \nthrough some sort of accessing agency. So I have asked the leaders of \nthese various industries to think about it, to think about putting into \ntheir processes some sort of self-voluntary block that eliminates the \nability to easily access this type of information which is so patently \ninappropriate. I hope they will take such action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. I commend my colleague from New Hampshire. I hope everyone \nlistens to his last remarks on this subject matter and that people will \nheed his advice. This is a serious matter.\n  Our colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, yesterday I think, made \nsimilar comments and brought to the floor the documentation that came \noff computers on this information. I think his advice is extremely \nworthwhile.\n  Mr. GREGG. I can show the Senator a copy of the letter and have him \nbe a cosponsor, as well as any other Senators.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  I first want to very much thank my colleague from California, Senator \nFeinstein, and Senator Dodd of Connecticut for very generously and \ngraciously yielding me their time and allowing me to proceed ahead of \nthem. I thank the Senators.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of welfare reform. The \nwelfare reform debate is emotional, we all know that. It is complex, \nthat is clear. But I must say I find almost universal agreement that \ntoday's Federal welfare program does not do what we would expect of a \nwelfare system.\n  It does not help people get back on their feet and back to work. It \ndoes not promote worth or promote personal responsibility or self-\nsufficiency. Most of us envisioned a different system, a welfare system \nthat encourages personal responsibility, one that encourages work and \nself-sufficiency, one that lets States like Montana create their own \nsystems that make sense to their State's own unique problems, one that \nprotects children, helps keep families together, prevents communities \nfrom deteriorating, and is fair to taxpayers.\n  The Nation's welfare problems took a long time to develop, and they \nwill take some time to solve. Our solutions will not come overnight. We \nhave to work on them. I believe this proposal is a clean break with the \npast and a good start for the future. It is based on two essential \nelements that encourage work and self-sufficiency.\n  First, there will be a time limit on welfare assistance to make sure \nthat people have an incentive to leave welfare and move to work; \nsecond, we will remove some obstacles that now deter people on welfare \nfrom moving to work. They will have more help available for child care, \nand Medicaid will still be there to provide basic health care.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that the imminent passage of the increase \nin minimum wage will be a big boom, will be a big part of the solution \nto welfare reform.\n  On the whole, I believe this effort reflects the views and values of \nMontanans and of Americans. Undoubtedly, it is not perfect, and we can \nlearn from experience. We can and will improve it as time goes by. \nHowever, it is a good start and a step we have to take.\n  Finally, I am glad that the President has chosen to sign it. It was \nnot an easy decision. But it is time that the system reflects the \nconsensus now existing in America for welfare reform. I believe this \nbill is a good start. It is not perfect. Nothing is perfect. But we \ncannot let perfection be the envy of the good. It is a good start, and \nI believe we will have many opportunities to improve upon it as days, \nmonths, and years go by.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield myself up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this is landmark legislation, and it is a pivotal \npoint in our Nation's history and future. What it does, this bill \nbefore the Senate, it does, indeed, change welfare as we know it.\n  This is what the hard-working American people have been asking \nCongress to do for years. It limits welfare to 2 years for able-bodied \nindividuals, and there will be a 5-year lifetime on welfare for any \nindividual in our country.\n  Mr. President, this sends a message to the working people of our \ncountry that, yes, we understand how hard it is to make ends meet. All \nAmericans work hard. Welfare recipients should not be an exception. If \nwe have uniform requirements for work, we will then say that this \nNation is a Nation that has a work ethic and values people who are \ntrying to be productive citizens.\n  This bill requires all able-bodied welfare recipients to work within \n2 years, or lose their benefits. States will be required to have 50 \npercent of their welfare recipients working by 2002. And to ensure that \nchild care is available for a single parent, this bill provides an \nadditional $4.5 billion more than current law for child care. So we are \nmaking sure that there is a safety net, while at the same time we are \ngoing to save the taxpayers of our country $58 billion.\n  Now, I want to put this in perspective just to show what the American \npeople are seeing in our welfare system as it is today. In many States, \nwelfare systems provide the most perverse incentives. In 40 States, \nwelfare pays more than an $8 per hour job. In 17 States, it pays more \nthan a $10 per hour job. In six States, and in the District of \nColumbia, welfare pays more than a $12 per hour job--more than two \ntimes the minimum wage. In nine States, welfare pays more than the \naverage first-year salary of a teacher. In 29 States, it pays more than \nthe average starting salary for a secretary. In the six most generous \nStates in this Nation, benefits exceed the entry-level salary for a \ncomputer programmer.\n  Mr. President, no wonder our welfare system is broken. No wonder the \nAmerican people are saying that we must have relief from a system that \nwould pay more to people who do not work than a teacher, a computer \nprogrammer, or a person making $12 an hour that is getting up every \nmorning, putting their lunch together, and walking out the door to make \na living for his or her family.\n  Mr. President, what we are doing here tonight is saying that those \npeople have a value in our society. And people who can work, but won't, \nwill not be any better off than the person who gets up, puts his or her \nlunch in a box, goes to work, and is a productive citizen of this \ncountry.\n  This is indeed landmark reform. It is fair. It will stop a system \nthat has become a cancer on our society. It will give self-worth to the \npeople who will now have to work for any benefits they receive. And it \nwill say to hard-working Americans that are struggling to make ends \nmeet, ``You have a value and we appreciate you in this country, and you \nwill not have to work to support someone who can work, but chooses not \nto.''\n\n[[Page S9376]]\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nebraska yield me up \nto 15 minutes?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes, I yield the Senator 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that I respect those \nwho support this legislation, and I respect the President for making \nthe decision he did. But may I also begin by saying that I respectfully \ndisagree with their decisions.\n  Mr. President, I have served now in this body for almost 18 years. I \nserved in the Congress for 22 years. I have dedicated a good part of my \nservice in the U.S. Senate, as many of my colleagues know, to issues \naffecting children. In fact, one of the first things I ever did as a \npart of the Senate was form the first children's caucus, along with \nSenator Specter from Pennsylvania. Dan Coats of Indiana and I were the \nauthors of the family and medical leave legislation. It took 7 years to \nadopt that. It went through two vetoes before being signed into law by \nPresident Clinton in the early days of his administration in 1993. \nSenator Orrin Hatch and I were the authors of the child care block \ngrant, which is a subject of much discussion here today.\n\n  I note, with some irony, that when I offered amendments a year ago to \nincrease the child care funding in the early welfare reform proposals, \nonly two Members of the majority party supported the increase for child \ncare funding. Nonetheless, I am delighted to hear such strong, ringing \nendorsements for the child care block grant, considering it took us so \nmany years to bring it the support it has now. There are numerous other \npieces of legislation over the years that I am proud to have been \nassociated with that affect children.\n  While there are certainly significant deficiencies, in my view, in \nthis legislation, affecting legal immigrants, affecting working adults, \nI want to focus my remarks, if I can, Mr. President, on children. I say \nthat because the overwhelming majority of the people who will be \naffected by this legislation are children. We are a Nation of some 275 \nmillion people in the United States--a very diverse and rich people. Of \nthe total population of this country, it is worthwhile, I think, to \nnote that we are talking about 13 million Americans out of 270 million \nAmericans who receive some form of aid to families with dependent \nchildren from the U.S. Government. There are local welfare programs. \nAnd there are State programs. But the Federal Government's commitment \nto welfare affects 13 million Americans. Of the 13 million Americans, \nalmost 9 million are children under the age of 18, and 4 million are \nadults. Of the 9 million who are children, 80 percent of the 9 million \nare under the age of 12, and 50 percent of the 9 million are under the \nage of 6.\n  So we are talking about 4 million adults and 4 to 5 million infants \nand young children, in effect, who will be affected by this \nlegislation. We also know that roughly 2 million of the 4 million \nadults are unemployable under any situation. They are either seriously \nill, or disabled, and will not be affected by this legislation because \nthey cannot work.\n  So our goal is to put 1 to 2 million of the 4 million adults on AFDC, \nwho are able-bodied and can work, to work. This is 1 to 2 million \npeople out of a nation of 270 million people. My concern is that, in \nour efforts to do that, we are placing in jeopardy, and at significant \nrisk, for the first time in a half-century, the 9 million children in \nthis country who are also the recipients of public assistance.\n  So it is with a great deal of sadness, Mr. President, that I rise \ntoday, knowing that in less than 2 or 3 hours from now, America's \nnational legislature will vote overwhelmingly to sever completely its \nmore than one-half century of support for the most vulnerable of our \npeople--our children.\n  For over 60 years, Mr. President, through 10 Presidents, hundreds of \nU.S. Congressmen and Congresswomen, Senators, Democrats, Republicans, \nliberals, moderates, and conservatives, we have tried to improve the \nopportunities for all Americans. Certain issues were always in \nconflict, and I suspect they always will be. But with regard to one \nconstituency, one group of Americans, there was never any serious \ndivision. We in America take care of our children.\n  There is a national interest, I argue, and there has been for \ndecades, to protect the most innocent and defenseless in our society. \nWhether you were a child from Eastport, ME, or San Diego, CA, if all \nelse failed, your National Government, your country, would not let you \ngo hungry, would not let you be denied medical care, and would not deny \nyou basic shelter. No matter how irresponsible your parents may have \nbeen, no matter how neglectful your community or State, your country, \nAmerica, would absolutely guarantee, as a last resort, a safety net of \nbasic care.\n  In less than a few hours, Mr. President, we will end, after half a \ncentury, that basic fundamental guarantee to these children.\n  Am I opposed to reforming welfare? Absolutely not. But let us put \nthis issue in perspective. We are talking about 9 million children--\nmany of whom have no other protection at all because of the \ncircumstances in which they are raised--who count on their Government \nas a last resort to be of help.\n  Let me be starkly clear about what this legislation does. Under this \nbill, States can cut off benefits. They cannot provide work \nopportunities. There is no requirement for them to do so. They can set \nshorter and shorter time limits, if they so desire. They can cut off \nfamilies completely without making any accommodation for their \nchildren. And no matter how draconian these measures may be, this \nNational Government will stand by and do nothing.\n  It is worth noting that virtually all religious groups in this \ncountry and their leaders oppose this piece of legislation. Let me \nshare with you the views of Bishop Anthony Pilla on behalf of the \nCatholic Bishops:\n\n       The test of welfare reform is whether it will enhance the \n     lives and dignity of poor children and their families. The \n     moral measure of our society is how we treat the least \n     amongst us. This legislation fails these tests and fails our \n     Nation.\n\n  What is more, we are considering this legislation with the benefit of \ndata showing that the bill will push at least 1.1 million children into \npoverty in this country and worsen the situation of children already in \npoverty by 20 percent.\n  Let us consider, if you will, for just one moment that instead of \ndealing with welfare reform here, we were dealing with a piece of \nlegislation affecting American businesses. And assume for 1 minute, if \nyou will, that we were provided data by credible sources that said as a \nresult of this bill, if it were to become law, 1 million business \npeople would fail as a result of your actions.\n  I would just inquire: How long would that legislation last on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate? We would not be told that it is a ``minor \ninconvenience'' and somehow ``we may fix that later.'' We would not \nspend 1 minute considering a piece of legislation that would cause 1 \nmillion business people to fail. And, yet, when 1 million children may \nfail and already poor children will be pushed into even more difficult \ncircumstances, we are told over and over again that somehow we will fix \nthat down the road.\n  I cannot support a piece of legislation that would take 1 million \ninnocent children and push them into poverty with a vague hope that \nsome day we may do something to correct that situation.\n  These numbers should make all of us take pause and seriously consider \nthe dire implications of our actions. I know many people argue that the \ncurrent welfare system does not serve our children well. I do not \ndisagree. But replacing a system in need of reform with a worse system \nis no solution at all. In fact, it is irresponsible. There is no \njustification, in my view, to try something different at any cost; \nnamely, abandoning a national commitment to children for the sake of \nchange.\n  Again, I applaud the improvements that were made in this bill, and \nthey have been recited by others. It, certainly, is better than what \nwas considered a year ago in a number of aspects. But despite those \nimprovements, there are still elements in this legislation which make \nit fundamentally flawed.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that between 2.5 and 3.5 \nmillion\n\n[[Page S9377]]\n\nchildren would be affected by the 5-year cutoff of benefits in this \nbill. I have no objection to setting time limits on adults. In my \nState, it is 2 years. Experiments like that make sense, to see if they \nwork. What I do not understand is that no matter how difficult you want \nto be on the parent, how do you look into the face of a 6-year-old \nchild who, through no fault of their own, are born into difficult \ncircumstances and say that regardless of the flaws of their parents, \nthe irresponsibility of their parents, they must pay the price? I do \nnot understand that logic or that thinking.\n  It seems to me that if we know this welfare bill will increase the \nnumber of poor children, we should, at the very least, make some \nprovisions for children whose parents have reached the time limit and \nare cut off from assistance. But this bill prohibits--and I emphasize \nthis--this bill prohibits even providing vouchers to children whose \nparents have hit the 5-year time limit. In fact, it does not even grant \nthe State the option to provide noncash aid to infants and toddlers.\n  This is not only a step backward, but, in my view, it is an \nunconscionable retreat from a 60-year-old commitment that Republicans \nand Democrats, 10 American Presidents, and Congresses have made on \nbehalf of America's children.\n  Some will argue that the conference agreement says that States can \nuse the title XX social services block grant to provide vouchers for \nthese families and children. But I ask my colleagues to look at the \nprovisions of the bill that cut this block grant by 15 percent. We are \nreducing the very block grants we are now telling States they can use \nto provide for these benefits.\n  I truly believe that if we were serious about ensuring the safety net \nfor children in this bill, we would do it outright and not come up with \nfancy accounting methods that provide no guarantees for children \nwhatsoever.\n  This legislation does not provide enough funds, quite frankly, to \nmeet the work requirements of the bill. This bill has the goal of \nputting welfare recipients to work. I applaud that. Yet, it fails to \nprovide adequate funds to reach that very growth.\n  We are setting ourselves up for a failure. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that this bill is $12 billion short of funds needed to \nmeet the work requirements--$2 billion more than the shortfall of the \nSenate bill which was passed last year. The same Congressional Budget \nOffice says that most States will not succeed in meeting the work \nrequirements. They will just accept the penalty of reduction in funds.\n  Do our friends here who support this legislation think that millions \nof jobs for welfare recipients will simply appear out of the air? Will \nmillions of welfare recipients, most of whom want to work, I would \nargue, magically find jobs? Not unless they receive the assistance, the \ntraining, and the educational help which leads to job creation. In this \nbill, they will receive no such help at all.\n  While we see movement on child care--again, I applaud that--this \nconference agreement retreats on a critically important child care \nprovision.\n  Let me emphasize this point. Both the House and Senate bills contain \nprovisions that prohibit a State from sanctioning a family if the \nmother could not work because she could not obtain nor afford child \ncare for children age 10 and under. The conference agreement, which we \nare about to vote on, moves that age threshold from 10 years of age to \n5 years of age, at the request, I am told, of some Governors.\n  Currently, approximately 2.4 million children on AFDC are between the \nages of 6 and 10. The families of these children could lose all of \ntheir benefits as a result of a work sanction because the parent could \nnot find adequate child care for a 7-year-old, an 8-year-old, or a 9-\nyear-old. This bill encourages parents to go to work and leave a child \nat home, without supervision, at a time when we are talking about \nfamily values and parents caring for their children. We put these \nparents in the catch-22 situation, either they lose benefits or leave \ntheir child--a 6- 7- or 8-year old at home alone. I do not understand, \nagain, the logic of that kind of thinking.\n  I know that the Governors have argued that the protection for \nchildren 10 and under would make it hard for them to meet the work \nrequirements in the legislation. But that sort of argument points out \nflawed thinking in this bill. I think all of us understand the need for \nchild care. Latchkey children are a serious problem in our society. I \nfail to understand how Governors who argue that a provision which \nprotects kids who are 6- 7- and 8-years old would impede their ability \nto meet work requirements. Governors, at the very least, should be able \nto guarantee to children age 10 and under that they will not be left at \nhome without care.\n\n  Additionally, the food stamp cuts in the conference agreement are \ndeeper than last year's vetoed welfare bill and deeper than last year's \nSenate-passed bill. The conference agreement would cut food stamps by \nabout 20 percent. Families with children--not single adults--families \nwith children will bear the greatest burden. Two-thirds of the cuts in \nfood stamps will hit families with children.\n  Additionally, the bill limits food stamps to unemployed adults not \nraising children to just 3 months in a 3-year period with no hardship \nexemption whatsoever. If we were in a period of high unemployment in \nthis country, with people being laid off from jobs through no fault of \ntheir own, how do you explain to someone who has worked for many, many \nyears and finds himself without a job, that he will be cut off from \nsome basic necessities to allow him to exist? And there's no exemption \nwhatsoever to account for economic difficulties.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that in an average month, \nunder this provision, 1 million poor, unemployed individuals who are \nwilling to work and have worked in many cases and would take a workfare \nslot, if one were available, would be denied food stamps because they \ncannot find work.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to mention the treatment of legal \nimmigrants in this legislation, which I know is of great concern to our \ncolleagues from California and Florida and New York and others.\n  This bill, in my view, is a repudiation of the legacy of immigration \nthat has defined our country for more than 200 years. We are talking \nabout legal immigrants now.\n  It is this influx of immigrants from diverse cultures and distant \nlands that has made this country a shining example to the entire world. \nThat is why millions of people across the globe have come to our \nNation.\n  To say to legal immigrants who pay taxes, who get drafted and serve \nin our military that we are going to deny them basic protections after \nwe have invited them to come here in a legal status because they do not \nvote and they are an easy target I think is a mistake.\n  It was the promise of the American dream that brought my family to \nthis country from Ireland. And it was the desire for a better life that \nbrought millions of other immigrants to America, whether they came over \non the Mayflower or if they came to our land in just the past few days.\n  The fact is, nearly every Senator in this body is a descendant of \nimmigrants.\n  The attack, in this legislation, on legal immigrants is mean-spirited \nand punitive.\n  This bill is more interested in reducing the deficit than maintaining \nour commitment to legal immigration.\n  This bill bans legal immigrants--children and the disabled--from food \nstamps and SSI. When people lose SSI, they lose their health coverage \nunder Medicaid.\n  I fear that we'll see people who have paid taxes wheeled out of \nnursing homes as a result of this bill.\n  The legal immigrant provisions of this bill will shift substantial \ncosts on to local governments.\n  In the words of Mayor Guiliani of New York:\n\n       By restricting legal immigrants' access to most Federal \n     programs, immigration, in effect, becomes a local \n     responsibility. Welfare reform should not diminish Federal \n     responsibility for immigration policy or shift cost to local \n     governments.\n\n  But that's exactly what this bill does.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  In closing, let me say, Mr. President, that welfare reform is by no \nmeans easy. If we are to change the cycle of dependency and encourage \nwork among welfare recipients, we must make tough decisions.\n\n[[Page S9378]]\n\n  But, in the end, those decisions must always be weighed against their \neffect on poor children. Our success will not be judged by how much we \nreduce the welfare rolls, but how we help those who are left behind.\n  This bill fails that test--on both accounts.\n  President Franklin Roosevelt once said that: ``The test of our \nprogress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have \ntoo much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too \nlittle.''\n  For those in our Nation who have too little, we are providing only \ncrumbs.\n  If welfare recipients are to revel in the hopes and aspirations of \nthe American dream then they must be provided with the tools and \nopportunities to make those dreams a reality.\n  This bill fails those Americans and it fails our commitment to the \nmost vulnerable and poorest citizens in our Nation.\n  I know this is a futile effort, but I urge my colleagues in the \nremaining few hours to consider that we are about to sever the lifeline \nto 9 million children in this country for the sake of putting 1 to 2 \nmillion adults to work. This incredibly misguided policy is not in \nbalance and ought to be defeated.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the conference \nreport to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996. \nThe American people I believe have demanded welfare reform, and I am \npleased that the Congress has not yielded in its commitment to pass \nmuch needed and long overdue comprehensive welfare reform. Our current \nwelfare system is a death sentence. It is a death sentence to the human \nspirit, the family, and the hopes and dreams of millions of children in \nAmerica. The welfare system today encourages dependency, facilitates \nthe breakdown of the family, demoralizes the human spirit, and \nundermines the work ethic that built our Nation. For a third time this \nCongress has delivered legislation to address the failures of the \nwelfare state and provide reforms that I believe will free the poor \nfrom being trapped in a cycle of dependency. This bill is the boldest \nstatement we can make in the current political environment, and I am \npleased that the President has finally pledged to keep his promise to \nend welfare as we know it.\n  Mr. President, the imperative for welfare reform is manifest. The \nAmerican taxpayers have spent more than $5.4 trillion since President \nJohnson declared a war on poverty. But after spending this massive sum, \nwe are no closer to having a Great Society than if we had done nothing. \nIn fact, the poverty rate in America has actually increased over the \npast 28 years. The reason for this is simple: Welfare has become a way \nof life. The modern welfare State is rife with financial incentives for \nmothers to remain unmarried. Eighty percent of children in many low-\nincome communities in America are born in homes without a father. It is \nvirtually impossible for a young unwed mother with no work skills to \nescape the welfare trap as we know it today. This has done nothing to \nstop the ravaging of our cities and the skyrocketing of violent crime.\n\n  People have become dependent on welfare because it completely \ndestroys the need to work and the natural incentive to become self-\nsufficient. For more than 30 years the message of the welfare state is \nthat the Government will take care of you. It is a punitive form of \nassistance. It punishes those who want to work and want to succeed. It \npunishes those mothers who want to get married and have a husband to \nhelp raise the children.\n  Where is the compassion in this present welfare program? It is not \nthere. Only the beltway establishment would dare suggest that providing \nmonthly benefits is more compassionate than fostering the natural \ninclination in every human being to reach your full potential. However, \nwith the enactment of this bill, Congress will require welfare \nrecipients to work in exchange for benefits for the first time. By \nimposing a 5-year lifetime limit on welfare benefits, the message of \nthe reformed welfare state is that we will provide temporary assistance \nto help during hardship as you return to self-sufficiency.\n  The bill we vote on today begins to repair a very badly broken \nwelfare state in other ways. It puts healthy incentives in our welfare \nsystem. The generous package of welfare benefits available in America \nis a magnet for literally hundreds of thousands of legal and illegal \nimmigrants. I do not believe this is just, and this bill properly \ndenies welfare to noncitizens.\n  Also, the Government will no longer tell young women, ``If you have \nchildren you are not able to support and you are willing to raise them \nwithout a father the Government will reward you and pick up the tab.'' \nThat is the wrong message. This legislation allows States to end \nadditional cash payments to unwed mothers who have additional children \nwhile collecting welfare. The bill also permits States to deny cash to \nunwed teenage mothers and instead provide them with other forms of \nassistance. It is good for children to see both their parents in the \nmorning, and this bill provides the mechanisms that will make this the \nnorm, not the exception.\n  This legislation represents real welfare reform. The monster that was \ncreated over the last 30 years will not change overnight, but we take a \nsignificant step today. This bill ensures that welfare finally will \nbenefit, not harm, its beneficiaries. I urge all my colleagues to adopt \nthis landmark legislation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask to be recognized for \n13 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to read you an excerpt \nfrom an editorial in yesterday's Sacramento Bee which, I believe, sums \nup the bill we are about to vote on\n\n       There is a widespread consensus that welfare must be \n     reformed to reduce long-term dependency and encourage work \n     and personal responsibility. But the current bill, \n     underfunded and overly punitive, ignores everything we have \n     learned over the last decade about moving welfare recipients \n     into the job market.\n       More than half of the welfare recipients lack a high school \n     education at a time when labor markets put a premium on \n     education and skills. Two-thirds live in central cities, \n     places from which employers have fled. At their most \n     successful, past efforts to move welfare recipients into \n     jobs, such as the GAIN program in Riverside have reduced \n     welfare roles by only 10 percent and incomes of welfare \n     recipients by a few hundred dollars a month.\n       Yet the welfare bill requires states to move half of all \n     recipients into jobs, even though, according to Congress' own \n     experts, the bill falls $12 billion shy of funding for the \n     work program. Even if one heroically assumes that two-thirds \n     of welfare families would find permanent employment, the \n     bill's five-year lifetime limit on benefits would leave 1 \n     million families--adults and children alike--without any \n     source of income.\n\n  Mr. President, I am very disappointed that I must oppose the welfare \nreform bill as presented to this body by the House-Senate conference \ncommittee. I had hoped that the bill that emerged from the conference \ncommittee would be one that California could live with, because, I \nthink it is clear that, with 32 million people, no State in the Union \nhas as much to gain or as much to lose from welfare reform.\n  Unfortunately, this bill remains one in which California loses, and \nloses big.\n  California is being asked to foot the bill for changing welfare as we \nknow it--and that is wrong. One-third of the estimated $55 billion \nsavings in this bill comes from one State: California. California faces \na loss of more than $16 billion over the next 6 years as a result of \nthis bill, more when you add reductions in State funds under the new \nrules and potentially much more if our welfare caseload continues to \nincrease at the current pace.\n  The losses to California are staggering: Up to $9 billion in cuts to \nFederal aid for legal immigrants, $4.2 billion in cuts in food stamps, \nand as much as $3 billion in AFDC funds over the next 6 years.\n  Not only is this bill unfair to California on its face, it is \nseriously flawed in a number of critically important areas.\n  The contingency funds provided in this bill--$2 billion--are too \nlittle. California alone, I predict, can and will need the entire \namount.\n  Work requirements are an impossible goal. The heart of this bill, \nmoving\n\n[[Page S9379]]\n\npeople from welfare to work, rests on the unknown and probably the \nimpossible. No state, to my knowledge, in 6 years has been able to move \n50 percent of its welfare caseload into jobs, as this bill requires. \nCalifornia will have an impossible hurdle to move the required 20 \npercent of its welfare caseload into jobs in 1 year, let alone 50 \npercent in 6 years. In order to meet the 20 percent work requirement in \nthis bill, California would have to find jobs next year for more than \n166,000 current adult welfare recipients. But, in the last 2 years, the \nState added an average of only 300,000 people total to payrolls in \nnonfarm jobs. How do we possibly create enough jobs to increase \nemployment by another 50 percent--especially for a work force that is \nlargely unskilled and under educated? California is a State that has \nall but lost its production base and is now producing either high-\nskilled jobs or hamburger flippers at minimum wage.\n  In order to move people into work, there must be affordable child \ncare for parents. This bill does not provide anywhere near enough \nfunds. The child care block grant in this bill is awarded to States \nbased on their current utilization of Federal child care funds. In \nCalifornia, there are approximately 1.8 million children on AFDC. \nCalifornia currently provides child care subsidies and/or slots to \napproximately 200,000 children. The Child Care Law Center estimates \nthat under the welfare reform bill, as more parents are required to \nwork, as many as 418,000 additional preschool children and 650,000 \nchildren aged 5 to 13 may need child care. This would be a 600 percent \nincrease in need for child care slots.\n  This bill does not come near the amount of child care dollars that \nwould be needed in California to do this job.\n  The conference bill is actually worse than the Senate bill in \nhandling America's ultimate safety net: Food Stamps. The conference \nbill cuts food stamps by 20 percent. California loses $4.2 billion.\n  Last year, an average of 1.2 million households--more than 3.2 \nmillion people--in California relied on food stamps each month. \nCalifornia's unemployment rate is still high at 7.2 percent--2 \npercentage points above the national rate of 5.3 percent. 1,117,000 \npeople are out of work today--more than the entire populations of nine \nStates. This bill would limit food stamps for an able-bodied adult with \nno children to a total of 3 months over a period of 3 years. If that \nperson becomes unemployed, they would only be able to receive an \nadditional 3 months of food stamps in that same 3-year period. This \nbill would also bar all legal immigrants from receiving food stamps--\nthere is no exemption for elderly, disabled, or children.\n  The shelter deduction in this bill is a case in point which \ndemonstrates that, however well intentioned this bill might be, it \nlacks a fundamental foothold in reality when it comes to California.\n  The shelter deduction allows families with children to deduct a \nmaximum of $247, with an increase to $300 in the year 2001, from their \nincome level when applying for aid--ostensibly to compensate for the \ncost of housing.\n  In the vast majority of the population centers in California, \nparticularly in urban areas, you can not find a place to rent for that \namount of money. In San Francisco, the average rent is between $750 and \n$1,000 per month.\n  So this deduction is so low that it is virtually useless in \nCalifornia.\n  California is not the only loser in this welfare bill. America's \nchildren lose as well. In a rush to deliver a welfare reform bill--any \nwelfare bill--before the November elections, this bill is the moral \nequivalent of a dear John letter to our Nation's needy children.\n  Under this bill, 3.3 million children nationwide and 1.8 million \nchildren in California could lose AFDC after the 5-year limit. Children \nof undocumented immigrants would not even be allowed to buy federally \nsubsidized school lunches. Recent studies by Children Now and the Urban \nInstitute estimated that this welfare plan would thrust an additional \n1.1 million children into poverty conditions in the United States. The \nSenate rejected moderate amendments sought by the White House as well \nas members of both parties to provide noncash assistance to children \nwhose parents lose their benefits in the form of vouchers for food, \nclothing and other basic necessities.\n  The voucher language included in the conference report is an empty-\nhanded gesture allowing states to rob Peter to pay Paul because it adds \nno new funds to provide basic necessities to children whose parents \nlose benefits.\n  The major cost shift to California comes from the elimination of \nFederal assistance for legal immigrants, most of whom are elderly, \nblind, and disabled--all of them poor--who came to this country under \nterms agreed to by the Federal Government. And yet, the Federal \nGovernment will not bear the cost of changing the terms of that deal--\nthe cost of this policy shift will be forced onto States and counties.\n  Let me be clear: I am all for changing U.S. immigration policies to \nhold sponsors of legal immigrants legally bound to provide financial \nsupport to their sponsees. But to change this policy on those already \nin this country--retroactively--and thus summarily dropping hundreds of \nthousands of elderly and disabled immigrants from Federal support \nprograms like SSI, food stamps, and AFDC onto already overburdened \ncounty assistance programs, is not only an abdication of Federal \nresponsibility--to me it is unconscionable.\n  The impact of this cost shift to California counties could be \ncatastrophic.\n  An estimated 722,939 legal immigrants in California--many of whom are \naged, blind, and elderly--would lose SSI, AFDC, and food stamps under \nthis bill.\n  Los Angeles County--the most impacted area nationwide--estimates that \n93,000 noncitizen legal immigrants will lose SSI under this bill, at a \npotential cost of more than $236 million each year in county general \nassistance funds.\n  Los Angeles also estimates that the restriction on future immigrants \nreceiving nonemergency Medicaid services would result in $100 million \nin additional costs--much higher unless the State comes up with the \nfunds to provide coverage to noncitizens.\n  San Francisco County estimates that the cost of county funded general \nassistance could increase $74 million under the legal immigrant \nprovisions in this bill--an increase of more than 250 percent.\n  Other counties in California are studying the impact of this \nlegislation and coming up with similar financial horror stories. Twelve \nof the top twenty metropolitan areas in the country that are impacted \nmost severely by this bill are in California.\n  The State of California indicated by its budget that it has no \nability or intention of stepping in to fill the funding gap this bill \ncreates. Governor Wilson's State budget for fiscal year 1996-1997 \nassumes the immigrant provisions in this legislation will pass and \nlegal immigrants will no longer be eligible for assistance.\n  California's legislative analyst's report indicates that Governor \nWilson's budget:\n\n       . . . assumes enactment of federal legislation barring most \n     legal immigrants from receiving SSI/SSP benefits starting \n     January 1, 1997. The budget assume savings of $91 million \n     from this proposal.\n\n  That is from the ``Legislative Analyst's Report, 1996-97 Budget.''\n  While we in Washington sit in our ivory tower and pat ourselves on \nthe back for changing welfare as we know it, the real impact of this \nbill will land on real people who are too old or too sick to care for \nthemselves, and whose families--if they have one--have no ability to \nhelp them.\n  Let me put some faces and names on this welfare bill for you:\n  A 73-year-old woman who asked not to be named came to the United \nStates as a refugee from Vietnam in 1981. She sold everything she owned \nto pay for her passage on a boat for her and her mother. Her mother \ndied on the trip over. She moved to San Francisco in 1985 and fell ill \nwith kidney disease. She currently depends on SSI and Medicaid to pay \nfor dialysis and other medical care. Her only relative in the United \nStates is a goddaughter who cannot afford to care for her. She has \napplied for citizenship, but may not pass the English proficiency exam.\n  Maria, who lives in Los Angeles, came to the United States in 1973 \nwhen she was 62 years old to live with her daughter. In 1984, her \ndaughter had a stroke at work which rsulted in two cerebral aneurysms. \nFollowing the stroke, her daughter was unable to\n\n[[Page S9380]]\n\nwork and therefore unable to support Maria as she had done for the \nprevious 11 years. Maria received both SSI and Medicaid. Neither Maria \nnor her daughter would be able to survive on her daughter's disability \nincome alone.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, like so many of my colleagues, I have had \nthe opportunity to actually visit--this time Norfolk, VA a few days \nago--a center which is providing job training for welfare recipients. \nThe first thing I was impressed with was a collection of about 12 \nrooms. It was absolutely spotless. The staff of this nonprofit \norganization had many volunteers who came in to work with their welfare \nclients. In this instance I only saw welfare mothers, or some perhaps \nwho did not have children, and largely minorities. All was neat and \nclean, and they showed up meticulously on time at this center with a \nspirit of ``can do--we will overcome our handicaps if only you will \nreach out and give us a helping hand.''\n  That is what this bill does. It should be called the helping hand \nbill. Each of us in our lifetime has experienced periods when you had \nto reach out a helping hand. Most have the opportunity to do it \nregularly. I can remember at one point serving in the U.S. military \nwith men, in this instance, who could not read and write, but they \nreceived a helping hand and quickly learned those military skills, that \nthey could at that learning level, and became key members of fighting \nteams, in this instance, in the Navy. I will never forget that. All \nthey asked for was a helping hand, and that is what this bill is \ndesigned to do and will do if we will just give it a fair chance.\n  I regret to hear, largely from the other side of the aisle, these \ncries that we have done a wrong. We have not done a wrong. We have \nlistened to the American people. Sixty-five percent of the American \npeople, or higher, agree that the system in Washington has not worked. \nIt was given a fair chance. It was given an enormous sum of money. One \npiece of paper says we have spent, as a nation, more money on welfare \nthan the cost of all military actions in this century. This is a \nsubstantial amount of money.\n  Yet, the casualties in terms of the families, particularly the \nchildren, have been very high. Why not give the States and the local \ncommunities the opportunity now to make this system work? We all know \nthat there are persons less fortunate than ourselves, and all they want \nis a helping hand. Reach out, that is what we should do.\n  As this bill goes forth--the President has now indicated, for reasons \nof his own, after two vetoes he will sign this one--let's send it forth \nin a spirit of can do, like the people I met in the welfare center in \nNorfolk. We do not want it to arrive on the doorstep in the several \nStates, down in the small towns and villages of my State and your \nStates with a message, ``It isn't going to work.'' But it is there, so \nlet's send it in the spirit of give it the best shot.\n  I ask, are not the people in the communities, large and small, all \nacross this Nation as well qualified as the innumerable army of \nbureaucrats here in the Nation's Capital who, for half a century, have \nworked with this? Are they not as well qualified? I say absolutely yes, \nand let's give them a chance to make it work.\n  I am not satisfied with every provision in this bill. I sided with \nthe Senator from Louisiana, John Breaux, to give more funds and support \nto the children. I was concerned. I voted against a majority on my side \nof the aisle. There is not a person in this Chamber who is not \nconcerned as to exactly what will happen to children. But let me tell \nyou, in the communities in my State, and I say in the communities in \nyour States, they are not going to let the children be injured, \nirrespective of however the law is written. They will find a way to \nmake it work and protect those children far better than we can as \nbureaucrats in Washington. They will make it work.\n  If there are legislative changes needed, I assure you, the citizens \nof my great State will come to my doorstep very promptly and say, \n``Senator, we're trying to make this bill work, but we need a change \nhere,'' or a change there. And I am confident I will step forward, as \nwill others on both sides of the aisle, and make those changes to make \nthis piece of legislation work.\n\n  Families living side by side, one receiving welfare, one getting up \nand going to work--the friction between them, the discontent right in \nthe same street in the same neighborhood--is intolerable. We have to \nstop that. We are providing a disincentive for those who are getting \nout of bed and trying to go to work. Within the welfare ranks, we may \nbe taking a gamble, but I will bet that there are a substantial number \non welfare who want to come forward and, with a helping hand, make this \npiece of legislation work.\n  It is incumbent on those welfare people to have a willingness to \nbreak out of the system. They may be shy, they may be reticent, and we \nwill be patient, but they have to go to work. There are able-bodied \npeople in all these communities--and I have seen them and you have seen \nthem--who will step forward and gently but firmly and decisively extend \nthat hand to make it work and to quickly come back if children or other \naspects of this program are not working and inform the Members of \nCongress so we can fix it.\n  Mr. President, this is a great day for our country. We have come to \nthe realization that one of the major entitlement programs has not \nlived up to its expectations. It has created scenes in every town in \nAmerica which are totally unacceptable in this day and time. Let's make \nthis piece of legislation work. Let's send it out of here and praise \nthe efforts that we have made in response to the direct plea of the \nAmerican people to fix this system by sending it from Washington back \nto where it belongs--hometown USA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, let's face it, our choice is: hurting poor \npeople and gaining some votes in the process, or appearing to stand for \nsomething that we all know needs change and losing votes but not \nhurting poor people.\n  My friend from Virginia, for whom I have great respect, says this is \na helping-hand bill. The Urban Institute says we are going to put 2.6 \nmillion more Americans into poverty, 1.1 million more children. That is \nnot the kind of helping hand we need. We already have 24 percent of our \nchildren living in poverty. No other Western industrialized nation is \nanywhere close to that, and we are compounding the evil.\n  I am supporting Bill Clinton for reelection. In many ways, he leaves \na good legacy. But let no one make any mistake about it, he is marring \nhis legacy by signing this bill. He may gain a few more votes on \nNovember 5, but he is hurting history's judgment of what he is doing as \nPresident.\n  This is not welfare reform. This is political public relations.\n  I heard one of my colleagues, for whom I have great respect, say we \nhave to change the system of children having children. Of course we \nhave to change the system of children having children. But this bill \ndoes not do one thing in that direction. And it should be added that \nthe birthrate among people who have welfare is going down, and going \ndown significantly.\n\n  Second, I say to you, Mr. President, we have about a million teenage \npregnancies each year, about 400,000 of which end up in abortions, \nincidentally. What we know is those who are high school dropouts are \nmuch more likely to be involved in teenage pregnancies. You want to do \nsomething about that? Let us put some money into education, not this \nphony bill that is going to cause great harm.\n  Will Durant and his wife have written great histories: \n``Reformation,'' ``The Age of Napoleon,'' and so forth. But Will Durant \nwrote a small book called ``The Meaning of History.'' In that small \nbook, in ``The Meaning of History,'' he said: ``This is the history of \nnations, that those who are more fortunate economically continue to \npile up benefits, and they press down\n\n[[Page S9381]]\n\nthose who are less fortunate until those who are less fortunate \neventually revolt.''\n  What are we doing here in this session of Congress? We are giving the \nPentagon, this fiscal year, $11 billion more than they requested. We \nare going to have some kind of tax cuts that particularly benefit those \nof us in this Chamber who are more fortunate economically. And with \nthis bill, for the next 6 years, we will be cutting back $9.2 billion a \nyear from poor people.\n  I am for genuine welfare reform, but genuine welfare reform requires \nproviding jobs for people of limited ability and providing day care. I \nhave a bill in that says you cannot be on welfare more than 5 weeks--in \nsome ways, tougher than this--but then the Federal Government has a WPA \ntype of job available. We screen people as they come in, and if they \ncannot read and write, we get them into a program. If you have no \nmarketable skill, you get them to a technical school or a community \ncollege. That would be genuine welfare reform.\n  But as Gov. Tommy Thompson has pointed out--a Republican, \nincidentally--if you are going to have welfare reform, you are going to \nhave to put in more money upfront, not less money.\n  I like Senator Feinstein's remark that this is the moral equivalent \nof a ``Dear John'' letter to the poor people of the Nation. She is, \nunfortunately, right.\n  In October--the Presiding Officer is someone who has a sense of \nhistory--in October, we have Roosevelt History Month because we thought \nat that point we would dedicate the Roosevelt memorial. It looks like \nnow it will not be ready then. But we will celebrate, that month, when \nwe had a great national leader who lifted the poor people of this \nNation. Two months prior to that, we are going to celebrate by pushing \ndown the poor people of this Nation.\n  Let us be very practical. A woman who lives in Robert Taylor homes in \nthe south side of Chicago, desperately poor, lives in a public housing \nproject, has three children, and with this bill--and she has very \nlimited skills because she went to poor schools, probably can barely \nread and write--with this bill we are saying to her, you can at the \nmost stay on welfare 5 years, maybe only 2, but we are not going to \nprovide any job for you, we are not going to have any day care for your \nchildren.\n  What does that woman do if she wants to feed her children? Does she \ntake to the streets in crime? Does she become a prostitute? I do not \nknow, nor does anyone else in this Chamber.\n  Let me pay tribute to two people here, one who just spoke against \nthis before, Senator Chris Dodd, who is the Democratic national \nchairman and who is interested in votes. But despite being Democratic \nnational chairman, despite the stand taken by President Clinton, Chris \nDodd stood here and said this is bad for the children of America. And \nPaul Wellstone, up for reelection, showing great, great courage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SIMON. I yield myself 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. When my friend from Virginia, Senator Warner, said the \nStates will protect people, I think of the bill we finally passed when \nI was over in the House to protect children who wanted to go to school \nwho had disabilities. The States said, ``If you're in a wheelchair, if \nyou're blind, if you're deaf, sorry, we're not going to force education \nfor them.'' The majority of the mentally retarded were not being given \nany help by our public schools. The Federal Government came along and \nsaid, ``You are entitled to this.'' The Federal Government protected \npeople with disabilities, and the Federal Government should protect \npoor people in this Nation. We are not doing it with this legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield to the Senator from Ohio 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  This legislation that we will pass in the next 2 hours is truly \nhistoric. It recognizes, literally for the first time in 60 years, that \nwhen it comes to lifting people out of poverty, Washington does not \nhave all the answers. In fact, I think most of us know Washington has \nreally few answers in this area, because the true innovation, the true \nchanges that we have seen in the last decade in regard to welfare \nreform has come from the States. That is what this bill will foster. \nThat is what this bill will allow.\n  Mr. President, there has been a great deal of controversy about many \nparts of this bill, but I believe what unites just about everyone in \nthis debate is a realization that the current system simply is not \nworking, that the status quo is unacceptable. We disagree about what \nshould replace that system.\n  That is why one chief merit of this bill is that it gives the States \nthe flexibility to reinvent welfare, to find out what works, what does \nnot work, and once we find out what works, to build on that. That \nexperimentation has already started in the States. The only thing that \nis holding it back, frankly, is the Federal Government. And this bill \nallows for more experimentation, it allows for new ideas.\n  Mr. President, compared to the current system, a failed, top-down \nsystem that fosters the cycle of dependency that blights so many parts \nof America, this is a huge improvement. And there are other \nimprovements, Mr. President, in this bill as well.\n  This bill reestablishes the connection between work and income, the \ntime-honored idea that people should work to get income. The current \nwelfare system cut the nexus between working and making money. This was \none of the great mistakes of our social welfare policy. People do need \na hand up. They need help. And this welfare bill gives them a hand up.\n\n  I am also very pleased, Mr. President, the bill includes a ``rainy \nday'' contingency fund for the States. As a former Lieutenant Governor, \nI know how vulnerable a State's budget is to an economic downturn. Many \nStates, such as my home State of Ohio, are required by law to balance \ntheir budget every single year, no matter how hard the economic times \nare. We need to make sure that the poorest Americans are taken care of \nwhen that contingency arises, thus the contingency fund in this bill.\n  That is why, Mr. President, I offered the amendment for the \ncontingency fund last year. I applaud the conferees and the leadership \nfor the decision to include that contingency fund in this package as \nwell.\n  I also think this bill's crackdown on unpaid child support is a \nterrific idea and long overdue. As a former county prosecutor, I dealt \nwith these child support cases all the time, and I can tell you that \nwhen child support goes up, the welfare rolls go down. It is as simple \nas that.\n  One provision in this bill that I am particularly proud of is one I \nproposed as an amendment to last year's welfare reform bill. It has \nbeen included in this bill as well. It would give States added tools in \ntheir efforts to track down the bank accounts of deadbeat parents.\n  Mr. President, in this bill, we are strengthening the States as they \nattempt to go after the delinquent and deadbeat parents. It is \nabsolutely essential that we strengthen the ethic of personal \nresponsibility in this way. We need to make it absolutely clear--\nAmerica demands that parents be responsible for their children. \nDeadbeat parents cannot be allowed to walk away from their \nresponsibilities. In this bill, we deal with that.\n\n  We also provide a strong safety net at the same time, a strong safety \nnet for people who need help. The bill passed the House by a broad \nbipartisan vote, 328 to 101. I expect it will pass the Senate \noverwhelmingly later this evening. I applaud the President for his \ndecision to sign this bill. My only regret is that we lost time. We \nlost a year. Last year, the President had welfare reform before him. He \ndecided to veto the bill. This bill is no different, not significantly \ndifferent in any way. I am pleased to see that the President has \nchanged his mind and that he now intends to sign the bill.\n  Today, the American people can be proud of this legislative process. \nWe are about to pass a bill in a couple of hours that offers the best \nhope in our lifetime for breaking the cycle of poverty. It is a bill \nthat provides hope, hope for the people on welfare, and hope for the \nidea that we can change\n\n[[Page S9382]]\n\nwelfare, change the system that clearly has not worked. It has been a \nsystem that has kept people down, a system that has promoted \nillegitimacy, a system that has not given people hope. Today we take a \nmajor step to change that.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by stating that we have heard a lot of \ncomments today on this floor about children. I think we should not fail \nto realize that the chief victim of the current welfare system, the \nchief victims, are the children. If anyone doubts that, talk to \nfamilies who are on welfare. Talk to the children. I believe the chief \nbenefit of this bill, quite frankly, is the hope it holds for these \nchildren.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. In the absence of a speaker on the Democratic side, I \nyield myself up to 10 minutes to speak at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, as we come to the conclusion of this \ndebate, I think we should be proud of the efforts of the Senate and of \nthe Congress. For the better part of 2 years we have now been working \ntoward, I think, a very positive conclusion to the debate on how we \nassist those in our society who are the most needy.\n  It is clear from an examination of the past 25 to 30 years that the \nso-called war on poverty has been, at least up until now, won by \npoverty. Although trillions of dollars, over $5 trillion, has been \nspent during this past 25 to 30 years to try to fight that war, we find \ntoday virtually the same percentage, if not a greater percentage, of \nAmericans below the poverty line than was the case when the war began. \nWe have spent, as I say, a lot of time debating in this Congress and in \nprevious Congresses why that is the case.\n  It is quite clear, and I think acknowledged now by virtually \neverybody who has been involved in this debate, that the process, the \nwelfare system in this country, is a principal reason why the war has \nnot been won. Some would say, yes, there is a problem, but we have yet \nto come to the proper solution to that problem. However, I disagree.\n  Indeed, we have worked very hard for, as I say, almost 2 years in \nthis Congress, building on work done in previous Congresses, to find \nthe solution. I believe this legislation, although maybe not ideal from \nthe perspective of any single Member, including the one from Michigan, \nis, nevertheless, a major step in the right direction.\n\n  I believe this approach will work, Mr. President. It will work for a \nvariety of reasons. First, it will work because it vests far more \nflexibility and far more decisionmaking and far more authority in the \n50 States. There may have been a time in this country when some States \nand communities did not step up to their obligations to assist those in \nneed. That is certainly not the case today. I do not know of one person \nin this Senate who has stood up here and said: ``My State will fail; my \nState will not take care of people; my State cannot meet the challenge; \nmy State is less compassionate than the National Government.'' I have \nnot heard one Member say that. That is because not one Member could say \nthat, Mr. President.\n  The States are as compassionate and as capable and more knowledgeable \nabout the problems confronted by their citizens than bureaucrats in \nWashington. This legislation gives those States the chance to translate \ntheir compassion and their insight and their expertise into the action \nit will take to assist people in need to move out of poverty and on to \nthe economic ladder.\n  This legislation works, also, Mr. President, because it changes the \nincentives. Yes, we place some tough standards in this legislation, \nincentives to people to get out of the welfare dependency role and on \nto and into the work force. We put time limits. We put the kind of \ntough standards that will cause people to understand that poverty is \nnot the way of life, that welfare is not the way of life, and to seek \nthe assistance of government at all levels to obtain the training and \nthe assistance and the help it will take to move into productive work. \nIt changes the incentives in the right direction.\n  The legislation is important, also, Mr. President, because for the \nfirst time it allows us to begin addressing one of the most important \nproblems we confront in this country, the problem of the rising rate of \nillegitimacy, of out-of-wedlock births in America. We provide in the \nlegislation incentives for States to find ways to solve the growing \nnumber of out-of-wedlock birth situations, incentives in the form of \nmore dollars for the various problems if States can address effectively \nthese issues and these problems, and do so without increasing the \nabortion rate at the same time.\n  Finally, this legislation makes sense, Mr. President, because it \nmeans less bureaucracy. In my State of Michigan, we think we have a \npretty darn good formula for addressing the problems that confront our \nmost needy citizens. Too often, however, Washington bureaucracy and red \ntape make it impossible to accomplish our objectives.\n  Just to put it in perspective, when we talk to people in our Family \nIndependence Agency--it used to be called the Department of Social \nServices; we tried to change the title to change the philosophy as to \nour objectives in that agency--the front-line case workers, the people \nwho are supposed to be out there at the front line assisting folks to \nget out of poverty and on to the economic ladder, two-thirds of their \ntime is not spent helping people get off welfare. Two-thirds of their \ntime is spent filling out paperwork, almost all of it coming from \nWashington. We believe in our State, for example, that we can take what \nis now a 30-page form that must be filled out by folks who are going to \ngo on to assistance programs and reduce it to about 5 pages, one-sixth \nthe size of the form that currently is used. The time the case worker \nwould have spent filling out the other 24 pages can now be spent \nhelping the recipient figure out what training programs and what \nstrategies will work to give them an opportunity to be productive and \nto get on the economic ladder. We think we should have the flexibility \nto get rid of the bureaucracy and to get rid of all that paperwork and \nconcentrate on the true challenge that we have.\n\n  For these reasons, I think the program that we are about to pass \ntonight is a sensible approach. I think it will do two things. I think \nit will help the people who need help and give confidence to people who \nhave lost it in our system, the people who pay the bills, the \ntaxpayers, who are frustrated by what they see as a losing war on \npoverty, confidence we are moving in the right direction. I think that \nwill translate, Mr. President, into more support for social agencies \nacross our States and in our communities, for charitable organizations, \nfor other types of approaches that will assist government in getting \nthe job done.\n  Finally, let me conclude with a comment about one particular topic \nthat has been discussed at great length during this debate. That is the \nissue of children. We all have different perspectives on this, of \ncourse. As I look back at the last 30 years, as I hear story after \nstory from the people in our social service agencies about families in \na cycle of dependency, about kids without hope, of rising crime rates \namong young people, of increased drug usage rates, of kids having \nkids, I can't help but think that what we have today has to be changed \nif we really care about helping kids. If we really want to help the \nchildren, we certainly should not, in any sense, continue this legacy, \ncontinue the system that has created so much unhappiness and so much \nhopelessness.\n\n  Let us replace the hopelessness with hope, Mr. President. Let us \nfinally put all the words and all the rhetoric of many years of \ncampaigns and Congresses into action. Let us do it tonight. Let us \nfinish the job and move in a new direction. Let us solve the problem. \nLet us help our most needy citizens in the best way possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. Last year, I voted for \nthe bill that the Senate passed 87-12 that went to conference \ncommittee. The conference committee moved significantly back, so much \nso that the President saw fit to veto it. I voted for the bill that \ncame back. I voted for the bill that went to the conference committee \nthis year. I listened very carefully to\n\n[[Page S9383]]\n\nthe comments today of my colleagues about this bill that comes back \nfrom the conference committee.\n  This bill that returns to the floor contains a number of important \nimprovements from the bill that was vetoed last year. The agreement \nbefore us assures that almost all categories of citizens who are \nwilling to work who are now eligible for Medicaid will continue to be \neligible for health care in the future. The bill increases child care \nfunding levels by $4 billion over that which was vetoed. It doesn't \ninclude the optional food stamp block grant, so our Nation will \ncontinue to have a national nutritional safety net that is below that \nwhich I think is necessary. The new bill also maintains the child care \nhealth and safety protections contained in the current law and \nreinstates a quality set-aside.\n  Additionally, whereas the vetoed bill block granted administration \nand child-placement services funding, this bill before us retains the \ncurrent law on child protection entitlement programs and services. And, \nfinally, compared to the vetoed bill, this new bill increases the \ncontingency fund from $1 billion to $2 billion to provide States with \nmore protection during an economic downturn.\n  Perhaps most important in the new bill is the child-support \nenforcement measures. These enormously significant changes will result \nin the most sweeping crackdown on deadbeat parents in history. As the \nPresident said yesterday, with this bill, we say to parents that if you \ndon't pay the child support you owe, you are going to have your wages \ngarnisheed, your driver's license taken away, and people will be chased \nacross State lines and tracked, and, if necessary, people will have to \nwork off what they owe. That is a monumental shift in attitude and \nculture; although, ultimately, I believe without equivocation, that we \nwill have to go further toward a national system, because one-third of \nall child-support cases are interstate cases. The measures contained in \nthis bill will dramatically improve the child-support system so \nchildren can get the support they need and deserve.\n  Notwithstanding these good advances, Mr. President, I have also \nlistened carefully to my colleagues on the floor, those who oppose it. \nThere is not one of them who has not expressed legitimate concerns, \nlegitimate fears. I respect those concerns and those fears, and I do \nnot believe that there is one of them who does not want welfare change \nin this Nation. But I do believe we are voting today on a fundamental \ndecision about change and what we are going to try to do. The fact is \nthat we are really codifying what 40 States are already involved in, \nbecause there are waivers all across this land. And we are codifying \nsomething for a period of 5 years, a 5-year experiment, during which \ntime, the 5 years, the full amount of time that people have before they \nwould be cut off, will not have yet expired. We will be reconsidering \nit before that date comes.\n\n  I believe that my colleagues who have cited problems that still \nremain with this bill are correct. But there is no way to a certainty, \nMr. President, to say what the interaction will be with those who will \ngo to work, those who will benefit from the increased minimum wage, \nthose families that will benefit by increased purchasing power from the \ncombination of work and minimum wage, and therefore less need for food \nstamps. There is no way to say to an absolute certainty what the impact \nof a new culture will be on children or the relationship of family.\n  What we do know is that it will be new, and what we do know is that \nit carries risks. Mr. President, we also know some things to a \ncertainty. I agree with the President and colleagues who come to the \nfloor that, although we made great strides to maintain the fundamental \nnutritional safety net, we do cut deeper than necessary in this bill. \nAnd I am disappointed in the bill's provisions on legal immigrants. \nLegal immigrants are people who pay taxes, they can be drafted, and \nthey are in this country completely legally. The harmful provisions \nthat are in this bill have nothing to do with welfare reform. They are \nfundamentally a savings mechanism. I will do everything in my power, \nMr. President, to see that we change those measures as rapidly as \npossible to adjust.\n  But as the President said yesterday, immigrant families with children \nwho fall on hard times through no fault of their own should be eligible \nfor medical and other help when they need it. If you are mugged on a \nstreet corner or are in an accident or you get cancer or the same thing \nhappens to your children, we are a society that should provide some \nassistance. I will do everything in my power to fight for that.\n  Finally, I was also disappointed that we weren't able to have the \nvouchers for children as a matter of automatic. But, Mr. President, as \nI balance the equities of this bill, the need for change, against those \nthings that we can remedy and against the experiment that is already \ntaking place in this country, it is my belief that the bill before us \nwill ultimately provide a leverage for change that will also change the \ndynamic of the debate in this country, and that is why, ultimately, I \nchoose to vote for the change and choose to vote for this bill.\n  For years now, the poverty rate for children has already been going \nup in America. We have the highest poverty rate of any industrial \nnation in the world. But when we come to the floor of the U.S. Senate \nto try to do something for children, we are told, well, now, wait a \nminute, their parents don't want to work, or it is the welfare system \nthat created the problem. In fact, the welfare debate that has been so \nadequately distorted in so many regards obscures the real debate about \nchildren and about how you put people to work.\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that by taking that off the table, we \nare, in fact, going to begin the real debate in this Nation today about \nhow we adequately take care of those kids.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. EXON. I have exactly 1 minute left. I yield that 1 minute only to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Thank you. Mr. President, I believe that, by taking this \naway, providing we are vigilant and providing we all mean what we say, \nproviding we are prepared to do what we ought to do in conscience, we \nwill now begin to focus on the children of this country and we will \nbegin to focus on the real work of how you put people to work. I \nbelieve that is the most important debate that the country can have and \ntake away from it any demagoguery or artificiality that is placed in \nfront of us about welfare or stereotypes with respect to it. I believe \nit is an important change.\n  Yes, people ought to work. Hard-working American citizens should not \nbe required to carry people. But we also have to be honest about the \ndifficulties of some of our population trying to actually find that \nwork. We should not hurt children.\n  I want to spend every ounce of energy I have, Mr. President, on the \nfloor of the Senate to stop the business of the Senate, if necessary, \nto guarantee that we fulfill that commitment as we judge how this works \nover the next months and years.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished \nfloor manager from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, let me say, first, that nobody knows better than I \nthat our welfare system does not work very well. Everyone who is going \nto vote against this bill today said they do not like the system, that \nit is broke. There is a lot of truth in that.\n  There are a number of reasons I am going to vote against this bill. \nFirst, the bill is not going to address those deficiencies we all know \nexist in the system. Second, I am going to vote against it because it \ndiscriminates against my home State of Arkansas in a massive way. \nChildren in my State will get $390 a year. Children in Massachusetts \nwill get $4,200 a year; in Washington, DC, $2,200 a year. You tell me \nwhy a child in Arkansas is worth $390 a year and $4,200 in \nMassachusetts. You expect me to vote for a formula like that, one that \ndoes not even take into consideration how many poor children are in \nyour State?\n  Everybody hates welfare. I am not too crazy about it myself. But I \nwill tell you one thing. I have seen it firsthand. I have been in the \nghettos of my\n\n[[Page S9384]]\n\nState in the Delta. I can tell you it is not a pretty picture. Mr. \nPresident, I find it rather perverse that 535 men and women who make \n$133,000 a year will be voting on whether children are going to eat or \nnot, whether their mothers are going to eat or not.\n  Never has such an important piece of legislation been crafted in such \na highly charged political environment. Everybody understands precisely \nwhat the politics of this whole thing are. The election is coming up. \nSo we have to do it. I said the other day that there ought to be a rule \nin the Congress against considering bills like this during an election \nyear. The American people detest welfare. I understand that. But there \nought to be a rule against considering these kinds of bills that affect \nthe very fiber of this Nation in an election year.\n  This is the first time in my lifetime we have deliberately and \nknowingly and with some elation turned our back on the children of this \nNation. I still believe those Methodist Sunday school stories I heard \nabout ``blessed are the poor.'' I used to be one of them.\n  We are going to kick people off welfare and tell them to get a job. I \nwould like to invite all of my colleagues to go to the Arkansas Delta. \nI will pick out a dozen communities for you to visit, and then you tell \nme after you have kicked these mothers off welfare where they are going \nto get a job; 50 percent of these mothers will be kicked off the \nwelfare rolls after the first 2 years. There are no jobs.\n  We could not even find it in our hearts to provide vouchers for \nmothers so they could provide diapers, medicines, and other necessities \nfor children. We wouldn't even give them a voucher to buy nonfood \nproducts for their children. I can't vote for this.\n  We have one out of every five children in this country in poverty. \nYou think of it. One out of every five children in this country, 20 \npercent, now live in poverty. Every single study of this bill says \nthere will be a minimum of 1 million to 2.5 million children added to \nthose rolls within 5 years.\n  Oh, Mr. President, I could go on and on about why I am not going to \nvote for this bill. Simply, I just can't find it in my heart to vote \nfor a bill that I consider to be punitive. Punitive toward whom? Not \njust some lethargic person on welfare, but innocent children. If you \nare a legal alien and the school district wants to take your child, \nthat is their business. We are not going to pay for it. So if you are a \nlegal alien, you have a right to be here, you work here, you pay taxes \nhere, and you send your child down to the school. They may take your \nchild, but they will not let him go to the lunchroom because the \nFederal Government pays that bill, and ``We ain't paying.'' We are not \ngoing to pay it. I have heard it said that 47 members of our Olympic \nteam are legal aliens, or children of legal aliens. Tonight, instead of \nhonoring them during the Olympics, we are turning are backs on them.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I admit I am soft-hearted. I am very compassionate \ntoward children and women. So I just simply cannot vote for this bill. \nI wish everybody well, and I hope it works. I do not believe it will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I speak as someone who has worked on this issue for \nnow 4 years. This is a very meaningful thing for me personally. But I \nthink, as I look at this legislation and as I look at the process it \nhas been through, I can't help but think what we are doing here is \nprobably the most significant piece of social welfare legislation that \nwe passed maybe since the mid-1960's, and I would even suggest possibly \nsince the 1930's. So it is a very significant day. We are making \nmonumental decisions here that are going to affect millions of people.\n  I understand that the passions run very high on both sides of the \naisle on how desperately we need these changes, as some suggest, and \nhow erroneous these decisions are by others who oppose the bill.\n  If I can for a moment, because I know there has been a lot of debate \nabout why we need to make these changes and what the bill does or does \nnot do, or should or should not do, let me talk for a minute as to how \nthis bill got here.\n  I think, if you look back at the genesis of this proposal, you have \nto go back to the House of Representatives. A task force was put \ntogether by Newt Gingrich, a task force on welfare reform when we were \nin the minority over in the House back in 1993. He asked me, as the \nranking member on the Ways and Means Subcommittee of Human Resources, \nto chair a task force of members of the subcommittee and other people, \nincluding the former Governor of Delaware, Michael Castle, the Governor \nfrom Missouri, and a few others, to sit down and try to put together a \nbill that would follow through on ending welfare as we know it.\n  We got all sorts of testimony from people. We talked to literally \nhundreds of people all over the country about the problems in the \nwelfare system and listened to all of the experts and pseudoexperts on \nthe issue of welfare--frankly, not just from conservatives but from \nacross the spectrum--as to the pitfalls that we might encounter.\n  Let me first state that this was an extraordinary thing to do. We \nactually took this very seriously. When you are in the minority, when \nyou work on a major issue like this, most people do not pay much \nattention to what you do. ``You are not going to pass this bill. It is \nnot going to become law.'' So there is sometimes a feeling, ``Well, \nlet's just sort of put together what we can, sort of patch together \nsome popular ideas, throw it out, and it will get a story for 1 day and \nno one will pay much attention to it after that.''\n  I can tell you that myself, Nancy Johnson, Clay Shaw, Michael Castle, \nand a whole lot of other folks who were in the House last term took \nthis as a real serious responsibility. We met literally for, I think, 6 \nor 7 months, every week, hours upon hours each week, just over every \nsingle item in the legislation.\n  It was a wonderful experience for me. But I think it was a great \nexperience for all of us to see the real complexities of what we are \ndealing with. I think we got a real understanding of some of the \nconcerns that Members have expressed here.\n  We came out with a bill in November of 1993. It addressed for the \nfirst time issues like the paternal establishments which are in this \nbill. The provisions we wrote in this bill almost 3 years ago are \nalmost identical. In fact, I suggest they maybe are identical to the \nprovisions that are in the bill today that we addressed--the issue, for \nthe first time ever, of immigration and benefits to legal aliens. It \nwas the first time the bill had come up and addressed that issue. And \nthose provisions are in this bill today.\n  We addressed the issue of illegitimacy. Again, that was a word that, \nfrankly, we were not supposed to use anymore. It was a politically \nincorrect word. You were supposed to use the word ``out-of-wedlock \nbirth.'' We addressed that issue for the first time and really brought \nthe attention of the welfare debate on this scourge in our Nation.\n  I know it has been cited here before, but in 1965, the illegitimacy \nrate in this country was about 5 or 6 percent. Today a third of the \nchildren in this country are born out of wedlock. I am not saying that \nwelfare is the sole cause of that. It certainly is not. But it \ncertainly is a contributing factor, in my mind and, I think, in other \npeople's minds. We were trying to come up with ideas, some of which \nwere included, and, frankly, a lot were not. But we pushed the envelope \nfor the first time. We put this in the forefront and made it an issue \nof debate. Yes; we had time limits on welfare. Yes; we had work \nrequirements--real work requirements. And those time limits of 2 years \nwithout having to work and 5 years total on welfare are in this bill \ntoday.\n  If you go back and look at that original draft, I think you are going \nto see a lot of similarities in child support enforcement and a whole \nhost of other areas that are in the bill today. And I think it is a \nremarkable compliment to the men and women who worked in that group \nthat their hard work, seemingly fruitless at the time because we were a \nminority, had absolutely no hope that we would ever be in the majority \nbut cared enough--I think that is the point I am trying to make--we \ncared enough about this system and the destruction that the system was\n\n[[Page S9385]]\n\ncausing, we cared enough to spend hours and hours of time to put \ntogether a bill that we felt truly would change welfare and end the \ndespair and the dependency that this system has created.\n  So I congratulate my friends in the House who made a tremendous \ncontribution to the original bill, and I congratulate others for the \nsuccessor bills, the bills that were introduced in the Senate by \nSenator Packwood and in the House subsequently by Clay Shaw, who was a \nmember of that original working group. They took the next logical step \nand moved the ball forward on a few issues, fell back a little bit on \nothers, but that is how the legislative process works. We tried to meet \nthe concerns of, frankly, both sides of the aisle. And I know when \nSenator Packwood, and then subsequently when Senator Roth took over the \nFinance Committee, we actually crafted a bill here on the Senate floor \nlast year that got 87 votes and then recrafted another bill, very \nsimilar to the bill that passed last year, and got 74 votes, and I \nsuspect we will get maybe even a few more than that this time around. \nThey did the same thing in the House and continued to get more \nbipartisan support as we worked through some of the difficult issues of \nwelfare reform.\n  The core of those bills remains the same, and that is that we are \ngoing to do something about illegitimacy. There is an incentive now \nsponsored by Senator Abraham, one of the improvements to the bill, for \nStates to reduce their illegitimacy rates, and there is a cash bonus \nfor States that are able to reduce that statistic, that cruel statistic \nto children. And I say cruel because go through all of the evaluation \ncriteria: Children who are born to single-parent households are more \nlikely to be poor, are more likely to be on welfare, more likely to do \npoorer in school, more likely to be victims of crime. You can go on \ndown the list. We are doing no favors to children when fathers are told \nthat they are expendable.\n  In the welfare system that we are creating here today, fathers are no \nlonger expendable. Fathers are going to be required to be responsible \nfor the children. Mothers are going to be required to cooperate with \nthe Government in establishing paternity--two things that were in the \noriginal bill that we drafted 3 years ago that have stood the test of \ntime and scrutiny in both Houses of Congress, because it is the right \nthing to do. We have stood up and said families are important under \nthis bill. We have stood up and said communities are important.\n  Senator Ashcroft, in another good addition to this bill, said that \nreligious, civic, and nonprofit organizations in the local communities \nare going to be much more able to be part of the system of welfare, of \nsupport of the poor than they are today, are going to be eligible for \nmore funds and more opportunities to help the poor, which they do much \nbetter, much more efficiently, but, frankly, even if they did not do it \nmore efficiently, they do it more compassionately. They do it with love \nfor their neighbors and the people in their communities, not out of \nsome sense of duty because it is their job.\n\n  We have changed welfare in this bill, and we have done it over a long \nprocess. Those who would suggest this is just something that was thrown \ntogether at the last minute before an election do not know the work, or \neither choose not to recognize the work that has been put into this \nbill, the time and the debate, the hours of the debate here on the \nfloor and over in the House, in the conference committees, to try to \ncome up with a carefully crafted bill that is truly compassionate and \nnot compassionate in the sense that the Federal Government is going to \ngo out and take care of every person's need who is poor.\n  I think we have shown that that system is truly not compassionate \nbecause when the Federal Government comes in and takes care of every \naspect or every need that even a child has, then the Federal \nGovernment, in fact, becomes the replacement for the others whose \nresponsibility it truly should be to take care of that child. We have \nsaid to the father, again, you are not necessary. We have said to \nmothers, you do not have to work; we will provide--some distant \nbureaucrat will send a check to provide for you.\n  That is not compassion. Compassion is having a system that builds \nfamilies so there is an environment there for children to flourish. \nCompassion is a system that supports neighborhoods and civic \norganizations, mediating institutions that Dan Coats talks about so \noften that provide the values and community support for families that \nthey need to help take care of children, to create the neighborhoods \nwhere children are no longer afraid to go out and play on the \nplayground because they could step on some drug-infected needle.\n  No, this bill is all about creating a community, creating a support \nnetwork and environment at the level most important to that child as \nopposed to that bureaucrat sitting behind the bulletproof window \npassing out the check every month, saying to that person on the other \nend receiving that check that you, because of your poverty, are unable \nto provide for yourself and your children and you need to be dependent \nupon us for your life.\n  The Senator from Arkansas said it is a tragedy that one in five \nchildren in this country are in poverty, and I agree it is a tragedy. \nAnd he said it is going to get worse. I suggest he is wrong. I suggest \nthe tragedy is as bad as it is going to get, and there are plenty of \norganizations as a result of this bill that are going to get the \nopportunity to step forward, including the family.\n  I feel very good about what we are doing here, and I would say, as my \nfriend and colleague in the House, Clay Shaw, said many times, I am not \nsuggesting this bill is perfect. I grant you this bill is not perfect. \nNo bill is perfect. But I can guarantee you that this is a dramatic \nstep forward that this country has asked for and is getting from a \nCongress that is listening.\n  Yes, we will make mistakes. Unlike those who crafted the current \nsystem in the thirties and in the 1960's, we are going to be willing to \ncome back here and look at those mistakes. We are going to be willing \nto come back and face those problems, because we understand, unlike \nthose who crafted the last system, that we do not have all the answers \nhere, that we do not have the omnipotence here to decide what is best \nfor everyone.\n  This is a grand experiment, one that we must take if we are going to \nsave children in this country and, more importantly, to save the fabric \nof America for the next and future generations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I advise Senators on both sides of the aisle \nthat we have 11 minutes remaining. I am about to yield 7 minutes to the \nSenator from Florida. There will be 2 minutes to Senator Heflin and 2 \nminutes to Senator Ford.\n  I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, when we voted on this matter a few days \nago, I voted ``no.'' Today, I am going to vote for the conference \nreport, and I wish to explain why I am taking that position.\n  As I assessed the conference report, it seemed to me that we had \nbasically two options. One option was to wait until there was a better \npoint at which to commence and continue our effort at welfare reform \nand be prepared to accept the status quo until that second opportunity \npresented itself. I felt that was likely to be a long time from \ntonight.\n  The second option is to accept a clearly less than perfect bill, I \nwould say, accept a flawed bill, but one which represents a step in a \nmultistep process leading toward a fundamental transition from a \nwelfare system that has focused on providing for the needs of a \ndependent population to a welfare system that provides the ladder by \nwhich people can move from dependence to independence. I believe it is \nmore appropriate to take that second road. I believe this is the time \nto take that leap of faith.\n  To use some statistics from my State of Florida, 3 years ago, in \n1993, we had an unemployment rate of 7 percent. We had 254,000 persons \nwho were on the AFDC caseload. That is 254,000 families that were on \nAFDC. Today, in 1996, we have a 200,000 AFDC caseload, a reduction of \n54,000 in 3 years. That says that we are in a period of a strong \neconomy, creating jobs, providing people with the opportunity within \nthe current system to get off welfare and to get a job.\n\n[[Page S9386]]\n\n I think that is the ideal environment in which, now, to have this new \nsystem which will be giving to the 200,000 who are still on welfare the \nmeans by which they can get a job and end dependence. If we cannot make \nthis transition work under the economic conditions that exist in my \nState and most of the States of America in the summer of 1996, then I \ndoubt we will see a time in the foreseeable future when we could make \nthis system work.\n  It is for that reason that our Governor has announced his support for \nthis program. It is for that reason our legislature has passed its own \nversion of welfare reform, building on important demonstration projects \nin our State which have tested out what is going to be required in \norder to make this new system achieve its objective.\n  I stated candidly that this is a bill which is far from perfect, and \nwhich has some flaws. That presents, as I believe the Senator from \nPennsylvania just stated, the agenda for our action in the future. I \nsuggest two areas in which I think that attention should be focused. \nOne of those is on the basic financial arrangement between the Federal \nGovernment and the States. We start this in a period of prosperity. We \nknow the business cycle has not yet been repealed. There will be times \nwhen we will return to the circumstances of the early 1990's, when we \nhad unemployment rates ranging from 7.4 to 8.3 percent. We need to \nrelook at our financial relationships to assure that we have the \nflexibility, the elasticity in order to protect States during those \ndownturns.\n  We need to also look at the issue of fairness of allocation. I \ncontinue to be distressed at the fact that we are using the old method \nof allocating Federal funds, the formula that we developed for the \nsystem we are now rejecting as we move into the new system. I suggest \nthat is inappropriate, an inappropriate bit of baggage we are carrying \nwith us and it is going to be a heavy piece of baggage, in terms of \nachieving the objectives of moving people from welfare to work, \nparticularly in States such as Arkansas, which start this process as \nvery low beneficiary States and are therefore restricted in the amount \nof funds they will have available.\n  The second area in which I believe we need to focus our attention is \non the issue of legal aliens. It confounds me as to why legal aliens \nwere brought into this bill, which has, as its title, welfare reform. \nThat has very little relationship with the severe cutbacks in benefits \nfor legal aliens. These are our parents and grandparents of just a \ngeneration or two ago, who came to this country seeking the freedom of \nAmerica. Now, those who have followed them in that 200-year quest for \nthose values of America, we are now putting into a second-class status. \nThere is no relationship to the goals we are trying to achieve in \nwelfare reform. It has a lot to do with the fact this is a voiceless, \nvulnerable population, from which we can seek some additional resources \nin order to meet our budgetary goals.\n\n  Let us be clear, this is a budget issue, not a welfare reform issue \nas we speak of legal aliens. And it is going to be a major budget issue \nfor those communities which have sizable numbers of legal aliens who \nwill now become an unpaid charge to the local public hospital. So that \narea will also require our attention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I conclude by saying it is with a leap of \nfaith that we undertake this initiative. I think we are doing it at a \ntime which gives us the greatest hope and expectation that faith will \nbe justified.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Simpson is next. I believe he \nhas asked us for 10 minutes? Up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Domenici, always, for his \ncourtesy, his kindness and his generosity in what he does for all of \nus; and to recognize once again how hard he works. And, also, Senator \nExon, who came here to this body when I did. I do not think anyone \nrealizes the task of the chairman and ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee and what they do. Through the years I have watched with awe, \nas they deal with every single issue that confronts us and do it with a \nsteadiness and skill that is enviable. I do mean that.\n  I think we have a good measure here. It has certainly been through \nthe grinder. We have all looked at it carefully. There is nothing new \nin it. I support it. I served on the Finance Committee. I listened to \nthe hearings. I tried to add my own dimension of activity and support \nto it in its passage. So I commend those who have worked so hard on \nthis issue. I commend the President who has indicated he will sign the \nbill.\n  There are some troubling things in there for me. One especially, \nbecause I did not have any real active participation in it, and that is \nwith regard to the benefits to legal immigrants of the United States. \nThere is a great difference between an illegal immigrant and a \npermanent resident alien. We should not be making distinctions on \npermanent resident aliens, in my mind, to the degree here. I did not \nparticipate in any aspect of that because I felt it would detract from \nwhat I was trying to do with legal and illegal immigration--which we \nhave dealt with, and legal immigration, which we did not deal with.\n  Next year, when legal immigration goes up from 900,000 to 1 million \npeople, the people of America will wonder what we did in this Congress. \nBut I think we will deal with the issue of illegal immigration. We are \nnot far from resolving that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9352-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9386-S9387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MENTAL HEALTH PARITY\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, let me just say I am deeply troubled the \nconferees for the health insurance bill have apparently decided to not \ninclude any form of mental health parity on the final bill. In April, \n68 Senators voted aye on an amendment by Senators Domenici and \nWellstone that would prohibit health plans from discriminating against \npeople who have mental illness. This amendment was not a sense-of-the-\nSenate proposal or some meaningless resolution. We do plenty of those \nin this place. They always come back to haunt us, but we do them all \nthe time--sense-of-the-Senate this, sense-of-the-Senate that. That is \nnot what this was. It was a real piece of legislation.\n  It was real legislation that expressly prohibited health plans from \nimposing treatment limits and financial requirements on services for \nmental illness that are not also imposed with respect to physical \nailments. It was deeply gratifying to me personally to see so many \nSenators cast a rollcall vote, clearly ``on the record,'' in bipartisan \nsupport of ending this terribly unfair discrimination.\n  It is discrimination, that is what it is. We talk about that all day \nin here. If there is ever a more blatant form of discrimination, I do \nnot know what it is. To think we still carry such a stigma in society \nof mental illness is dark ages stuff.\n  So 3 months later, I am absolutely stunned that we are unable to gain \nsupport for the Domenici-Wellstone compromise which represents a very \nmere ``slice,''--a minuscule slice--of the original amendment that \nreceived 68 votes.\n  All this compromise would require is that mental health ``parity'' be \nachieved with respect to annual payment limit caps and lifetime caps.\n  I think it is rather curious that the conferees rejected this \ncompromise, held tough for so long and, at the same time they accepted \nanother compromise on medical savings accounts which received only 46 \nvotes on the Senate floor, and I am one of the 46 who voted for medical \nsavings accounts.\n  I am pleased we were able to work out an agreement on that aspect of \nthe bill, but I certainly must question why the same spirit of \ncooperation was nowhere to be found when the issue of mental health was \nconsidered.\n  I am especially troubled that some of the special interest groups--\nboy, have they been sharpening their fangs in this session of the \nlegislature; I have felt a little of it--have been so aggressive in \nlobbying against this compromise. To say that this small measure of \nparity is too costly is absolutely utterly absurd. As Senator Domenici \npointed out, this entire bill is a mandate. To single out this one lone \nlonely mental health provision and label it as a costly mandate when \nthe whole thing\n\n[[Page S9387]]\n\nis a mandate is a classic example of absurdity and discrimination. Yes \nI will use the term one more time.\n  Sadly, that is what this debate is now all about. Discrimination is \nsurely not something new to those who suffer from mental illness, I say \nto my colleagues. They have had it for a lifetime, and the stigma hangs \nand it is demeaning and it is wrong. It is not something we should \naccept without a good fight.\n  I have deepest admiration and respect for my friend Senator \nKassebaum. She too came here when I did. I would certainly hate to see \nher work product injured or disrupted, but I respectfully urge my \ncolleagues to consider what we are doing, and I hope Senators Domenici \nand Wellstone will work toward some other result, and I will work with \nthem in that objective.\n  It is time to rid ourselves of this tragedy of stigma and \ndiscrimination. To see the business community do what they have done \nwith regard to this issue deserves closer attention from all of us on \nthis and other issues of the day where they apparently feel a great \nstrength surging through their muscles and they do things they never \ndid before. We will address that at some future time, too.\n  I certainly respect those who have worked so hard to bring this about \nand will certainly give my full energies to seeing if we cannot get a \nbetter result. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Simpson. I think he will \njoin me in saying, as both of us talk to the business community about \nwhat they have done here, we want to acknowledge that some very good \nbusinesses in America already have decided to cover mental illness, and \nnone of our remarks are directed at them. There are many self-insured \nand otherwise who are doing a good job of considering this \ndiscrimination.\n  I thank him for his remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9386-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9387-S9415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORK OPPORTUNITY RECONCILIATION ACT OF \n                        1996--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, 1 week ago, I voted for the welfare reform \nlegislation that passed the Senate. Previously, I had supported two \nalternatives--one a Democratic version and the other a bipartisan \nalternative. Although both these attempts failed, some of their \nprovisions were adopted into the bill that passed, making if far better \nby providing a wider safety net for children and the poor.\n  The conference report before us now is not as good as I would like. \nIt probably is not anyone's ideal plan for welfare reform. Frankly, I \nthink the Senate's version was preferable to this conference report. \nBut, while some provisions within the legislation are still troubling \nand need to be reworked down the road, at least we are off to a good \nstart in reforming a system that we all agree to a good start in \nreforming a system that we all agree is broken and needs to be \noverhauled. One thing is certain: regardless of its shortcomings, this \nbill is a product of sincere efforts to end the harmful dependency and \nother severe short-comings which currently exist in our welfare system. \nThroughout this debate and these difficult negotiations, I have been \nimpressed with the diligence, tenacity, and honesty which Members have \ndisplayed in trying to come up with an acceptable plan to end welfare \nas we know it.\n  The measure we are considering today does, in fact, represent a \nchange in philosophy in how we think about children and families. This \nis the most significant and sweeping change in the social compact of \nour Nation since the New Deal. Its strength is that it overhauls our \nwelfare system without the harshness of previous bills that have been \nvetoed. The two vetoes, along with the threat of a third, served the \npurpose of eliminating the extreme measures that made the previous \nbills unacceptable--even harmful.\n  For example, we have now rightly recognized that a mother with young \nchildren who wants to work will have access to adequate child-care. \nAlso among its vast improvements is the fact that child nutrition \nprograms, such as the school lunch program, are not block granted. The \nsame is true of the Food Stamp Program. I had grave fears that block-\ngranting these kinds of nutrition programs would impose tremendous \nburdens on States like Alabama, which over the years has suffered from \nseveral periods of budget proration and economic recession. Programs \nlike these aimed at helping children and the poor would have faced \ndrastic cuts if they had been block-granted.\n  This measure raises the cap on the contingency fund from $1 billion \nto $2 billion to provide States with more protection during economic \ndownturns. It also adds a new trigger mechanism based on the food stamp \ncaseload. It includes some provisions for States to establish objective \ncriteria for delivery of benefits and to ensure equitable and fair \ntreatment.\n  This welfare reform legislation, while not as sound as the Senate-\npassed plan, is still a vast improvement over the Republican bills \nwhich were vetoed. As I stated earlier, I still have some reservations \nsurrounding certain provisions contained in the measure. But I believe, \noverall, that the positive outweighs the negative. I think the \ncompromise we have struck is a major step in the right direction, and \nan overall positive effort at making welfare more of a helping hand in \ngetting people on their feet economically.\n\n  Our debate over the last few months has been both constructive and \nproductive. We now have a bill before us which is a testament to the \nCongress and its leadership--majority and minority. In essence, it is a \nproduct of the Congress' legislative process working as it was designed \nto work.\n  We have seen some hard-fought battles and witnessed significant \nchanges from the original bill after some intense debate and good-faith \nnegotiations between the two sides of the aisle. Each side has made \nconcessions, while holding firm to certain core principles. We have \narrived at agreements on several major issues. As a result, we now have \na bill that contains stronger work provisions and that is not as harsh \non children. While there are undoubtedly problems still remaining in \nthe legislation that will have to be addressed down the road, this \ncompromise is an overall positive step for reforming welfare, reducing \ndependency, and offering a brighter future for millions of American \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, except for the balanced budget constitutional \namendment, this welfare reform bill is arguably the most important \nlegislation we will tackle in this or any other Congress. There is no \ndoubt that our current system is failing welfare recipients and \ntaxpayers alike. I am pleased to join my colleagues and the President \nin taking advantage of this historic opportunity and enacting reforms \nwhich will empower recipients to break cycles of dependency, to focus \non work and responsibility, and to become successful and productive \ncitizens.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about this important \nissue before us--perhaps the most important initiative undertaken by \nthe 104th Congress--welfare reform. For the last nineteen months, \nCongress has been embroiled in an enormous debate over how best to \nreform our welfare system. There has been a lot of talk about ending \nwelfare ``as we know it'', but for the most part, it has been just talk \nand no action. Today, however, the Senate stands close to passing \nlegislation that I believe will make the much-needed changes in the way \nour welfare system operates.\n  I think many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as \na majority of my fellow Montanans, would agree that our welfare system \nneeds improving. I am glad we agree that changes need to be made in our \nwelfare system so that our assistance programs are more effective and \nless costly. Let's face it, however, we don't need this legislation to \nknow that the welfare system has failed miserably. The truth is, the \nsystem is not working as it was intended--as a temporary assistance to \nhelp people until they can get back to work. Over the last thirty \nyears, the system has become a way of life, not because those receiving \nassistance don't want to work, but because the\n\n[[Page S9388]]\n\nsystem makes it tough, even discourages people, to get off welfare.\n  Although we all know that this bill before us today will not solve \nall the problems with the current welfare system, it does take a giant \nstep toward reversing years of failed social welfare policy. This bill \nwill end welfare as a way of life for many Americans. By requiring most \nable-bodied adults to go to work within two years and by putting a \nfive-year limit on welfare assistance, we are making great strides \nforward in putting people back to work. I have to believe that most \npeople would rather work than be on welfare. And it pleases me to no \nend that the tough and real work requirements contained in this bill \nwill get folks off the welfare roles and into a productive job, job \ntraining program or community service. There is no doubt there will be \nexceptions, but the goal of welfare reform is independence, not \ngovernment reliance.\n  This bill also contains provisions to strengthen families and \npersonal responsibility, something I think is essential to getting at \nthe root of our welfare problems. In a scant few decades, we have seen \nthe demise of families and family values in our country. And \nillegitimacy rates are rising to almost dangerous levels. These are the \nthings that are contributing most to the decline in our society. More \nand more children are growing up without a father, without a solid \nfamily to support them, and crime statistics show that kids who are \nraised without a father commit more crimes. I think our welfare system, \nthough designed to assist folks and born of good-hearted intentions, \nhas served to fuel some of the social problems we face today. It \nis clear that our present welfare system encourages young mothers to \nhave children, and many of those children are not being cared for. \nThough it is impossible to legislate, this bill takes a giant step \nforward in addressing these problems by encouraging families to stay \ntogether, providing more resources for child care and enhancing child \nsupport enforcement and domestic violence measures.\n\n  Perhaps the fact that is most important to me personally, by passing \nthis bill we will give the states flexibility to design programs that \nwill work best for their residents. Currently, the Federal Government \nhas so many rules and regulations that when States want to try \nsomething innovative to reform the welfare system, like my home State \nof Montana, the barriers are often times too great. Over the last 7 \nyears, I have spoken with the folks who administer the welfare programs \nin my State and time and time again they ask for the opportunity and \nflexibility to run the welfare system as they see fit. And by block \ngranting funds to the States and letting States set many of their own \nprogram rules, this bill will allow the decisionmaking to be done at \nthe state and local level, not by Washington bureaucrats. There is no \ndoubt in my mind this will serve both our Nation and, specifically, the \npeople of my State well. After all, Montanans do know what is best for \nMontana.\n  The bill does all this and will still succeed in reducing welfare \nspending by roughly $55 billion over 6 years. Given our Nation's budget \nproblems, that's an important fact.\n  I realize that there are many Americans, including a number of folks \nin Montana, who have serious concerns with this legislation. Folks seem \nto be particularly troubled by the possibility that this bill will \nactually increase poverty and fails to provide a nutritional ``safety \nnet'' for our Nation's needy families. I appreciate and understand \nthese concerns--no one wants to push more children and families into \nmisery. In fact, I have been an ardent supporter of nutrition programs \nin the past, especially those for children, and I have made every \neffort to protect them throughout the current welfare reform process.\n  The reality is, however, that the American taxpayer is not getting \nhis money's worth when it comes to many of the current assistance \nprograms and the tragic state of the welfare system makes reforming the \nsystem all the more urgent. What's more, there have been those who have \nsuggested that this bill is heartless and out to punish children and \nimmigrants. In response to those who would make such accusations, I \nwould join with many of my colleagues in asking if the current welfare \nsystem is not already punishing--even degrading--children and other \nfolks it is supposed to help? Why do we insist on protecting, or at \nleast not reforming, a system that promotes a culture of dependency and \npoverty? As for the immigration provisions contained in the bill, \nperhaps Senator Santorum summed it up best when he noted that as we \nbecome the retirement home for the rest of the world, the taxpayers of \nthis country are picking up the tab. To that end, the goal of this \nwelfare reform bill is not to punish, favor or discriminate against \nanyone or any group. Its intent is not to promote and strengthen the \nsystem. It is constructed to end the cycle of generational dependency \nand irresponsibility promoted by the current welfare system.\n\n  Mr. President, we have a historic opportunity today to change a \nsystem that has consistently failed poor Americans. I want to thank the \nGovernors and all of those who have worked so hard, in both parties, to \nbring this legislation to this point. I particularly want to commend \nthe Republican leadership for leading the way on this issue. Though Bob \nDole may not be with us on the Senate floor today, I also want to thank \nhim for his efforts and dedication in ending welfare as we know it. I \nalso want to congratulate President Clinton on his announcement \nyesterday. Though the President has resisted real welfare reform by \ncasting two vetoes on similar bills in the past, he has realized that \nthe American people want this bill and that bipartisan cooperation is \nneeded to reform this broken system. And with the overwhelming \nbipartisan support in the House yesterday, it looks as though we are \nseeing our way clear to bring about the much needed reforms with what I \nbelieve will be the right kinds of results.\n  In closing, Mr. President, it was almost exactly 1 year ago--in fact, \nit was August 9, 1995--that I stood on the floor of this esteemed \nchamber and spoke about how much I was looking forward to the upcoming \nwelfare reform debate. I spoke about how excited I was to see some real \nchanges in how Americans perceive welfare, how welfare is paid out, and \nthe direction our country was headed. There were a number of goals then \nthat I was looking for in welfare reform legislation. Would it promote \nand strengthen the family? Would it give more flexibility to the \nStates, allowing each State to design a system that best suits their \nneeds? Would it include strong work requirements to get folks back into \nthe workplace? Would it address our growing problem with illegitimacy \nand teenage pregnancy? Mr. President, I think we have addressed these \nissues with this legislation.\n  It is now a year later. During this time, a number of differing \nopinions have been offered--suggestions put forth--on how best to \nachieve these goals. It has been a very slow process indeed--but I \nthink that most of us would agree that welfare reform is still very \nnecessary and this bill does that. Business as usual was not working in \nAugust 1995 or even in November 1992, and it is not working now. All \nAmericans deserve the chance to succeed, whether they are poor or not. \nI think this bill gives all of us the chance to do just that. Let's not \nsquander this opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I will vote for this bill because \nmaintaining the status quo is unacceptable. The other alternative is to \ndo nothing. I vote for this bill, having reservations, but believing it \nis the right thing to do.\n  We Democrats have made 36 important improvements in this bill that \nprotect the most vulnerable, the children. But there are still yellow \nflashing lights, warnings regarding the bill's safety net for children. \nWe will need to monitor them closely.\n  On balance, though, I believe the poor and the taxpayers will be \nbetter off because we are voting for this bill.\n  We all acknowledge that our current welfare system does not work. It \nhas failed to move people from welfare to work, and has created a \nculture of poverty that has ensnared generations of our most vulnerable \ncitizens in poverty and dependency. I believe in the capacity of people \nto better their lives and build a better future for themselves and \ntheir families. The current welfare system does not provide people with\n\n[[Page S9389]]\n\nthe tools they need to do that. Welfare should be a way to a better \nlife not a way of life.\n  The current welfare system is dysfunctional and destructive to the \npoor. I have worked to change that. I have fought for a plan, which I \nhelped to write, that was firm on work and demanded responsibility from \nthose who find themselves on public assistance, but that protected \nchildren.\n  I will vote for this bill because it is greatly improved over the \noriginal Republican bill which the Senate debated last year. There are \nsome 36 improvements in the bill, improvements which I fought for and \nwhich are drawn largely from the Democratic alternative bill which I \nco-authored with Democratic leader Senator Daschle and Senator Breaux.\n  Our Democratic alternative provided people with the tools to move \nfrom welfare to work. It demanded work of all able-bodied adults. It \nremoved the key barriers to work--such as lack of adequate child care \nand inadequate job skills. Our bill ensured that no child would go \nwithout health care or adequate nutritional assistance because of the \nfailings of their parents. It ensured that when we aimed at the parent \nwe did not hit the child.\n  I am proud of my work on the Democratic alternative bill. I am proud \nthat we gained the support of every Democratic Member of this body. I \nregret that it was rejected by the other party. But thanks to the \npersistent advocacy of our Democratic leadership, of which I am a \nmember, many of the provisions of the Democratic alternative were \nadopted in the bill that the Senate passed. They are now in this \nlegislation. These improvements have helped to make this a more \nacceptable bill.\n  I'm particularly proud of my role in fighting for child abuse \nprograms, for child care health and safety standards and for the health \ncare safety net. I offered amendments on these issues and fought for \ntheir adoption.\n  From day one, I insisted that we could not do anything in this bill \nto lessen our commitment to fighting child abuse. I am pleased that \nthis bill no longer includes provisions which would have replaced \nFederal child abuse and protection programs with an inadequate block \ngrant. As a former child protection worker, I know how vital \nthese programs are for taking care of children who have suffered from \nabuse or neglect.\n\n  I fought to keep current Federal child care health and safety \nstandards. Along with Senator Dodd, I offered an amendment to restore \nthose standards which the other party was prepared to abandon. I fought \nto maintain those standards because I believe strongly that parents \nshould have every assurance that when they place their children in \nchild care, they will be protected from infectious diseases, from \nunsafe buildings and playground hazards, and that the child care worker \nwill know basic first aid. This is a significant improvement in the \nbill.\n  I also fought for a health care safety net for children. I wanted to \nmake sure that children would still be eligible for Medicaid coverage \neven if their parents failed to meet the work requirements of this \nbill. This bill contains the provision I fought for to ensure that \nchildren will still have access to health care.\n  I was an energetic and enthusiastic advocate for other improvements \nto the bill, such as the provisions to provide funding for child care, \nto exempt mothers with infant children from the work requirements, and \nthe provision that ensures that a mom with a preschooler cannot be \npenalized for not working if she can't find or afford child care. These \nare all important measures to protect children, and I am pleased that \nwe were successful in having them included in this bill. The \nprotections for children are significantly better than in previous \nbills we have considered.\n  So I acknowledge that this bill has been improved in important ways \nfrom the conference report that I opposed and which the President \nvetoed last year. And I believe the strong support for the Democratic \nalternative bill is what made these improvements possible.\n  While I will vote ``yes'' today, there are yellow flashing lights \nthat give me pause. They must be monitored meticulously. And all of us \nwho vote for this bill must be prepared to make modifications if the \nsafety net for children and the working poor becomes tattered.\n  A key yellow flashing light for me is the bill's changes in the rules \nfor the food stamp program. Changes in the excess shelter deduction \ncould harm the working poor--those families that pay over half their \nincome for housing. Other changes will severely limit food stamps for \nadults without children who lose their jobs. Another yellow flashing \nlight for me is the bill's restrictions on assistance for children of \nlegal immigrants, who have not yet obtained their goals of citizenship. \nAnother yellow flashing light for me is the bill's provisions for \nmeeting the needs of children whose parents reach the 5-year time limit \nfor benefits and still do not have work. I fought for a requirement \nthat States must assess and meet the basic subsistence needs of those \nchildren through vouchers or other non-cash assistance. The conference \nagreement did not include what I advocated, but it gives States the \noption to use their title XX, social service block grant funds, to \nprovide vouchers to meet the needs of children.\n  Mr. President, today we must face facts. We cannot make the perfect \nthe enemy of the good. And so I will vote for this bill. The American \npeople and I want welfare reform. And I believe the people currently \nmired in poverty, who have not been well-served by the current welfare \nsystem, deserve better. There are over 9 million children currently on \nwelfare. Under the current system, that number is estimated to grow to \n12 million in 10 years. We owe it to those children to give their \nparents every incentive to leave welfare behind and to lift themselves \nand their families out of poverty.\n  I will vote yes today. But I will be standing sentry and will be in \nthe forefront in fighting for any changes needed to prevent the safety \nnet for children from being tattered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, future historians are likely to regard this \nas a momentous occasion in Congress--a welfare bill is finally about to \nbe approved by Congress and signed by the President--a bill which will \neffectively drive a nail in the coffin of the Great Society.\n  This welfare reform bill proposes to set welfare policy on the right \ncourse.\n  It requires welfare recipients to work;\n  It promotes family and the work ethic; and\n  It exercises sound fiscal responsibility.\n  In addition, this legislation will insist that illegal aliens must \nnot receive welfare and that non-citizens cannot hereafter lawfully \nreceive most Federal welfare benefits during their first 5 years in the \nUnited States.\n  These legislative goals are tough, but fair. Requiring welfare \nrecipients to work provides the hammer that can break the cycle of \npoverty and dependency. As matters now stand, the average welfare \nrecipient stays at the public trough for 13 years. This bill reverses \nthat folly; it proclaims for all to hear that welfare must not be a way \nof life.\n  Equally important, Mr. President, this legislation is fair to \ntaxpayers because it saves $55 billion of taxpayers' money. The average \nAmerican worker in 1993 paid $3,357 in taxes just to support welfare \nrecipients. Taxpayers are sick and tired of working hard, paying taxes \nand watching folks on welfare get a free ride.\n  Mr. President, the taxpayers can be thankful that this bill contains \ntough work requirements for food stamp recipients. On several \noccasions, including during the conference, I took the position that \nCongress should require able-bodied food stamp recipients go to work \nbefore they receive free food stamps.\n  The original Senate welfare bill allowed recipients to receive free \nfood stamps for 6 months every year with no work requirement. Now, \nCongress is sending a bill to the President that will require food \nstamp recipients to work 20 hours per week for an average of 11 months \nper year or be thrown off the welfare rolls. This is a giant step \nforward from current law which gives folks a free lunch at taxpayer's \nexpense.\n  Mr. President, when the liberal politicians pushed through their \nwelfare system more than 30 years ago, the American people were assured \nthat welfare would not become a way of life.\n\n[[Page S9390]]\n\n  And when Lyndon Johnson signed the war on poverty legislation in \n1964, he promised, ``The days of the dole in our county are numbered.'' \nUnfortunately, 30 years after this war began, the days have numbered to \nabout 11,680--and we're still counting.\n  Since Congress obediently embarked down the road called the Great \nSociety, the result has been the most massive Federal spending in \nhistory, increased poverty and untold millions of Americans trapped in \nthe welfare cycle. The Great Society has been a monumental failure, but \nit got a lot of promising politicians elected because they promised \neverything to everybody. But with the enactment of the bill, the days \nof the Great Society are coming to a close.\n\n  The cost of welfare programs has now reached a budget-busting $345 \nbillion a year. During the past three decades, welfare spending has \ncost the American taxpayers $5.4 trillion. It may come as a surprise \nthat welfare programs have cost 70 percent more than the war against \nGermany and Japan in World War II.\n  What, Mr. President, do we have to show for these exorbitant \nexpenditures? An increase in the poverty rate. As of 1993, 15.1 percent \nof Americans were in poverty, compared to 13 percent in 1964, a 2-\npercent growth.\n  Mr. President, the human devastation caused by rising illegitimacy \nrates and the breakdown of the family is even more troubling than the \ncost of welfare programs. Government programs of any magnitude carry \nwith them a cargo of unintended consequences. In welfare, like most \nother things, you reap what you sow. For 30 years, the welfare system \nrewarded idleness and illegitimacy and there has been a marked increase \nin both.\n  Mr. President, I emphasize that nobody is opposed to helping those \nwho are less fortunate. Americans, as individuals and communities, have \na responsibility to help those who cannot help themselves. That \nresponsibility cannot and should not be abdicated. But we must help \nthem by teaching them to ``help themselves'' as President Kennedy once \nstated.\n  This legislation will help those on welfare because it restores the \nAmerican work ethic which once was one of the cornerstones of this \nNation. In addition, this bill takes a step in the right direction in \nhelping reduce the rising illegitimacy rates by providing funds for \nabstinence education, and by allowing States the option of denying \nbenefits to welfare recipients who already have children living on the \npublic dole.\n  An Associated Press poll showed recently that 69 percent of Americans \nfavor a 5-year limit on welfare payments. Likewise, most Americans \nobviously don't think it's right that working people are required to \ngive up a substantial percentage of taxes to support people who refuse \nto work.\n  Mr. President, the majority of Americans are calling for welfare \nreform. Welfare entitlements must be replaced by limited handouts \nconditional on self-improvement and work.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to support the welfare reform \nlegislation pending before this body. I do so with both reluctance and \nhope.\n  My reluctance stems from some very real concerns I have with this \nbill. First, I am concerned that we fail to give States the resources \nthey need to do the job right. I am willing to pay more in the short \nterm to bring about economic independence in the long term. Second, \nlike the President, I am extremely uncomfortable with both the level of \ncuts to the Food Stamp Program and the severity of the restrictions on \nlegal immigrants. We cannot simply abandon our obligation to protect \nthe most vulnerable among us. And, finally, I am troubled by specific \nprovisions of this bill--like the one dealing with mothers with young \nchildren who do not work because they cannot find child care. The \nconference lowered the age from 11 to 6--and this is wrong, Mr. \nPresident. If we want mothers to move from welfare to work, we have to \nensure they have child care for their young children.\n  I will vote for this bill believing strongly that it is not our final \nword on welfare reform. And I'm prepared to work with the \nadministration and with my colleagues here in the Congress to address \nthe concerns that I have--and that I know others have--with this \nlegislation.\n  But, Mr. President, like the President of the United States, I also \nbelieve strongly that the opportunity before us is one we cannot let \nslip away. We simply cannot allow another generation of American \nchildren to fall victim to a welfare system that fosters dependency \nrather than opportunity, that has become for far too many children, not \na second chance, but a way of life.\n\n  I will vote for this bill, Mr. President, because I believe it \ncontains the incentives needed to bring people out of poverty and into \nthe economic mainstream. It contains tough work requirements, time \nlimits on benefits and nearly $4 billion in new money for child care. \nIt protects health care for current populations and allows States to \nuse Federal money to provide non-cash vouchers for children whose \nparents meet the time limits.\n  It emphasizes work and responsibility. It includes a strong community \nservice component, which teaches both the value and the obligations of \ncitizenship.\n  But I know, Mr. President, that all the positive incentives in the \nworld mean nothing if there are no jobs at the end of the line--and \nthat the best social policy of all is economic growth.\n  That is why I believe that the first edition of welfare reform was \napproved by this Congress in l993 with the passage of the President's \ndeficit reduction plan. We can approve legislation today that aims at \nmoving people from welfare to work because we do so amidst a strong, \nvital economy. In less than 4 years, our economy has created over l0 \nmillion new jobs--most of them in the private sector--and we have the \nlowest unemployment rate in 6 years.\n  As we bring down our deficit, we enhance our ability to invest in our \npeople. And as we strengthen our economy, we provide new avenues of \nopportunity for poor Americans to enter the economic mainstream.\n\n  We cannot just give incentives to move people from welfare to work, \nMr. President. We have to also better invest in programs that give them \nthe tools to succeed--programs like education and job training.\n  Mr. President, I have outlined my reservations about this bill, and I \nam committed to working in the coming months to remedy these concerns. \nBut my hope for this bill transcends the ability of individual mothers \nto exchange a welfare check every month for a pay check.\n  For every time a welfare recipient earns a living wage, at least one \nmore child in America sees their role model go to work in the morning, \nearn a salary, pay their bills, believe a little more in their own \nability and self-worth, and live in a world that is infinitely stronger \nbecause they contribute to it.\n  And every time a welfare recipient earns a living wage, at least one \nmore child in America escapes from what could become a cycle of \ndependency and hopelessness that is inherently unAmerican--and which we \nhave an opportunity and an obligation to break.\n  Although only history will tell for sure, I will vote for this bill \nbecause I believe it is the first step in breaking the cycle of poverty \nwhich has sapped the optimism and the opportunity of too many \ngenerations of innocent American children.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as we end the debate on the welfare reform \nconference report, I would like to make several acknowledgements of \neffort in bringing forward this truly historic legislation.\n  First, I want to congratulate Chairman Domenici and Chairman Roth and \nthank them for their leadership. As chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, I am pleased to have been a partner with them in crafting \nthis bill.\n  I also want to thank my staff on the Agriculture Committee for their \nefforts throughout this 104th Congress to make welfare reform a \nreality. Staff director Chuck Conner, as always, contributed strong \nleadership. Dave Johnson and Beth Johnson worked tirelessly to develop \nproposals that both meet our budget goals and continue to deliver \nassistance to the needy.\n  They were assisted ably over the past year by Bill Sims, who has \nreturned to the U.S. Secret Service. Special thanks are also due to Joe \nRichardson of the Congressional Research Service, whose knowledge of \nthe very complicated nutrition assistance programs was invaluable.\n\n[[Page S9391]]\n\n  The legislative process that culminates here in the Senate today \nsometimes seemed like a rollercoaster ride with no end. Frustration and \nlong hours were common for my staff. But they have my sincere thanks \nfor their efforts. They should be very proud of this landmark bill.\n  In the final analysis, this welfare reform legislation represents the \nbest of our democratic process. After much debate, a proposal of \npotentially monumental importance is about to be approved \noverwhelmingly by a Republican-led Congress, and a Democrat President \nwill sign it. I hope we will someday be able to look back at this bill \nas a major step toward restoring the public's confidence in the ability \nof its elected leaders to respond to our Nation's pressing needs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the bill before us represents a historic \nopportunity to change and improve the welfare system in this country. \nToday's Washington Post headline proclaims that this bill represents a \n``basic shift in philosophy'' about welfare in this country.\n  It is true that this bill sends a strong message. That message is: \nwelfare should not be a way of life. We are saying that welfare should \nbe a safety net--a first step toward achieving independence and self-\nreliance.\n  But this is not a major change from the way most Americans view the \nwelfare system. We are a compassionate nation, and we accept our \nresponsibility to help those who are less fortunate, who are on the \nbottom rung of the economic ladder, and those--especially children and \nthe elderly--who are unable to help themselves. This basic notion is \nembedded in our social policy, and this bill does not--can not--change \nthat fundamental view. Our task in drafting this bill has been to \nensure that the safety net will always be there for those families \nneeding assistance to get over a temporary setback.\n  I will vote for the welfare reform bill today because I think we need \nto make some changes in our welfare system. I believe that this bill \nrepresents a significant improvement over last year's conference \nreport, which I opposed because it did not provide an adequate safety \nnet for poor children. Specifically, this bill does not include the \ndeep levels of cuts in child nutrition programs or an optional block \ngrant for food stamps. It permits States to use Federal money to \nprovide noncash assistance, or vouchers for children. And it preserves \na national guarantee for access to health care for pregnant women and \nchildren.\n  This bill also takes the right first steps toward encouraging and \nrewarding work. It requires welfare recipients to work after receiving \nbenefits for 2 years, and backs up that requirement with the support \nfamilies need to move from welfare into the workplace.\n\n  The bill provides $4 billion more for child care and maintains strong \nhealth and safety standards for day care. It gives recipients \nflexibility to use some of their time on assistance to get the \neducation they need to find and keep a job. The bill also gives States \nmore flexibility to use Federal dollars to create new jobs for welfare \nrecipients, and preserves the earned income tax credit for working \nfamilies. All of these provisions work together to give welfare parents \nthe support they need so they can afford to leave welfare and enter the \nworkplace. When combined with the minimum wage increase that I hope the \nSenate will approve in the next few days, it is a significant move in \nthe right direction for America's working families.\n  While I have reservations about the block grant approach presented in \nthis legislation, the bill does take steps to ensure that States will \nfollow through on their obligation to spend Federal welfare dollars to \nmove people up and out of poverty. Most importantly, we require States \nto maintain a significant portion of their own contributions for \nwelfare programs. While the maintenance-of-effort provisions are not as \nstrong as I would have liked them to be, they are a major improvement \nover last year's bill.\n  One of the most important parts of this bill is its tough child \nsupport provisions. Nationwide, only 18 percent of child support cases \nreferred to State agencies for collection result in payments by the \nabsent parent. Yesterday, the President pointed out that, if every \nparent paid the child support they should, we could move 800,000 women \nand children off welfare immediately. This bill takes the necessary \nsteps to move us toward demanding responsibility from both parents, and \nI wholeheartedly support this effort.\n  Having said why I am voting for the bill, let me now explain that I \nremain concerned about some of its provisions. One specific area that \nwe will have to adjust with follow-up legislation is the bill's change \nto the rules for determining eligibility for food stamps. The bill \nrepeals a provision that would have helped families who are forced to \npay a higher-than-average percentage of their income for shelter and \nheating costs. In my state of North Dakota, heating costs take a big \nbite out of every family's income. For a poor family, this can mean \nchoosing between heat and food. The excess shelter deduction that was \nscheduled to go into effect next year would have gone a long way toward \neliminating the need for that painful decision, and I intend to work to \nsee that provision restored in separate legislation.\n  We must also address a punitive measure that denies food stamps to \nAmericans who are looking for but have not been able to find work. The \nconference bill places a 3-month limit on the receipt of food stamps by \njobless adults between the ages of 18 to 50. I am certain that each of \nus knows someone--a brother, an uncle, a cousin--who is out of work, \nhas been looking for work every day, but has not been able to find a \njob because no work is available. In rural North Dakota, unfortunately, \nwe are not creating a lot of jobs, and finding work may take more than \n3 months. It is simply mean-spirited to deny an unemployed person food \nassistance while they are looking for work, and I will work to fix \nthat.\n  Despite these concerns, this bill is, on balance, a responsible bill. \nIt moves toward achieving the right balance of personal responsibility \nand giving people the tools they need to move up and out of poverty. I \nwill support this bill today, and I will work to fix those areas that \nneed improvement.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am pleased that we are here for this final step in \nthe process of ending welfare as we know it. Just yesterday, President \nClinton made clear that he will sign this conference report. After \nweeks of obfuscation, President Clinton finally has made clear that he \nwill act on his promise to end welfare as we have known it and sign \nthis dramatic change in the welfare system. After all we have been \nthrough in the last 18 months, I have to admit that I was beginning to \nfeel like a broken record. We passed 2 different welfare bills under \nthe able leadership of former Senate majority leader Bob Dole. In both \ncases, the President vetoed those efforts.\n  From the President's most recent remarks, apparently out hard work \nhas paid off and he is finally going to approve our efforts. \nInterestingly, Doug Besharov, a resident scholar at the American \nEnterprise Institute, and known expert on the welfare program, says \nthat the new bill is not significantly different from the 2 previous \nproposals. A Washington Times article of yesterday quoted Mr. Besharov \nas saying, ``This business about `how much' improved is a certain \namount of political rhetoric.''\n  In my judgment, Mr. Besharov is being kind in his remarks. This bill, \nin fact, is significantly the same as previous efforts.\n  In the last 30 years we have spent more than $5 trillion to fight the \nwar on poverty. Unfortunately, we have lost. The child poverty rate in \nour nation is .8 percent higher than it is was when we started this \nprocess 30 years ago. So what have the families on welfare gotten for \ntheir difficulties? And what have the taxpayers gotten for their money? \nFor all we have invested, we have made no progress.\n  Clearly, something is not working.\n  The reconciliation bill before us takes a new approach to an old \nproblem. it restores power and authority to the States to create their \nown systems to meet the needs of low-income citizens.\n  Iowa is a perfect example of success. Iowa overwhelming passed \nlegislation in April 1993 to change welfare in the State. In order to \nimplement their plan, the State had to seek 18 initial Federal waivers \nand more since. Although the State wanted to implement\n\n[[Page S9392]]\n\na statewide program, in order to obtain their initial waiver, they were \nrequired to have a control group of 5 to 10 percent who would remain \nunder old AFDC policies.\n  In October of 1993, the work incentives and family stability policy \nchanges were implemented. At that time, there were over 36,000 families \nreceiving assistance, with an average monthly benefit of over $373.\n  Last week I received the latest State figures. Iowa's caseload is \ndown 12.6 percent to under 32,000 families. The average monthly benefit \nis down 11.7 percent to $330.\n  In January 1994, Iowa implemented its personal responsibility \ncontracts. A family commits to pursue independence and the State \ncommits to provide supports. Before the State implemented reform, only \n18 percent of Iowa welfare families had earned income. The most recent \nnumbers show that over 33 percent of all welfare families are earning \nincome now.\n  With Iowa's success as a backdrop, it is easy to understand why \nStates want welfare reform, not waiver reform.\n  Another reason is the frustration States feel when seeking a waiver. \nThough President Clinton has expressed glowing support for the \nWisconsin welfare waiver it has not been signed. If the President is \nfor the Wisconsin waiver, why can't he approve it? Even yesterday \nduring his CNN interview, the President challenged other States to \nfollow Wisconsin's lead in reforming their welfare system. Once again \nwe see him saying one thing and doing another.\n  The reconciliation bill before us also provides for a lifetime limit \nof 5 years for welfare benefits. This means that there is an actual \nmeasurable end so that parents are held accountable for their choices.\n  When working Americans do not show up for work, they are not paid and \nare likely to lose their job. They want welfare recipients to live with \nthe same reality. Taxpaying Americans do not understand why their hard \nwork is subsidizing those who are not working.\n  Mr. President, again, I want to say that I am pleased that the \nPresident has finally agreed to sign this conference report. I think \nthis is an historic effort on the part of Congress and it is \nappropriate for him to sign this legislation.\n  I look forward with anticipation to what our outstanding Governors \nand State leaders will do with the freedom and responsibility we are \nentrusting to them.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote for the welfare reform \nconference report. I do so with grave reservations about many specific \nprovisions.\n  Like President Clinton, I think the cuts in nutrition programs are \ntoo deep and they can and should be corrected.\n  Like President Clinton, I am concerned about the treatment of legal \nimmigrants--people who followed the rules and came here under our legal \nimmigration laws. Many have contributed in numerous ways to their \ncommunities. They are taxpayers and workers who, like all of us, may \nbecome ill or unemployed. This bill slams the door on them to a variety \nof programs in a manner that is neither appropriate nor necessary.\n  There are other provisions of the final bill that I feel are too \nharsh and should be changed.\n  But the overall effort at reforming the current welfare system is one \nthat I support.\n  When I campaigned for the U.S. Senate in 1992, I said then, and I \ncontinue to strongly believe, that if people can work, they should \nwork. The focus of this bill is to encourage people to work, rather \nthan remain on welfare. I support that goal.\n  I also believe that the States should have more flexibility to design \nprograms to meet the needs of their residents. I do not believe that \ndetailed prescriptions from Washington, DC are the answer to the \nproblems afflicting the current welfare system.\n  Nationwide, the current welfare system is a disaster.\n  It keeps families trapped in poverty. It discourages self-\nsufficiency. It creates unnecessary barriers to those trying to move \nfrom welfare to the work force. It forces recipients and local \nofficials to wade through piles of bureaucratic red-tape. It fosters \ndependency, discourages initiative, and dampens the spirits of those in \nneed.\n  We must do better. We must change the status quo. We must provide a \nnew, flexible approach that will help people work and get off welfare.\n  This bill has improved dramatically from the original Republican \nproposal of last year. Many of the draconian provisions have been \ndropped.\n  The Medicaid safety net has been restored for vulnerable children, \nthe aged and disabled. Child care funds have been significantly \nincreased and efforts to roll back Federal health and safety standards \nfor child care were defeated. Attempts to dismantle the food stamp \nprogram and child protection programs failed. The effort to impose a \nfamily cap--a penalty for having a child when on welfare--was rejected \nby a bipartisan majority in the Senate. Maintenance of effort \nprovisions were retained, helping to assure that Federal dollars do not \nsimply replace State dollars.\n\n  There are other provisions of the bill that I am disappointed about. \nI am disappointed that the conference agreement did not include an \nimportant improvement made during the Senate debate which expanded the \neducational activities that welfare recipients could take part in. In \naddition, the bill is too punitive on mothers who cannot work because \nof lack of affordable child care. There are vast areas that should have \nbeen improved.\n  I believe that those of us who vote for this measure have an \nobligation to watch closely as it is being implemented to make sure \nthat it works, works fairly, and that if changes are needed, they are \nenacted. I am deeply concerned about the opposition of many individuals \nwhose opinions I respect. I share their concerns that in an effort to \nget able-bodied adults to enter the workforce, we do not inadvertently \npunish innocent children.\n  But we are faced with the choice of supporting this bill or \nmaintaining the current system. I vote to change the system.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the welfare \nreform bill. I applaud the bipartisan effort that has taken place to \nend welfare as we know it, but most importantly I applaud the efforts \nof the former majority leader, Senator Dole for his efforts in helping \nto shed some light on the problem of America's children living in \npoverty.\n  Mr. President, the most vital investment that we can make in \nAmerica's future is our children. If there has been any one single \npledge that I have made to the people of Tennessee, it was that I would \nspend my time in Washington working tirelessly to protect the American \nfamily but most importantly our Nation's children.\n  In the real world, beyond the Washington Beltway, everyone knows that \nthe real investment and sacrifice on behalf of children is not made by \ngovernment do-gooders, educrats, Members of Congress, or social \nworkers. The real investment and sacrifice is made by parents.\n  Mr. President, few in Washington understand this fact more than I do. \nAs the father of three young boys, it is my belief that we should not \nbe asking the question ``what should the Government do for our \nchildren?'' Instead our question should be ``what must we do to get \nparents to do more?'' I strongly believe that our children do not need \nmore Government spending but a mother and a father who care about them.\n  My Republican colleagues and I pledged to return to families \nsomething more than a program or a slogan. We have tried to return \nresources to families, rather than the Federal Government, to help them \nin raising their children. Our devotion to our Nation's children is \ndemonstrated in our agenda of strengthened families, safer streets, and \nstronger communities. Our agenda has included:\n  A balanced budget that saves tomorrow's generations from crushing \ndebt levels--because of Washington spending, each child born this year \nalready owes more than $187,000 just to pay their share of interest on \nthe debt.\n  A $500-per-child tax credit to ease the pressures on families and \nallow parents to spend more time with their kids.\n  Adoption reforms, including an adoption tax credit, to make adoptions \nmore frequent, less expensive, more secure, and designed to make it \neasier to place children in loving homes.\n  Tough crime legislation to protect our children from violent criminal \npredators.\n\n[[Page S9393]]\n\n  Welfare reform that lifts families out of poverty and into work, \nprovides for child care, introduces the toughest child support \nenforcement standards ever considered by Congress, and real reform that \nreverses the destructive effects of the $5 trillion War on Poverty that \nhas failed so many of our children.\n  Education reforms which empower parents, teachers, school boards and \nthe local communities instead of the Washington bureaucracy. This \nincludes solid reforms which would enable low-income parents to send \ntheir children to quality public, private, and religious schools.\n  Unfortunately, our efforts to enact much of these pro-family items \nhas been stymied by the President's veto or through filibusters here in \nCongress. The President vetoed the $500-per-child tax credit, thus \nrefusing to ease the financial burden that so many families feel today, \na financial burden that often results in parents spending less and less \ntime with their kids. The President has vetoed a balanced budget, a \nbudget which would have given the children of Tennessee freedom from \nthe repercussions of Washington's destructive spending habits.\n  Right now, because of the traditional Washington habit of spending \nnow and passing on the bills to future generations, your children and \nmy children will face a lifetime tax burden of more than 80 percent. \nImagine that--more than three-quarters of their income will be taken \naway to pay for the debts we have left behind. That to me is truly \nimmoral. That is why I worked tirelessly last year to pass a balanced \nbudget, the first balanced budget in almost 30 years. A balanced budget \nwould have put a stop to reckless Washington spending and would have \nallowed us to pay our bills--not pass them on to our grandchildren. The \nbottom line is: a balanced budget helps to secure a better future for \nour children--and the President vetoed it.\n   Mr. President, my Republican Colleagues and I understand that many \nchildren are trapped in poverty or failing schools, with little hope of \nachieving a better life than their parents. During the past year and a \nhalf, we have made it our priority to lift the lives and hopes of these \nchildren. In addition to lifting the crushing debt burden, we must \nrecognize this immediate, abusive, and destructive threat to the lives \nof America's children: the liberal welfare state.\n  Nothing punishes single parents and children more than the current \nwelfare system. Our Federal Government is fixated with a system that \nis riddled with perverse incentives which discourage work and marriage \nwhile encouraging illegitimacy and long-term dependency. Designed as a \nsystem to help children, our current welfare system has ended up \ndamaging and abusing the very children it has intended to save.\n\n  Consider the facts:\n  Between 1965 and 1994, welfare spending cost taxpayers $5.4 trillion \nin constant 1993 dollars.\n  There are 77 overlapping welfare programs to assist Americans \nofficially designated as poor.\n  Total welfare spending in the United States, in 1993 exceeded $324 \nbillion. Of this spending, 72 percent is Federal and 28 percent is \nState. About 90 percent of all State welfare spending is on federally \ndesigned welfare programs.\n  The cost of the war on poverty has been some 70 percent greater than \nthe price tag for defeating Germany and Japan in World War II, after \nadjusting for inflation.\n  Welfare spending is so large it is difficult to comprehend. One way \nto make it more tangible is to recognize that, on average, the cost of \nthe welfare system amounted to $3,357 in taxes from each household that \npaid Federal income tax in 1993.\n  A final way to assess the growth in welfare spending is to compare it \nto the increase in spending on other government functions:\n  Since President Johnson launched the War on Poverty in 1965, means-\ntested welfare spending by Federal, State, and local governments has \ngrown more rapidly than spending on all other major government \nfunctions.\n  In 1965, the United States spent 17 cents on welfare for each dollar \nspent on national defense. By 1993, this had risen to $1.11 on welfare \nfor each dollar spent on defense.\n  In 1965, the United States spent 29 cents on welfare for every dollar \nspent on primary, secondary, and post-secondary education by all levels \nof government. By 1993, the United States spent 91 cents on welfare for \nevery dollar spent on education.\n  Even if the analysis is restricted to welfare spending on cash, food, \nhousing, and energy programs, the trends are virtually identical. Since \nthe beginning of the War on Poverty, means-tested cash, food, housing, \nand energy programs have grown more rapidly than defense, education, or \nSocial Security.\n  After $5.4 trillion has been spent on welfare there remains little to \ncheer about. The onset of the War on Poverty coincided with the \ndisintegration of the low-income family and the rapid increase \nin illegitimacy. Overall, 30 percent of American children are born to \nsingle mothers. We have spent more money on welfare programs since 1965 \nthan on all the wars we have fought this century, yet people are poorer \nand more dependent than ever.\n\n  These are just a few of the ways that Federal Government's welfare \npolicies and social programs are actually working against the American \nfamily and our children. I believe that we have a responsibility to \nprovide a safety net--helping those who, by no fault of their own, have \nfallen on hard times. It is the right thing to do. But when we help \npeople who are able, and yet make no effort to help themselves, we \ndestroy the individual and undermine the very principles of personal \nresponsibility in which our society was founded on. And this is what \nhas happened.\n  It is clear that our Great Society national urban policy has not \nhelped people. It has destroyed them. It has not kept families \ntogether. It has torn them apart. It has not turned the urban areas of \nAmerica into shining cities on a hill, it has made them war zones where \nresidents live in fear. Our inner cities should be a symbol of what is \nright about America. Unfortunately, they have become examples--dying \nexamples--of everything gone wrong with government policy.\n  Mr. President, this bill changes that harmful government policy.\n  I firmly believe that most of America's children are being raised in \nloving, caring families that struggle every day to ensure that their \nchildren have a chance at achieving the American Dream. But I also know \nthat many of these same families are filled with guilt, at not spending \nenough time with their kids because both parents must work to make ends \nmeet. While Washington cannot alleviate these parents' guilt--the 104th \nCongress has acted to ease the tremendous pressures and burdens on \nstruggling families.\n  Too many single moms are near poverty because their child support \nchecks are nowhere to be found. Just since President Clinton was \nelected, 175,000 women, mostly single moms, have slipped into poverty. \nThrough the efforts by my colleagues in the House and the Senate, this \nwelfare reform bill holds fathers accountable for their child support, \nputting in place the toughest ``deadbeat dads'' provisions anywhere in \nthe country. We increased child care funds by $4 billion over current \nlaw in order to help single parents make the successful transition from \nwelfare to work. Our children are suffering from the current welfare \nstate. We must reverse this trend, to make welfare a helping hand, not \na way of life.\n\n  Changing the welfare system will help children. Encouraging families \nto stay together will help children. Putting welfare recipients back to \nwork will help children. Restoring the work ethic will help children. \nImproving the quality of local education will help children. \nEncouraging spirituality will help children.\n  Spending more on the current broken Washington welfare system will \nnot help children. It's time we take away the blindfold and accept \nreality. We have to rebuild parents, families, and communities, but you \ncan not do it from inside the beltway. It has to be done at home, in \nschool and at church.\n  Mr. President, the most important thing that we as a nation can do \nfor our children, does not come from the Congress or even the White \nHouse. Rather, it must come from within all of us--a commitment to read \nto your son or daughter, a commitment to attend church with your child \nand family, coaching your son or daughter's little league team, and \nbecoming involved in the education of your son or daughter. Mr. \nPresident, our children are the future of this great country.\n\n[[Page S9394]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this historic bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, when the welfare reform bill was before us \nlast week, I said that I could not let my desire to vote for reform \ncloud my judgment about the bill, and about the serious flaws which I \nperceived in it. The bill has been returned to us from conference with \nsome of those flaws remedied, but alas not all, and the omissions to my \nmind are determinative. And so once again, I shall vote against the \nbill.\n  I am especially concerned about the bill's undeservedly harsh \ntreatment of legal immigrants. I note with dismay that nearly half of \nthe $56 billion that would be saved by this bill comes from the denial \nof benefits to people in this category. More often then not, legal \nimmigrants are hard-working, tax paying individuals who deeply \nappreciate the freedom and opportunity of U.S. citizenship, which they \nhope to attain. To deny them so many of the benefits that they might \nlegitimately need as they build a life here, seems unfair and \nunjustified. While I applaud President Clinton's assurance that this \ngrievous flaw in the bill will be corrected by future legislation, the \nprovision amounts to justice denied, here and now, and I cannot bring \nmyself to vote for it.\n  I remain concerned, moreover, about the practical consequences of \nceasing to treat welfare as an entitlement and replacing it with block \ngrants. But what this means is that this Nation will cease to respond \nto anyone in great need, as a matter of right, and that some people in \nneed may be cut off simply because we have shifted this serious \nnational problem to the States, and we have done so without providing \nthem with adequate support to address the problem. I am particularly \nconcerned that some States, including my own State of Rhode Island \nwhich has just enacted a new welfare program, may be penalized if they \nchoose to have a welfare program which is relatively more liberal than \nthe Federal law.\n  Also troubling is the retention of cuts in food stamp spending, \nprojected at roughly $24 billion over 6 years. Unemployed workers \nwithout children will be hard hit, as will legal immigrants.\n  Finally, I continue to be deeply concerned about the plight of \nchildren. I simply cannot believe that eliminating an entitlement which \nensures that all poor children get the food, clothing, and shelter that \nthey need can move us individually or as a society down the path we all \nwant to go. While some improvements were made in conference, the fact \nremains that children will be the ones most vulnerable to the vagaries \nof variable State welfare programs.\n  Mr. President, it is with real regret, then, that I cast a ``no'' \nvote on this welfare reform legislation. I recognize that the bill \nachieves many important broad objectives which are clearly desired by \nthe public at large--including work requirements, time limits on \nbenefits and job creation incentives. But looking at the final product, \nI cannot say that what we have before us is better than what we now \nhave. The bill is, as the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] reminded \nus ``radical legislation with unforeseeable consequences.'' Better to \nreject it now than try to make up for its deficiencies in the future.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is the understanding of welfare \nconferees regarding the reconciliation bill that that bill exempts \nelectronic benefits transfers from coverage of the Electronic Funds \nTransfer Act. The Department of Agriculture is empowered to establish \nregulations which will provide some protections against recipients' \nloss of benefits through electronic transfer systems. We encourage the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services [HHS] to develop similar \nregulations which will require procedures to minimize the losses of \nbenefits for aid to families with dependent children recipients. It is \nalso the conferees' understanding that nothing in this bill in any way \nprevents or discourages HHS from promulgating these essential \nregulations.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today we take the first big step in ending \nthe era of big government. Today, we send the states the authority to \ndesign their own programs for the needy. We move one step further away \nfrom the one-size-fits-all approach that comes from a Federal \nbureaucracy far removed from individual state environments and \nconstituencies. This bill completely changes the very nature of welfare \nfrom one of endless individual entitlement to one of temporary \nassistance and personal responsibility.\n  This legislation is the result of a truly bipartisan process. I want \nto thank my colleagues for their work in crafting a compromise that can \nbe supported by a majority of both parties.\n  I also want to congratulate the President for joining this effort. \nWhile we all wondered whether, after vetoing welfare reform twice in \nthe last year, he would sign this measure, I am delighted that he has \nannounced his support for this bill. I commend him for this decision. \nThis is a great victory for Congress, for the President, for the \nStates, for the taxpayers, and, above all, for the needy families of \nAmerica.\n  Do we know exactly what will happen after this bill is passed? No. No \none is blessed with that kind of omniscience. The current system \nprovides an excellent illustration of the uncertainty of the future. \nThe current system was well-intentioned at its inception. No one was \ndeliberately trying to create a cycle of dependency or despair for \nbeneficiaries who much too often found themselves locked into the \nsystem. However, the current system has turned out to be just that, \ndestroying the very spirit of those who are receiving benefits. Through \nhindsight, we can see that the approaches taken in the current system \nhave not, do not, and will not work. It has been a near total failure \ndespite its worthy intentions.\n  We have learned from this experience. We have not crafted this \nwelfare reform proposal out of whole cloth. We did not simply dream it \nup. We reviewed the findings of academics; we heard hours and hours of \ntestimony; we poured over statistics; and we listened to our \nconstituents.\n  The result is a welfare system built on a new paradigm--a ``can do'' \nphilosophy that must be infused into recipients and administrators \nalike.\n  In designing a new approach to assisting the needy, we have looked to \nthose programs that are successful in moving people to work and helping \nthem become independent. The States have been moving in this direction \nand have been designing innovative and successful programs for several \nyears. My own State of Utah is in the third year of a successful \ndemonstration project that has just gone statewide. The Single Parent \nEmployment Demonstration [SPED] has 90 percent of the caseload actively \nparticipating in work activities, utilizes the use of education and \ntraining to provide basic job skils, and has been successful in moving \nparticipants into unsubsidized, private sector jobs. This bill will \ncontinue this trend and allow the States to continue to design \ncomprehensive programs to address their unique constituencies, needs, \nand resources.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not perfect. There are several things \nincluded in this bill that I don't agree with. There are many things \nthat aren't in this bill that I think should be there. There are even \nsome things that I think need to be changed. I would particularly like \nto see an expansion of the use of education and training to provide job \nskills for long-term employment, changes made in the language regarding \nexisting State waivers, and a broader compromise on Medicaid \neligibility to provide a level of administrative relief to the States.\n  However, the core reforms contained in this bill far, far outweigh \nthese concerns. This bill contains block grants to States and gives \nthem the opportunity to design their own systems--systems that will \nprovide not only the wherewithal to transition people into jobs, such \nas child care, but also systems that have dignity, hope, and \nindependence as the primary goals.\n  Throughout this debate, we heard from many who were concerned about \nthe effects that these reforms could have on native Americans. I am \npleased that this conference report retains several provisions \naddressing these concerns. The most important of these provisions is \nthe native American tribal allocation provision. I would like to thank \nmy colleagues for working with me to address this issue.\n  The tribal allocation provisions in this bill will provide tribal \ngovernments the same opportunities and responsibilities as the States \nto receive\n\n[[Page S9395]]\n\ndirect funding and the flexibility to design their own programs based \non the unique geographical and cultural needs of tribal members. This \nrepresents a significant shift in thought and Federal policy. Through \nprovisions like these, this legislation reinforces the Federal \nGovernment's commitment for Indian self-determination and self-\ngovernance.\n  Mr. President, we have heard from the American taxpayers in no \nuncertain terms that they are tired of paying for people to do nothing. \nFamilies who are getting up to work every day and are still struggling \nto make ends meet are tired of seeing families receiving assistance \nwith virtually no obligation to work for it. This bill changes all \nthat. Under this legislation, people must work for their benefits. No \nlonger will beneficiaries be able to continue to receive benefits for \nnothing. Families receiving assistance will now be given the resources \nand opportunity to receive job training and education and to move into \nwork and independence. The legislation provides child care and other \nsupport services to these families.\n\n  Mr. President, we have heard much during this debate about the \nchildren and about how this bill is bad for children. This bill is not \nbad for children. If there is a program that has been cruel to \nchildren, it is the current system. How can anyone say that a program \nthat traps our families in a hopeless cycle of dependency is good for \nand helps children? The current system may throw money at the problem \nof poverty, but it does not provide a solution.\n  This bill provides a solution, a way out of the dependency cycle. \nThis bill gives needy children back the things that money can't buy--\nhope, dignity, self esteem, and a way out of long-term dependency. The \nbest way we can help needy children in the long run is to give their \nparents the skills and resources--and, yes, motivation--to enter and be \nsuccessful in the labor market. It can be done. Many have done it. Many \nmore can be successful under the new system of assistance and \nincentives incorporated in this bill.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not the end of the welfare reform debate. \nCongress will continue to review and reform programs for the needy of \nthis country. The reforms contained in this bill will continue to be \nmonitored and evaluated. We can even see some technical corrections \nthat could be made in the near future. I assure my colleagues and the \nAmerican people that the passage of this legislation does not signal \nthe end of congressional interest in the welfare programs. Passing this \nlegislation is only the first, most important step in a long ongoing \nprocess.\n  Not only is this bill only the first step in reforming the welfare \nsystem, it is also the first step in tackling the seemingly \ninsurmountable problem of ever-growing entitlement programs and \nbalancing the Federal budget. This is not a plateau but rather a ledge \non the way to the top of the mountain. Congress must continue to look \nat other entitlement programs for the needy. We must look at the \nMedicaid Program, at Medicare, at programs for the disabled, and yes, \neven Social Security. Without reforming these programs, this country \nwill find itself digging itself deeper and deeper into a black hole \nwith no way to get itself out. But, more importantly, our citizens who \nhave come to rely on these programs will wake up one day to find that \nthese programs have met with fiscal disaster and are no longer viable.\n  Just as important as the fiscal aspect of reforming these programs is \nthe evaluation of the role and values of the Federal Government. We \nmust reform the very nature of Federal programs from one of dependency \nto one of independence and transition. I encourage my colleagues to \ncontinue this fight. We must not stop here at the first victory over \nbig government, but rather continue the process of reviewing the role \nof the Federal Government and of reforming those programs that are \nholding us back on the way to a prosperous and secure 21st century.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I regret that the conferees on the welfare \nreform bill have decided to report out a measure that is short-sighted \nand punitive to children, the disabled, and legal immigrants. I realize \nthat the President has indicated that he will sign this bill into law, \nbut I have concerns, as have already been expressed by the President in \nhis recent statement, with many of its provisions.\n  Preliminary estimates that this measure will push an additional 1.3 \nmillion children nationwide into poverty. Once families have reached \nthe 5-year time limit for receiving assistance in this legislation, \nthey will have no recourse for assistance if a poor economy leave them \nwithout the possibility of finding employment.\n  Legal immigrants, including those who have been in this country for \nsome time already, will be prevented from participating in all Federal \nmeans-tested programs, including the Food Stamp and Medicaid Programs.\n  This measure also cuts $23 billion from the Food Stamp Program over \nthe next 6 years. It also limits benefits for those out of work without \nminor children to 3 months total in a 3-year period.\n  This measure will cause much grief in Hawaii. The State is already at \nits limit in its ability to assist those living in poverty, and the \nchanges in the Federal law will only exacerbate a bid situation\n  I believe that the intent of a welfare reform bill should be to make \nit easier for families to make the transition from welfare to work. \nThis bill does not provide adequate resources for States to provide the \nnecessary support for families to do so. For these reasons, I will vote \nagainst the conference report.\n  However, I wish to commend the conferees for including in the bill \nthat will now go before the President important provisions that would: \nFirst, provide child support enforcement services and funding to Indian \ntribes; second, authorize a State to exempt any Indian tribe from the \n5-year limitation on participation for any Indian residing on an Indian \nreservation where the resident Indian population is 1,000 or more and \nwhere the unemployment rate is 50 percent or higher; and third, \nestablish a 3 percent set-aside for American Indian tribal governments \nin the child care development block grant. Given the President's \nstatement of his intent to sign his measure into law, I am pleased that \nthe conferees have given special attention to the very serious needs of \ntribal communities.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, in 1935 Franklin Roosevelt had the \nforesight to realize that a welfare system that replaces real work with \nhandouts was doomed to fail the very individuals it was intended to \nassist. In FDR's own words,\n\n       The lessons of history * * * show conclusively that \n     continued dependence upon relief induces a spiritual and \n     moral disintegration fundamentally destructive to the \n     national fiber. To dole out relief in this way is to \n     administer a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human \n     spirit.\n\n  I am pleased that America's long, costly drug addiction to the easy, \ninsidious welfare drug may be beginning to end today. Destructive \ngenerational dependency, illegitimacy, fraud, waste, abuse, and neglect \nsoon will be replaced with greater self-sufficiency, responsibility and \npride.\n  The bill before us would change the welfare system and the lives of \nmany Americans for the better. Welfare was meant to be a safety net, \nnot a way of life. This bill would restore the values of personal \nresponsibility and self-sufficiency by making work, not Government \nbenefits, the centerpiece of public welfare policy. I am proud to be a \npart of the team that has brought this historic legislation to the \nSenate and, soon, to the President's desk.\n  Why did the welfare system fail? The value of work was replaced with \na handout, instead of a hand-up. The welfare system eroded the American \nwork ethic. In many cases, welfare recipients today can sit at home and \nmake double the minimum wage. Work, as my colleagues and staff know all \ntoo well, is a character building process. For generations, South \nDakotans demonstrated this principle, that a hard-work ethic provides \nfor themselves and their families. Imagine how they must feel when \ntheir tax dollars are used to support Americans who need not work. I \ncan tell you how they feel--upset. That is why we needed workfare.\n  Workfare may seem innovative here in Washington, but it's not a new \nidea. Fifteen years ago, South Dakotans sought to develop new solutions \nfor\n\n[[Page S9396]]\n\ntheir welfare system. South Dakota wanted workfare, not welfare. With \nthe reforms it has implemented, South Dakota has succeeded in \ndecreasing its welfare caseload by 17 percent and saved taxpayers $5.6 \nmillion. Those reforms, considered radical at that time, will the \nvision of the future for the rest of the country when the bill before \nus become law. Governor Janklow first pursued workfare in the early \n1980's, and former Governor Miller and our late Governor Mickleson \ncontinued with further reforms. I also want to acknowledge and commend \nDeputy Secretary Mike Vogel, Social Services Secretary, Jim \nEllenbecker, Denny Pelkofer, Donna Keller, Judy Heinz, Julie Osnes, and \nthe rest of the staff at the South Dakota Department of Social Services \nfor their efforts to make welfare reform a reality in South Dakota. \nWhen today's bill becomes law, these innovators will have even greater \nfreedom to succeed where the Federal Government has failed.\n\n  I am pleased that the final bill includes workfare amendments I had \nincluded during the Finance Committee's markup of welfare reform. These \namendments ensure that welfare recipients will put in a full workweek, \njust as other Americans do, in order to receive benefits. My amendments \nalso increase the number of welfare recipients who must work and \ntighten liberal loopholes that have allowed people to avoid real work.\n  This historic legislation is a dramatic turn to decentralization of \ngovernment. We are putting greater faith and trust in the states to \noperate their own welfare programs. I am confident South Dakotans will \ndo better than Washington bureaucrats. No longer will the Federal \nGovernment apply a one-size-fits-all welfare system run by bureaucrats. \nIndeed, the Federal agencies responsible for welfare will be \ndrastically reduced. States will have the flexibility to seek solutions \nand alternatives to welfare problems. This bill also would do something \nvery revolutionary for the native American community-- it would give \nthem the opportunity to run their own welfare programs. This is a great \nopportunity for them to seek innovative solutions as well. This bill is \nnot just about changing the welfare culture, but also the big \nGovernment culture. We change both for the better.\n  Workfare is not just about restoring responsibility at the individual \nand State level, it is about protecting children in need. This workfare \nbill would ensure that children have quality food and shelter. This \nbill would increase our investment in child care by $4.5 billion and \nincrease federal child protection and neglect funding by $200 million \nover current law. What this bill eliminates is cumbersome bureaucracy \nand needless regulations.\n  We also strengthen child support enforcement and give States new \ntools to crack down on deadbeat parents. These reforms represent the \ntoughest child support laws ever passed by Congress. The past welfare \nsystem fostered illegitimacy and discouraged marriage and parental \nresponsibility. This welfare reform would promote the basic family \nunit, and crack down on those who deliberately walk away from meeting \nthe needs of their children. More and more children are growing up \nwithout the moral guidance and financial support of parents, especially \nfathers. This is a tragedy of our time.\n\n  I am also pleased the final bill includes provisions I authored to \ncrack down on food stamp fraud and prisoner fraud. Last year, I was \nshocked to learn the extent to which prisoners are able to continue \nreceiving welfare benefits. The workfare bill before us once and for \nall puts an end to cash payments to alcohol and drug addicts in prison. \nIt also would, reward States that crack down on food stamp recipients \nwho abuse the welfare system. Although my home State's food stamp \nprogram is ranked first in the Nation, each year $1.7 billion is lost \nnationally through food stamp fraud, waste, and abuse. My provision \nwould give additional incentive to crack down on those who abuse the \nwelfare system. I want to extend my thanks to the staff at the South \nDakota Office of Recovery and Investigations, specifically Marty \nArmstrong, for their diligent and effective work on this matter.\n  Several years ago, President Clinton promised America he would change \nwelfare as we know it. Our former colleague and majority leader, Bob \nDole, made the same promise. Last year Congress delivered on that \npromise. We passed workfare. Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed \nthat workfare bill. The President vetoed workfare again as part of our \nbalanced budget plan. Thanks to Chairman Roth, Senator Domenici, and so \nmany others we didn't quit. We produced another workfare bill. I am \npleased the President has said he will do the right thing this time and \nsupport this workfare legislation.\n  I want to thank the conferees for their quick action in approving the \nwelfare bill. Again, I am proud to have played a significant role in \nthis effort to enact workfare legislation. The workfare bill before us \nwill end welfare dependency by requiring work and placing a time limit \non benefits. Tomorrow's welfare system would encourage people to become \nmore self-sufficient and productive members of society, as was intended \nmany years ago. Americans deserve more than a handout for today, they \ndeserve the hope and happiness that come through personal financial \nindependence and the self-realization of work. Welfare reform ensures a \nbetter future for all Americans.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as the Senate debates the Conference Report \non H.R. 3734, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, \nSenators are considering one of the most significant pieces of \nlegislation to come before this body in the current Congress. Indeed, \nif this legislation is approved today--and the President signs it as he \nhas indicated--this welfare reform legislation may be the very hallmark \nof the 104th Congress. This being said, Mr. President, it is important \nthat all Senators pay heed to the vast and complex changes that this \nlegislation would effectuate on federal welfare policy. I intend to \nsupport the Conference Report on H.R. 3734 because I believe it \nrepresents a necessary departure from a welfare system that few will \ndeny is fundamentally flawed. My overall support of this legislation \nnotwithstanding, I do harbor certain reservations about the possible \neffects of certain aspects of this welfare reform initiative on our \nneediest citizens. With this in mind, Mr. President, allow me to \nexplain why I believe that this legislation, even with its potential \ndeficiencies, represents a marked improvement over ``welfare as we know \nit.''\n  Mr. President, by combining many of the current federal welfare \nprograms into a single Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Block \nGrant, H.R. 3734 would effectively end the federal entitlement to \nwelfare assistance and give the States expanded control over their \nrespective welfare programs. Under the bill's provisions, each State \nmust establish objective criteria for determining eligibility and \nproviding ``fair and equitable'' treatment for its welfare recipients. \nIn order to receive their full block grant, States would have to \nenforce rigid work requirements for welfare recipients and provide \nadequate child care resources to families with children. Moreover, H.R. \n3734 stipulates that States, in order to receive their full block \ngrant, must continue to spend at least 75 percent of the amount they \nspent on cash assistance programs in fiscal year 1995. And, \nimportantly, H.R. 3734 would limit welfare recipients to five years of \nbenefits and would require most welfare recipients to work at least 30 \nhours per week by the year 2000. In addition, to protect children of \nfamilies whose 5 years of assistance have expired, H.R. 3734 permits \nStates to use funds from their Social Services Block Grant to provide \nvouchers for food for children.\n\n  Finally, the legislation permanently bans illegal immigrants from \nreceiving any Federal benefits, and bans legal immigrants from \nreceiving most assistance for the first five years of their residency \nin this country.\n  Mr. President, having mentioned the various aspects of this welfare \nreform legislation that I believe will improve our system of welfare, I \nmust also allude to a particular provision of the bill that I believe \nmay have unnecessarily negative effects on many of the neediest welfare \nrecipients. Specifically, I am concerned about the food stamp work \nrequirements included in this legislation, which would limit adults \nwithout dependent children to just 3 months of food stamps every 3 \nyears. Unemployed laid-off workers\n\n[[Page S9397]]\n\nwould be given an additional three months, and areas with unemployment \nof ten percent or more would also be given a waiver from the work \nrequirements. Nevertheless, Mr. President, these provisions represent a \nsignificant departure from the Senate-passed welfare bill, and they \nalso embody a complete departure from our national policy of providing \nour needy with the most basic safety net: food. On the surface, it \nmight seem that the two exemptions from the work requirement provide a \nsafety net. Yet, the Congressional Budget Office has reported that \nStates will not be able to create the necessary jobs or workfare slots \nfor individuals that are likely to be subjected to these new work \nrequirements.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate-passed measure, like the measure before us \nnow, would penalize States for not creating the necessary jobs or \nworkfare programs. However, this bill goes further than that by \nincluding provisions that would also punish an individual who simply \ncannot find a job or a workfare slot available. While ostensibly \nintended to target those who could work but choose not to, this \nprovision may in fact have the worst effect on vulnerable individuals \nwho want to work but cannot find a job. Indeed, this issue warrants \ncareful watching. I believe the conferees would have better served this \ncountry by adopting the Senate food stamp work requirements.\n  While this legislation is not perfect, it represents what I believe \nto be a reasonable attempt to restore the concept of welfare to its \noriginal purpose: a temporary ``safety net'' for those who have fallen \non hard times. Welfare should not be a permanent way of life for those \namong us who are able to work. The cost of such misguided policies is \nfar greater than the dollars spent on providing benefits to those who \nchoose not to work because, in time, they foster dependence and \nindolence among recipients and their families. This argument is not \nnew. President Nixon, in addressing the Nation on welfare reform in \n1969 said, ``If we take the route of the permanent handout, the \nAmerican character will itself be impoverished.'' Mr. President, I \nagree fully with President Nixon's statement and that is why I support \nthis conference report.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today, I will be unavoidably absent \nfrom the Senate, as I am in Arkansas on a family matter. However, I \nfeel it is important to express my support for this welfare reform \nmeasure and discuss briefly the reasons for my support.\n  My concerns in the debate over welfare reform stem from proposals \nthat would outright dismantle the safety net in this country. For \ndecades, the Federal Government has assumed the responsibility to help \nthose that can-not help themselves. The welfare reform bill before us \nshifts much of that responsibility to the States. I voted against last \nweek's Senate version of the welfare bill with the hope that I could \nimprove it in the conference committee. In some ways it has improved, \nin others it has not.\n  Even so, if I were able to vote for this bill today, I would. I am \nnot going to say this bill before us today is perfect. It is not. But I \ncannot justify keeping the current system. There are more individuals \nin poverty now than ever before. I believe we have a responsibility to \nseek new ways to help people help themselves. Our current system fails \nat this task and we must recognize this fact.\n  Welfare as we know it has not effectively emphasized work or pulled \nindividuals out of poverty. I do not like all of the provisions in this \nbill, but I can not support the status quo.\n  In the past week I have heard from many people in Arkansas about \nwelfare reform. They know how the current program works in places like \nLittle Rock, and in Camden, in Fayetteville, and across the Arkansas \nDelta. They can see that the current program needs reform.\n  Under this bill, States will be given the flexibility to reform \nwelfare to meet the needs of that State. Yesterday, President Clinton \nsaid that the welfare population today is different than the one 60 \nyears ago. It is also true that the welfare population today differs \nfrom State to State. Individuals on welfare in Arkansas face different \nproblems and have different strengths than those in New York or \nCalifornia. This legislation will give States the opportunity to design \na welfare program unique to that State. It is a big responsibility we \nhand over to the States today. I pray they act wisely.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the \nlegislation upon which we are about to vote. We have been working on \nthis bill for a year and a half and we've been back to the drafting \ntable several times. Today, though, we're going to pass this bill and \nwe have the President's assurance that he'll sign it. I am truly \npleased to have been part of this historic effort, and I want to thank \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their hard work and \ndedication to reforming welfare.\n  Does my support mean that I believe we've got the perfect bill and \nall of our concerns have been addressed? Do I think we've finished the \njob and we can forget about welfare for another thirty years? Certainly \nnot. No one thinks that this is the perfect approach to reforming \nwelfare. Many of us would like to see less in cuts to food stamps; we \nwould prefer more support for children.\n  In particular, we're emphasizing work in a way that we never have \nbefore--and let me stress that I think we are emphasizing that goal, \nand I commend the bill on that point. Even so, we're not doing nearly \nas much as we need to do to ensure that jobs are available for people, \nand that people have the education and training they need to fill the \navailable jobs. We've spent a fair amount of time and energy this \nsession talking about job training. As we all know, reconciliation on \nthis issue has eluded us to date. We must address this issue. The first \nthing people need to get and hold down a job is a good education. Too \noften, I think, we assume that to mean a college education. That is not \nnecessarily true. In the next Congress, I hope we will renew our \ndiscussion of how to link education and job training so that people are \nable to fulfill the expectations of the jobs that are available.\n  Our international competitors have been leaders in making the \nimportant link between education and work. Germany for example, has \nlong been a model for vocational education. As early as the sixth \ngrade, students opt for a college-prep or vocational education program.\n  Over and over we've said people need to get off welfare and get back \nto work. I agree with that. We've said ``you can always get a job at \nMcDonalds.'' There are two flaws with this flippant argument. One is \nthat a person doesn't earn a living wage at a fast-food restaurant--but \nwe've had that debate. The other flaw with the argument is that even \nthe fast food industry jobs are not as available as we'd like to \nbelieve. A 1995 Columbia University study of fast-food minimum wage job \nopenings found that 14 people applied for every opening. Among those \nrejected, 14 percent hadn't found work a year later. What are we going \nto do for these people? What are we going to do about this problem?\n\n  While this bill makes some nods in that direction, I think perhaps \nits biggest failing is it fails to recognize all the work we need to do \nto get people back to work. So far, the necessary resources in \neducation and job training far exceed the available resources. Job \ntraining and education are an investment that will yield us incredible \nreturns. Last year the Department of Education released a study that \nfound that ``a 10 percent increase in the educational attainment of a \ncompany's workforce resulted in an 8.6 percent increase in \nproductivity. Whereas a 10-percent increase in the value of capital \nstock such as tools, buildings, and machinery only resulted in a 3.4 \npercent increase in productivity.'' I won't belabor this point, but \neducation and job training are issues I will continue to work on, and I \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I think all of us realize that it will be our responsibility to \nmonitor the effects of this bill, to improve and enhance those \nprovisions that seem to work well, and to revisit those provisions that \nare unproductive or fall short of what's needed, such as those \nsurrounding job training and education that I have just highlighted.\n  This bill is not perfect. Even so, the system we have now is not \nworking and\n\n[[Page S9398]]\n\nwe need to move forward now. The bill before us takes important steps \nin the right direction, and is clearly preferable to the welfare \nprogram we've arrived at after 30 years under the old system.\n  We enacted this system 30 years ago to combat poverty, and the truth \nis--this system hasn't worked. In 1965, 3.3 million children received \nAFDC benefits. In 1990, 7.7 million kids received AFDC benefits, and in \n1994 9.6 million children received AFDC. At the same time, between 1965 \nand 1990, the actual number of children in the United States declined \nby nearly 5 million. Clearly, the current system isn't working, and \nbecause of that there is strong support in this country and in this \nCongress to reform welfare.\n  Furthermore, the current system has developed into one that permits, \neven encourages, a lifestyle of dependence. Under the system we have \nnow, 65 percent of families on welfare will be dependent for at least \neight years. One in eight children in this country is on welfare, and \nnearly one in five mothers in inner cities is on welfare. Without \nwelfare reform, millions more children will grow up dependent on \nwelfare. Under the current system, children who grow up in families \ndependent on welfare are twice as likely to rely on welfare when they \nbecome adults. It is clear that for many people, welfare has become a \nway of life.\n\n  The bill before us will terminate reliance on Federal assistance as a \nway of life. We end this reliance by terminating cash assistance after \n5 years of receiving benefits. After two years, we require people to \nget jobs. This is real welfare reform. Time limits are unprecedented at \nthe Federal level. Five years of benefits allow adequate time for most \npeople to get their feet under them and get back on the road to \nsupporting themselves. But even after 5 years the line is not a hard \nand fast one. There can be exceptions. The bill allows a 20 percent \nhardship exemption for the really difficult cases. So even though we \nsay ``5 years and you're off,'' even then there's some leeway.\n  Another strength of this reform bill is that it retains the Federal \nsafety net for nutrition benefits. One of the changes I worked hard on \nin the Senate version of the bill was the food stamp block grant. We \neliminated the block grant option last week, and the conference bill \nretains the food stamp entitlement. The entitlement ensures that food \nstamps will always be available to our most vulnerable populations: \nchildren, the very poor, and the elderly. And food stamps will be \navailable even after the eligibility for cash assistance has ended. I \nwant to thank my colleagues for joining me and voting to strike the \noptional block grant.\n  Another difference between this bill and the ones we've considered \npreviously is the money provided for child care. This bill fulfills the \nGovernors' and the President's request for additional child care funds, \nand as a result we'll be spending $4.5 billion above current law on \nchild care. In addition, the bill retains minimal health and safety \nstandards for child care, and it maintains a quality set-aside from \nchild care block grant funds so we might better focus on encouraging \nand developing good child care for our children. Finally, this bill \nrequires that the Secretary report to the Congress on how children are \naffected by welfare policy change; additionally, it requires the states \nto report on their child poverty rates. If the child poverty rate \nincreases by more than 5 percent, then immediate corrective action is \nrequired. I mention all of these factors because they contribute to my \nwillingness to support this bill, and also because they illustrate that \nthe drafters are concerned about children and intend to monitor the \neffect of this bill and follow up to ensure that we are bringing about \nthe positive change we're attempting to achieve.\n\n  In conclusion, let me speak briefly on how this bill will affect \nVermont. I was pleased to learn that the Governor of my home State, \nGov. Howard Dean, has spoken positively of this bill. While he shares \nthe concerns that many of us have, Gov. Dean thinks that Vermont can \ncome out ahead under the provisions of this bill. Vermont is currently \noperating its welfare program under a waiver. Not only does this bill \nallow the State to continue its first-in-the-nation reform project, the \nGovernor recognizes that the calculations used to determine the size of \nthe Federal block grants mean that Vermont will have more money to \nspend on its welfare program.\n  While I am on this subject, I would like to take a moment to voice my \nsupport and praise for those states, like Vermont, that have already \nundertaken welfare reform through waivers and demonstration projects. I \nam pleased that we will allow those waiver projects to continue.\n  But let me urge clarification on what I consider to be a confusing \nand counter-intuitive provision in the bill. Under the provisions of \nthe bill setting forth the guidelines for the temporary assistance for \nneedy families block grants we have a section that gives States the \noption of continuing the waiver projects already underway. In fact, the \nsection goes so far as to require the Secretary to encourage any State \noperating under a waiver to both continue the waiver and to evaluate \nthe result of the waiver so that other States may make use of the \nvaluable information to be gained from these demonstration projects.\n  However, under the hold-harmless provisions of this waiver section, \nwe seem to forgive the accrued liability of States that choose to \nterminate their waiver projects. Our intent, I believe is to forgive \nthe accrued liability of those States, like Vermont, that choose to \ncontinue their waiver projects. To take any other stance except one \nthat also wipes those slates clean would give States incentive to \nterminate their waivers. States like Vermont that are already \nconducting demonstration projects should be encouraged and supported in \ntheir efforts to continue those projects. I understand that there may \nbe an opportunity to revisit that issue soon, and I urge my colleagues \nto ensure that we're creating incentives to continue the waivers that \nare promising, rather than offering incentive to terminate those \nprojects.\n\n  Another aspect of the bill that is very important to Vermont is the \nassurance that, as under current law, LIHEAP benefits will not be \ncounted as income for purposes of determining food stamp eligibility. \nThis provision is very important to poor people in cold regions of the \ncountry who may rely on both LIHEAP benefits and food stamp benefits. \nThere was a provision in both the House and Senate bills that would \nhave forced people to choose between heating and eating, and I thank my \nSenate colleagues for accepting my amendment to strike those \nprovisions. I also want to thank my colleagues who worked on the \nconference committee for working to maintain the Senate bill provisions \non this issue.\n  Mr. President, I agree with my colleagues who say this bill has \nflaws, and I look forward to working with them next year and in future \nyears as we continue to work towards the proper balance between self-\nsufficiency and Gvernment assistance. In spite of its weaknesses, I \nthink this is a good bill. We've worked hard over the past year and a \nhalf to get to this point and I think we've made some very positive \nchanges that will help all Americans to be productive and contributing \ncitizens. I will be pleased to vote ``yes'' on final passage.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, since 1987, when I first proposed an \noverhaul of the welfare system, I have argued that welfare recipients \nshould be required to work. None long years later, I am pleased that it \nis finally about to happen.\n  It has been a long road. I was pilloried by many of my friends back \nthen for even suggesting the idea of requiring work. Today, I think \neveryone here believes that work should be the premise of our welfare \nsystem.\n  It was unthinkable a few short years ago, that we would limit the \ntime that people could collect welfare benefits. Today, I think that is \na proposition on which nearly everyone here agrees.\n  And, on the other side of the aisle, it was just a few short months \nago, that many were unwilling to invest sufficient amounts in child \ncare so that the children of welfare mothers would be taken care of \nwhen their mothers went to work.\n  We have come a long way toward reaching agreement on how best to \nreform our failed welfare system. And, much of that meeting of the \nminds is reflected in this bill. So, I will vote for it, although I \nbelieve it could have been better.\n\n[[Page S9399]]\n\n  I would feel much more comfortable if we were here today debating and \nvoting on the Bipartisan Welfare Reform Act that Senator Specter and I \nintroduced in the Senate and that Representatives Castle  and Tanner \nintroduced in the House. It was more realistic in putting people to \nwork; it was more compassionate to the children who did not ask to be \nborn in poverty; and it was a model of bipartisanship from the very \nbeginning.\n  Unfortunately, the Biden-Specter, or Castle-Tanner, bill is not a \nchoice facing us today. Today, we have but one choice: this bill with \nits flaws or the current flawed system. And, in weighing the \nalternatives, the flawed--I should say failed--status quo is simply no \nlonger an alternative.\n  The culture of welfare must be replaced with the culture of work. The \nculture of dependence must be replaced with the culture of self-\nsufficiency and personal responsibility. And, the culture of permanence \nmust no longer be a way of life. I will vote for this bill, Mr. \nPresident, because it is a step toward changing the culture.\n  This bill will require welfare recipients to work in exchange for \ntheir benefits, and it will limit the amount of time that families can \nreceive welfare. The bill will increase our investment in child care so \nthat welfare mothers can go to work, and it will go after the deadbeat \ndads who refuse to support their own children. Finally, it will crack \ndown on fraud in the Food Stamp Program.\n  These are important and crucial changes that need to be made in our \nfailed welfare system. They have been my priorities in reforming \nwelfare, and this bill meets those goals.\n  But, we should not fool ourselves. There will be people, many of them \nchildren, who will fall through the cracks because of this bill. I do \nnot know how many. I have heard numbers thrown around on how many more \npoor children there will be under this bill. To tell the truth, no one \nknows for sure. But, there will be some. And, for that, we should not \nbrag or boast or pound our collective chests or, as one Member of the \nother body did yesterday, claim that this will be great for America.\n  However, that's not a reason for failing to move forward. It is a \nreason for watching closely what happens as we move forward. As this \nnew welfare system is implemented, we must monitor it with a \nmicroscopic eye. And, I hope the authors of this legislation will be as \nwilling to make corrections if corrections are needed as many of us \nhave been willing to vote for a good, but not perfect, bill.\n  And, this is not a perfect bill. In fact, I do not even believe this \nis the best bill we could have written. But, it is a good bill. And, it \nis time to move forward.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, about 11 months ago, the Senate passed a \nwelfare reform bill by an overwhelming 87 to 12 margin. That vote \ndemonstrated that there was strong, bipartisan agreement that the \ncurrent welfare system needs a dramatic overhaul. After almost a year \nof discussion relating to the best way to reform the current system, it \nis satisfying that the same bipartisan spirit will be present when we \nvote on a welfare reform plan for third time.\n  The current system, with its trademark entitlement programs, has been \nonly marginally successful in providing for the most basic needs of \nlow-income people, and has been a dismal failure in encouraging \nrecipients to become independent.\n  While we supported changes in 1988 to emphasize work in our welfare \nsystem--those reforms included so many exemptions that the incentives \nto work were seriously undermined. Those reforms did not do enough to \nhelp us distinguish those who had fallen on hard times and needed a \nhelping hand from those who simply refused to act in a disciplined and \nresponsible manner. When welfare is a Federal entitlement, it is very \ndifficult to make that distinction.\n  The legislation before us today will put welfare recipients on notice \nthat their time on the system is limited. We are offering them \nassistance with child care, health care, and training to become self-\nsufficient. In return, recipients are expected to put in time improving \ntheir education, participating in training, and getting a job to get \noff the system permanently.\n  As recipients increase their efforts to comply with these new \nrequirements, States must understand the responsibility they are \naccepting with the flexibility gained from the block grant. The Federal \nGovernment is ending the 60-year philosophy that anyone at anytime is \nentitled to cash assistance.\n  The philosophy has changed to: we will help someone get a job and \nkeep a job by providing child care and health care for a specified \nperiod of time. This shift in philosophy means that the culture of \nState welfare offices must evolve into the culture of a job placement \nservice where the focus is getting jobs, not mailing checks.\n  This legislation also takes a big step forward to reinforce the \nimportance of families in society. Regrettably, too many of our young \npeople are growing up without two parents involved in their lives; 92 \npercent of AFDC families have no father in the home. This bill \nrecognizes that reducing out-of-wedlock births is an important goal, \nbut does not prescribe Federal solutions that would hamstring the \nability of States to try different approaches.\n  One of the most essential ingredients for self-sufficiency is the \navailability of child care. By funding child care activities at almost \n$22 billion, States will have the resources they need to design \nsuccessful return-to-work programs. With this enhanced funding, parents \nwill have some assurance that their children will be cared for in safe \nsettings.\n  As the President indicated yesterday, this bill is not perfect. One \nof my principle concerns is the impact of cuts in food stamps on the \nworking poor. Food stamp benefits do not extend just to families on \nAFDC. The Food Stamp Program plays an important role in helping poor, \nworking families make ends meet.\n  Food stamps are the front-line defense against poverty, providing a \nminimum safety net of 1 out of every 10 people in Maine. This program \nhas proven vital in improving the health of our children and the \nelderly, and protecting people with disabilities. We need to ensure \nthat this program retains its vital mission: to ensure that families \nhave enough resources to buy food.\n  One of the most important provisions in this bill is the emphasis on \nthe collection of child support and establishing paternity for children \nborn out-of-wedlock. Child support collections continue to increase \nacross the Nation. The Republican bill includes provision which will \nencourage even greater increases in child support collections. By \ntaking a tougher stand to establish and then enforce child support \norders, some of the families currently tied to the welfare system may \nbe able to get loose.\n  It is obvious that no one likes the current system. Governors don't \nlike it, welfare recipients don't like it, and the public believes that \nwelfare programs serve only those people who want to take advantage of \nthe system. As a result, support for antipoverty programs has eroded \ndrastically in recent years.\n  By injecting a work ethic into our welfare system and emphasizing \nself-sufficiency, which this bill does--we are on the right track. This \nbill comes very close to providing resources and incentives that will \nimprove our anti-poverty programs, but I also hope we will continue to \nwork to ensure that our most vulnerable populations are protected.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, today the Senate will be voting to \ntransform the Nation's welfare system. Despite some changes, I believe \nthat the fundamental flaws of the Senate and House passed bills remain \nand therefore I will vote against the conference report.\n  Children and low-income working men and women will be the victims of \nthis legislation. There are already far too many poor children in this \ncountry and I believe that this bill will in the end cause many more \nchildren to live in poverty. I am particularly concerned that in Ohio \nalone, as many as 43,500 children will be pushed into poverty by the \nimplementation of the bill before us. Mr. President, I cannot support \nlegislation that would cause this kind of harm.\n  I have been concerned from the start that simply washing our hands of \nthe Federal responsibility for welfare and turning it over to States is \nno guarantee of success. This is risky policy and\n\n[[Page S9400]]\n\nthere will no longer be any mechanism for guaranteeing a national \nsafety net for our poorest families.\n  I am concerned that the work requirements in the bill can not be met. \nStates that do not meet employment goals will lose part of their block \ngrants. Penalties would rise from 5 percent in the first year to 21 \npercent in the ninth year. The Congressional Budget Office has already \nreported that most States will be unable to meet the work requirements. \nThis legislation lacks the necessary commitment or resources to help \npeople move from poverty to meaningful employment. It does not provide \nany specific funding for States to help people find or train themselves \nfor better-paying jobs. Rather than moving people off welfare and onto \nwork, this bill emphasizes cutting off welfare.\n  While I support reform that promotes personal responsibility and \ncommunity initiatives, I cannot support legislation which undermines \nthe national safety net and reduces resources for hungry families.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, during consideration of the Senate \nreconciliation bill, two definitions regarding immigrants, section \n2403(c)(1), and in section 2423, section 213(A)(f)(2), were stricken \nbecause they contained material that was not under the jurisdiction of \nthe Finance Committee. Specifically the definitions denied all means-\ntested benefits to immigrants including benefits subject to \nappropriations.\n  The Parliamentarian also agreed that the provisions violated another \nsection of the Byrd rule, section 313(b)(1)(D). Section 313(b)(1)(D) \nprohibits language in a reconciliation bill or conference report if the \ndeficit reduction is merely incidental to the larger policy changes \ncontained within the provision. The Parliamentarian agreed that since \nthe reconciliation process is confined to mandatory spending, expanding \nthe scope of provisions to include benefits provided by discretionary \nspending was a violation of the Byrd rule.\n  The conferees were certainly notified about these rulings and the \noffending provisions were not included in the conference report.\n  Moreover, would the Senator agree that, when the Senate struck these \nsections as violating the Byrd rule, the Senate's intent was to prevent \nthe denial of services in appropriated programs such as those that \nprovide services to victims of domestic violence and child abuse, the \nmaternal and child health block grant, social services block grant, \ncommunity health centers and migrant health centers? Does the Senator \nagree that recipients of appropriated funds are not forced to conduct \nchecks on citizenship and immigration status when providing community \nservices?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. Under the Byrd rule, the budget reconciliation \nprocess cannot be used to change discretionary spending programs. Only \nmandatory spending is affected.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Is this consistent with the understanding of the Senator \nfrom Nebraska as well?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes. As ranking minority member of the Budget Committee, I \nhave been concerned to ensure that the budget reconciliation process is \nlimited to affecting mandatory spending and is not misused to achieve \nother objectives. Budget reconciliation's departure from ordinary \nSenate rules of debate must be carefully limited to its original and \nproper purpose. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle shared \nthis view when they agreed to strike the offending provisions from the \nSenate bill.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator agree that the version of the bill \nrecommended in this conference report is consistent with this \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes. These provisions stayed out of the bill in conference, \nas the conferees sought to avoid another challenge on the Senate floor \nthat these provisions violated the Byrd rule. This manifests our intent \nto keep this bill within the proper parameters of budget \nreconciliation.\n  Mr. President, changes in discretionary programs on a reconciliation \nbill, such as the ones mentioned by the Senator from Florida and the \nSenator from Massachusetts, result in no direct budgetary savings and \nare therefore extraneous under the Byrd rule.\n  During floor consideration of this legislation, we struck section \n2403(c)(1), and in section 2423, section 213(A)(f)(2) because they \ncontained material that was not under the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee, namely many discretionary programs, because they violated \nsection 313(b)(1)(C) of the Budget Act. These provisions also provide \nno budgetary savings, and violating the intent of section 313(b)(1)(A) \nof the Budget Act, but because they were cleverly embedded in language \nwhich did provide direct budgetary savings, it was difficult to fully \nenforce the Byrd rule. Nonetheless, it is clear that this bill should \nnot be used to make changes in discretionary programs, and those who \nlook to interpret the action of the Congress should take this into \naccount.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of the Byrd rule is to prevent \nreconciliation bills from being loaded up with provisions, such as \nthese, that have no budgetary impact. This is important because \nreconciliation bills move in the Senate under special rules which limit \namendment and time for debate. Without the protections provided by the \nByrd rule, it would be far too easy to take advantage of the privileged \nnature of reconciliation to enact controversial items without proper \nconsideration in the Senate. Allowing reconciliation to be used in this \nmanner fundamentally undermines the basic nature of the Senate's rules \nwhich protect the voice of the minority and damages the Senate as an \ninstitution.\n  For this reason, I feel it is important to bring these provisions to \nthe attention of the Senate, and I thank the Senators for their \nefforts.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, the Senate will reach a milestone in \nthe long and sometimes twisting journey of welfare reform legislation. \nThe Senate will pass this bill, as the House of Representatives did \nyesterday. The President has told the Nation that he will sign it, and \nsoon it will become law. I will vote in favor of this bill because it \nis a step toward ending the present system which simply does not work \nand replacing it with a system which requires and rewards work. I wish, \nhowever, that we had before us a reform bill which I could \nwholeheartedly, without reservation, endorse and support. I would \ngreatly prefer a bill, for example, like the work first legislation \nwhich contained a Federal safety net for children and which I \ncosponsored with Senator Daschle and many of my colleagues or even like \nthe bipartisan Biden-Specter approach which I voted for in the Senate.\n  The bill before us is an improvement over the legislation which I \nopposed last year and which the President vetoed because, among other \nthings, it provides more support for child care, retains needed child \nprotection programs and services, includes my amendment strengthening \nthe work requirement, does not block grant food stamp assistance, \nrequires a greater maintenance of effort from the States, and doubles \nthe contingency fund to help States in times of economic downturn. \nHowever, it contains a number of serious flaws. That is why it is a \nmilestone and not a final destination. It will need repairs. As the \nPresident has indicated, there are aspects of this legislation which \nthe Congress will be required to revisit. And beyond that, I believe \nthat this kind of sweeping reform involves an element of risk. Although \nour efforts are directed toward improving the system, recognizing \nwithin the welfare system the principle of the value of work, assuring \nthe protection of children and reasserting the responsibility of absent \nparents to their children, we cannot possibly be sure that all the \neffects of such sweeping reform will be those intended. For that \nreason, the Congress must remain vigilant in its oversight and \nmonitoring of the impacts of this legislation. We must stand ready to \naddress negative impacts. If critics are fully correct and there is a \nlarge increase in the numbers of American children who find themselves \nimpoverished, we must stand ready to remedy quickly the defects in this \nbill.\n  For a number of years, I have been working toward reform of the \nwelfare system. The existing system has failed. It does not serve \nfamilies and children well. It does not serve the American taxpayer \nwell. It was created to meet the needs of families in hard times. \nUnfortunately, for far too many, what was intended as a safety net has \ntoo often become a way of life, a cycle of dependency. It is wrong to \nallow such a system to continue.\n\n[[Page S9401]]\n\n  Meaningful reform should protect children and establish the principle \nthat able-bodied people work. It should tighten child support \nenforcement laws and be more effective in getting absent fathers to \nsupport their children. the bill before us represents a constructive \neffort.\n  The funding levels in this bill are aimed at assuring that adequate \nchild care resources will be available for children as single parents \nmake the transition into work. Those levels are significantly improved \nover last year's bill. This strengthens the work requirement because it \nbetter assures that States can effectively move people into job \ntraining, private sector employment, and community service jobs. The \nbill will provide the kind of flexibility which the States have been \nasking for. Now, they must step up to the task and meet their \nresponsibility. If they fail, this reform will fail because it is built \non the foundation of getting able-bodied people back to work.\n\n  I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes my amendment \nwhich I first offered last year which greatly strengthens the work \nrequirement in the bill. The original legislation required able-bodied \nrecipients to work within 2 years of receipt of benefits. My amendment \nadds a provision which requires that unless an able-bodied person is in \na private sector job, school, or job training, the State must offer, \nand the recipient must accept community service employment within 2 \nmonths of receipt of benefits.\n  As I have said, I am deeply concerned by several provisions contained \nin this legislation. I am afraid that the reductions in food stamp \nassistance may go too far, although the conference committee added $1 \nbillion in food stamp assistance back in. Also, while some language was \nadded in the conference to allow States to use some funds under this \nbill to provide noncash vouchers for minimum safetynet support to \nchildren of families which lose their benefits they have reached the 5-\nyear limit on assistance, I believe such minimum aid should be \nmandated. We will want to monitor how the States handle this problem. \nAnd, I am concerned that the provisions included, denying benefits to \nlegal immigrants, are too harsh. I particularly object to the impact on \nlegal immigrants who are already in the United States and on legal \nimmigrants who come here, work hard, and then may unfortunately become \ndisabled. As the President stated yesterday, these provisions don't \nbelong in a bill relating to welfare reform.\n  I am also concerned by a provision in the bill which did not appear \nin either the House-passed or Senate-passed bill. Both the House and \nthe Senate bills prohibited penalties against single custodial parents \nwith children under 11 years old who cannot find adequate, affordable \nchild care, as determined by the State. Inexplicably, the conference \ncommittee changed that provision to lower the protected age to children \nunder the age of 6. Again, I think this is a matter which Congress \nshould monitor closely as it is applied in the States, and revisit it, \nsoon.\n  Mr. President, the decision on this bill is a difficult and a close \none. But, I believe we must reform the broken welfare system which \ncurrently serves America's children poorly and serves the American \ntaxpayer poorly. But, as we move forward on a bipartisan basis, we must \nvigilantly work with the States, to make this reform successful, to get \npeople back to work, and to improve the lives of America's most \nvulnerable children, with an on-going commitment that mistakes will be \naddressed, and shortfalls will be reevaluated.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 moves our Nation in a positive \ndirection by reforming our current welfare system. Not only does it \neliminate the entitlement status of welfare, but the bill requires \nthose able-bodied recipients who can work, to work. In addition, the \nbill provides $4.5 billion more for child care than current law, \nmaintains Medicaid eligibility for those citizens who qualify for \nassistance, and allows those States who are operating under Federal \nwaivers to continue to do so. The child care and Medicaid provisions in \nthis bill will allow welfare recipients to better make the transition \nto work. Also, the Federal Government, by allowing States to continue \nwith their innovative welfare reform programs, will see continued \nsuccesses, as in Oregon, in welfare reform.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and while currently \nembroiled in the appropriations process, my experience has taught me \nall too well the dire consequences of continuing, without change, \nentitlement programs that we do not, and cannot control. We can no \nlonger keep spending until all needs are met. These entitlement \nprograms place a great burden on the Appropriations Committee and more \nimportantly, a burden on the many other needs of our Nation.\n  Only through a commitment to providing better opportunities for those \nliving in poverty will we find a solution to poverty. We can achieve a \nreduction in welfare spending while working to transition the \nimpoverished, out of poverty. The recent vote in the Senate to increase \nthe minimum wage is an indication of Congress' commitment to ensure \nthat in the area of employment, a minimum standard is assured. However, \nCongress cannot eliminate poverty by merely raising the minimum wage. \nThere is a cycle of poverty which is passed from generation to \ngeneration, and it is the root causes of this poverty that must be \naddressed: a lack of education and access to upward social, and \neconomic stability. Education is the key to the success of society. \nCitizens without the opportunity to educate themselves, to increase \nknowledge and skills, will weaken in despair, maintaining the status \nquo at best. In my home State of Oregon, the Governor's office, county \ncommissioners, and the Oregon Workforce Quality Council, are only a few \namong many who have worked towards improving job training. As a result \nof the efforts in Oregon, in only a few years Oregon has reduced their \nwelfare roles by almost 25 percent. By progressing towards a seamless \nlink amongst differing human resource agencies, Oregon has made \noutstanding progress in integrating education, employment, and training \nprograms. These are key links in ending the cycle of poverty. Thus, I \nam pleased to see waiver language contained in this bill which will \ncontinue the welfare reform process. With this added flexibility Oregon \nwill be able to continue its extraordinary welfare program.\n\n  Mr. President, we have chosen to address welfare reform and Medicaid \nreform separately; a decision which I cannot fully support. Welfare \nreform is an integrated effort which includes: child care, effective \njob training and quality health care. To end welfare as we know it we \nmust allow our citizens the opportunity to climb out of the welfare \ntrap and become productive citizens of our Nation. Without an \nintegrated approach the entire system is placed in jeopardy. Thus, I am \ndismayed that we did not reform Medicaid while reforming welfare, for \nthey are an integrated pair. However, I am satisfied at this point to \nknow that Medicaid will remain intact for our citizens who are \nfulfilling the work requirements of this bill. Furthermore, I am \npleased that the State of Oregon will continue to operate its Medicaid \nsystem under the Oregon health plan. Under the Oregon health plan, my \nState has enrolled 114,000 more Oregonians who would otherwise not have \nhad access to health care. The Oregon health plan required numerous \nFederal waivers to achieve this success, and I am hopeful that Medicaid \nreform, whenever enacted, will have similar success as in Oregon.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe State of Oregon endorsing this bill.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Oregon Department of\n\n\n                                              Human Resources,\n\n                                         Salem, OR, July 31, 1996.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     United States Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: Thank you for your ongoing work with \n     us on both our welfare reform waivers and the current pending \n     legislation. Your assistance has made it possible for Oregon \n     to continue to improve upon its extraordinarily successful \n     strategies to move families from poverty to employment.\n       Regarding the current bill, it is my understanding that the \n     conference committee has allowed states the option to \n     determine if, after a five-year period following enactment, \n     qualified aliens (generally speaking, legally residing non-\n     citizens) would remain eligible for Medicaid coverage. With \n     this issue resolved, the Department of Human Resources\n\n[[Page S9402]]\n\n     is satisfied that the bill will allow the State to have more \n     flexibility and success in helping Oregon families become \n     self-sufficient than would be possible under current law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Gary Weeks,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. In Oregon, we are reducing our welfare roles by \ntraining our workers and putting people to work. This is being \naccomplished through a concerted effort of local, State and Federal \nofficials striving together towards a common goal of putting people to \nwork. We are demonstrating that welfare reform is an integrated system \nof job training, child care, personal responsibility, and health care.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to change the \nNation's welfare system. While I hope these changes will make people's \nlives better, I greatly fear that these changes will do far more harm \nthan good.\n  Let me say I believe the country needs welfare reform, and I strongly \nsupport some portions of this bill. I support requiring all able-bodied \nrecipients to work, turning welfare offices into employment offices, \nproviding adequate child care and requiring strong child support \nenforcement. This bill achieves some of these goals, but I am deeply \nconcerned that it will push more people into poverty instead of lifting \nthem out.\n  I am encouraged by the President's commitment to pursue these \nconcerns and come back next year to propose changes to this \nlegislation. In fact, I wish we had incorporated those changes in this \nbill.\n  I have been hopeful that this Congress would achieve real welfare \nreform. A good bill would encourage adults to work without threatening \nthe well-being of children or legal immigrants or the States that need \nwelfare assistance most. I originally voted for welfare reform \nlegislation in the Senate with hopes of ultimately achieving this goal.\n  Unfortunately, this has not happened. In the highly politicized \nenvironment in which we find ourselves, I fear that we are trading an \nadmittedly imperfect system for one that may prove to be far worse for \nour Nation's children and poor. That is why I am voting against the \nconference report before us.\n  I have been persuaded that this bill will hurt New Mexico. While \nunder this bill, States may have substantial discretion on how they \nadminister welfare benefits, it is equally clear that they will have \nsubstantially less money with which to administer those benefits.\n  I believe this bill will increase the number of children living in \npoverty in our State. Relative to other States, low per capita income \nstates like New Mexico will suffer. According to the New Mexico Human \nServices Department, the number of families on welfare is increasing in \nNew Mexico--from an 18,400 caseload in 1989 to 34,000 cases per month \nin 1996. New Mexico cannot easily absorb funding cuts when the caseload \nis growing and the State budget is not.\n  This bill requires progressively more hours of work, from a greater \npercent of each State's caseload every year, with States losing \ncumulatively more funding each year they fail to hit their targets. \nWhile I am a strong proponent of work requirements as an integral part \nof welfare reform, I am skeptical of this approach.\n  Currently, unemployment in New Mexico is 6.8 percent, higher than the \nnational average of 5.3 percent. While we have experienced a recent \nperiod of high job creation, many of those new jobs are concentrated in \nour urban centers and are not likely to be accessible to those who live \nin rural areas. And what will happen to New Mexico in the event of an \neconomic downturn, when rates of job creation are not so high? This \nbill provides a penalty of a 5 percent cut in Federal funds for the \nState's block grant that will be increased to a maximum of 21 percent \ncut should targets be missed in consecutive years. The National \nGovernors' Association [NGA] shares the concern that many States will \nhave difficulty in meeting the work requirements. This will leave \nStates with the choice of using State and local funds for education, \ntraining, and child care, or throwing more people off the rolls so it \nwill be easier to hit their work targets, or cutting far back on \nbenefits.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that, over 6 \nyears, this bill falls $12 billion short of the funding needed to meet \nthe work requirements of this legislation, and about $2.4 billion short \nin child care resources. Currently, the caseload in New Mexico is \ngrowing. Who will be forced to pick up the shortfall? State and local \ngovernments will.\n  Last year in New Mexico, 239,000 recipients in 87,000 households \nrelied on food stamps. About $28 billion in savings realized by this \nbill will be in food stamps. Such cuts to funding benefits erode the \nintegrity of the safety net for those who need it most. I say again \nthat we are trading in an imperfect system for one that may prove much \nworse.\n  Our common goal is to eliminate public assistance as a way of life \nwhile preserving temporary protections for those truly in need. We can \ndo this without denying the basic needs of innocent children and \nwithout driving State and local governments further into debt. I look \nforward to voting for the necessary amendments to this legislation in \nthe next Congress.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased that the welfare reform \nconference report includes a suggestion I made to the conferees.\n  Before final passage in the Senate, I suggested that we delete a \ndirect spending appropriation that was in the Senate-passed bill--\nsection 2211(e)(5).\n  This provision would have given the Social Security Administration \n[SSA] $300 million in entitlement funding for administrative costs \nassociated with welfare reform.\n  Although it is important to make sure SSA gets the funds it needs to \nimplement welfare reform, I oppose creating new entitlement spending \nfor Federal agencies.\n  As an alternative, I suggested that we build upon a process that is \nalready in current law and which adjusts the discretionary spending \ncaps to accommodate additional funding in the appropriations process \nfor SSA to do continuing disability reviews.\n  I am pleased that the conferees accepted this approach.\n  Let me also clarify one issue.\n  The language in the conference report provides that the chairman of \nthe House Budget Committee must take back the cap adjustment in the \nevent the President vetoes the bill.\n  For the record, we do not need this explicit authority in the Senate. \nThe chairman of the Senate Budget Committee already has the authority \nto reverse adjustments of this kind in the event the legislation does \nnot become law.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the conference report \nand welfare reform.\n  The Congress and the administration have worked now for over 3 years \nto reform the shameful situation in which millions of Americans on \nwelfare find themselves. Parents seeking work are discouraged from \ndoing so by the current system. Teenage mothers languish alone in \nhouseholds without the support of their children's fathers and often \nwithout proper adult supervision. Welfare as we know it has allowed \nthese societal ills to fester and drain increasingly large amounts of \npublic assistance funds. The current system has made it too easy for \nyoung men to father children without assuming either the financial or \nemotional responsibilities of parenthood. For too long, society has \nassumed the responsibility of caring for poor children with welfare \nchecks, while not placing expectations of accountability upon the young \nparents. Too many families face the daily burden of survival, \nunemployment, and society's suspicion of their unwillingness to change \ntheir situation.\n  The provisions of this conference agreement can ensure that our \nwelfare system will finally reflect a respect for two of the most \nfundamental values of our society--an adherence to the American work \nethic balanced with a compassion for those truly unable to care for \nthemselves. This bill redirects hard-earned tax dollars toward \nachieving employment opportunities for adults and improvements in the \nquality of life of children.\n  First and foremost, it eliminates the possibility of receiving public \nassistance without any intention of making some kind of a contribution \nto society in return. Beneficiaries will be aware\n\n[[Page S9403]]\n\nthat from the day they receive their first check, the clock will be \nticking. Society is fulfilling an obligations to help them get back on \ntheir feet, and they in turn are obligated to make every effort to \nreceive job training or education and to find employment. The \nemployment of parents will enrich their children not only financially, \nbut morally as well. In watching their parents benefit from educational \nopportunities and engage in gainful employment, children may embrace a \nvaluable work ethic and eventually be better able to free themselves \nfrom the cycle of poverty and welfare dependence in which they are \ncurrently entrapped. States will also have an incentive to help \nbeneficiaries find work. Welfare offices should become employment \noffices as States strive to move recipients into the work force in \norder to earn a performance bonus from the Federal Government.\n\n  The conference bill also holds the hope of protecting children and \nreducing welfare spending by attacking the problem of unmarried teen \nparenthood. Welfare will no longer encourage the proliferation of \nsingle and uneducated parents by automatically and unconditionally \nunderwriting the mothers who bear children out of wedlock. Children \nborn out of wedlock are shown by studies to be three times more likely \nto be on welfare as adults than their peers. By implementing this bill, \nhowever, the Federal Government will require States to combat this \nproblem and hopefully prevent it in a number of ways. First, paternity \nmust be established for all children born out of wedlock at birth as a \ncondition for receiving assistance, and fathers will be required to pay \nchild support and set a good example for their children by engaging in \neither private sector or community service jobs. Mothers must live with \nan adult parent or relative or in an adult-supervised, strictly run \nSecond Chance Home where they can learn skills necessary to the proper \nmanagement and care of a child and household. A further condition of \nreceiving assistance is a commitment to educational advancement. Young \nmothers must stay in a school or training program as a condition of \ncontinuing to receive welfare checks.\n  This welfare reform bill will additionally work to prevent a new \ngeneration from entering into the cycle of early parenthood and welfare \ndependence by making it a national goal to lower teen pregnancy rates. \nIt establishes a national campaign that will assure the creation of \nteen pregnancy prevention programs in at least 25 percent of American \ncommunities by 1997. It includes two amendments which I authored with \nthe intent of combating this problem. One will require the Justice \nDepartment as well as the States to crack down on what studies show is \na class of older men--many of them predatory--who father the children \nof young girls in the majority of teen pregnancy cases. The second \namendment requires States to reserve a portion of their social service \nblock grant funds for programs and services that educate young people \nabout the consequences of premarital pregnancy. As we reduce the number \nof teens who become pregnant, we will be increasing the number of \nchildren who are able to enjoy a childhood without deprevation.\n\n  There are other aspects of this legislation which have been framed \nwith the protection of children in mind. For example, minor children \ncontinue to receive Medicaid even if their parents lose coverage as a \npenalty for not getting off of welfare into job training and work. \nFamilies can also be eligible for transitional Medicaid coverage as \nthey move from welfare to work. These provisions are vital as many \nparents currently refrain from finding jobs and moving off welfare for \nfear of losing the medical coverage for their children that welfare \nprovides.\n  Mr. President, this bill provides a significant improvement over the \nSenate-passed bill in allowing States to provide needy children of \nparents who go off of welfare with vouchers through the title XXblock \ngrant. The legislation also answers the all-important question of who \nwill care for the children as their mothers and fathers move into the \nworld of education and work. We have designated $13.8 billion--a \nsubstantial increase--to be spent just on child care over the next 6 \nyears, and we have retained child care health and safety standards. \nMoveover, we will not penalize mothers with children under the next 6 \nyears, and we have retained child care health and safety standards. \nMoreover, we will not penalize mothers with children under the age of 6 \nwho do not accept employment because they cannot find or afford child \ncare. I would have preferred the retention of the Senate provision in \nthis regard which allowed the mothers of children age 6 to 11 who \ncannot find adequate, affordable child care to stay home with them \nwithout penalty.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill--a giant step forward from the \nwelfare status quo--but it is no more perfect than any other bill that \nhas passed the Senate on a big, complicated problem. I am especially \nconcerned by the food stamp provision which is a real break with what \nwas agreed to in the Senate-passed bill. It limits the receipt of food \nstamps by jobless individuals who do not have children to 3 months out \nof a 3-year period and allows no hardship exemptions. This is far \nharsher than the Senate provision which allowed jobless individuals to \nreceive food stamps for 6 months out of each year as well as a 20-\npercent hardship exemption. Food stamps are also now cut for households \nreceiving energy assistance, a proposal not included in the Senate \nbill. The conference report also cuts the cap on the shelter deduction \nby $42 and takes away food stamps for more families with children who \npay over half their income for housing. And I remain very concerned \nabout the ban on food stamps, Medicaid, and other assistance for legal \nimmigrants; it has no good place in a welfare-to-work bill.\n  As the President has urged, we must keep these issues in mind for \nrepair in the future even as we recognize that this legislation is \ndefinitely an improvement in the current welfare program. In voting for \nthis bill, we will realize an historic opportunity to meet President \nClinton's call to ``end welfare as we know it.'' We will have also \nproven to the American people that the Federal Government is capable of \nbringing about change through bipartisan cooperation.\n  This is not the end of welfare reform but it is the largest step \nforward we have taken to improve the way America cares for its poor, \nand tries to make real for them the dreams of equal opportunity, which \nis the driving impulse of our history.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I wonder if my colleague could address one point on this \nbill. I notice that the term ``Federal means-tested public benefit'' \nwas defined in previous versions of the bill. However, in this \nconference report, no definition is provided.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is my understanding that the Parliamentarian noted \nthat the previous definitions of ``Federal means-tested public \nbenefit'' were broad enough to include discretionary spending. \nAccording to the Parliamentarian, that inclusion caused the definition \nto violate Section 313(b)(1)(D) of the Byrd rule, which prevents \nreconciliation legislation from extending its scope to items that \nprovide merely incidental deficit reduction, that is, discretionary \nprograms.\n  Therefore, when the bill was considered in conference, I understand \nthat there was an intentional effort to ensure this provision complied \nwith Byrd rule by omitting the definition of that particular term.\n  In other words, then, the term ``Federal means-tested public \nbenefit''--if it is to be in compliance with the Byrd rule--does not \nrefer to discretionary programs. I would assume that programs such as \nfunding for community health centers, as well as the maternal and child \nhealth block grant, would not be impacted.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator for clarifying that point.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe our last Senator, other than \nthe leader and myself, is Senator Thurmond, and he would like 8 \nminutes. We have plenty of time, so I give him 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport to H.R. 3734, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \nReconciliation Act of 1996. This legislation reforms welfare to \nemphasize fundamental American values. It rewards work and self \nreliance, promotes personal responsibility, and renews a sense of hope\n\n[[Page S9404]]\n\nin the future. Additionally, the bill slows the growth of Federal \nwelfare spending, thus reducing the Federal budget deficit by $55 \nbillion over 6 years. The measure does provide sufficient increases in \nspending to protect vulnerable populations.\n  This Congress previously passed two welfare reform bills. The \nPresident subsequently vetoed those bills, despite his 1992 campaign \npledge to end welfare as we know it. I hope as we send him another \nbill, that the President will finally keep his pledge on this issue, \nand sign the bill.\n  Mr. President, more than 30 years ago the Federal Government declared \nits War on Poverty. Since then, the number of individuals receiving aid \nto families with dependent children has more than tripled. Over two-\nthirds of these recipients are children. The increase in the number of \nchildren receiving public assistance is closely related to the dramatic \nincrease in births to unmarried women, particularly to teenage young \nwomen. Mr. President, the War on Poverty has inflicted many casualties. \nMultiple generations of children have grown to adulthood, continuing \nwelfare as a way of life. Mothers and children have been abandoned. \nFamilies have been destroyed by long-term dependence on Government. The \nWar on Poverty has been costly, both in terms of human suffering and \ntaxpayer dollars spent.\n\n  In contrast, this reform measure takes steps to promote stable \nfamilies and discourage illegitimacy. We recognize many children in \nAmerica are vulnerable. In response to this need, the bill guarantees \nthey will continue to receive the support they need. In doing so, the \nprospects of children in welfare families are greatly improved.\n  Mr. President, the measure before us is built on five main \nprinciples, which I believe are supported by residents of South \nCarolina and by the American people in general. I would like to briefly \nsummarize these pillars of welfare reform.\n  First, welfare should not be a way of life. By placing lifetime \nlimits on benefits, this bill ensures that welfare will be temporary \nassistance to those who are in need.\n  The second principle is work, not welfare. Able-bodied beneficiaries \nwill, for the first time ever, be required to work for their benefits. \nThis principle is designed to restore dignity to the individual and \nfairness to the system.\n  Third, welfare for noncitizens and felons will be limited. The bill \nprovides adequate exceptions for emergency benefits, for refugees, and \nfor those who have contributed to this Nation by paying taxes for 10 \nyears or through military service.\n  Fourth, the bill encourages personal responsibility to halt rising \nillegitimacy rates. This legislation seeks to counter that trend by \nincreasing efforts to establish paternity and enforce child support \norders. Furthermore, the bill encourages the formation and maintenance \nof two-parent families.\n  Finally, this legislation returns responsibility and flexibility to \nthe States. The national Government has an obligation to promote the \ngeneral welfare of the United States. At the same time, we know that \nthose who are closest to the problem are better able to provide for the \nspecific welfare of needy individuals. This bill establishes general \nguidelines and provides broad cash welfare and child care block grants. \nWith this flexibility States can design programs that meet local \nconditions and particular needs.\n  Mr. President, like the two vetoed bills that preceded it, this bill \nhas many provisions that will encourage work and education, lessen \ndependency on the Government, and foster an environment to reduce unwed \nand teen pregnancy. The legislation also ensures that needy Americans \nwill receive a wide range of services including cash assistance, child \ncare, food stamps, medical care, child nutrition, and disability \npayments. The bill also contains strong provisions related to child \nsupport enforcement, child protection, foster care, and adoption \nassistance.\n  I compliment the managers of the bill who have brought historic \nreform to our welfare system. This bill deserves our support. I thank \nthe Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes off our side to Senator Ford to go \nalong with whatever he has.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 2 minutes on our side to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Mexico for \nallowing me to have a couple minutes.\n  Mr. President, I think we need to be very careful to put this bill \ninto perspective. Yes, it will modify a system that no one defends. \nYes, it will give States more flexibility to deal with their poorest \ncitizens. Yes, it will provide more for child care than H.R. 4, easing \none of the greatest barriers for those on welfare who want to work. All \nof these things are good reasons for supporting this bill.\n  But I find some of the predictions of what this bill will do to be a \nbit of a stretch. It is being suggested by some that this bill will \nreduce the poverty rate, the illigitimacy rate, the teen pregnancy \nrate, the crime rate, and just about every other kind of rate you can \nimagine. We hear that this bill provides dynamic opportunities for \neducation and training and is the opportunity that people who are poor \nin this country have been asking for.\n  Well, I hope the strongest supporters of this bill are right. \nSometimes I wonder when I listen to some of these speeches just how \nmany poor people some of my colleagues have ever met. Maybe they could \ncome to eastern Kentucky. Maybe then they could understand how \ndifficult it is to determine whether a lack of personal responsibility \nor a lack of opportunity is the greater cause of poverty.\n  For those of us in the middle of the political spectum, this is a \ntough vote. When I hear some of the predictions about what this bill \nwill do, I am skeptical. I have a hard time figuring out how it will \naffect my State.\n  We have been doing some innovative things in Kentucky with welfare \nreform. We are one of the 10 States left that has not obtained a \nFederal waiver from welfare laws--something you hear so much about in \nWashington today. Yet we are 1 of the top 10 States in reducing our \nwelfare rolls--reducing welfare rolls without a waiver--23-percent \nreduction since January 1993. We have tried a lot of things to put \npeople to work. Our current Governor is looking at even broader \nchanges--maybe this bill will allow him to do most things without \nhaving to worry about a waiver request, and that is a good thing.\n  But when I talk to those in my State about why our welfare rolls have \ncome down, the most important reason I hear about is the improvement in \nthe economy. I remember how tough the vote was in 1993 on the deficit \nreduction package. I believe that vote had a lot to do with the \nstrength of our economy today. In many ways, that bill may have been \nmuch more important in reducing welfare rolls and putting people to \nwork than the welfare bill before us today.\n  And speaking of predictions, I remember the predictions that \nopponents of deficit reduction made in 1993. They said the 1993 deficit \nreduction package would cause a recession, cost jobs, increase \ninflation, cause interest rates to rise, fail to reduce the deficit \nbelow $200 billion, and shake up the stock market. Guess what, Mr. \nPresident? Our friends who made these predictions were zero for six. \nThat kind of batting average won't even get you in the minor leagues. \nJust this morning, we learned that the economy grew in the second \nquarter at an extremely strong annual rate of 4.2 percent. We have a \nhealthy, growing economy, and the deficit has been cut from $290 \nbillion to $117 billion and may go below that. These are important \nreasons why the welfare rolls are down in my State by 23 percent.\n  Some of our colleagues who made those wrong predictions about the \n1993 deficit reduction package are the same ones making the boldest \npredictions about what this welfare bill will do. So I am skeptical.\n  I am willing to support, and will support, this conference report for \nthe steps it takes in the right direction. But we need to monitor the \nimpact of this bill very carefully. About the only thing we know for \nsure is that it will reduce the growth in welfare spending by about $55 \nbillion over the next 6 years. We hope it will achieve some of the \nother things that are being predicted today, and at least give our \nGovernors and State legislatures more\n\n[[Page S9405]]\n\nflexibility in experimenting and designing programs which address \npoverty. I hope that we will see more success at the State level. But \nsomehow, I am also quite certain that as we monitor the impact of this \nbill, we will quickly find out that this is not the end of the welfare \nreform debate, and that future Congresses will find there is much more \nwork to be done. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Roth started off today following me. Since he \nis the chairman of the committee that wrote most of this, we thought it \nmight be appropriate that he give the closing argument. We have saved \ntime for him. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Roth.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, in these last few minutes before we put \nAugust 1, 1996, into the history books as the day we end the welfare \nsystem as we know it, I will close with a few observations and some \nimportant acknowledgments.\n  Last February, after welfare reform had been vetoed twice, the \nNation's Governors restarted today's legislation by reaching a \nunanimous agreement to reform welfare. Gov. John Engler of Michigan \ntestified before the Finance Committee later that month and put this \nentire debate into its proper perspective. He said:\n\n       Just consider the Washington Post headline describing what \n     the governors' policy--adopted unanimously with the support \n     of our most conservative and most liberal governor and \n     everybody in between--meant.\n       The Post headline read, ``Governors reform plan would break \n     with 60 years of policy.''\n\n  Governor Engler went on to say:\n\n       Remember what the governors propose is changing a law that \n     has been the basis of federal policy for 60 years and \n     remember how counterproductive these policies have been.\n       They punish parents who work too much.\n       They punish mothers and fathers that want to stay together.\n       They punish working families who save money.\n       They reward teenagers who have babies out of wedlock, and \n     the list is longer.\n\n  Mr. President, this 60-year-old welfare system rewards the behavior \nwhich leads to poverty and punishes the behavior which leads out of \npoverty. Yes, it is time to end this system.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is about personal responsibility and \nwork opportunity. Work is not only about earning our daily bread. Work \nis an integral part of the human condition. A parent's work also \nteaches the values necessary to prepare the next generation for its \nresponsibilities.\n  We can all be proud of our work today because it will make a profound \ndifference in the lives of millions of Americans.\n  It will go down as one of the most important legislative achievements \nnot only in this Congress, but in many, many years.\n  This is a historic week for a historic Congress. In a matter of \nweeks, we have moved from gridlock to winning gold medals. Welfare \nreform is certainly one of our gold medal achievements.\n  I end by again thanking Senator Domenici for his leadership in \norchestrating this legislation through the process. I want to extend my \nthanks to the Finance Committee conferees, Senator Chafee, Senator \nGrassley, Senator Hatch, and Senator Simpson for their extraordinary \nassistance and cooperation.\n  The contributions of Senator Nickles, Senator Gramm, and Senator \nSantorum as we moved through the conference cannot be overstated. They \nplayed key roles in assuring this legislation would meet all of our \nobjectives, especially with respect to tough work requirements.\n  Let me compliment the majority leader, Senator Lott, getting this \nconference report completed. This is a major accomplishment in the \nbrief time of his leadership position.\n  Our former majority leader and colleague, Bob Dole deserves as much \ncredit for this legislation as anyone. When the tough decisions needed \nto be made, and there were plenty through this process, he demonstrated \nthe leadership we all look to.\n  I extend my congratulations and thanks to those Members in the House \nof Representatives who have worked so hard on this issue. It was a \nprivilege to work with Chairmen Bill Archer, Clay Shaw, Bill Goodling, \nand Tom Bliley over these months.\n  I extend the thanks of everyone to both the majority and minority \nstaffs of the leadership, the Finance Committee, especially Lindy \nPaull, Frank Polk, Ginny Koops, and Dennis Smith, the Budget Committee, \nand the Agriculture Committee, for their work. There are too many to \nname individually and I would not want to fail to mention anyone. I do \nthank each of them.\n  I also extend those same thanks to the respective staffs in the \nHouse, most especially to Ron Haskins, Matt Weidinger, Cassie Bevin, \nand Margaret Pratt at the Committee on Ways and Means.\n  We should remember that until a few weeks ago, Medicaid was included \nin this package, so the staffs at Finance and the House Commerce \nCommittee who worked on Medicaid should be recognized, especially Susan \nDull, the First Heinz Fellow working in Congress.\n  Of course, the committee work cannot be done without the help of \nthose staff members at Legislative Counsels in both the Senate and \nHouse, especially Ruth Ernst, and Mark Mathiesen.\n  I extend our thanks to those at the Congressional Budget Office, \nespecially Jean Hearne, Robin Rudowitz, Sheila Dacy, Justin Lattice, \nand Kathy Ruffin; the Congressional Research Service, most especially, \nVee Burke, Gene Falk, and Melvina Ford; and the General Accounting \nOffice, especially, Greg Dybalski and Jerry Fastrup.\n  Let me mention something else that is historical about this day which \nhas been overlooked.\n  I know of no other time in which congressional and State officials \nand staffs have worked so closely together on an issue.\n  For months, Governors John Engler, Tommy Thompson, and Mike Leavitt \nhave given so generously of their time, support, and the power of \nideas. They truly deserve the thanks of the American people.\n  They have donated the talent and expertise of their staffs, \nespecially LeAnne Redick, Kathy Tobin, who also worked on this \nlegislation as a staff member of the Finance Committee, Joanne Neumann \nand Mary Kay Mantho.\n  Mr. President, this will indeed be a day to remember. Thank you and \ncongratulations to all the Republicans in the House and Senate who \nstuck to our principles and stuck together to make this a reality. \nTogether we have made a difference.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe we have a few moments left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes and 15 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will use 5 minutes, then yield the balance to our \nleader.\n  While I have during the day given deference to this being a very \nbipartisan effort, and while I have from time to time and during the \nday said we are glad the President is going to sign this measure, I \ntake a few minutes of my closing time to thank the Republicans in the \nU.S. Senate and Republicans in the U.S. House, because I think it is \nobvious the President of the United States came into office promising \nthe end of welfare as we know it, and for 2 years during his \nadministration he had Democrats in the Senate and Democrats in the \nHouse and no welfare reform was achieved.\n  Now, while we are glad to have the President saying, ``Yes, I will \nsign this bill,'' I do not think it ought to escape anyone that there \nwould be no welfare reform if the Republicans had not taken control of \nthe U.S. House and the U.S. Senate. I believe I can say that with a \ndegree of certainty, because I worked on reconciliation bills and \nbudget bills that called for reform for at least 10 years and nothing \nhappened.\n  So I say thank you to the American people who elected the Republican \nMembers to the House and Republican Members to the Senate, because \ntonight we celebrate a very, very significant achievement. As we moved \nthrough the Chamber of the Senate with our efforts to get a balanced \nbudget, I say to most Republicans it was truly a difficult job to stand \nhere and ask you to vote for all those tough items, as we moved a \nbudget resolution toward balance, and a reconciliation bill, a big bill \nchanging the law, only to find that the President did not agree.\n  I believe tonight the fruits of that effort are going to be realized \nand a program that has not worked for millions\n\n[[Page S9406]]\n\nof Americans will begin to work in their behalf, as it works for all \nAmericans who get jobs and assume personal responsibility. For tonight \nwe say if 60 years ago, or even 30 years ago, or even 10 years ago, if \nwe would have looked at this program and said it is inconsistent with \neverything that is good about America, for it locks people in poverty \nand denies them the interest and enthusiasm to get a job--for many, \nmany years the welfare laws of America were administered by people who \nwere worried about the sociological problems of the poor.\n  I am hopeful that across America the offices that are helping welfare \npeople will be job training, will be jobs-oriented, will be talking \nabout training and education, and how people can get off welfare \ninstead of finding ways to assure them that they can stay on.\n  This bill is going to say most Americans work, and we are going to \nask that welfare recipients work. We will give them training. We will \ngive them child care. But we will say, you ought to work because \nthrough work, you get responsibility, and through responsibility, you \nand your families get the joy of living.\n  Second, simple as it sounds, we are going to ask parents to take care \nof their children. We stress personal responsibility. I can predict \nthat across this land, as millions of welfare recipients who are not \nworking and have children get jobs, guess who will be the happiest \nabout it? Their children. For they do not like it any more than anyone \nelse that they are locked in, and so are their parents, in poverty.\n\n  Third, we are going to change the culture of welfare. How obvious it \nis--had we changed this culture a few decades ago and said the \nprinciple of welfare is a short-lived assistance while you attempt to \nget a job and take care of yourself, we would not have the welfare \nproblem we have in America today.\n  Fourth, we will end the futile and cumbersome regulations of the \nFederal Government and its bureaucrats who set such stringent \nrequirements that they assume a degree of arbitrariness that people \ncannot even make sense of getting on and off of welfare, and those \nrunning them in the State governments are constantly looking through \nfive volumes of regulations to see just what they can do.\n  Fifth, and finally, and this should not go in any sheepish manner as \nif we are embarrassed to say it, we are going to save money. What is \nwrong with that? The taxpayers of America have been paying for a \nprogram that does not work. They will be paying now for a program that \nat least has a chance of working.\n  I am very hopeful those leaders, including the Catholic hierarchy of \nAmerica, who I generally talk to and seek advice from, I am hopeful \nthat they understand there is a lot more to welfare reform and to \ntrying to help the poor people than to continue programs that exchange \nmoney and give them benefits, for they, too, may find them more \nresponsible and more independent and doing for themselves. I believe \nthis has a chance of working, and I think when we adopt it tonight, it \nis going to be historic.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a detailed analysis of the savings to \nthe Federal budget in all categories, made by June O'Neill, dated \nAugust 1 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 1996.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     has reviewed the Conference Report on H.R. 3734, the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996. The bill would replace federal payments under the \n     current Aid to Families with Dependent Children program with \n     a block grant to states, restrict the eligibility of legal \n     aliens for welfare benefits, modify the benefits and \n     eligibility requirements in the Food Stamp program, increase \n     funding for child care programs, and tighten the eligibility \n     requirements for disabled children under the Supplemental \n     Security Income program.\n       Although the estimate assumes that the bill will be enacted \n     by September 1, 1996, its impact on direct spending and \n     revenues in 1996 is estimated to be negligible. The bill \n     would reduce federal spending by $3.0 billion in 1997 and by \n     $54.1 billion over the 1997-2002 period, as well as increase \n     revenues by $60 million and $394 million over these \n     respective periods. Detailed tables are enclosed. For the \n     most part, the underlying assumptions and methodology are \n     described in CBO's estimates for the House- and Senate-\n     reported versions of the bill (see House Report 104-651 and \n     Senate Print 104-59).\n       In addition to its federal budgetary impacts, the bill \n     would have a significant impact on the budgets of state, \n     local, and tribal governments. A statement on the \n     intergovernmental and private-sector mandates in the bill is \n     also enclosed.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n\nSUMMARY TABLE.--FEDERAL BUDGET EFFECTS OF H.R. 3734, THE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORK OPPORTUNITY RECONCILIATION ACT

greater funding for similar activities is restored in Title VI.       \nbStates have the option to begin to operate under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Block Grant any time after enactment of this bill. A few  \n  states may opt to do so in FY 1996 creating small savings in the AFDC, Emergency Assistance, and JOBS programs and small costs in the TANF program.   \nc The bill appropriates $2 billion for the contingency fund for use in years 1997 through 2001. The estimate shows costs of the contingency fund in 2002\n  because section 257(b)(2) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 requires that the baseline shall assume that mandatory     \n  programs greater than $50 million dollars are continued.                                                                                              \nd The bill retains categorical eligibility for Medicaid for families that meet the eligibility criteria for Aid to Families with Dependent Children as  \n  they are in current law.                                                                                                                              \n\n\n\n    FEDERAL BUDGET EFFECTS OF H.R. 3734, THE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORK OPPORTUNITY RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1996; TITLE II--SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY   \n                   INCOME; AS ORDERED REPORTED BY THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE ON JULY 31, 1996; ASSUMES ENACTMENT BY SEPTEMBER 1, 1996                  \n                                                        [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]                                                        \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                                                 7-year \n                                                                     1996       1997       1998       1999       2000       2001       2002      total  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDirect Spending:                                                                                                                                        \n    SSI Benefits to Certain Children:                                                                                                                   \n        Supplemental Security Income:                                                                                                                   \n            Budget Authority....................................

The bill does not, however, directly appropriate that money. Its        \n  availability remains contingent on future appropriation action. In addition to those one-time costs of $250 million or more, the bill would require   \n  that most disabled children who qualify even under the tighter eligibility criteria be reviewed every 3 years to see if their medical condition has   \n  improved. That cost, which CBO estimates at about $100 million a year beginning in 1998, could be met by raising the caps on discretionary spending as\n  permitted in P.L. 104-121. The cap adjustment in that law, however, was designed to cover periodic reviews and not the heavy volume of one-time       \n  reviews that would be mandated in 1997 by this legislation.                                                                                           \nd The provision would encourage prison officials to exchange data with SSA by paying them up to $400 for providing information that helps to identify   \n  each inmate who receives SSI (and whose benefits should therefore be suspended). In the course of checking that information, SSA would find that some \n  inmates collect OASDI. Therefore, although the language makes no mention of OASDI, savings in that program would result.                              \n\n\n\n FEDERAL BUDGET EFFECTS OF H.R. 3734, THE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY

Appropriations Act which \n  cleared the Congress before this bill cleared, contained a similar provision.                                                                         \nb Any proceeds from this provision would be used to reimburse law enforcement agencies or for retail compliance investigations. Thus, CBO estimates no  \n  net effect on the federal budget, though funds could be received in one year and not spent until a later year.                                        \nc This provision is included elsewhere in the bill. If the exemption from Regulation ``e'' were not enacted, there likely would be costs to the federal \n  government. CBO estimates these costs would be small.                                                                                                 \n

on Taxation. Components may not sum to totals because of rounding.                                          \n\n    Congressional Budget Office: Conference Agreement on H.R. 3754, \nEstimated Cost of Intergovernmental and Private Sector Mandates, August \n                                1, 1996\n\n\n                       intergovernmental mandates\n\n       CBO cannot determine if the bill contains intergovernmental \n     mandates that would impose costs exceeding the $50 million \n     threshold established in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of \n     1995 (Public Law 104-4). At issue is a provision dealing with \n     an increase in child poverty.\n       Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). The bill \n     would require a state to carry out a corrective action plan \n     if it determines that the rate of child poverty increases by \n     five percent in a given year as a result of carrying out its \n     new program for needy families. Depending on how this \n     requirement is enforced, it may constitute a mandate when it \n     is combined with the reduction in federal funding for needy \n     families and the work requirements of the bill. Under the \n     work requirements, a state would be required to have 50 \n     percent of certain families that are receiving assistance in \n     work activities by fiscal year 2002.\n       Under Public Law 104-4, an increase in the stringency of \n     conditions of assistance or a\n\n[[Page S9413]]\n\n     reduction in federal funding for an entitlement program under \n     which the federal government spends more than $500 million \n     annually is considered a mandate only if state, local, or \n     tribal governments lack the authority under that program to \n     amend their own financial or programmatic responsibilities to \n     continue providing required services.\n       The bill does not specify how this child-poverty \n     requirement would be enforced. On the one hand, if a state \n     would be allowed simply to submit a corrective action plan \n     but would not be required to take action to reduce child \n     poverty, then the requirement, by itself or in combination \n     with the other changes, would not constitute a mandate \n     because the state would have the flexibility to reduce \n     caseloads and benefit levels in response to the federal \n     requirements and reduced federal funding. On the other hand, \n     if the bill would require a state to reduce child poverty \n     (and a mechanism was developed to enforce that requirement) \n     then it may constitute a mandate when it is combined with the \n     funding reductions contained in the bill and the work \n     requirements.\n       Even if the requirement is stringently enforced, however, \n     states may still have sufficient flexibility to meet all the \n     requirements of the bill without devoting more state funds to \n     the TANF program. States, not an outside party, would \n     determine whether the rate of child poverty has increased by \n     5 percent. In addition, the majority of people currently \n     receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Child (the program \n     that TANF would replace) are already in poverty, so that rate \n     of child poverty might not increase significantly even if \n     these people lose benefits.\n       Child support. The bill would mandate changes in the \n     operation and financing of the state child enforcement \n     systems. The primary changes include using new enforcement \n     techniques, eliminating a current $50 payment to welfare \n     recipients for whom child support is collected, and allowing \n     former public assistance recipients to keep a greater share \n     of their support collections. The net savings from these \n     mandates would exceed the costs by $200 million to $500 \n     million annually over the next six years.\n       Restricting Welfare and Public Benefits for Aliens and \n     Supplemental Security Income. CBO estimates that the new \n     mandates contained in the portion of the bill titled \n     Restricting Welfare and Public Benefits for Aliens would not \n     be significant. However, the bill would reduce the size of an \n     existing mandate. Current law requires states that supplement \n     federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) either to maintain \n     their supplemental payments levels at or above 1983 amounts \n     or to maintain their annual expenditures at a level at least \n     equal to the level from the previous years. Once a state \n     elects to supplement SSI, federal law requires it to continue \n     in order to remain eligible for Medicaid payments. Because \n     the bill would restrict eligibility for SSI, primarily for \n     aliens and disabled children, states would no longer have to \n     maintain their supplements for these individuals. CBO \n     estimates that states could save roughly $750 million \n     annually by fiscal year 1998.\n       Other Titles. Two other titles of the bill--Child Nutrition \n     and Food Stamps--contain intergovernmental mandates, but the \n     total cost of the mandates would be significantly less than \n     the $50 million threshold.\n\n\n                        PRIVATE SECTOR MANDATES\n\n       The bill contains several private sector mandates as \n     defined in Public Law 104-4. CBO estimates that the direct \n     cost to the private sector of those provisions would be $65 \n     million in fiscal year 1997 and would total about $1.0 \n     billion over the five-year period from 1997 through 2001, as \n     shown in the following table.\n\n                                       [Fiscal year (dollars in millions)]                                      \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       1997     1998     1999     2000     2001 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRequirement on Employers...........................................  .......      $10      $10      $10      $10\nRequirement on Sponsors of New Immigrants..........................       $5       20       55      195      400\nChanges in the Earned Income Credit................................       60       61       62       65       68\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Requirement on Employers. The child support provisions of \n     the bill include a requirement that employers provide \n     information on all new employees to new-hire directories \n     maintained by the states. This provision would impose a \n     direct cost on private sector employers of approximately $10 \n     million per year once it became effective in 1998. Based on \n     data from the Bureau of the Census, CBO estimates that \n     private employers hire over 30 million new workers each year. \n     Even so, the cost to private employers of complying with this \n     mandate would be expected to be relatively small. Many states \n     already require some or all employers to provide this \n     information, so that a federal mandate would only impose \n     additional costs on a subset of employers. In addition, \n     employers could comply with the mandate by simply mailing or \n     faxing a copy of the worker's W-4 form to the state agency, \n     or by transmitting the information electronically.\n       Requirement on Sponsors of New Immigrants. The bill would \n     also impose a new requirement on individuals who sign \n     affidavits of support for legal immigrants by making future \n     affidavits legally binding. This requirement would impose a \n     direct cost on the sponsors estimated to be $5 million in \n     1997, rising to $400 million in 2001. This estimate \n     represents the additional cost to sponsors of providing the \n     support to immigrants that would be required under the bill. \n     The added costs are larger after the first three years \n     because of the new responsibility sponsors would have to \n     provide support after a three-year deeming period.\n       Changes in the Earned Income Credit. Finally, the bill \n     would make several changes in the Earned Income Credit. The \n     bill would modify adjusted gross income by disregarding \n     certain losses, expand the definition of disqualified income \n     and index the threshold, and strengthen compliance. The Joint \n     Committee on Taxation estimates that the direct mandate cost \n     of these changes would be $60 million in 1997, increasing to \n     $68 million in 2001. These estimates include only the revenue \n     effect of the changes in the credit, and not the effect on \n     federal outlays.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe the Democratic leader is on his \nway and will be prepared to close on that side, and I will go \nimmediately following that.\n  Until he arrives, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, after 18 months, we are about to pass \nwelfare reform. It has been a long, divisive debate about the direction \nour Nation will follow on fundamental social policy. The initial bill, \napproved by the House last year, I think, by virtually any standard, \nwas an extreme piece of legislation. As a result, it enjoyed very \nlittle public support. Twice the President vetoed extreme legislation, \nand that resulted in far more bipartisan cooperation in the ensuing \nmonths.\n  It is clear that there is a consensus on many concepts relating to \nwelfare reform. Most of us believe the current system is not working, \nthat welfare must be reformed, that welfare as a way of life must end. \nThere is a consensus about the need for work, that able-bodied people \nshould work, that there should not be welfare for those who are \nunwilling to work. There is a consensus about the need to allow States \nflexibility and a recognition that South Dakota is different from New \nYork and different from California. There is a consensus that the lack \nof child care is a major barrier to work, that States need to provide \nadequate funds to help parents afford it, that the current law with \nregard to health and safety standards must be maintained and even \nimproved, and that child care needs to become more available and \ncertainly more affordable.\n  So there are points on which there is common ground and a great deal \nof agreement. The welfare debate has come a long way since those early \nmonths when the President felt compelled to veto that extreme \nlegislation. There have been many areas where bipartisan progress in \nreducing the barriers that I have just discussed has been made. The \ndebate began on welfare reform with not $1 for child care money, with \nnot $1 for child care to be provided under any circumstances. Now, in \nthis legislation, there is $14 billion to assist parents' efforts to \nsecure child care.\n  The debate began over a House bill with absolutely no guarantee of \nMedicaid coverage for families under any circumstances. Now families \nmoving from welfare to work will continue to receive health care during \na 1-year transition period.\n  We have made bipartisan progress in other areas, too. This bill \nimproves the Nation's child support enforcement system. It improves the \nNation's supplemental security program for the disabled children of our \ncountry. We dropped the proposals to block grant food stamps and \neliminate the national nutrition safety net, and we dropped proposals \nto block grant child abuse funds, which would have undermined our \nNation's child protection system.\n  So, Mr. President, this bill does represent progress. In these areas, \nand in others, I think it is fair to say that we have come a good \ndistance. But in a democracy everybody has to make their own \nassessment. We have our own internal comfort zone. We have our own \nsense of what is right. From phone calls I have received from my State \nof South Dakota, and letters I received from across the country, the \nviews are as diverse outside Washington as they are here in the Senate.\n  Every Senator, every Representative, and the President of the United \nStates must make his or her own judgment\n\n[[Page S9414]]\n\nand draw his or her own lines. It is better than when we started. We \nbegan having a threshold for which there could be agreement and \nconsensus on items that I have discussed. Thoughtful people will \ndisagree about where we go from here, how we can assess that progress, \nand whether or not this marks enough progress to stop now. For many, \nincluding this Senator, it is a tough call.\n  There is no crystal ball. Nobody can predict with certainty the \neffect of this bill. It will improve, in some ways, the welfare system \nthat we have right now. I think that is a given. But will it help move \nwelfare recipients to work? We can only hope that it does. Will it \nensure that children are protected? We can only hope that it does.\n  Is there a guaranteed safety net for children in the future? On that \nanswer, in my view, Mr. President, the answer is not even hopeful. The \nanswer, in my view, is no. Is this the last point? Is this the only \npoint? There are others. But the fact is that this important issue \naffecting 100 percent of the future population is not resolved. On that \nissue, we can do better.\n  We all want reform. We want to require people to work. But we also \nwant to protect children who can't protect themselves.\n  We have to be careful to balance those goals. The need a meaningful \nsafety net for children--a guarantee that they will not pay for the \nmistakes or circumstances of their parents--ought to be paramount for \nevery one of us as we make our decision tonight.\n  Mr. President, we need vouchers to ensure children's basic needs are \nmet when their parents reach the time limits, and you can't find \nvouchers in this bill--not to any meaningful extent. We need a \ncontingency for emergencies. When we went through the last recession, \nthis country drew down more than $6 billion in emergency AFDC funds an \n18-month period. These were the resources necessary to provide the \nsafety net, especially for children who otherwise had nothing--$6 \nbillion. You know what is in this bill? We have about $2 billion in \ncontingency funds. We may be more than $4 billion underfunded the next \ntime we have a recession in this country. Then what happens?\n  The level of nutrition cuts continue to concern me as well. I am not \ncomfortable reducing food stamp benefits for families with children who \npay more than 50 percent of their income in rent. We do not treat the \nelderly that way, and we should not. And we should not treat children \nthat way, either. Nutrition cuts have nothing to do with work, nothing \nto do with reforming welfare. It is an attack on the essential \nnutritional safety net in this country, and we ought to recognize it as \nthat.\n  I support strong work requirements. But the work requirements in this \nbill are inadequately funded. This is something that we ought to be \nconcerned about, and the Congressional Budget Office says that most \nStates in the country, when this legislation passes, will fail to meet \nthe work requirements. They will not even be close.\n  We all agree that the lack of affordable child care is a barrier to \nwork. The Senate and House bills said mothers with elementary school \nchildren could not be sanctioned or terminated from assistance if they \ndon't find child care or cannot afford it, but the conference bill \nprecludes sanctions only for mothers with children under 6. The \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut addressed this point earlier \nthis afternoon. I am concerned that this is an impossible choice for \nmothers. A mother's choice is to go to work in order to receive \nassistance, leaving a child of 7 or 8 alone after school, or not to go \nto work and lose the help she needs to feed and clothe her child. What \na choice. Mr. President, that is not a choice that you and I and the \nrest of this body can be comfortable with.\n  Frankly, I am very troubled about the treatment of legal immigrants. \nThere is no assistance for illegal immigrants, and perhaps that is \nappropriate. But this bill attacks legal immigrants. I am not talking \nabout those who cross our borders in the dead of night. Individuals who \nhave followed the rules, paid taxes in this country, and gone to fight \nin other parts of the world for this country are now going to be told \nthat there is nothing, no help whatsoever, even when they desperately \nneed it through no fault of their own.\n  It was 100 years ago that my grandparents came to this country with \nthe promise of 160 acres of soil. They came with a lot of hopes and \ndreams about what this country could provide for them and their \ngrandchildren and for all of the Daschles to follow. They came here for \nfreedom. They came here in the belief that this would be a better life. \nWe joked about the Government betting you 160 acres of land that you \ncould not survive it on for 5 years in South Dakota. If you could \nsurvive for 5 years, it was yours. They got off the railroad, they \nbuilt a sod house, and survived. But the Government gave them the \nopportunity to survive, gave them the license to be Americans, and I am \nhere 100 years later because that happened.\n  We do not have any more land to give, but I sure hope we can still \ngive dreams. I hope that there are still people out there who believe \nthat the freedom that they can find in this great country of ours, for \nall of the things this country can provide, ought to be ample reason to \ncome to this country and give it their best.\n\n  But we are saying we are not going to help you; we are going to \npunish you if you even try. That is not American. My grandparents could \nnot have come with this law in effect 100 years ago.\n  So, Mr. President, it is with some sadness that we have come to the \nconclusion that we cannot do better than this. But we are going to pass \nthis legislation tonight with the understanding that there are some \nvery severe deficiencies. Is it an improvement over what we passed a \nyear ago? Yes. Can we do better? I think we all know in our heart of \nhearts that the answer to that is also yes.\n  I hope that we can agree when it is signed into law that we will go \nback, without much time to waste, and attempt as best as we can to fix \nthose deficiencies so we do not punish children, so we do not send the \nwrong message to people who want to be Americans, so we recognize that \nthis country is still all that it can be, so we can work together to \nmake it an even better one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we have some 2\\1/2\\ minutes left, \nand beyond that I will use my leader time.\n  Mr. President, over the years we have watched a program that we \nstarted some 60 years ago with very good intentions to help the weak \nand the genuinely poor people in this country to be able to get some \ndegree of temporary assistance to help them exist.\n  We have watched over the years as the taxpayers of this country \nworked hard to try to look after their families, tried to get clothes \nto put their children in school, and pay their taxes. Then they began \nto wonder, who was thinking about them? Because they saw this program \ncontinue to grow and build, and they saw it continue to cost more and \nmore billions of dollars, and they saw abuses. Then they started to \nworry. What about the children that are getting locked into this system \nof welfare dependency?\n  Over the years it moved in that direction--to where we have \ndisaffection on all sides; those who pay the bills for the welfare \nprogram and those who are on the program. People ask: Who is it really \nhelping? Is it really giving people a lift out of poverty, or it is it \nlocking them in? Does it really help the children when the parents are \nnot able to get a job, they do not have the training, the education, \nnor the day care to be able to really get a job? Who is the real loser? \nThe children have become the losers of this program. It has become a \nprogram of dependency without a way out. That is what this bill is \nreally about.\n  I am happy that the Senate is about to take this final action on this \nmonumental accomplishment, a bipartisan accomplishment on a bill that \nis entitled ``Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of \n1996.'' We call it welfare reform, but that is the real title. That is \nwhat it is really about--personal responsibility; taking advantage of \nthe program when you really need it on a temporary basis, to give you \nan opportunity to exercise your responsibilities and get off the system \nand get into a job--work opportunity. That is the American way; to have \nan\n\n[[Page S9415]]\n\nopportunity to get what you need temporarily with training to go out \nand get a job and look after your family.\n  It has been a long haul with more than a few dead-ends. But we stuck \nwith it. We forged the kind of compromises that were needed to move it \nahead, and at last we have come to our destination: ending the \ndestructive welfare cycle. That is what this is all about.\n  There is more than enough credit to go around. But I think special \ntribute clearly should be given to the Senator from Delaware, Senator \nRoth. He has pulled off a gold medal performance this week. He was lead \nchairman on the welfare reform bill. He was the chairman that \nnegotiated the agreement on the small business tax relief bill, and he \nwas the lead participant in the health insurance reform legislation; a \ntremendous week. We are all indebted to Senator Roth for that great \nwork. I know it has been exhausting, but I know you are extremely proud \nof the accomplishment that you have in this bill and those other bills.\n  Of course, the venerable chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, hangs in there. It was going to be maybe just a few hours and \nthen it looked like it was going to be the full 10 hours. He has to do \nit over and over again. He has been a partner with the Senator from \nDelaware. They have done a great job. He is the most knowledgeable \nMember that we have on how we deal with these budget issues.\n  Senator Nickles, at my request, was representative of the leadership \nin a lot of the negotiations. That youngster from Pennsylvania, Senator \nRick Santorum, he was great. He came to the floor one night. He did his \njob. He knew his subject matter. He has been working on it for 2 \nyears--actually longer than that. I guess about 4 years. He really \nknows the intricacies of this bill. It has been bipartisan, House and \nSenate. The vote in the House, 328 to 101. That looks mighty broad to \nme in its support and its bipartisanship.\n  In the Senate, Senator Breaux was involved and helpful as we went \nalong. Senator Lieberman, I read his article, I believe, in a New York \nnewspaper last week, an excellent article. So I think we have truly \nmade this bipartisan. It is an effort of which we can be proud.\n  Also, I have to say this. A lot of credit goes to the man whom I \nsucceeded as majority leader. Bob Dole worked on this effort, pushed \nthis effort, would not let it end, helped get it through, not once but \ntwice, and was committed to getting it done again this year for the \nthird time. Without his leadership, without his determination, without \nhis commitment, we would not be here tonight passing this welfare \nreform package. In my opinion, it should truly be called the Dole \nWelfare Reform Package.\n  The last time I spoke on the Senate floor about welfare, I expressed \nthe hope then that President Clinton would not again veto the reform \nbill that we had come up with on welfare. And I did have an opportunity \nover the past 2 weeks to talk with him about it. There were some \nchanges made that he had hoped for in the bill, and so I am, frankly, \ngreatly satisfied that he has announced he will, indeed, sign this bill \ninto law.\n  So now our country begins a great transition. It will be complicated \nand difficult and probably will require fine tuning on our part in the \nfuture, but we have made a start. We have made a commitment. We signed \non to the blueprint for the most profound restructuring of public \nassistance since the New Deal.\n  This legislation will end the Federal entitlement to welfare and \nreplace it with block grants to the States. All by itself, that makes \nthis landmark legislation. But the flexibility for the States and the \nGovernors, I think, will work well. They are close to the problems. \nThey will be able to use the money where it is needed the greatest to \nhelp the people who need it the most.\n  More than that, for the first time ever we are legislatively imposing \ntime limits on the receipt of welfare on an endless basis, and for the \nfirst time ever we are applying a meaningful work requirement that can \nhelp recipients make the move--and we know it is not always an easy \none--from dependence to independence.\n  That is what we desire and we hope for all Americans. This bill \nresponds to a consensus among the American people by ending most \nwelfare for noncitizens. It strengthens our child support enforcement \nand paternity establishment requirements. It combats fraud and abuse of \nwelfare programs and will save the taxpayers about $54.5 billion over \nthe next 6 years.\n  We can be proud of this package, and we can build on it in the months \nahead as we seek to improve Medicaid and other programs of assistance \nto the needy. We are going to be working with the Governors to make \nsure that this bill sets the pattern for a new era of cooperation \nbetween the States and the Federal Government.\n  Again, I thank everyone whose diligence and patience brought us this \nfar. There is an old saying: ``Well begun is only half done.'' Today, \nthe herculean task of comprehensive welfare reform is, indeed, well \nbegun and much more than half done.\n  With the lessons we have learned in this effort, we can finish the \njob for the benefit of both the taxpayers of America and the poor in \nthe months ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know that Senators are waiting to see what \nmight be the schedule for the remainder of the evening. There are a \nnumber of discussions underway now on a number of issues that we would \nlike to get completed before we leave this weekend.\n  I want to say again tonight, as I did this morning, I really think \nthat the last 2 days have involved a lot of tremendous legislative good \nwork by Members on both sides of the aisle. I do not ever recall having \never seen as many bipartisan conferences in as many places at one time \nas yesterday.\n  Yesterday morning, I really didn't think it would be possible to \nreach an agreement on the conference report on health insurance reform, \non safe drinking water, and, of course, we already reached agreement on \nwelfare reform, and before the night was out, even the small business \ntax relief package and minimum wage. It looks like there will be an \nagreement also on illegal immigration.\n  I don't know exactly when all of those will move, but it is my \nfervent hope that all that work will not be for nought before we leave. \nWe would like to be able to bring up some appropriations conference \nreports that have been completed. The legislative appropriations \nconference report is ready. We hope to be able to get to the military \nconstruction appropriations conference report, if not tonight, \ntomorrow.\n  That probably will require a vote, since we didn't vote on it when it \nwent through earlier, and the District of Columbia appropriations \nconference report will also probably require a vote.\n  We would like to do those either tonight or in the morning. And we \nwould like to also get the conference reports that have been agreed to: \nthe health insurance conference report, the safe drinking water \nconference report, the small business tax relief package with minimum \nwage, and if there are other conference reports that could become \navailable later on. The Department of Defense authorization conference \nreport is available, too.\n  So we have several conference reports that we could get done tonight \nor tomorrow with just a little cooperation. There are some nominations \nthat we think we can move forward. We have been working on those today. \nI think we can get some of those moved. So it is my hope that we could \nget those done.\n  Also, I would want to move to the HUD-VA appropriations bill. I know \nthe chairman is here, Senator Bond, who has been very patiently waiting \nhis appropriations opportunity. The Senator from Maryland is here ready \nto go. So if we could have a few unanimous-consent requests and work \nthrough those, then we would try to go to the HUD-VA appropriations \nbill.\n  I just want to make the Members aware of that. We need to have some \nadditional discussions here in the next few minutes. If we could come \nto some agreements, then we should be able to notify the Members within \n30 minutes what they can expect for the remainder of the evening and \nwhether or not there would be any recorded votes tonight.\n  I would be prepared to yield the floor and observe the absence of a \nquorum, Mr. President, where we could work on a couple issues, and we \nwould let the Members know as soon as possible thereafter. I yield the \nfloor, Mr. President, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do not believe we have been able to come \nto a satisfactory resolution of some of our concerns that Senators have \non both sides of the aisle. We have had a very productive week and a \ngood day. It is already 20 until 9. I know several Senators have had \nother things on their minds today, so I do not see any sense in \npressing the point too far tonight.\n  I do feel constrained to ask for at least two unanimous-consent \nrequests. We will see what happens. Then, depending on that, we will be \nable to make some further announcement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9416-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--CONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOMPANY H.R. 3754\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with regard to the legislative branch \nappropriations conference report, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now turn to the conference report to accompany H.R. 3754, the \nlegislative branch appropriations bill, that the conference report be \nconsidered as having been read and agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. You did object? All right.\n  Mr. President, we have been hoping to go to the HUD-VA appropriations \nbill for over a week now, but because we were assured on various bills \nthat they would take just a short period of time, we have been able to \nmove through eight appropriations bills. I appreciate the success we \nhave had with that. But this is the one that we need to go to and get \ndone so that we do not have to have a Saturday session. It is my intent \nto complete this bill even if it does involve going to a Saturday \nsession.\n\n  It would be nice if we could put that down tonight so that the \nchairman and the ranking member could get some work done. But we can do \nthat tomorrow, and then we can finish up or we can work on that on \nSaturday. It is already in my mind that we are going to be here \nSaturday. So I have been feeling all day that this is really kind of \nWednesday, and so tomorrow is only Thursday by my body clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9416-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9416-S9418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3666\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nturn to the consideration of the HUD-VA appropriations bill, H.R. 3666.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, and the majority leader \nhas been working in very good faith. I appreciate it.\n  I just let my colleagues know that this is not my first choice, but \nmonth after month after month I have been very patient. The last \nseveral weeks I have been very patient. I think the majority leader \nwould be the first person to say I have worked through the process.\n  We have a very gifted judge, Hennepin County Judge Ann Montgomery. I \nthought there was a clear agreement that she would be cleared last \nnight. That did not happen. It is not my choice that somebody objected. \nI have heard no substantive reasons given to that objection, and that \nis why I object to moving forward.\n  I am going to fight very hard for Ann Montgomery because she is an \nimmensely talented, gifted judge, with broad support in Minnesota, \nbroad support in the legal community. What has been going on here is \njust or fair to her. That is why I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond, first, let me announce \nthat was the last vote tonight. There will be no further votes tonight. \nWe will begin tomorrow morning at 10:30 on Friday morning.\n  I think all the Members know I have been trying to work through these \njudges. We have, I think, cleared 16 judges from across the country. \nSome of them had some problems. We were able to look into those \nproblems, and\n\n[[Page S9417]]\n\nSenators have spent time working through those lists. That is how we \nhave been able to move 16 of them. We are working on another one right \nnow. I think maybe it will be cleared.\n  Let me emphasize this: Judges quite often are somewhat controversial. \nSenators have different views on that. Senators have a right to express \nthemselves on it. The time may come when we will have to move some of \nthese judges. My approach is always to see what the problems are and \nsee if we can work through them. We will keep working on this one. I am \nhoping maybe tomorrow we can satisfy concerns.\n  Sometimes what happens with these, it is not just the judge, but it \ngets involved with other issues, other legislative issues, and you have \nto deal with those problems before you can deal with the next problem.\n  We worked on that. I think we made real progress. The Senate, I \nthink, would have to acknowledge that I have worked steadily at it. I \nthink we have approved an average of at least one a day for the last 3 \nweeks.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have been here a little while, and I cannot remember \nanybody objecting to moving to an appropriations bill because they did \nnot get a judge confirmed.\n  I will give one example. I remember we had a judge in Oklahoma that I \nwas trying to get confirmed in 1992 and the Democrats were in control \nof the Senate. George Mitchell was the majority leader. I kept trying \nto get the judge moved, the nomination moved. The nominee was Frank \nKeating. There was no opponent, but we kept having a hold. To make the \nstory short, we never could get his nomination placed before the \nSenate. He would have been an outstanding judge. There was kind of a \nroving hold on it, primarily inspired by my good friend and colleague \nfrom Ohio, Senator Metzenbaum, who is no longer with us.\n  The point being, we had an outstanding person, but we did not hold up \nany appropriations bill. We did fuss about it, and we groaned about it, \nand maybe griped about it, but I want to thank Senator Metzenbaum for \nputting a hold on Frank Keating because he is now the Governor of \nOklahoma.\n\n  Judges have been held for different reasons, maybe good reasons, \nmaybe bad reasons, but a lot of times it happens. However, I am not \nfamiliar with the holding of major pieces of legislation, particularly \nappropriations bills, hostage. I hope we are able to work through this \nand do our bills. We know we have to do the appropriations bills, and I \nam hopeful we will be able to move forward.\n  I congratulate the majority leader and the minority leader. I think \nthis week has been a very constructive week. The welfare bill that just \npassed is certainly historic, and the legislation that we will have \nbefore the Senate tomorrow dealing with health care, dealing with small \nbusiness tax relief, is also very important. I hope we will be able to \ncomplete that as well.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the distinguished chairman of the HUD, VA \nAppropriations Subcommittee, if he would like to make a comment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the efforts of the \nmajority leader. I assure you that the ranking member, Senator \nMikulski, and I have worked long and hard with many Members to \naccommodate the interests Members have. We were prepared to negotiate \ntime agreements so we could move this expeditiously.\n  The matters involved in this bill include the funding for the \nVeterans Administration, the funding for the Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, funding for EPA--there seems to be a great deal of concern \nabout drinking water facilities; those funds are appropriated in this \nbill--Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, National Science \nFoundation. It had been our hope that by working with and being \nresponsive to the concerns of Members on both sides of the aisle, with \nrespect to what is, frankly, a very complicated bill, that we could \nwrap this up so we would not have to impinge upon any Saturday or \nSunday activities that our colleagues may have.\n  Mr. President, that is why I am deeply disappointed. The ranking \nmember and I have been ready since last Wednesday to go forward on this \nbill. It is a complicated bill. I had hoped we would be able to go \ntonight. I am very disappointed, personally, and for the agencies and \nthe people working with us.\n  Let me say at this point that we have worked together prior to the \nbill coming to the floor. The ranking member and I have agreed that we \ncan accept a significant number of amendments that have been presented \nto our staff. If there are other amendments, we ask Senators to bring \nthem to us or to our staffs tonight so we may determine if we can \naccept them or work with the Members to gain accommodation on them.\n  I have approved, as has my colleague, a number of colloquies that \nwill be ready to go if we are able to move to this bill tomorrow. I \nthink there are perhaps three or four issues which would require a \nvote, and we would like to work with the leadership and get short-time \nagreements on these votes, reserving everybody the right to submit \nadditional comments for the Record so we can handle this in an \nexpeditious manner. We understand how controversial the issues can be. \nWe think we can deal with it in a timely fashion.\n  I ask that people who do have amendments, questions, colloquies, \nplease contact us tonight and perhaps we can move expeditiously \ntomorrow.\n\n  I share the leader's disappointment that we are not able to do this \ntonight. With cooperation in bringing the amendments to us tonight, \nperhaps we can deal with the issues in a timely fashion tomorrow.\n  I thank the majority leader, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will take just 1 minute. I know the minority leader \nwants to speak on this.\n  Let me just say I heard the word ``controversial'' used. Judge Ann \nMontgomery has the support of both Senators from Minnesota. She has the \nbroadest possible support in the legal community, the highest possible \nmarks from the ABA. She is imminently qualified.\n  I would be more than pleased for someone to move this. I do not ask \nfor unanimous consent, although I think that is the best way to do it. \nI would be willing to debate this nominee with anybody.\n  Just to be very clear, as far as the delay, I was not the one that \nput the hold on Judge Montgomery. I am not the one that has objected to \nmoving forward. Other Senators have. I am just doing what any Senator \nwould do from any State, which is that I am fighting hard for a woman \nwho richly deserves to be Federal district judge. There is no reason in \nthe world why anybody should be trying to stop this. This woman came \nout of committee back in March. She has been waiting and waiting and \nwaiting, and I have patiently worked through the process.\n  I am absolutely convinced the majority leader is working in good \nfaith, and I look forward to working this out tomorrow. I apologize to \nmy colleague from Missouri, who is a friend whom I respect. I am not \nthe one that has delayed this.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we don't need to rehash all the history \non this. I think it is fair to say that there has been a tremendous \namount of cooperation this month. I pledged my efforts to the new \nmajority leader when he became leader and indicated that I wanted to \nwork with him. I think that fact has now been well-documented. The \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire was in the chair last night, \nand I applaud him for his willingness to preside at late hours. As he \nwas presiding last night, it seems to me that the cooperation stopped.\n  Before last night, we had another indication of the degree to which \nwe were going to work on both sides to move things along, with the \nclear understanding on both sides that we had to finish the executive \ncalendar on judgeships this month. The distinguished majority leader \nsaid that he would try to help us get that done. I said I would try to \nwork with you to accommodate all of the specific pieces of legislation \nthat need to be addressed so long as we can continue to work in good \nfaith toward those ends. Last night, it stopped.\n  So, Mr. President, we have no choice but to continue to find a way \nwith which to resolve this impasse. We need to finish the four circuit \ncourt judges,\n\n[[Page S9418]]\n\nplus the other district judges that remain on the executive calendar \nthis week.\n  The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma made a good point that there \nhave been holds in the past on individual judges. I will not deny that. \nBut I think it is important that we emphasize that, in 1992, under \nsimilar circumstances, the majority at that time, the Democratic \nmajority, confirmed 66 district and circuit judges. On July 1 of this \nyear, not one, zero judges had been confirmed. Now we have confirmed, I \nbelieve, 16. So we are making progress. But we can't be expected to \nallow the balance that we had agreed to to be disrupted. If we can \ncontinue to find ways to cooperate and work together, all of the pieces \nof legislation that the distinguished majority leader mentioned, I \nthink, are possible. Realistically, I don't think we are going to be \nable to do the VA-HUD bill this week, but I do believe that all of the \nconference reports and things that the majority leader mentioned are \nthings we ought to be able to work together to achieve before we \nrecess. But we have to get those judges done, as we earlier agreed to \ndo. If we can do the judges, we can do the legislation. That balance is \nsomething that I think we have made very clear from the beginning. I \nhope we can work together to make that happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9416-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9418-S9420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the majority leader would help \nus out a bit with this question. It was my understanding that, early in \nJuly, the majority leader had indicated an intention to work through \nall of the judges on the calendar, and that if there was an objection, \nthe objection would be required to be stated, and then the majority \nleader would attempt to move to the confirmation of each of the judges \non this calendar. I am particularly interested in a court of appeals \njudge, Eric Clay, from Michigan, who has the support of both Senators \nfrom Michigan. I know the majority leader has spoken to my colleague, \nSenator Abraham, and me about Mr. Clay.\n  My question is this: Is it still the hope of the majority leader to \ncall each of the names of the judges that are on the calendar and see \nif there is an objection, and if there is, to move to the confirmation \nof each of the circuit court judges, as well as district court judges, \non this calendar? Is that still the intention of the majority leader \nbefore we recess?\n  Mr. LOTT. It is my intent to continue to try to work through these \nmatters. I never indicated, in any way, that I could guarantee that we \nwould get them all done. There are objections to some of them, and \nmultiple objections to some of them. But I will continue to work on \nthem one at a time, because you can't work six or seven at a time. It \nhas worked pretty well. And I am working on that one. I have talked to \nthe other Senator from Michigan, Senator Abraham, about this judge. We \nare looking into what might be the problems and what might be done. Let \nme say this. Circuit judges are viewed very differently than district \njudges for a lot of reasons, and we can discuss that some other night. \nBut that is not to say that we will not continue to work on it.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator from Michigan yield to me for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I really want to thank the majority leader for doing all \nthis. I want to make the point to the Senator from Texas, and others \nwho have problems with this, that you are talking about real people \nwhen you stand here late at night and object. Sometimes we forget that. \nI think Senator Wellstone was very real last night when he came back \nand he was on the phone ready to tell this particular nominee that all \nwas well.\n  I happen to know two judges on that list from California. Their lives \nare on hold. They are human beings, just as we are. Many have been \nwaiting for months and months. I say to the majority leader, please, do \nall you can, because pretty soon we are going to come down here with \nphotographs of the families that are in limbo. They don't know. Some of \nthem are closing other practices up. It is a hardship on the families. \nThese are wonderful people. These are people who came out of those \ncommittees, many of them without one objection. These are people who \nhave support of both Senators, in many cases, Republican and Democrat \nalike. So we really changed course here when many of us understood it \nwas going to go a certain way. It is very hard, I think, on the people \nwhose lives are affected, their children and their spouses.\n  So I hope we can work together for the good of, frankly, these people \nand their families and the criminal justice system. I don't think it \ndoes any good to have these judgeships vacant. Justice needs to be \ndone, and it is hard to serve it when you don't have the judgeships \nfilled.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am going to have to respond to some of \nthat. There are real people, also, whose lives would be affected by \nthese appointments. These are not administration appointees who will \nserve at the pleasure of the President for a year or 4 years. These are \nlifetime appointments to the Federal judiciary, and it is very \nimportant who these people are--\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. LOTT. And how they are going to rule. We should look not only at \ntheir education, background, and qualifications, but also--particularly \nwhen it comes to circuit judges--what is their philosophy with regard \nto the judiciary and how they may be ruling. We have a legitimate \nresponsibility to ask those questions. I have to tell you, we have all \nbeen through this. I have had a couple of judges that I have been \ninterested in, one from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. He is a \ngreat guy, a great lawyer, Harvard educated, with all the credentials. \nHe did not make it in 1992. That is the way it goes. Some people did \nnot like him because he was a very conservative lawyer. I think the \nphilosophy does make a difference when it comes to the circuit.\n  I want to emphasize here that, when we start painting this mosaic \nabout this person and the family going to be affected, we have a right \nto think about all the families whose lives will be affected by some of \nthe ridiculous decisions we see in the Federal judiciary, and the \nactivism where they start writing laws, which is our job. I never \nintended to infer, in any way, or imply that I could guarantee that all \nthese would be done or that I would even vote for all of them. All I \nsaid was that I would work through this list and I would try, because I \ndidn't know any of them, not a single one of them, when I started out.\n  I started down the list, at the direction of my predecessor, I got to \nknow some of them and worked through them. I tried to move four en bloc \none night, and because we did not have all of them on the list, it was \nobjected to by a Senator. I thought we had worked it out. Later, I \ntried to move the same four judges again that nobody objected to, \nexcept when I brought it to the floor, a Democratic Senator objected \nbecause his judge was not on the list. And then the majority leader \nleft, and I said, well, maybe I can work through more of them. I got it \nup to nine judges. One night, I came to the floor and we had 10 that \nhad cleared on the hotline. I even talked to a couple Senators as they \nhit the ground at the airport trying to get them done. At the last \nminute, one of those dropped by the wayside. I tried nine judges, and I \nhad an objection from a Democrat when I was trying to clear nine \njudges. I think at least five or six of those were supported by \nDemocrats. So I said, OK, that hasn't worked. In an abundance of good \nfaith, I said I will do them one-by-one.\n  I brought up one. It was objected to. But then I started working it \nwith the minority leader. He started working it with his people. And \nthen we started to move with the ones that were really not \ncontroversial. We got four or five done. Then we got five more done. \nAnd I think it is 15 or 16--16 that we are working through the process.\n  I really must say that the minority leader was fair in his remarks of \nhow we talked about it. We work together on it. We will just keep \nmoving through the process.\n  But again these are not insignificant. These are big-time, lifetime, \nhigh-paid jobs that are going to affect our lives, and, if we do not \nknow who they are, if we do not ask questions, then we will be shirking \nour responsibilities.\n  But we will continue working on these judges. Just like the Senator\n\n[[Page S9419]]\n\nfrom Michigan said, we will talk more about that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Certainly; I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the leader for yielding. I appreciate what he is \nsaying. He is so right about that. I have to say having had the real, \ngreat privilege to get a number of judges through this U.S. Senate--\n  Mr. LOTT. There was one from California that we moved.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. I want to say that the committee is doing its \njob. They were very clear with all of us--the Republican Senators--\nsaying we want to make sure when you bring people up that they have \nRepublican support as well as Democratic support in their committees. \nAnd it has been, frankly, a joy for me to work to bring these types of \npeople who have that type of bipartisan support.\n  But I guess the one point that I just want to make--and I will not \nbelabor this any longer--is that I heard the Senator from Minnesota say \nthat he would be delighted to debate this. He is ready.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me say in this case that I have already told him. If I \ncould reclaim my time for a moment, it is relevant. If we can't get it \nworked out, I intend to move it, and we'll have a debate.\n  But here is one of my problems. We have a few hours left here. We \nhave a lot of work that we need to get done that you want, and that we \nwant. So I plead with everybody. Let us keep our heads cool. Let us \nkeep talking.\n  Also, I again say that I think it would be a major mistake--a major \nmistake--for Senators to hold up health insurance reform, safe drinking \nwater, small business tax relief, and minimum wage, if we can't work \nthrough all of these things tomorrow. I plead with you not to do that. \nI urge you not to do it.\n  Let us get these conferences that we have worked together on in a \nbipartisan way. I understand there is some objection maybe to the \nillegal immigration bill. I do not know the details of the negotiations \nthere. But this is something the American people feel outraged about. \nWe can't control illegal immigration in this country. But if there is \nsome problem with the way it was handled we will take that into \nconsideration.\n  There are three of these conference reports which everybody has \npretty much signed on to. They have problems with them.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I just want to say that I appreciate the comments, and \nthis has been informative.\n  In the last couple of months, if my figures are correct, there have \nbeen 23 judges on the Executive Calendar ready for confirmation by the \nSenate. We have confirmed 16. We have 7 still left on the calendar.\n  So I tell my colleagues on the other side who might be frustrated \nthat is a pretty good batting average. That is 16 out of 23 in this \nperiod of time. I admit that hardly--I think maybe one judge was \nconfirmed prior to that time.\n  Also, just while we are looking at this, I mention Frank Keating who \nwas not confirmed in 1992. And my colleague, Senator Daschle, mentioned \nthat we confirmed 66 judges in 1992, which is a lot. That is correct. \nBut we also had 58 nominations pending at the end of 1992. Right now \nthe total nominations of judges on the calendar--and that have been \nnominated--the total is 28.\n  So, if you look at the total percentage of those we have on the \npercentage--\n  Mr. LOTT. That is, those on the calendar and those still pending in \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Still pending before the Judiciary Committee.\n  So the only thing you have had on your plate is that there has been \n23 judges on the Executive Calendar. The Senate has now confirmed 16. \nThere are 7 remaining.\n  So I would say that in the past month the majority leader has been \nvery cooperative in the fact that he has moved 16 out of 23. That is 70 \npercent of the judges.\n  So I think he has been very cooperative in working with all Senators.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the President.\n  I just ask the majority leader to extend the courtesy, if he can. I \nwant to add my compliments to those that he has already received for \nsuch a good job, and I think too in a most serious way. He has tried \nto--\n  Mr. LOTT. One of those was from New Jersey, if the Senator will \nyield.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LOTT. We ran into a little problem, and we worked it out.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. To use an expression, ``I don't have a judge in this \nfight.'' So I want you to know that.\n  [Laughter].\n  I enjoy not only working with him but my kind, friendly tete-a-tete \nwith the majority leader.\n  I ask the majority leader whether or not in reality these judges did \nnot move tonight because they had something to do with something else? \nIs there some legislative redress that is being sought here, a judge is \nbeing held hostage, and people seeking justice are being held hostage \nbecause we are not processing their cases in an expeditious fashion? I \nask the majority leader because it was suggested to me that perhaps \nthere was something that I might do to help it along here.\n  I just would like to know whether or not there is some particular \npiece of legislation that may have offended someone that has them out \nhere saying, ``No. I am going to object to judges. I am going to object \nto anything that goes on in this place, and I do not care what the \nconsequences are. I object to the legislation.'' Could I possibly be \ncorrect in my assumption, Mr. Leader?\n  Mr. LOTT. I do not think it has ever happened in the Senate before; \nthat one matter would be impacted by an unrelated matter in another \narea. Why, of course, everything in the Senate is tangled up and \nrelated to something else. I do not guess there is any relationship \nbetween the judge not moving tonight and the objections to taking up \nthe HUD and Veterans appropriations bill. Why, of course, they are \nrelated.\n  But I have found the way you do that, you get all tangled up, and you \nwork with them, and quite often they manage to work themselves out and \nwe get the job done. But they are related.\n  Look. You know that Senators on both sides of the aisle feel strongly \nnot only about the judges but about the legislation. People are worried \nwhen you have a bill that involves a stalking of women and children \nthat you really care about, and you think that there is a mistake \nthere, and it is a bill that is universally supported. When that bill \ngets tangled up in the course of events, a Senator gets excited about \nthat, and upset about that. When a Senator feels like his or her rights \nare trampled upon, they move and they take advantage of whatever rights \nthey have.\n  My attitude with the Senator from Minnesota tonight was, ``Look. I \nunderstand. You are doing what you have to do.'' And we will see what \nwe can do with his problem that has been affected by another problem. \nWe will work them all.\n  Yes. They are all related. There is nothing new in that.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The majority leader--like my name--is frank, and I \nappreciate that candor. Because, if we are talking about the stalking \nbill here that passed the Senate that is over in the House, it carries \nan amendment by me that says wife beaters, child beaters, spouse \nabusers should not have a gun. Apparently there is an objection. ``We \nare concerned about that. We want to give those guys guns. What did \nthey do? Beat up their wives? That is not a crime.'' One judge said, \n``I hate to give a noncriminal a criminal sentence.'' One judge was so \ntough that he gave a man who murdered his wife in Baltimore County 18 \nmonths with time to be served on weekends. He murdered his wife. The \njudge said, ``I do not like to really punish someone like the \ncriminals. They are not really a criminal. All they did''--he did not \nsay this. I am saying it. ``All he did was murder his wife.''\n  So I am asking for my amendment and that bill to be carried along, \nand now suddenly I hear that has something to do with the approval of \njudges, which now has us tangled up in appropriations bills. I think it \nis pitiful that someone would object as we saw here\n\n[[Page S9420]]\n\nlast night; the Senator objected to an order that the minority leader \nrequested and refused to answer a question--refused, turned around and \nwalked out. This place is deteriorating into a sorry condition. But I \nknow the majority leader is working on it.\n  I think it is very important that people across the country hear that \neight judges are not being appointed because of a piece of legislation \nthat would prevent wife beaters and child abusers from getting guns. I \nthink that is pretty important. I hope the public hears it and listens \nto it, and I hope the press hears it and listens to it.\n  I say to the majority leader, my apologies for this little tirade, \nbut I had to kind of get it off my chest.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on June 16, something happened that has \ntremendous implications for the American people and for people \neverywhere. On that day, Russia, which just a few years ago was the \ngreatest threat to democracy in the world, held a democratic election \nto select its President.\n  That alone, Mr. President, is reason to celebrate. Despite calls from \npeople across the Russian political spectrum who still do not \nunderstand what democracy is about to cancel the election, the Russian \nGovernment stuck by its commitment to democracy--\n  No decisions were taken by secretive Politburos.\n  Parties representing the full spectrum of political sentiment \nparticipated.\n  Candidates crisscrossed that vast country making promises to win the \nvotes of ordinary people.\n  And in the end, most stunning of all, there was a graceful concession \nspeech by the losing candidate, the leader of the Communist party that \nonly a little while ago we regarded as the personification of tyranny, \ncommitting the party to challenge irregularities in the election ``in \nthe courts, not in the streets.''\n  Mr. President, this was not a perfect election. There were \nirregularities. There may well have been instances of ballot box \nstuffing. I was quite concerned about the extent to which media \ncoverage of the election appeared to favor one candidate. But it also \noccurred to me that, if I were a newspaperman covering an election in \nwhich one major party had a record of advancing democracy and the \nfreedoms associated with it and the other had a 70-year history of \nsuppressing the freedom of newspapers like mine, I might have tended to \nadvocacy rather than neutrality too. That is not an excuse, but despite \nthe irregularities, there is general agreement that the will of the \nRussian people was heard in this election.\n  The Russian people voted for democracy, and the tremendous \nsignificance of that should not be lost on anyone. Despite all of the \nhardship they are experiencing. Despite the crime and corruption. \nDespite their loss of empire. Despite the fact that the standard-bearer \nof the forces of democracy has made many mistakes, the brutal war in \nChechnya being the most egregious, and is in poor health.\n  The Russian people voted for freedom. Freedom to speak their minds. \nFreedom to associate. As ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who is \nnot someone I admire, put it in explaining why he would not support the \ncommunists: freedom to decide where to spend his vacation. For some, it \ncame down to things as simple as that, things which we take for \ngranted.\n\n  Mr. President, the world has changed profoundly in the last decade. \nCommunism as a world force is gone. Whatever the future may bring in \nterms of the distribution of power in the world, the age of ideological \nconfrontation between communism and democracy is over. While there \nremain many aggressive forces in the world, I cannot help but feel that \nthe world will be a safer place when its two greatest powers are both \ncommitted to democracy and the protection of individual rights.\n  And I think we owe credit to President Clinton, Secretary of State \nChristopher, and Deputy Secretary Talbott. Over the past three years, \nthey have braved the attacks by those, including some in this chamber, \nwho cannot bring themselves to give up their cold war notions about \nevil empires and would have us focus only on the vestiges of the old \nand ugly in Russia and ignore all that is new and promising.\n  Where do we go from here? As the ranking member of the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee, I have watched as funding for foreign \nassistance has been slashed over the past 18 months, including \nassistance to Russia. Assistance to Russia is being phased out over the \nnext 2 years, even though it is obvious that it is going to take the \nRussian people at least another decade to be able to take control of \ntheir own lives instead of expecting the government to do it for them, \nand that our assistance would be valuable to them.\n  President Yeltsin has won the support of his people to continue \nreform. But the Russian economy remains a shambles. The Russian \nGovernment has no money to finance its reforms. Crime is rampant. There \nare still pensioners on the streets of Moscow hawking pairs of \nchildren's rubber boots in order to survive.\n  Aid from the United States cannot possibly solve these problems \ndirectly. The problems are so immense that only the Russian people \nworking together will be able to.\n  But what our aid can do is show them the way. Most Russians still \nhave only a faint notion of what a market economy offers. Most also \nstill carry the perceptions drilled into them by their Soviet masters \nthat Americans are their enemies.\n  I have not been fully satisfied with the results of our aid program \nin Russia. There has been confusion, a lack of strategic thinking, and \nboilerplate approaches that did not fit the unique conditions there. \nToo much of the money has ended up in the pockets of American \ncontractors, without enough to show for it.\n  But some programs have given the Russian people hope for a \nbetter future. People-to-people exchanges are an example of how we can \nhelp change old ways of thinking. I believe the thousands of exchanges \nof ordinary citizens that we have sponsored over the last 4 years \nplayed a role in President Yeltsin's victory. Farmer-to-farmer \nprograms. Business exchange programs. Academic exchange programs. Civic \norganization development projects. They have shown the Russian people \nwhat is possible.\n\n  Americans have learned from these exchanges too. We have learned that \nthe Russian people are not ogres. Like us, they are mostly worried \nabout the welfare of their families. But they are learning for the \nfirst time that it is possible to have a system of government whose \nprimary aim is the defense of individual rights, and which actually \nserves them.\n  Mr. President, there remains much to criticize in Russia. The \ndemocracy that exists there is fragile, and the future unpredictable. \nThere will continue to be setbacks, and instances when Russia behaves \nin ways that are inconsistent with international norms. I have been \nhorrified by the brutality of the Russian military in Chechnya. While \nit has been reassuring to see the outpouring of protest against this \nbarbarity by the Russian people themselves, President Yeltsin and his \nsecurity advisors need to recognize that Chechnya's future is not going \nto be decided by bombing its people into submission.\n  Having said that, let us today recognize how much has changed for the \nbetter in Russia compared to just a few years ago. And I hope we will \nalso reaffirm our commitment to support reform in Russia. We know how \nto put our aid dollars to good use there, and there is much good yet to \nbe done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9420-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9420-S9421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HARRY M. ``MAC'' JOHNSTON\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the emergence of South Carolina as a \ncenter for business and industry is due to many factors including a \ntemperate climate, a trained and enthusiastic\n\n[[Page S9421]]\n\nworkforce, cooperative government officials, and not the least \nsignificant, community leaders committed to bringing new jobs into \ntheir towns, cities, and counties. One of the fastest growing areas of \nthe Palmetto State is the region known as the Upstate, and a gentleman \nby the name of Harry M. ``Mac'' Johnston, played a key role in business \ndevelopment in Union County, until his recent and untimely death.\n  Mr. Johnston served as the director of the Union County Development \nBoard for slightly more than 2 years, a short tenure to be certain. \nDespite the brevity of his administration, cut tragically short by a \nstroke, Mr. Johnston managed to achieve several important \naccomplishments that will be of great benefit to his fellow citizens. \nThanks to the efforts of the late Mr. Johnston, the historic Buffalo \nMill was purchased and re-opened, Union County was named as the home of \nSouth Carolina's new Juvenile Justice facility, and Upstate residents \nwill celebrate community spirit this fall at the first ever ``Uniquely \nUnion Festival.'' Without question, these are three excellent examples \nof Mr. Johnston's abilities as a civic booster and promoter of Union \nCounty, and had his life not been ended so abruptly, I am confident \nthat he would have continued to have played an important role in the \ndevelopment of Union County.\n  Mr. President, the impact Mr. Johnston had in Union County was \ntremendous. He was a very capable and well liked man, and in memory of \nthe many contributions he made to his community, the County Council \nrecently voted to name the new county industrial park after this man. \nThis is a fitting tribute to a person who dedicated so much of his \nefforts to making our State a better place to live. I commend the Union \nCounty Council on the honor they have paid Mr. Johnston and I extend my \ndeepest condolences to his family on the loss they have suffered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9420-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF AMBASSADOR DAVID COLSON\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I take the floor today to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished civil servant, Ambassador David A. Colson. Ambassador \nColson is Deputy Assistant Secretary for Oceans in the Bureau of Oceans \nand International Environmental and Scientific Affairs. He will retire \nfrom 25 years of Government service on August 2; his departure is a \nloss to the Department of State and a loss to our country.\n  Dave Colson's career is an exemplar of public service. In 1966, he \ngraduated from college and joined the Peace Corps, serving for 2 years \nas a teacher in Liberia. Thereafter, he enlisted in the United States \nMarine Corps. Upon completion of his tour of duty in 1971, he returned \nto law school. In 1975, he began working for the Department of State, \nthe organization which has enjoyed the benefits of his efforts ever \nsince.\n  Dave progressed rapidly up the career ladder at State. First as \nAttorney-Adviser, then as Assistant Legal Adviser, and finally as \nDeputy Assistant Secretary. He received a career appointment to the \nSenior Civil Service after only six years working in the Legal Advisers \noffice. Since 1991, he has served with the rank of Ambassador.\n  Mr. President, those are titles and ranks. They are impressive, but \nthey speak little to Dave's accomplishments and service to our country. \nThe true measure of his contributions lies in the body of international \nlaw that he leaves behind and the people whose lives are better because \nof his work. In these areas, his achievements are legion.\n  At the Foreign Relations Committee, Ambassador Colson is best known \nfor his expertise in the area of living marine resources. In the past \nthree Congresses, he appeared before our Committee to testify on \nnumerous marine resource treaties. Each of these advanced the interests \nof the United States and its citizens. Each of them improved the \nconservation of in the world's marine resources. Each of them developed \nfurther the framework of international law that governs the use of \nocean space. And each of them was brought about either in large or \npartial measure through Ambassador Colson's efforts.\n  Dave Colson's accomplishments are not, however, confined to living \nmarine resources. As Deputy Assistant Secretary for the OES Bureau at \nthe State Department, he has been extensively involved in a variety of \nissues including the Law of the Sea Convention, the London Dumping \nConvention, a number of maritime boundary negotiations, navigation \nissues, and a range of matter associated with the Arctic and Antarctic.\n  Simply put, Dave Colson became one of the leading experts in the \nworld on oceans. He is to be commended for his invaluable and lasting \ncontributions. I wish him all the best as he embarks on this new phase \nof his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9421-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \ncomment on our nation's continued support with its chief ally in the \nMiddle East, Israel. Last week, the Senate completed action on the \nFiscal Year 1997 Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill. The final \nlegislation soon will be brought before us. This legislation represents \nthe annual opportunity for Congress to demonstrate its clear support \nfor the people of Israel.\n  This year is no exception. Both House and Senate bills would continue \nlast year's investment levels to Israel--$1.2 billion for economic \nassistance and $1.8 billion in military aid. I commend the House and \nSenate Chairmen of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee--\nSenator McConnell and Congressman Callahan for their efforts to \nmaintain our full commitment to the people of Israel.\n  I have been a strong critique of foreign aid excess. However, I \nfirmly believe that one of the wisest investments we can make is to the \neconomic viability and national security of Israel. Failure to maintain \nthat commitment could pose even greater costs in the future--costs in \nlost jobs, lost opportunities and far worse, even lost lives.\n  I have been concerned of late with the proliferation of advanced \nweapons to nations that traditionally have been hostile to Israel's \nexistence. In the past year, Iran has acquired advanced cruise missiles \nfrom China, and has engaged in an aggressive campaign to develop a \nnuclear weapons and ballistic missile program. It also recently was \nreported that Syria may have obtained advanced ballistic missile \ntechnology from China. It is no secret that Syria is seeking to develop \na far more capable ballistic missile than the Scud missiles that rained \ndown on Israel during the Gulf War. Given these developments, it is \ncrucial that Israel maintains a technological edge in its defense \nsystems. Our continued support of Israel's defense, therefore, is \nvital.\n  Mr. President, as we all know, just a few weeks ago, a joint session \nof Congress was held in order to hear an address by the newly elected \nPrime Minister of Israel, Binyamin Netanyahu. We witnessed a stirring \nspeech. Prime Minister Netanyahu deserves our congratulations for \narticulating a thoughtful vision for the people of his country.\n  Perhaps most important, the people of Israel deserve our \ncongratulations for demonstrating their commitment to democratic \nvalues. For nearly a half century, the people of Israel have built and \npreserved a democracy despite constant hardship and hostility. The \nrecent elections are proof that the people of Israel are determined to \nwithstand pressures from without and within to maintain a democracy, \nbuild a vibrant economy and achieve peace and security in the entire \nregion.\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu came to Washington as Israel's first \npopularly elected Prime Minister. Rather than be the choice of a \ngoverning coalition, Prime Minister Netanyahu is the people's choice. \nThe people chose him to lead the Israeli government, rather than the \ngovernment itself.\n\n  The Prime Minister's speech to Congress demonstrated his appreciation \nand understanding of the American-Israeli partnership--a partnership \nthat\n\n[[Page S9422]]\n\ngoes beyond common political and strategic bonds. Both nations share a \ncommon set of values --values of freedom, individual responsibility, \nand hope and opportunity. The Prime Minister noted that it was no \ncoincidence that the birth of Israel coincided with the rise of the \nUnited States as the world's preeminent power. He is right.\n  I also was particularly heartened with the Prime Minister's \nassurances that he is committed to establishing real peace in the \nregion. Indeed, he articulated a clear, commonsense vision of how peace \ncan be established. He called this vision the ``three pillars of \npeace.'' The pillars being security, reciprocity, and democracy and \nhuman rights. Americans should understand and appreciate each one of \nthese pillars.\n  It was Ronald Reagan who popularized the maxim ``peace through \nstrength.'' Actually, as Prime Minister Netanyahu reminded us, that \nmaxim has its origin in Hebrew verse, which when translated, reads as \nfollows: ``God will give strength to His people; God will bless His \npeople with peace.'' We are a nation long blessed with peace because we \nalways made the defense of this nation a high priority. America's \ncombined economic and military power provided the strength needed to \nsecure a peaceful victory in the Cold War. Similarly, we cannot \nundermine Israel's security in the name of peace. That, in essence, was \nwhat the Israeli elections were all about.\n  Therefore, we should not question Israel's commitment to peace if it \ndemands as a prerequisite an end to terrorist aggression, or state-\nsponsored attacks against Israeli citizens and cities. We should not \nsecond guess Israel's desire to move the peace process forward if it \ndemands as a prerequisite that existing peace agreements be respected \nby all sides. We should embrace these conditions for they have at their \ncore the values of any true democracy--the values of personal freedom \nand the rule of law. In essence, that is what Israel is seeking from \nits neighbors. American know peace cannot exist without respect for \nindividual rights and the rule of law. The people of Israel should \nexpect no less.\n  I applaud Prime Minister Netanyahu for being unwilling to believe \nthat Israel will remain the Middle East's one lone democracy. There is \nno reason that the shared traditions of our two countries--human \nrights, democracy, free speech, religious tolerance--cannot be the \ngrowing traditions in any part of the world. Democracy has seen \nadvances in Asia and Africa. The Middle East should not be immune to \nits benefits, one of them being a lasting peace.\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu understood and demonstrated to all of us \nthat democracy is the ultimate method to achieve peace. After all, as \nhe correctly pointed out, ``modern democracies do not initiate \naggression.'' That being the clear case, and understanding the values \ninherent in democracies, there should be no question in the minds of \nthose who seek peace, that the Middle East's lone democracy should be \nthe sole sovereign of the city of Jerusalem. I am pleased that Congress \ntook a stand for one, unified city of Jerusalem by voting to move our \nEmbassy there. Is it no surprise that under a unified democratic \nsystem, Jerusalem has witnessed peace and protection to members of all \nnationalities that have come to worship there? Certainly, it is no \nsurprise to Americans. We know, as Prime Minister Netanyahu said, that \na city divided is not a city at peace or tolerant of its diversity.\n\n  Mr. President, let me conclude my remarks with the subject I started \nwith--our continued support for Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu has \nvowed that he would like to take Israel down the road of less reliance \non U.S. economic assistance, and greater reliance on the powerful \nforces of capitalism and free markets. I commend him for setting his \nnation on this course of economic independence. This decision \ndemonstrates his confidence with his fellow citizens of Israel to build \na vibrant, strong, self-reliant nation. That being the course he has \nset, the best we in the United States can do is help him and the people \nof Israel achieve that admirable goal.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I have watched and admired a brave and determined \npeople build a democracy under brutal circumstances that more than \ntested their resolve. This past year was no exception. It has been a \nyear that witnessed the assassination of Israel's great leader, Yitzhak \nRabin, repeated terrorist attacks, and a very contentious election. \nThrough it all, the people of Israel stood strong, holding to its \nvalues and its belief that their home, their country, will stand \nstrong, prosperous and at peace. The people of the United States cannot \nhelp but admire that determination. The people of the United States \nstand ready to help the people of Israel as they move down a road of \npeace, security and economic self-reliance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9421-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9422-S9423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OREGON COAST AQUARIUM\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, for 30 years I have had the pleasure of \nrepresenting a State known for its emphasis on educating its citizens \non the importance of understanding and preserving their surrounding \nenvironment. The Oregon Coast Aquarium serves as a wonderful example of \nthis unique spirit of conservation.\n  Visitors at the Oregon Coast Aquarium are able to experience the \nindigenous coastal habitat and view many examples of marine creatures \nand plant life. However, the aquarium is much more than a collection of \nexhibits, it is an education center. The theme chases a raindrop from \nthe moment it drops from the sky and hits the Coast Range, until it \nreaches its final destination, the Pacific Ocean. By following this \npath through numerous interactive exhibits, theaters, and touch pools, \nchildren and adults alike are able to learn about the native Oregon \ncoastal environment and its important function.\n  Located just south of Newport along the scenic Oregon coastline, the \nOregon Coast Aquarium has recently become the rehabilitation center for \nthe 16-year-old orca whale Keiko, known for his role in the movie \n``Free Willy.'' The aquarium was selected by the Earth Island \nInstitute, whose job it was to find a suitable new home for the 21-\nfoot-long and 7,000-pound killer whale, as the only facility in the \ncountry that satisfied the necessary criteria. Keiko was transported, \nvia a UPS B-130 cargo jet, to the aquarium from an amusement park in \nMexico, where his health had been rapidly deteriorating. Since his \narrival in January, Keiko has steadily improved and is moving ever \ncloser to the goal of his eventual release.\n  I am honored today to recognize the Oregon Coast Aquarium and welcome \nthe most recent addition to our coastal waters.\n  On Sunday, July 28, 1996, the New York Times published a full page \narticle on Keiko and the Oregon Coast Aquarium.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 28, 1996]\n\n                      Willy Not Free, but Mending\n\n                          (By Donald S. Olson)\n\n       On Jan. 7 of this year thousands of people lined Highway \n     101 south of Newport, Ore., to welcome a 7,720-pound, 21-\n     foot-long celebrity from Mexico City. Keiko, the 16-year-old \n     orca whale who starred in the movie ``Free Willy,'' arrived \n     by U.P.S. B-130 cargo jet. He was loaded onto a flatbed truck \n     and hauled past cheering crowds to his new home, the Oregon \n     Coast Aquarium. Several aquariums wanted Keiko, but the \n     Oregon Coast was chosen because it was the only one with the \n     space to build a pool large enough to rehabilitate him for \n     possible release into the wild--the first such attempt ever \n     made with a captive orca.\n       Since it opened in 1992, the magnificent 37-acre facility, \n     about two and a half hours southwest of Portland, has drawn \n     me back to Newport and the coastal region around Yequina Bay \n     several times. Situated on the bay's south side, adjacent to \n     an estuary teeming with wildlife, the aquarium is designed in \n     the vernacular of seaside buildings such as boat sheds, with \n     imaginative interior detail. The pillars, for instance, are \n     cast with sandy reliefs of marine life, and the doorhandles \n     are octopus tentacles and heron heads cast in bronze.\n       A sculptured school of 150 thrashing coho salmon hanging in \n     the front entry hall leads to the first exhibit, where a \n     short video introduces the concept behind the aquarium. \n     Following the course of a raindrop that falls in the Coast \n     Range, trickles down streams, flows into rivers, washes \n     through wetlands and finally reaches the sea, the galleries, \n     arranged in a circular pattern, present a cross-section of \n     various coastal habitats linked by water into one vast inter-\n     connected marine ecosystem.\n\n[[Page S9423]]\n\n       The first gallery focuses on Oregon's sandy beaches, which \n     support crabs, shrimps, sea stars, sea pens and sand dollars. \n     The flatfish, whose camouflage abilities are highlighted in a \n     special tank, is one of the stranger creatures on view. As it \n     grows it changes color, its eyes migrate toward one another, \n     and it begins to swim sideways. A central floor-to-ceiling \n     walk-around tank recreates the pier-and-pilings environment \n     found along Newport's Bay Front. Leopard sharks, smelt and \n     tubesnouts glide in and out among the piers, barnacles and \n     anemones attach themselves to pilings.\n       A favorite spot for children (and many adults) is the Touch \n     Pool in the next gallery, called Rocky Shores. Here, under \n     the genial tutelage of aquarium volunteers, visitors can \n     gently stroke starfish and chitons. Smaller tanks contain \n     oddities like the grunt sculpin, which crawls or leaps across \n     rocks with broad, fingerlike fins, the pea sized spiny \n     lumpsucker and the decorated war bonnet. An array of delicate \n     anemones wave their pulpy pink, white and purple tentacles in \n     other tanks.\n       Visitors often gasp in surprise when they enter the Coastal \n     Waters Gallery and see the central moon jellies exhibit. The \n     glass of the oval-shaped tank magnifies these pink, brainless \n     beauties as they gracefully palpitate up toward the top and \n     drift down again. Sea nettles, another jellyfish species, \n     look like aquatic, caramel-colored Art Nouveau lampshades, \n     and the fragile bell jellies resemble tiny transparent light \n     bulbs. For sheer creepiness, on the other hand, nothing \n     compares with the hagfish, coiled like a pale, bloated \n     sausage in its own tank. This repulsive creature covers dead \n     fish with a glaze of slime, swims inside, and proceeds to eat \n     its way out again. A close runner-up in the ugly department \n     is the huge, primitive-looking wolf-eel, which uses its \n     mouthful of buck teeth to crush shellfish.\n       The circular route of the galleries brings the visitor to \n     the long covered portico near the entrance, beyond which are \n     the outdoor exhibits--four acres of specially constructed \n     caves, cliffs and pools that distinguish this aquarium.\n       Both aboveground and through underwater viewing windows \n     visitors can watch sea lions, seals, sea otters, octopuses \n     and sea-birds. The otters, rescued as infants from the Exxon \n     Valdez oil spill in Alaska, are the only animals not \n     indigenous to Oregon. They look cuddly and playful, but \n     they're very territorial and aggressive. Cody, the 80-pound \n     male, has smashed the protective glass window on more than \n     one occasion.\n       Keiko, of course, is now the star attraction, housed in his \n     own state-of-the-art pool, 150 feet long, 75 feet wide and 25 \n     feet deep. Although Keiko did not come to the aquarium to \n     perform, his trainers have devised a series of brain games \n     and high-energy remedial workouts--including breaches, barrel \n     rolls, bows and high-speed swims--to improve his physical \n     abilities and keep him mentally challenged. To the delight of \n     visitors, he also spends a great deal of time at the \n     underwater viewing windows, watching the people watch him.\n       The Free Willy-Keiko Foundation, which now owns the animal, \n     will make the final decision regarding his release. After \n     Life magazine brought Keiko's plight to the public's \n     attention in 1993 and children around the world bombarded the \n     Warner Brothers Studio with letters demanding to know why \n     ``Free Willy'' was ailing and still in captivity the studio \n     hired Earth Island Institute, an environmental advocacy group \n     headquartered in San Francisco, to find a facility where the \n     whale--then a ton underweight, with a collapsed doral fin and \n     skin lesions--could be rehabilitated.\n       The institute set up the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation, and \n     Warner Brothers donated $2 million of the $7.3 million needed \n     to complete his new pool. The rest of the money, for \n     relocation, veterinary care and  operating expenses (such as \n     the 120,000 pounds of fresh-frozen fish Keiko will eat \n     every year), has come from private donations. The goal of \n     the foundation and the Oregon Coast Aquarium is to make \n     Keiko well enough to so that he can eventually be returned \n     to his family pod. Already there are signs that his health \n     is steadily improving, his veterinarian and others at the \n     aquarium say. He is eating nearly twice as much as he did \n     in Mexico City, and because of the change in water \n     chemistry--he now swims in cold fresh seawater instead of \n     warm chlorinated water--he's shed a layer of skin, \n     including patches of lesions near his tail flukes and \n     pectoral flippers.\n       Dr. Lanny Cornell, his veterinarian, recently stressed, \n     however, that while the initial news is good, ``it's a very \n     short time to make long-term predictions about his eventual \n     recovery.''\n       Other factors beside Keiko's health must also be taken into \n     consideration before he can be considered ready for life in \n     the wild. For one thing, each orca pod communicates with its \n     own ``dialect'' based on geographic location. Keiko can't be \n     released into the Pacific because he wouldn't be able to \n     communicate with the West Coast orcas. Willy had been \n     captured off the coast of Iceland; marine biologists must \n     find his original pod, and it's possible that they may no \n     longer be alive. In the meantime, from underwater viewing \n     windows, visitors now have a chance to see an orca explore an \n     environment that recreates a portion of his natural habitat.\n       Since Keiko's arrival, Newport, a small coastal town on the \n     north side of Yaquina Bay, has experienced a major tourist \n     boom.\n       From the aquarium it takes about five minutes to reach the \n     town via the Yaquina Bay Bridge, build in 1932 to 1936 as a \n     W.P.A. project.\n       South Jetty, the oldest on the West Coast, extends far out \n     into the Pacific, protecting the entrance into the bay. The \n     section of Newport that stretches along Highway 101 is little \n     more than an anonymous-looking strip mall, but a couple of \n     areas still preserve remnants of the old fishing community's \n     crusty past.\n       Nye Beach, a neighborhood that fronts on the Pacific Ocean \n     just west of Highway 101, is full of the weathered, \n     unpretentious cottages and beach shacks that until recently \n     characterized Newport and most Oregon coastal towns.\n       The Sylvia Beach Hotel, a former boardinghouse that is now \n     a cozy hotel, is perched above the broad, white-sand beach.\n       From Highway 101, the road curves down past a Coast Guard \n     station to Bay Boulevard, the main street where Newport's \n     beleaguered fishing industry is still headquartered. The Bay \n     Front, with its assortment of seafood restaurants, is a good \n     place to sample fresh local fish, oysters, shrimp, mussels, \n     crabs, geoducks (pronounced gooey-ducks) and clams. White \n     clam chowder, thick as pudding, is a staple in these parts. \n     More seafood to go can be found, uncooked, at the indoor \n     counters of the bayside canneries and fish-processing plants. \n     In seconds they can clean, crack and package a whole \n     Dungeness crab, one of the sweetest-tasting crustaceans in \n     existence. The Bay Front is the liveliest spot in Newport.\n       In addition to local craft, antiques, gift and candy shops, \n     there's Mariner Square, with a child-pleasing Ripley's \n     Believe It or Not. Dozens of colorful trawlers still dock at \n     Newport's marina, chugging out to fish for cod, flounder, \n     tuna, shrimp and oysters. But the recent, federally imposed \n     quotas on salmon and halibut has slowed the town's charter-\n     boat business.\n       Strolling along the narrow bayside sidewalks, visitors are \n     often surprised to hear the grunting gutteral barks of nearby \n     sea lions. There are so many male sea lions in Yaquina Bay \n     that residents call it the Bachelor Club. The females stay in \n     the sea with their young, but the hulking males like to \n     congregate on waterside docks.\n       The stretch of Highway 101 from Newport to Lincoln City, 22 \n     miles north, is filled with a spectacular array of the \n     saltwater habitats recreated at the aquarium. One of the best \n     areas for viewing coastal wildlife is Yaquina Head, on the \n     northern outskirts of Newport. Here, in the water and on the \n     rocks below Oregon's oldest lighthouse, a gleaming white \n     tower activated in 1873, a raucous assortment of harbor \n     seals, sea lions, cormorants, murres, puffins and guilemots \n     make their home.\n       This is also a good spot for whale watching in the wild. If \n     the spring and early summer more than 18,000 gray whales pass \n     by on their seasonal migration from Alaska to Baja \n     California.\n       Once or twice a year orca whales, such as Keiko, also make \n     their way into Yaquina Bay. After gulping down whatever fish \n     is available--and often a sea lion or two they swim back to \n     the open sea. They bay itself is a thriving oceanic \n     ecocenter.\n       Not only does it support 200 species of birds, but it is so \n     clean that every day at high tide the Oregon Coast Aquarium \n     pumps two million gallons of water directly from the bay into \n     their tanks and another two million into Keiko's pool.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9422-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9423-S9424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN TRIBUTE TO JOHN PAUL BOLLMAN\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to pay tribute \nto a great man who has dedicated his life to helping people and \nfamilies in need. John Paul Bollman has grown up in the small town of \nDallas, OR. His family has made funeral service their life's work and \nas a result, he has helped thousands of people cope with the most \ndifficult loss a family can experience. Over the past 4 decades he has \nworked tirelessly to help people in need by extending kindness and \ncompassion to acquaintances and strangers alike, each as if they were \nan old friend. A man of conviction, he is deeply admired by his peers, \nrespected for his principles, and highly regarded as a noteworthy civic \nleader. Throughout his life he has embodied the true sense of a \nChristian. He has helped all people, doing so humbly and with great \nadoration from his community.\n  John has spent countless hours working for the betterment of the \ncommunity and has achieved a number of significant accomplishments as a \nresult. Serving on the boards of the local school district, the \neducation service district, the local hospital, along with numerous \ncivic and professional boards, John has dedicated his time to improving \nthe community at all levels. Whether he has taken the time to offer a \nhelping hand, a kind word, or a heartfelt gesture, he is always \navailable for those who need him. He recognizes that people are busy \ntoday and don't always\n\n[[Page S9424]]\n\nwant to invest their time helping in a classroom or teaching a high \nschool student about a business or profession, so John leads by example \nand hopes that his involvement will encourage others to give of their \ntime as well. He realizes that an opportunity to explore a career path \nat a young age can make the difference between providing a child an \nincentive to stay in school and dropping out. For many young people, \nJohn has shown them the connection and the importance of receiving a \ngood education.\n\n  Over the years, many fortunate people have had a unique opportunity \nto learn from this man who has made helping others his life's work. \nFollowing in the steps of his father, John entered the funeral service \nin 1960. It was with a great deal of pride, that John welcomed his son \nMichael into the family business 10 years ago, to follow in the \nfootsteps of his father and grandfather before him. I share a great \nfondness for the Bollman family, for it was John's grandfather, Dr. \nL.A. Bollman that brought me into this world 74 years ago. I have known \nfour generations of this family and have seen the attributes of his \nfather and grandfather in John and have seen them passed on to his \nchildren. His daughter Amy worked in my offices in Washington, DC and \nOregon and I saw in her the qualities of her father. She, too, is an \noutstanding role model in her community. We need more people like John \nBollman--people willing to give their time and their hearts to help \nothers. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank \nJohn for his tireless service to those in need and let him know that \nhis selfless dedication to his profession and his community does not go \nwithout recognition and appreciation. The town of Dallas, OR and all \nwho know him are both fortunate and blessed. John Paul Bollman embodies \nthe words of Ralph Waldo Emerson in his famous poem entitled Success:\n\n       To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent \n     people and the affection of children; to earn the \n     appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of \n     false friends; to appreciate beauty, to find the best in \n     others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy \n     child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition; to know \n     even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. \n     This is to have succeeded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9423-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NINA H. REEVES\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, my friend Nina Reeves will soon be \nretiring from her position as youth director of the North Alabama \nConference of the United Methodist Church after nearly 50 years. She \nwill be leaving her post in August 1996 after the conference's \ninternational peace camp. The official publication of the North Alabama \nConference, the Voice, published a tributary interview with Nina in its \nApril issue, saying,\n\n       If the North Alabama Conference has an icon, then Nina H. \n     Reeves definitely would be that person * * * From thousands \n     of youth and hundreds of events, the ministry of Nina Reeves \n     stretches from the lives of each youth she has touched \n     throughout the years.\n\n  Nina Reeves grew up in Yazoo City, MS and was reared as a \nPresbyterian. She went on to attend Millsaps College and later graduate \nschool at the University of Alabama, earning a master's degree in \nphysical education and recreation. After working part time for the \nWesley Foundation, she joined the North Alabama Conference at the early \nage of 22. She had planned to be a teacher, but, even though she didn't \nknow that much about the Methodist Church at the time, took the \nposition as youth director at the persistent urging of Brother V.H. \nHawkins, who vowed to teach her everything she needed to know. Hawkins \nhad seen her at work leading folk dancing, story-telling, and \nrecreation at a Tuscaloosa Methodist Church. She calls herself the \noldest living youth worker.\n  Each year, Nina has brought a large group of Methodist youth from all \nover north Alabama to Washington each year. While in the capital, they \nmet with Government leaders to get acquainted with public affairs and \nthe political process. They also visited the United Nations \nheadquarters in New York City. The annual breakfast town meetings with \nthe Alabama congressional delegation at the Capitol complex were truly \noutstanding and informative. I was always impressed with these young \npeople, since they seemed to have a genuine interest in Government and \nworld affairs. They also tended to be intellectually curious and quite \nprogressive in their thinking, believing that they had the ability to \nmake a real difference in their communities, State, Nation, and world. \nNina Reeves deserves much of the credit for instilling these kinds of \npositive attitudes in the youth to whom she ministered and offered \nguidance over the years.\n  I am pleased to commend and congratulate Nina Reeves for her nearly \n50 years of service to the Methodist youth of north Alabama. She has \nbeen their spiritual guide, their teacher, and their friend. She will \nbe greatly missed, and never really replaced, but her immeasurable \ncontributions and life of service in shaping the leaders of tomorrow \nwill never be forgotten. I wish her all the best as she enters the \nwell-deserved retirement phase of her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9424-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO GRADY LILES\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Grady Liles, the moving figure behind \nbringing the NCAA division II national championship game and with it \nnational recognition to the Shoals area of north Alabama, will be \nhonored for his outstanding community leadership on September 5, 1996, \nat the Florence, AL, Conference Center. He also originated the idea of \nthe Harlon Hill Trophy to honor the top collegiate football player in \ndivision II. It is named after a former University of North Alabama \nplayer who went on to star with the Chicago Bears, winning the Jim \nThorpe Award in the mid-1950's.\n  In 1985, Grady helped organize and establish the Shoals National \nChampionship Committee, which made a successful bid to host the NCAA \ndivision II football championship game. The nationally televised game \nhas been played in the Shoals for 10 years.\n  Grady Liles is a native of Florence and was the 1947 golden gloves \nboxing champion and the 1950 middle-weight champion in the U.S. Marine \nCorps. In 1957, he helped organize the Florence rescue squad, which was \nthe first volunteer squad in north Alabama. He served as a firefighter \nfor 13 years and was selected Alabama's fireman of the year in 1965. In \n1963, he had successfully lobbied for the approval of the State \nfireman's bill, which regulates and controls the maximum working hours \nfor city firefighters. This bill was the first to help firefighters on \na Statewide level.\n  Grady is a man of many awards. He was named ``outstanding young man'' \nby the Jaycees in 1965 and 1967 and that same year was selected for \noutstanding personalities of the south in 1967. In 1968, he received \nthe Distinguished Service Award after saving the life of an infant who \nhad stopped breathing through mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

Mr. President, next Monday evening will mark the 39th \nannual Red Saltsman picnic in Sorgho, KY. For a few hours that evening \na little town of less than 100 people will be the hot spot for the \nevening; host to thousands of people listening to good music, eating \nbarbecue and bringing each other up to date on the latest political \nhappenings.\n  It's all thanks to the good will of Katherine and Red Saltsman who 39 \nyears ago just wanted to say thanks to the regulars at their restaurant \nknown as the fish house of the south. That little picnic for family and \nfriends just sort of grew.\n  Now, you'll not only find friends and patrons of Red's restaurant, \nbut politicians beating a path to the picnic as well. They know that if \nthey want to\n\n[[Page S9425]]\n\nget their message out, they have to first convince the political movers \nand shakers who come to Red's.\n  But perhaps the best things about this picnic is that no matter how \nbig the picnic gets, it's always Red's picnic. Oh there's a bigger \nspread and it's become a permanent stop on the Kentucky campaign trail, \nbut the good intentions of one man and his family to say thanks and \ngive back to the community are still at the heart of this picnic.\n  Red and his family are pillars of this community. They're constantly \ndoing far more than their part to ensure Kentucky is the kind of place \neach of us can call home.\n  And so in a way, this picnic reminds us how much we each can do to \nmake our communities thrive. And for that reason--more than the good \nfood and music--we are all grateful to Red Saltsman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9424-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9425-S9426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AGRICULTURE CONFERENCE REPORT--PUBLIC LAW 480 FUNDING\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. In the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies' conference, on \nJuly 30, the conferees accepted a proposal to reduce the Senate's title \nIII funding level by $10.5 million and increase title I funding by \napproximately $7.9 million. I do not serve on the subcommittee but I am \nconcerned about the implications of this action. I would like to hear \nfrom the Senator from Iowa, who has expertise on the subject through \nhis years of service both on the Agriculture Committee and on the \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. Senator Harkin, what are your \nthoughts about this action?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Vermont for \nraising this issue. His work on food aid issues has been unsurpassed. \nIt was under his leadership as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry in 1990 and as ranking member \nduring the 1996 farm bill, that the Public Law 480 Food for Peace \nprogram continues to benefit the world's starving and undernourished \npeople.\n  I share the concerns of the Senator from Vermont regarding the \nfunding level for the title III Food Aid Program adopted in conference. \nIt would have been much better, in my view, to have retained the Senate \nlevel of funding for title III. Title III is an important tool in \ncombating the long-term obstacles to food security, yet it has been cut \nsignificantly over the past several years. The title III fiscal year \n1995 funding level was down by well over 50 percent from fiscal year \n1994, and the number of countries receiving title III food aid dropped \nfrom 13 in fiscal year 1994 to 7 in fiscal year 1995.\n  Title III serves the poorest and most food-deficient countries. In \ntimes of shrinking budgets, it is especially important that in using \nthe available funds priority be given to addressing the most pressing \nneeds. Unfortunately, the $40 million contained in the President's \nbudget and in the Senate bill already represented a substantial cut in \ntitle III funding, as compared to $50 million in fiscal year 1996, \n$117.4 million in fiscal year 1995, $255.1 in fiscal year 1994, and \n$333.6 million in fiscal year 1993. So I believe that at a minimum the \ntitle III funding should have been maintained at the $40 million level \nin the President's budget and the Senate bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator for his comments. I share his concern \nthat by cutting this program we are cutting aid to those populations \nthat are the most needy. I can only hope that this occurred because of \na lack of understanding about what this program does and what \npopulations it serves. These programs are now tightly focused on the \npoorest, most food-deficit countries in the world such as Bangladesh \nand Ethiopia.\n  Let me give an example of the way the program operates: Title III \nwheat in Ethiopia has been used to capitalize an emergency reserve. \nThis has helped to stabilize grain markets, while providing a cushion \nagainst periodic drought. Under this program Private Voluntary \nOrganizations such as Catholic Relief Services and Care can borrow from \nthis reserve to meet emergency requirements, with a promise to \nreplenish the reserve in the future. Without this facility we would \nhave greater requirements for costly emergency feeding programs.\n  So here's a way, in a time when we are cutting back on total food aid \ndollars, that we can help alleviate problems before they become \nexpensive emergency situations. I think the U.S. Congress should be in \nfavor of this type of preventive activity.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Vermont is certainly correct in his \ncomments about the title III program. The focus of title III is on \nstructural, policy reforms and activities that directly affect or \nimprove food production and consumption, including nutrition. Helping \nthe poorest, most food-deficient countries address these issues will \nhelp them see their way to food security. Reforms achieved through \ntitle III are an important tool in a longer term strategy for poorer \ndeveloping countries.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand that the Senator from Iowa also shares my \ngrave concerns about the consistent reductions in our funding of the \nPublic Law 480 Food for Peace Program--a key part of our global effort \nto foster international food security throughout the globe.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Vermont is correct. In addition to our \ndiscussion about title III, I would like to speak about my deep concern \nregarding the overall cuts in funding for the Public Law 480 Food for \nPeace Program in recent years. These cuts, combined with higher \ncommodity prices and the virtual disappearance of surplus commodities, \nhave caused a dramatic reduction in the volume of U.S. food aid. Since \nfiscal year 1993, total food aid provided by the United States has \ndropped by about two-thirds--from 8 million metric tons to about 2.8 \nmillion metric tons this fiscal year.\n  The United States has been generous in providing food aid. Since its \ninception in 1954, our Food for Peace Program has delivered over 372 \nmillion metric tons of food to needy countries--and Americans sincerely \nwant to help alleviate world hunger. We also realize that Public Law \n480 assistance works to our own benefit. It is a win-win proposition \nfor our farmers and agricultural businesses. In the short term, \npurchases for Public Law 480 shipments strengthen markets for U.S. \ncommodities. Over the long term, Public Law 480 helps develop world \nmarkets for U.S. agricultural exports. Forty-three nations that once \nreceived U.S. foreign aid are now among the top consumers of U.S. \nagricultural products.\n  It is very unfortunate that these cuts in Public Law 480 are \noccurring at a time when world food aid needs are growing dramatically. \nThese needs are expected to double by 2002 according to a report by \nUSDA's Economic Research Service issued in October 1995. Regrettably, \nas U.S. food aid tonnages have dropped, so have those of other donor \nnations, resulting in only about 6 million metric tons of food aid \nannually to meet need amounting to some 27 million metric tons of food.\n  Over 800 million people on Earth are now chronically undernourished. \nThe people hardest hit are young children and pregnant and lactating \nmothers who are deprived of adequate nutrition at the most critical \ntimes in their lives because of abject poverty and horrible living \nconditions. They suffer from frequent illness, poor growth and \ndevelopment, lack of productivity, and early death.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator is correct. Under the Public Law 480 program, \neach title addresses a vital, yet different need and population group. \nThese titles are like tools in a toolbox. Each one has a vital \nfunction; each one is needed but at different times.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have discussed the importance of title III in \ntargeting countries with low incomes, high infant mortality, and low \ncaloric intakes. Title II is similarly focused on addressing the \ncritical needs of the hungry and malnourished. Title II saves lives \nthrough emergency assistance and improves health, incomes, and living \nconditions through development programs conducted by private voluntary \norganizations.\n  It is particularly important that title II have enough resources so \nthat emergency food aid demands do not consume resources that would \notherwise be available for the development component of title II \ncarried out by\n\n[[Page S9426]]\n\nPVOs. Eroding these development programs--which are critical to \nalleviating poverty and hunger over the long term--to meet overriding \nemergency demands is surely a stark example of eating one's seed corn.\n  By contrast, the title I market development program serves a \ncompletely different population. Title I is important to U.S. \nagriculture and to foreign market development--and I am concerned about \nthe funding cuts it has suffered--but I also believe that we must seek \na reasonable balance among the three titles in light of pressing human \nneeds.\n  Given the growing need for food aid and the reductions in Public Law \n480 funding, I encourage the administration to make full use of its \nauthority to focus the limited Public Law 480 funds on meeting the \npriority needs of the poorest and most food-deficient countries.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with the Senator from Iowa and I know that we can \nwork in concert with the administration and the Congress to ensure that \nour limited food aid resources are effectively used to promote food \nsecurity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9425-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Sherman Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9426-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:15 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Geotz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3006.

A bill to amend the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                The Oil Pollution Act Amendments of 1996\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to improve \nmarine safety in the transportation of oil and petroleum products and \nto enhance the safety of our waterway navigational systems. It has been \nover 7 years since the Senate approved legislation addressing a \ncomprehensive program regulating the transportation of oil and \npetroleum products, and mandating a system of responding to oilspills. \nSince the enactment of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, there has been a \nmarked improvement in the safety of maritime transportation of oil. \nAccording to a recent study, after 1990, the volume of oil pollution \nfrom maritime sources in U.S. waters dropped precipitously, and has \nbeen reduced by over 75 percent. In addition, there has been a \ndecreasing number of large volume oilspills. For instance, in the 5-\nyear period between 1986 and the end of 1990, there were an average of \n25 major and medium oilspills per year, however, since 1990, the \naverage number of large and medium spills decreased 33 percent to \napproximately 16 per year. Despite these increases in safety there are \nother steps that can be taken to improve safety, and the bill I am \nintroducing today will continue the improvement of the safe \ntransportation of oil and other petroleum products.\n  During consideration of the Oil Pollution Act, the Senate Commerce \nCommittee held four hearings on the six different bills that were \nreferred to the Commerce Committee. The end Senate legislative product \nincorporated the Commerce Committee's provisions on: The operations of \noil tankers, enhanced Coast Guard authority to regulate the conduct of \noil tankers and merchant marine personnel, requirements on Vessel \nTraffic Services [VTS] systems, marine oil transportation-related \nresearch, and oilspill contingency response plans as they pertain to \nvessels and offshore facilities. The Senate bill also included the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works provisions creating the Oil \nSpill Liability Trust Fund, increasing liability limits, and oilspill \ncontingency response planning as it pertains to onshore facililities.\n  I am introducing this legislation today to build on the Commerce \nCommittee marine safety improvements that were incorporated into the \nOil Pollution Act of 1990. Title I of the bill would require the Coast \nGuard to finalize regulations on operational measures required for \nsingle-hull tankers, add certain new safety requirements for the tug-\nbarge industry, and mandate a minimum underkeel clearance level for \ntank vessels. The bill also would create incentives to induce vessel \noperators to switch from single hulled vessels to double-hulled vessels \nin advance of their mandated phase out. The bill simplifies the \nprocedures for resolution of oilspill claims, and allows vessel \noperators to consolidate all claims in one Federal proceeding.\n  Title II of the bill will provide the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration [NOAA] with the authority to allow emergency \nregulations for fishing grounds closures to respond to health \nemergencies and oilspills. The bill would also require NOAA to provide \nscientific support on oilspill information. Also included in title II \nare provisions which would authorize a grant program to establish a \nnonregulatory program for reducing the risk of oilspills, and authorize \nNOAA to\n\n[[Page S9429]]\n\nuse the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for nautical charting. We are \nfacing a critical juncture in the modernization of nautical charts, the \nUnited States has a responsibility to provide marine nautical chart \nusers with accurate charts, and this provision would help NOAA to \nprovide the shipping public with the most up-to-date navigational \ninformation. This provision also includes the authority to utilize \nprivate contractors to accomplish nautical charting objectives, and \ntransfers the aeronautical charting responsibilities to the Federal \nAviation Administration.\n  Title III of the bill modernizes the regulations governing deepwater \nports. When the Deepwater Port Act was enacted in 1974, it was \nprojected that there would be numerous deepwater port facilities. In \nfact, there is only one deepwater port in existence today. The \nprovisions of this title will help modernize the regulations, and \nconform the existing regulations to the realities of deepwater port \noperation.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to continuing the effort to upgrade the \nsafety of marine operations in the navigable waterways of the United \nStates, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2009\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Oil Pollution Act Amendments \n     of 1996''.\n\n                 TITLE I--OIL POLLUTION ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n     SEC. 101.

MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND NAVIGATIONAL \n                   SAFETY.\n\n       Section 10(a) of the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (33 U.S.C. \n     1509(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting after ``international law'' the following: \n     ``and the provision of adequate opportunities for public \n     involvement''; and\n       (2) by striking ``shall prescribe by regulation and enforce \n     procedures with respect to any deepwater port, including, but \n     not limited to,'' and inserting the following: ``shall \n     prescribe and enforce procedures, either by regulation (for \n     basic standards and conditions) or by the licensee's \n     operations manual, with respect to''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Warner, \n        Mr. Simpson, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. D'Amato, and Mr. Faircloth):\n  S. 2010. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to exempt \nqualified current and former law enforcement officers from State laws \nprohibiting the carrying of concealed firearms, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the community protection initiative of 1996\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the community \nprotection initiative of 1996. This bill will exempt current and former \nlaw enforcement officers from State and local laws prohibiting the \ncarrying of concealed firearms. In so doing, this bill will adopt a \nclear, uniform rule in place of the various State and local laws that \nare on the books today.\n  This bill has the support of many law enforcement organizations and \nindividuals, including the Law Enforcement Alliance of America, \nFraternal Order of Police, National Association of Police \nOrganizations, National Sheriffs Association, National Troopers \nCoalition, Southern Police Benevolent Association, National Law \nEnforcement Council, the Salt Lake City police chief, the Salt Lake \nCounty sheriff, and the Utah Highway Patrol Association.\n  This bill will prove to be a useful addition to our laws in several \nways. This bill will enhance public safety. It will do so by \npotentially placing thousands of additional police officers on the \nstreets of America--at no additional cost to the public. Law \nenforcement officers are highly trained professionals. Their classroom \nteaching, as well as their experience in the field, are the most \nvaluable weapons that they possess. But all of that skill and \nexperience will be of little benefit for a police officer if he cannot \nprevent A crime from occurring because he is unable to carry the \nfirearm his community has authorized him to carry as part of his job. \nThis bill puts more police on the street, at no cost to the taxpayer.\n  That result alone is a valuable one. But there is more. The bill will \nhelp law enforcement officers protect themselves and their families \nwhen they travel interstate. By itself, that is a valuable benefit. Any \none police officer may make scores of arrests throughout his career, \nand an officer may not always remember the face of every suspect that \nhe apprehends. Many criminals, however, remember. They remember the \nface of the judge, the face of the prosecutor, and, most importantly, \nthe face of the arresting officer. This bill enables police to protect \nthemselves and their families in the face of these long memories. \nCurrently, police officers can protect themselves when they remain \nwithin their jurisdictions on-duty. If those jurisdictions permit, \nofficers can carry their firearms off-duty. This bill would allow each \nqualified police officer to travel out of State without being at risk \nof criminal assault.\n\n  A firearm is an important tool in a battle with a criminal, \nespecially an armed one. A firearm in the hands of a trained police \nofficer, when off duty, will make our streets safer. For private \ncitizens, a firearm is best compared to a fire extinguisher, because \neach one is a piece of emergency, lifesaving equipment. But for police \nofficers, a firearm is a necessary tool of his profession.\n  We expect that police officers will intervene to prevent crimes from \noccurring. No, we demand that police officers carry out that \nresponsibility. That is why we train them in law enforcement; and that \nis why we give them a badge; that is why we give them a gun. This bill \nwill ensure that we do not disarm the police just because they have \ntraveled interstate.\n  There are more than 600,000 State and local law enforcement officers \nin more than 17,000 police agencies. This bill would allow those \nofficers, and many of their retired colleagues, to carry firearms when \nthey travel out of State. That puts each of those officers on the \nstreets in the service of law enforcement in this Nation.\n  To be sure, only some police officers will take advantage of this \nprovision. But we know that there will be some officers who prevent \nsome crimes and who prevent some people from becoming victims.\n  At the same time, this bill achieves those benefits in a careful \nmanner. It does not allow unqualified officer to carry firearms \ninterstate. Rather, it requires current police officers to be in good \nstanding to take advantage of the benefits of this bill. The bill also \ndoes not allow all retired police officers to carry firearms. Before a \nretired police officer can carry a concealed firearm under this bill, \nthe bill requires that the retired officer be authorized by his or her \nState of residence to carry a concealed firearm within that State. \nFinally, this bill does not authorize the carrying of firearms on \naircraft.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis in \nmoving this legislation. In the House, Representative Cunningham of \nCalifornia has introduced a similar measure.\n  Together, we can bring about passage of a bill that will protect the \npublic, our Nation's law enforcement officers, and their families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SIMPSON (by request):\n  S. 2011. A bill to ensure that appropriated funds are not used for \noperation of golf courses on real property controlled by the Department \nof Veterans Affairs; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                      veterans affairs legislation\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, I have today introduced, at the request of the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, S. 2011, a bill relating to the use of appropriated \nfunds for the operation and maintenance of golf courses on real \nproperty controlled by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs submitted this legislation to the \nPresident of the Senate by letter dated June 20, 1996.\n  My introduction of this measure is in keeping with the policy which I \nhave adopted of generally introducing--so that there will be specific \nbills to which my colleagues and others may direct their attention and \ncomments--all administration-proposed draft legislation referred to the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. Thus, I reserve the right to support or \noppose the provisions of, as well as any amendment to, this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, together with the transmittal letter and the \nenclosed analysis of the draft legislation.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2011\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That\n       Sec. 2. (a) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall ensure \n     that no funds appropriated by Congress are used for the \n     maintenance and operation of golf courses on real property \n     within the control of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary may provide for the maintenance and operation of \n     golf courses on real property within the control of the \n     Department by--\n       (1) entering into leases or other arrangements for a period \n     not to exceed 20 years with (i) Department of Veterans \n     Affairs employee associations; (ii) other nonFederal \n     nonprofit organizations; or (iii) private entities; or\n\n[[Page S9433]]\n\n       (2) entering into enhanced use leases under section 8162 of \n     the title 38, United States Code, without regard to sections \n     8163 and 8168 of title 38, United States Code.\n       (c) In making any arrangement under subsection (b), the \n     Secretary shall, to the extent the Secretary considers \n     appropriate, seek to provide for therapeutic work \n     opportunities for VA patients and members participating in \n     programs authorized by section 1718 of title 38, United \n     States Code.\n       (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, funds \n     generated in connection with the use of real property within \n     the control of the Department of Veterans Affairs that is \n     used for a golf course shall be retained by the Department \n     for such uses as the Secretary deems appropriate.\n       (e) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall, before leasing \n     a golf course on real property within the control of the \n     Department, consider the option of excessing the golf course \n     to the General Services Administration so that the property \n     can be screened for redeployment by another Executive Agency.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                Analysis\n\n       The draft bill contains the enactment section, which is \n     section one, and a section two which contains five \n     subsections.\n       Subsection (a) prohibits the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     from using funds appropriated by the Congress for the \n     maintenance and operation of golf courses at VA health care \n     facilities.\n       Subsection (b) would authorize the Secretary to provide for \n     the maintenance and operation of golf courses at VA health \n     care facilities by leasing the property to VA employee \n     associations or other non-Federal nonprofit organizations. \n     Examples of other nonprofit organizations are a local \n     government, or a veterans service organization. Subsection \n     (b) would also authorize the Secretary to enter into enhanced \n     use leases of golf course properties without regard to \n     limitations set forth in section 8163 and 8168 of title 38, \n     United States Code. Section 8168 limits the number of \n     enhanced use leases the Secretary may enter into, and could \n     be a barrier to the leasing of the golf courses. Section 8163 \n     establishes a process by which properties are designated for \n     enhanced use leasing. It is unnecessary to follow that \n     process for the golf courses as the bill itself designates \n     the properties subject to such leasing.\n       Subsection (c) would provide that in exercising the \n     authority in subsection (b) to make arrangements for the \n     operation of golf courses, the Secretary may, if appropriate, \n     seek to provide for therapeutic work opportunities for \n     patients. Thus, for example, the Secretary might include in a \n     lease, a provision calling for the lessor to enter into an \n     arrangement with a VA compensated work therapy program to \n     have patients perform golf course maintenance.\n       Subsection (d) would permit VA to retain any funds \n     generated by VA real property used as a golf course.\n       Subsection (e) would require the Secretary, before leasing \n     the property, to consider excessing the property for use by \n     another Executive Agency.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            The Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 1996.\n     Hon. Al Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: There is transmitted herewith a draft \n     bill, ``To ensure that no appropriated funds are used for the \n     operation and maintenance of golf courses on real property \n     controlled by the Department of Veterans Affairs.'' We \n     request that it be referred to the appropriate committee for \n     prompt consideration and enactment.\n       For many years VA has operated golf courses at a number of \n     its medical facilities to provide patient therapy and \n     recreation. Generally, these golf courses were in existence \n     at the hospital facilities at the time the Department \n     acquired the facilities. The courses are often quite small \n     with only 9-holes, and are located at facilities with large \n     psychiatric patient populations. Currently 22 VA golf courses \n     exist.\n       VA can no longer justify the expenditure of medical care \n     appropriations for the operation of golf courses. Scarce \n     resources used for maintenance and operation of the courses \n     can be more appropriately used for the direct provision of \n     medical care to veterans. In some instances opportunities may \n     exist to use the property more appropriately. In other \n     instances, continued operation of a golf course may be \n     warranted, but a better mechanism may exist for maintaining \n     and operating the course. Accordingly, the Department has \n     determined that it will no longer directly operate golf \n     courses using appropriated funds.\n       In the last several months, the Department has looked at \n     various mechanisms for divesting itself of golf course \n     operations. However, legal impediments exist to pursuing some \n     options. The enclosed draft bill would statutorily authorize \n     the Secretary to provide for the maintenance and operation of \n     golf courses in various ways without using any appropriated \n     funds.\n       The draft bill would prohibit the use of appropriated funds \n     to operate golf courses, and would provide specific \n     mechanisms for continuing golf course operations. The bill \n     would permit the Secretary to lease or make other \n     arrangements with VA employee associations or other non-\n     federal nonprofit entities to have them operate the \n     courses. Such a nonprofit entity might include the local \n     community where the VA facility is located. The bill would \n     also allow the Secretary to arrange for operation of a \n     course by a private organization. Finally, it would also \n     authorize VA to enter into enhanced use leases of golf \n     course properties.\n       Another provision in the bill would provide that in making \n     arrangements for operation of golf courses, the Secretary \n     should, if appropriate, seek to provide for therapeutic work \n     opportunities for VA patients. VA compensated work therapy \n     programs are always searching for ways to provide certain \n     patients with therapeutic work. In the lease of a golf \n     course, it might be possible to require the lessee to make an \n     arrangement with a VA work therapy program to use patient \n     workers. Finally, the bill would require the Secretary to \n     consider divesting golf courses altogether before entering \n     into lease arrangements.\n       This bill would affect direct spending and receipts; \n     therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of \n     the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB estimates \n     that the pay-as-you-go effect of this proposal is zero.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this draft bill from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                      Jesse Brown.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      By Mr. SIMPSON (by request):\n\n  S. 2012.

Albert Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Transmittal herewith is a draft bill to \n     redesignate the National Cemetery System (NCS) as the \n     ``National Cemetery Administration'' and the Director of the \n     National Cemetery System as the ``Assistant Secretary for \n     Memorial Affairs.'' The legislation would elevate the NCS to \n     the same organizational status within the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs (VA) as the Veterans Health Administration \n     (VHA) and the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). I \n     request that this draft bill be referred to the appropriate \n     committee for prompt consideration and enactment.\n       On March 15, 1989, the Veterans' Administration was \n     redesignated as the Department of Veterans Affairs and \n     elevated to cabinet-level status as an executive department. \n     At that time, two of the three VA components that administer \n     veterans' programs were also redesignated. The Department of \n     Medicine and Surgery was redesignated as the Veterans Health \n     Services and Research Administration (now the Veterans Health \n     Administration) and the Department of Veterans' Benefits was \n     redesignated as the Veterans Benefits Administration. The \n     designation of the third program component, the National \n     Cemetery System, was not changed.\n       On October 9, 1992, the title of the Chief Medical \n     Director, the head of the Veterans Health Administration, was \n     redesignated as the Under Secretary for Health and the title \n     of the Chief Benefits Director was redesignated as the Under \n     Secretary for Benefits. The title of the Director of the \n     National Cemetery System was not changed.\n       The NCS was established on June 18, 1973, in accordance \n     with the National Cemeteries Act of 1973, Pub. L. No. 93-43, \n     Sec. 2(a), 87 Stat. 75. The fourfold mission of the NCS is: \n     (1) to provide for the interment in national cemeteries of \n     the remains of deceased veterans, their spouses, and certain \n     other dependents and to permanently maintain their graves; \n     (2) to mark the graves of eligible persons buried in \n     national, state, and private cemeteries; (3) to administer \n     the State Cemetery Grants Program to aid states in \n     establishing, expanding, or improving state veterans' \n     cemeteries; and, (4) to administer the Presidential Memorial \n     Certificate Program.\n       NCS is the only one of the three VA components responsible \n     for delivering benefits to veterans and their dependents that \n     is referred to as a ``System'' rather than an \n     ``Administration.'' The proposed redesignation ``National \n     Cemetery Administration'' would more accurately recognize \n     NCS' status as a benefit-delivery administration.\n       Section 307 of title 38, United States Code, establishes \n     the position of Director of the National Cemetery System. The \n     present position title implies that the Director's \n     responsibility is limited to management of the system of \n     national cemeteries and does not adequately reflect the \n     responsibilities associated with the fourfold mission of the \n     NCS. The proposed redesignation ``Assistant Secretary for \n     Memorial Affairs'' would assure that the position receives \n     the status commensurate with its responsibilities. The \n     redesignation would not affect the duties and \n     responsibilities of the position, which would remain the \n     same.\n       Section 308(a) of title 38, United States Code, provides \n     that VA shall have no more than six Assistant Secretaries. \n     Under the draft bill, the position of Assistant Secretary for \n     Memorial Affairs, so designated in section 307, would not be \n     counted as one of the six Assistant Secretary positions \n     referred to in section 308(a).\n       Currently, the salary level for the NCS Director is set by \n     statute at Executive Level IV. The salary level for the other \n     VA Assistant Secretary positions is also set at Executive \n     Level IV. The proposed redesignation of the NCS Director as \n     the Assistant Secretary for Memorial Affairs would not affect \n     the salary level of the position, which would remain at \n     Executive Level IV.\n       Although the proposed redesignation would require changes \n     in some forms and publications, we contemplate making these \n     changes as the documents are reordered or revised. For this \n     reason, and because the Director's salary level would not \n     change, no costs or savings are associated with this \n     proposal.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the submission of this draft bill from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                      Jesse Brown.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Coats, Mr. Stevens, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Ashcroft, and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 2013. A bill to amend title 31, United States Code, to provide for \ncontinuing appropriations in the absence of regular appropriations; to \nthe Committee on Appropriations.\n\n\n                 the government shutdown prevention act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today Senators Coats, Stevens, Hutchison, \nAbraham, Ashcroft, and myself are introducing the Government Shutdown \nPrevention Act. This bill would statutorily create what is in essence a \npermanent backup CR. This special CR would govern if any appropriations \nacts do not become law.\n  We all saw the effects of gridlock last year. The Government shut \ndown and millions of people were affected. We want to ensure that \nanother Government shutdown does not occur.\n  Mr. President, this permanent backup CR would set spending at the \nlower of spending levels contained in:\n  First, the previous year's appropriated levels; second, the House \npassed appropriations bill; third, the Senate passed appropriations \nbill; fourth, the President's Budget request; or fifth, any levels \nestablished by an independent CR passed by the Congress subsequent to \nthe passage of this Act.\n  The bill specifically notes that entitlements such as Social \nSecurity--as obligated by law--will be paid regardless of what \nappropriations bills are passed. I want to emphasize that entitlements \nare protected.\n  This legislation does not erode the power of the appropriators and \ngives\n\n[[Page S9435]]\n\nthem ample opportunity to do their job. As a matter of fact, we hope \nthat Senators will realize that if they load up appropriations bills \nwith nonrelated riders--which causes gridlock--that this permanent CR \nwill kick in.\n  I want to especially note the support of my good friend Senator \nStevens. The Senator from Alaska is a senior member of the \nAppropriations Committee. His support of this bill is crucial and I \nthank him for it.\n  Mr. President, last year's Government shutdown hurt many. Many needed \nsocial services could not be offered. We must prevent that from \noccurring. Additionally, it cost the Government a considerable amount \nof money. We cannot and should not waste the taxpayers dollars in that \nfashion.\n  I want to raise one small example. During the last Government \nshutdown, I heard form people who work close to the Grand Canyon. These \nwere not Government employees. They were independent small businessmen \nand women. They told me that the shutdown was costing them thousands of \ndollars because people couldn't go the park.\n  The shutdown was not fair to them--it was not fair to anyone. This \nlegislation would prevent a similar shutdown in the future. This bill \nwill prevent gridlock, save money, and preserve needed Government \nservices. I hope the Senate will soon act on this matter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n\n                                S. 2013\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague and friend, \nSenator John McCain, to introduce The Government Shutdown Prevention \nAct. This legislation will create a statutory continuing resolution \n[CR] that will ensure that the Government will not shut down again--\never.\n  The lessons from last year are clear. The public expects us to debate \nour differences vigorously but they don't want our differences to \noverwhelm our basic responsibility to govern. No one wins when the \nGovernment shuts down. Shutdowns only confirm the American people's \nsuspicions that we are more interested in political gain than doing the \nNation's business. People are tired of gridlock. They want the \nGovernment to work for them--not against them.\n  I believe the legislation we are introducing today will go a long way \ntoward ensuring that we do not once again disappoint the American \npeople. Last year, the Republican Congress tried to do the right thing. \nWe passed fiscally sound appropriations bills and the first balanced \nFederal budget in a generation. Unfortunately, President Clinton was \nmore interested in playing politics with the budget. President \nClinton's irresponsible vetoes of numerous appropriations bills and a \ncontinuing resolution shut the Federal Government down. It is time to \nshow the American people we can do better.\n  Now, we all know that the fiscal year ends on September 30 and we \nalso know that day is approaching very quickly. Although the \nappropriators are working very diligently, the appropriations process \nis nowhere near complete. Not one of the appropriations bills has even\n\n[[Page S9436]]\n\nbeen sent to the President. My fear is that we are rapidly approaching \na politically sensitive deadline in a political year--a virtual \ninvitation for more budget gamesmanship on the part of the President.\n  Our legislation preempts this gamesmanship by a safety net CR that \nwill allow the Government to operate even if the appropriations process \nis not complete and even if negotiations on a larger CR are stalled.\n  Neither party can afford another break of faith with the American \npeople. Our constituents are tired of constantly being disappointed by \nthe actions of Congress and the President. They are tired of us not \nbeing prepared for what appears to be the inevitable. This is why \nSenator McCain and I have introduced this legislation. We want the \nAmerican people to know that there are some of us in Congress who are \nthinking ahead and who do not want a replay of last year.\n\n  Both Senator McCain and myself have been vigilant in our fight \nagainst wasting the taxpayers dollars. The legislation will save \ntaxpayer dollars because the Government programs will be funded at the \nlowest of the following spending levels:\n  The previous year's appropriation bill or CR;\n  The House-passed level;\n  The Senate-passed level;\n  The President's budget request; or\n  The level outlined in the most recent CR.\n  This legislation will restore the bias in appropriations negotiations \ntoward saving the taxpayers money not spending it. It is worth noting \nthat last year every time Congress went to the negotiating table the \nPresident demanded more money. Although Congress saved the taxpayer \nnearly $19 billion last year, without President Clinton's demands we \ncould have saved $27 billion. Passage of this legislation will \nguarantee that we are not faced with a choice between a Government shut \ndown and spending taxpayer dollars irresponsibly.\n  Finally, the hammer of very low funding levels will keep pressure on \nboth ends of Pennsylvania Avenue and both parties to get the \nappropriations work done.\n  Again, this is a preventative measure to ensure that politics or \nstalled negotiations will not stop Government operations. The time has \ncome to show the American people that we will not allow a Government \nshut down, or the threat of a Government shutdown, to be used for \npolitical gain.\n  Time is running out. September 30 will be here in just 2 short \nmonths. We must be prepared in case election year politics get in the \nway of funding the Government. Senator McCain and I will be offering \nthis legislation as an amendment to the first appropriations bill the \nSenate turns to following the recess. Let's not continue to disappoint \nan already disenchanted electorate. The time has come to take control \nand pass this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSTON (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 2014. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire \nproperty adjacent to the city of New Orleans, Orleans Parish, LA, for \ninclusion in the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n         the bayou sauvage national wildlife refuge act of 1996\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I introduce a measure that would \nbe the culmination of many years of negotiation and effort on the part \nof a number of interested individuals in my State of Louisiana.\n   Mr. President, the State of Louisiana is rich in wildlife and \nwildlife habitat, the flora and fauna of legend. The State is also home \nto numerous wildlife refuges, including the Bayou Sauvage National \nWildlife Refuge, which is the subject of my statement today.\n  Bayou Sauvage is located in east Orleans Parish, LA, almost entirely \nwithin the corporate limits of the city of New Orleans and \napproximately 18 miles east of the central business district. It has \nthe distinction of being the largest expanse of coastal wetlands in the \nUnited States that is easily accessible to city dwellers.\n  The refuge was created in 1986 by legislation sponsored by then \nCongressman John Breaux and Representative Lindy Boggs. The measure \nauthorized the refuge at 19,000 acres. In 1993, fee title had been \nacquired on 18,397 acres. An additional 4,373 acres was under \nmanagement lease from the Conservation Fund and the city of New \nOrleans.\n  After discussions with the city, the Conservation Fund and private \nindividuals with interests in the additional acreage, I am pleased to \nreport that a critical stage of acquisition is now ready to go forward. \nThe acreage which is the subject of this legislation is key to the \nability of the managers of Bayou Sauvage to achieve specific goals, \nincluding enhancing the population of migratory, shore, and wading \nbirds; encouraging natural diversity of fish and wildlife species; \nprotecting endangered and threatened species; and providing \nopportunities for scientific research and environmental education on \necological and wetland values to the public.\n   Mr. President, this is an important milestone for Bayou Sauvage \nNational Wildlife Refuge, and I urge this body to support the \ncompletion of this long effort to protect a wonderful treasure for the \npeople of Louisiana, and the Nation.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2014\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to convey certain real property located within the \nCarlsbad project in New Mexico to the Carlsbad Irrigation District; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                      carlsbad project legislation\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill convey tracts of land, referred to as ``acquired lands,'' to the \nCarlsbad Irrigation District in New Mexico.\n  This bill is a culmination of over a year's worth of work, addressing \nconcerns that were raised over legislation that Senator Craig and I \nintroduced early last year.\n  That legislation used a generic approach to direct the Secretary of \nthe Interior to convey these acquired lands to the beneficiary \ndistricts, when those districts had completed their contractual \nobligations to the United States for project construction.\n  The administration is on record in support of the idea of transfer of \nfacilities to the beneficiaries, ``where it makes sense,'' but it \nopposed that legislation, in part because of the generic nature in \nwhich it was drafted.\n  I hope that the legislation I am introducing today will address the \nadministration's concerns with the earlier bill.\n  It is specific to the Carlsbad project in New Mexico, and directs the \nCarlsbad Irrigation District to continue to manage the lands as they \nhave been in the past, for the purposes for which the project was \nconstructed.\n  This bill also protects the interests that the State of New Mexico \nhas in some of those lands, and a companion bill introduced in the \nHouse by Congressman Joe Skeen has the full support of the Governor and \nthe various Cabinet Secretaries who oversee those interests.\n  Finally, this legislation will return project lands, which were at \none time held by the beneficiaries of the Carlsbad project and its \npredecessor, to the Carlsbad Irrigation District.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, \nand\n\n[[Page S9437]]\n\nask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2015\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United State of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to assess the impact of the NAFTA, to require further \nnegotiation of certain provisions of the NAFTA, and to provide for the \nwithdrawal from the NAFTA unless certain conditions are met; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                      The NAFTA Accountability Act\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the North American Free Trade Agreement \nhas been a colossal failure. It epitomizes what is wrong with our \nnation's trade policies.\n  This Nation has focused practically all of its efforts on achieving \nsome theoretical system of free trade, without giving any real \nattention to whether what is advanced also provides fair trade and fair \ncompetition. We open our borders and provide access to our markets, \nwithout ensuring that at the same time there will be reciprocal trading \nopportunities with our trading partners.\n  NAFTA has not produced the results that were projected. It has not \nlived up to its promises. Since NAFTA took effect our trade deficit \nwith Canada and Mexico has ballooned by 368 percent.\n  Today, Canada and Mexico are the third and fourth largest trade \ndeficits for the United States. Rather than stopping the flight of \nAmerican jobs, it has accelerated the loss of jobs to our closest \ntrading partners.\n  Today, I am reintroducing the NAFTA Accountability Act. This bill \nestablishes benchmarks for measuring whether or not NAFTA has lived up \nto its promises. If it doesn't then the bill outlines the procedure for \nwithdrawing from NAFTA.\n  In reintroducing this bill we are updating some of the information in \nthe findings and we are adding a section on highway safety. In \naddition, we are adding a number of co-sponsors. Senators D'Amato, \nInouye, Hollings, and Wellstone are joining the list of original co-\nsponsors, including Senators Byrd, Heflin, and Campbell.\n  The companion bill on the House side, sponsored by Representative \nMarcy Kaptur now has 107 co-sponsors.\n\n\n                    Trade Deficits Continue to Grow\n\n  One of the untold stories of NAFTA is the growing trade deficit with \nCanada. Prior to NAFTA, the merchandise trade deficit was over $10 \nbillion in 1993. In 1994 it grew to $14 billion, and last year it hit a \nrecord of almost $19 billion. In the first 5 months of this year, our \ntrade deficit with Canada is already at almost $9 billion. At this pace \nthe trade deficit this year can be expected to be over $21 billion.\n  The change in our trade position with Mexico is even more dramatic. \nPrior to NAFTA our trade surplus with Mexico peaked in 1992 at $5.4 \nbillion. It then dropped to $1.6 billion in 1993. In the first year of \nNAFTA, the positive trade balance with Mexico dropped to $1.4 billion. \nIn the second year of NAFTA, we ended up with a $15.4 billion trade \ndeficit.\n  Much has been said about the role of the devaluation of the peso as \nthe cause of this dramatic turn-around in trade flows with Mexico. The \nreality is that the problems of the overvalued Mexican peso were well \nknown at the time of the passage of NAFTA.\n  Yet, there was nothing in NAFTA that provided any means to address \nthe question of rapid changes in currency values. Our bill would \nrequire the opportunity for renegotiation in such circumstances.\n  This year the trade deficit with Mexico has already reached almost $7 \nbillion during the first 5 months. At this pace, it will be very close \nto last year's record level of $15 billion.\n  Since NAFTA took effect, the United States has recorded a $42 billion \ntrade deficit with Canada in the 2 years and 5 months for which we have \nstatistics. During that time we have recorded a $20 billion deficit \nwith Mexico.\n  We have accumulated a total trade deficit of $62 billion with these \ntrading partners since NAFTA started regulating these trade \nrelationships. In other words our trade deficit with our NAFTA partners \nis draining over $2 billion a month from our national economy. These \ntrade deficits have serious consequences for our country.\n\n\n                      U.S. Job Losses Due To NAFTA\n\n  Today a study by Rob Scott on the relationship between NAFTA and jobs \nwas released by the Economic Policy Institute. This study reveals that \nthe trade deficits we have had during the first 2 years of NAFTA has \nmeant a loss of almost a half-million jobs and job opportunities for \nAmerican workers.\n  The study shows that as a result of our trade imbalance with Canada, \nwe have lost 200,026 jobs during the past 2 years. In the same period \nthe trade deficit with Mexico has meant a loss of 283,607 jobs. The \ntotal loss of jobs and job opportunities is 483,633.\n  When NAFTA was being debated, the predictions were that the United\n\n[[Page S9438]]\n\nStates would gain something between 120,000 and 220,000 jobs. Now 2 \nyears later, the reality is that our trade relationships under NAFTA \nhave cost this country 484,000 jobs.\n\n\n                         Jobs Moving to Mexico\n\n  One week ago I co-chaired the Families First Forum here in the \nNation's Capitol. At that forum, a union worker in North Carolina told \nus about the upcoming closing of his plant. That plant closing was to \nbe completed today and the jobs moved to Mexico.\n  This is a plant that produces electrical transformers. These are the \ntransformers that hang from electrical poles, sit on pads on the \nground, and even some units that are made for use underground.\n  They have been producing transformers at that plant for 40 years, and \nhave been a profitable operation for most of those years. There are 343 \nhourly workers and 250 salaried workers who today no longer have a job.\n  These workers will no longer be able to be employed using the skills \nthey have learned and developed in building electrical transformers. \nTheir jobs our moving to Monterrey, Mexico, to a facility that pays \nworkers less than a $1 per hour.\n  There is another small industry in this country. It's scattered \naround in rural communities in the heart of the corn belt. This \nindustry is dominated by small family business operations which make \nthe brooms that we use to sweep out our houses. The future of this \nindustry is in doubt.\n  Stan Koschnick, manager of the France Broom Co., told a news \nreporter, ``I don't want to worry my employees too much when they open \ntheir newspapers, but I would guess if it was left unchecked, within 10 \nyears there wouldn't be any brooms made in the United States.''\n  Kenneth Quinn, the retired president of the Quinn Broom Works, \nstates, ``It's hard to say you can compete with somebody when they're \npaying 30 or 40 cents per hour. We can do everything better except for \nwages. We can't compete on wages.''\n  Since NAFTA became reality, more than 200 jobs have been lost in this \nindustry. These companies are paying in the neighborhood of $8 per hour \nto their workers. They are competing with Mexican workers who will be \nlucky to be paid $8 per day.\n  The question is whether such wage competition is good for our \ncountry. There are those who would say we are raising our standard of \nliving by being able to buy a couple of cheaper brooms every year. \nHowever, what are we gaining if at the same time our wages are being \nlowered and our jobs are being lost?\n\n  This industry may get a second chance, because last Friday the \nInternational Trade Commission recommended restoring a tariff on \nMexican brooms. Earlier this month, the ITC determined that unfair \ncompetition from Mexican factories posed a serious threat to the \ndomestic broom industry.\n  The reason they are getting a second chance is that hidden away in \nthe fine print of the NAFTA agreement was a provision that allowed \ntariffs to be restored if the U.S. broom industry got hurt. Other \nindustries are not so lucky, and don't have such provisions. They are \nbeing swept under.\n\n\n                   Industries Experiencing Job Losses\n\n  Let's take a closer look at the industries in which we are losing \njobs and job opportunities under NAFTA. The study released today by the \nEconomic Policy Institute provides some estimates of where we are \nlosing jobs.\n  Our exports to Mexico have been mostly capital goods and intermediate \ninputs which are used to build and supply factories that assemble final \nproducts for export back to the United States.\n  With Mexico, we have lost over 85,000 jobs and job opportunities in \nauto, auto parts, and vehicles. Another 60,000 jobs were lost in \nelectrical equipment, such as televisions and other electronic \nequipment. Over 26,000 jobs in nonelectrical machinery and 20,000 jobs \nin scientific and professional equipment were lost to Mexico.\n  In our trade with Canada, we have lost over 53,000 jobs and job \nopportunities in the paper and allied products industry. We have also \nlost jobs in autos, auto parts, and vehicles to Canada. This accounts \nfor some 38,000 jobs. Another industry where we have lost jobs and job \nopportunities to Canada has been in the production of primary metal \nproducts. That is a loss of 26,000 jobs.\n  Now, these are not what is normally considered unskilled jobs. These \nare jobs that traditionally have paid good salaries and provided an \nindustrial base for our country.\n  The fact is that manufacturing jobs have been the hardest hit within \nthe trade framework established by NAFTA. According to the Economic \nPolicy Institute, 73 percent of the jobs lost to our NAFTA trading \npartners have been lost in the manufacturing sector.\n  That should be of great concern to this country. Our manufacturing \nbase has been what has provided good paying jobs for the bulk of \nAmerican families. As we shift to buying more and more of our \nmanufactured goods from beyond our own borders, we are also \nexperiencing both a shift in jobs and an overall loss in jobs.\n  According to the EPI study, the United States has had a net loss of \n483,633 jobs to our NAFTA trading partners since NAFTA took effect. \nThat reflects an total job loss of 883,717 jobs, while our trade with \nCanada and Mexico created 400,085 jobs. Since almost three-quarters of \nthe net job losses were in the manufacturing sector, this further \nunderscores that we are losing our better paying jobs.\n\n\n                            NAFTA Benchmarks\n\n  As a nation we need to begin systematically measuring how our trade \nagreements are doing. Are they living up to their promises?\n  Are they providing mutually beneficial reciprocal opportunities that \nstrengthen the economies of the participating countries? Are they \nhelping to improve the standard of living in each of the countries or \nare they pitting one nation against another down to the lowest common \ndenominator?\n  Those are the type of questions we are asking within the NAFTA \nAccountability Act. We are asking these questions in nine specific \nareas. In three areas we are requiring some renegotiation of NAFTA so \nit can deal with issues of significant trade deficits, currency \nexchange rates, and agricultural trade distortions.\n  The other six areas are matters of ensuring that the results are \nmeasured and certified. These include certifications in maintaining our \nmanufacturing base; highway safety; health and environmental standards; \njobs, wages, and living standards; rights and freedoms; and, \ncontrolling drug trafficking.\n  We need to make NAFTA accountable. If it doesn't measure up then we \nneed to withdraw from it. We need trade agreements that work. America \ncan no longer afford trade agreements that work against our long-term \neconomic interests.\n  That is why I am pleased to be reintroducing this bill. I am also \npleased that my colleagues, Senators Byrd, Heflin, Campbell, Wellstone, \nHollings, Inouye, and D'Amato are joining in this effort to make NAFTA \naccountable.\n\n

Res. 286\n\n       Whereas Operation Sail is a nonprofit corporation dedicated \n     to building good will among nations and encouraging \n     international camaraderie;\n       Whereas Operation Sail has represented and promoted the \n     United States of America in the international tall ship \n     community since 1964, organizing and participating in \n     numerous tall ship events across the United States and around \n     the world;\n       Whereas Operation Sail has worked in partnership with every \n     American President since President John F. Kennedy;\n       Whereas Operation Sail has established a great tradition of \n     celebrating major events and milestones in United States \n     history with a gathering of the world's tall ships, and will \n     continue this great tradition with a gathering of ships in \n     New York Harbor on July 3 through July 8, 2000, called OpSail \n     2000, to mark the 224th birthday of the United States of \n     America and to welcome the new millennium;\n       Whereas President Clinton has endorsed OpSail 2000, as \n     Presidents Kennedy, Carter, Reagan, and Bush have endorsed \n     Operation Sail in previous endeavors;\n       Whereas OpSail 2000 promises to be the largest gathering in \n     history of tall ships and other majestic vessels like those \n     that have sailed the ocean for centuries;\n       Whereas in conjunction with OpSail 2000, the United States \n     Navy will conduct an International Naval Review; and\n       Whereas the International Naval Review will include a naval \n     aircraft carrier as a symbol of the international good will \n     of the United States of America: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends Operation Sail for its advancement of \n     brotherhood among nations, its continuing commemoration of \n     the history of the United States, and its nurturing of young \n     cadets through training in seamanship;\n       (2) encourages all Americans and citizens of nations around \n     the world to join in the celebration of the 224th birthday of \n     the United States of America and the international \n     camaraderie that Operation Sail and the International Naval \n     Review will foster; and\n       (3) encourages Operation Sail to continue into the next \n     millennium to represent and promote the United States of \n     America in the international tall ship community, and to \n     continue organizing and participating in tall ship events \n     across the United States and around the world.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise today to submit a \nvery special resolution in anticipation of OpSail 2000 and in \nrecognition of the Operation Sail organization that has made events \nsuch as OpSail 2000 possible.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that many of my colleagues remember the \nglorious New York Harbor gatherings of the world's tall ships to mark \nseveral milestones in America's history: OpSail '76 celebrated the \nbicentennial of the Nation; OpSail '86 marked the centennial of the \nStatue of Liberty; and OpSail '92 commemorated the 500th anniversary of \nColumbus' discovery of the ``new world.''\n  In 2000, this grand tradition will continue. America, and indeed the \nentire world, will again be treated to the spectacular display of \ninternational friendship that is OpSail. OpSail 2000 will take place \nJuly 3-July 8, 2000 in New York Harbor to mark the 224th birthday of \nthe United States of America and to welcome the new millennium. It is \nexpected to be the largest gathering in history of the tall ships and \nother majestic vessels like those that have sailed the ocean for \ncenturies.\n  As a symbol of good will of the United States of America, the U.S. \nNavy will conduct an International Naval Review, which will include a \nnaval aircraft carrier. OpSail 2000 is endorsed by President Clinton, \njust as Presidents Kennedy, Carter, Reagan and Bush endorsed Operation \nSail's previous endeavors.\n  Much like the Olympic games our country is currently hosting, OpSail \nevents and Operation Sail are dedicated to building good will among \nnations, encouraging international camaraderie, and nurturing the \nleadership and athleticism of young people through training in \nseamanship. Furthermore, OpSail events and Operation Sail continually \ncommemorate major events in the history of the United States, working \nin partnership with every American President since John F. Kennedy and \nrepresenting and promoting the United States of America in the \ninternational tall ship community.\n  Mr. President, this resolution honors the tradition of the OpSail \nevents--the advancement of international friendship and the celebration \nof milestones in U.S. history--and I urge my colleagues to embrace that \ntradition by supporting this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9439-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nvalor and courage of the 168th Engineer Combat Battalion, which \ncelebrates the unveiling of its commemorative monument at Fort Devens, \nMA, later this month. During World War II, the 168th Engineer Combat \nBattalion was composed entirely of New Englanders, many of them \nresidents of the State I have the good fortune to represent in this \nbody: the great State of Maine. This brave group of soldiers defended \nfreedom and democracy from the will of tyranny in the darkest days of \nWorld War II and the Vietnam conflict. As they reunite to remember \ntheir success and pay homage to their fallen comrades, I'd like to take \na moment today to remember the unit's heroism.\n  Mr. President, any retelling of the pivotal events of the Second \nWorld War in Europe must include the deeds of the 168th. They were \nthere with General Patton in July 1944 when the Allies landed on the \nbeaches of Normandy as part of the D-day Invasion. For 10 hard but \nglorious months thereafter, the 168th provided the American ground \nforces in Europe with invaluable logistic support and an iron will that \nwas crucial in turning back the ruthless advance of the Nazis across \nEurope.\n  Perhaps no single mission depicts the heroism, bravery, and grit of \nthe 168th more clearly than its performance in the Ardennes offensive, \nalso known as the Battle of the Bulge. When the forces of Hitler \nlaunched their desperate, last-ditch offensive into the heart of the \nAllied line during the winter of 1944, the 168th displayed the \nresiliency and courage for which it has come to be known. In hopes of \nfracturing the Allied line into its American and British components, \nthe Nazi Army focused all of its lethal energy on breaking through the \nAllied line in Belgium. However, in doing so, the Nazis ran into the \n168th, and the 168th stood fast. With their defiant stand at St. Vith, \nBelgium, the 168th was able to slow the Nazi assault and then provide \nthe larger American force with the logistical support necessary to \nrepel the Nazi war machine once and for all.\n  In remaining at St. Vith, the 168th endured the loss of half its \npersonnel to casualty or Nazi apprehension. Yet, with the loss of every \ncomrade, the depleted 168th exhibited even firmer resolve to drive the \nNazis back across the line. They did so for each other, and they did so \nfor America. But most of all, they refused to succumb to the Nazis \nbecause at that moment, the cause of freedom depended upon them. For \nits valor in battle and efficiency in duty, the 168th was deservingly \nawarded the Distinguished Unit Citation by the U.S. Army. The 168th was \nalso awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre, which was given to foreign \nforces by the Belgian Government for the defense of its nation during \nWorld War II.\n  As if the heroics of the 168th in World War II were not enough, it \nalso served with distinction during the Vietnam conflict, 20 years \nlater. Faced with the daunting task of establishing logistical lines of \nsupport in the harrowing jungles of Southeast Asia, the 168th again \nperformed its tasks masterfully under heavy fire. For its repeated acts \nof bravery, the 168th received the Valorous Unit Citation and the \nMeritorious Unit Citation, and in doing so, reaffirmed its status as an \nelite unit of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\n  Mr. President, as the remaining members of the 168th gather to unveil \ntheir monument at Fort Devens, I think it is appropriate that we all \nremember the intrepid nature displayed again and again by the members \nof the 168th when they were most needed. Whether they were ordered to \nforge roadways and cross rivers in the snowy countryside of Western \nEurope, or devise ways to destroy the vast tunnel systems underneath \nthe steamy jungles of Southeast Asia, the 168th has performed its \nduties with honor and distinction. It is due to the heroism and \nsacrifice of people like the members of the 168th Engineer Combat \nBattalion that Americans enjoy the fruits of freedom today, and for \nthat, we all owe them a deep and heartfelt debt of gratitude.\n  In honor of the contributions made by the 168th in the defense of \nfreedom, I ask that the declarations honoring the 168th Engineer Combat \nBattalion made by the Governors of Maine and Massachusetts, as well as \nthe Corps of Engineers poem be placed in the\n\n[[Page S9441]]\n\nRecord in their entirety to commemorate the unveiling of the 168th \nEngineer Combat Battalion later this month.\n  The material follows:\n\n                      Proclamation--State of Maine\n\n       Whereas, the 168th Engineer Combat Battalion was activated \n     in 1943, consisting of a large number of New England \n     residents, many from Maine and Massachusetts; and\n       Whereas, since 1943, the 168th Engineer Combat Battalion \n     has served with distinction in both World War II and the \n     Vietnam War, earning five distinguished battle honors; and\n       Whereas, during the Battle of the Bulge, the 168th Engineer \n     Combat Battalion held its position at St. Vith, Belgium from \n     December 16 through December 23, 1944, and stopped the German \n     thrust through the Ardennes; and\n       Whereas, following the Battle of the Bulge, the 168th \n     Engineer Combat Battalion was awarded the Distinguished Unit \n     Citation for extraordinary heroism against an armed enemy, \n     and the Belgian Croix de Guerre for outstanding gallantry, \n     heroic action, and bravery in the face of enemy action; and\n       Whereas, during the Vietnam War, the 168th Engineer Combat \n     Battalion again served with distinction and was awarded the \n     Valorous Unit Citation for heroic combat action on or after \n     August 3, 1963, the Meritorious Unit Citation for outstanding \n     service during a period of combat, and the Republic of \n     Vietnam Civil Award for meritorious service and outstanding \n     accomplishments over and above the call of duty; and\n       Whereas, it is appropriate that all Maine citizens \n     recognize and honor the outstanding dedication, sacrifice, \n     and tradition of the 168th Engineer Combat Battalion,\n       Now, therefore, I, Angus S.

SHEEHAN\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding labor leader and an outstanding American. John J. ``Jack'' \nSheehan is retiring after 29 years as legislative director of the \nSteelworkers of America and a total of 45 years of service to his union \nand all working people. He has served as an assistant to three \npresidents of the Steelworkers: Lloyd McBride, Lynn Williams, and \nGeorge Becker.\n  During his 10 years in the Steelworkers' Washington office, Jack \nSheehan has been at the forefront of some of the most important \nlegislative battles in our history, including the creation of the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act [OSHA], the Mine Safety and Health \nAct, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act [ERISA], the Clean Air \nAct, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and much more.\n  Jack Sheehan was born and raised in the Bronx. He was the son of \nIrish immigrants. His father drove a truck for the New York City \nSanitation Department. Jack learned early in his life about the daily \nstruggles of working men and women who worked hard, who toiled through \nthe Great Depression of the 1930s, and who fought and won World War II \nin the 1940s.\n  He saw the destructive effects of discrimination in our society and \nbecame a champion of the cause of civil rights and equal opportunity.\n  He saw how poverty deprived people of their dignity and became an \nadvocate for social and economic development programs that promised \nmillions of Americans a better life.\n  He knew how important a clean and healthy environment is to the lives \nand well-being of all Americans and became an environmental advocate.\n  He understood that the labor movement is a progressive force for \nsocial and economic change that could better the lives of millions of \nAmericans.\n  Upon graduating from St. Joseph's College in 1951, he joined the \nadministrative staff of the United Steelworkers of America. In 1952, he \nwas appointed auditor under the secretary-treasurer's office and \ntraveled extensively throughout the United States on behalf of the \nunion. In 1959, Jack came to the Steelworkers' Washington, DC, \nlegislative office and launched a career as a labor lobbyist that has \nbeen nothing short of spectacular.\n\n  Jack worked to ensure the passage of the Manpower Training and \nDevelopment Act and the Area Redevelopment Act. He was one of the first \nlabor leaders to stand with the environmental movement for clean air \nand clean water. He continues to serve as a board member of the Natural \nResources Defense Council. He is also one of the founding members of \nthe Consumer Federation of America.\n  Perhaps the single most important fight of Jack's long and \ndistinguished career was the fight to save the lives and health of \nworkers on the job. Jack committed himself totally to securing the \npassage of OSHA, despite strong business opposition and even some \nopposition within the ranks of the labor movement. OSHA recently marked \nits 25th anniversary. It has been estimated that since the passage of \nOSHA, more than 150,000 workers' lives have been saved because of this \nlaw. There probably would not have been an OSHA law passed in 1970 had \nit not been for the steadfast leadership and determination of Jack \nSheehan.\n  ERISA was written in 1974 because thousands of American workers were \nlosing their pensions and their right to retire with financial security \nwhen their employers went out of business. Jack worked tirelessly to \nsee that Congress passed ERISA. America's working men and women are \nbetter off today because Jack Sheehan was here in the halls of Congress \non their behalf.\n  Mr. President, Jack Sheehan's career is a tribute to his intelligence \nand determination. I know that my colleagues in the Senate join me in \nextending to Jack our very best wishes\n\n[[Page S9442]]\n\nupon his retirement from the Steelworkers. Jack Sheehan has truly been \na ``Man of Steel'' for the Steelworkers and all American \nworkers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9441-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n S. 1729, THE INTERSTATE STALKING PUNISHMENT AND PREVENTION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nInterstate Stalking Punishment and Prevention Act of 1996. For far too \nlong, the victims of stalkers have lived in fear and insecurity. This \nlegislation, introduced by Senator Hutchison, will give them the \nprotection they need and deserve. At this time, this bill is awaiting \naction in the Judiciary Committee. I urge my fellow Senators on both \nsides of the isle to support bringing it to the floor as quickly as \npossible. The safety of stalking victims can not be delayed.\n  Experts estimate that there are close to 200,000 people who are \ncurrently stalking someone, and approximately 400,000 protective or \nrestraining orders are issued each year. Currently, stalkers can follow \ntheir victims when they cross State lines, knowing full well that any \nrestraining orders pertaining to them are rendered useless upon leaving \nthe State that they were issued in. Common sense demands that this \nsituation needs to be fixed.\n  This bill will make it a felony for a person to cross State lines in \norder to harass or injure their victim. We are not decreasing the power \nor role of the State authorities by making stalking a Federal crime. \nStalking will remain a State crime. This legislation will allow local \nand State authorities to work with the Justice Department and apply all \nof their resources in the apprehension and conviction of these \ncriminals. A stalker convicted under this law will be subject to one of \nseveral penalties: 5 years if State lines are crossed, 10 years if the \nvictim is seriously harmed, 20 years if the victim is permanently \nscarred, and life imprisonment if the victim is killed. I have \nand always will be an advocate of matching the punishment to the crime. \nThe strong penalties within this bill are steps in the right direction \nin the war against crime.\n\n  The Violence Against Women Act of 1993 defined a stalking victim as \nan ``intimate partner or spouse.'' This bill will change that term to \n``victim,'' allowing protection for all people who are stalked, whether \nby strangers or otherwise. Again, common sense will prevail. Of course \nthe protection of stalking victims should be universal and apply to all \nvictims, whether they are a wife, a girlfriend, a coworker, or a total \nstranger.\n  Mr. President, this is a law that will protect stalking victims and \nallow them to travel, without fear, as all citizens should, throughout \nour country. With respect to family members, this bill will help ease \ntheir worries. I can only imagine the terror that families feel when \none of their own is being stalked. With this thought, I urge my \ncolleagues to stand with me in support of this bill and in support of \nall the victims who have suffered at the hands of stalkers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9442-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MUTUAL AID AGREEMENT\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about House \nJoint Resolution 166, a bill we passed late last night, to grant the \nconsent of Congress to the Mutual Aid Agreement between the city of \nBristol, VA, and the city of Bristol, TN. Specifically, this bill would \nallow law enforcement officers in the cities of Bristol, VA, and \nBristol, TN, when requested by the adjoining city, to cross State lines \nin the performance of their duties and operate with full authorization \nin the adjoining city once there.\n  Last May, I met with members of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce and \ndiscussed the need to alleviate Federal hurdles that keep the two \ncities from working together to address a host of municipal issues. The \nVirginia-Tennessee State line cuts across State Street in Bristol, \nwhich is the cities' main thoroughfare. Often, jurisdictional confusion \nand restrictions on law enforcement personnel caused by the location of \nthe State line complicate anticrime activities on the bustling street. \nUnder current law, the cities are prohibited from assisting each other \nin law enforcement efforts. To address the problem, the two cities \nadopted a mutual aid agreement to allow each city to provide law \nenforcement and emergency assistance to one another. Under the terms of \nthe agreement, the responding city could provide a maximum of 50 \npercent of available personnel and resources to the requesting city.\n  The mutual aid agreement has been fashioned according to the cities' \nrespective State statutory requirements. Because the mutual aid \nagreement is an interstate compact, it requires congressional approval. \nAdditionally, section 15.1-131 of the 1950 Code of Virginia, as \namended, also requires congressional approval for multi-state \nagreements to which Virginia or one of its localities is a party.\n  I am pleased that the Senate was able to move this bill quickly. This \ncould not have happened without the full cooperation of the Senators \nfrom both States. Representatives Boucher and Quillen should also be \nrecognized for introducing this legislation and sheparding it through \nthe House.\n  The two cities of Bristol share common interests and common problems, \nand now with passage of this bill, the two cities will be able to work \nmore cooperatively for the betterment of all the citizens of \nBristol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9442-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NEW HAMPSHIRE OLYMPIAN LYNN JENNINGS\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lynn \nJennings of Newmarket, NH, for her competition in the 1996 Summer \nOlympic Games in Atlanta. Lynn competed in the 5,000-meter run Friday \nJuly 26 and was the first American to cross the finish line. New \nHampshire is proud of her dedication and commitment to training for \nsuch a competitive sport.\n  At age 36, this is Lynn's third time to compete with the U.S. Olympic \ntrack team. Lynn's long career exemplifies marks of distinction and \nexcellence. She competed in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul and in the 1992 \nBarcelona Olympics she became the only American woman to earn a \ndistance medal when she took home the bronze in the 10,000-meter run. \nPreviously, the greatest distance in which an American woman had \nmedaled was 800-meters and Lynn broke that record. Lynn has also been \nthe World Cross Country Champion three times, holding the title from \n1990-1992. She is an eight time National Cross Country Champion and \nholds American records in the 10,000-meter, indoor 3,000-meter, and the \n8- and 10-kilometer road courses.\n  Lynn's distinguished record is the mark of an Olympian and a \nchampion. She has pursued her sport with determination, followed her \ndream, and embodied the Olympic spirit. New Hampshire has followed her \ncareer and she has made the Granite State proud. Many people from New \nHampshire watched Lynn compete last Friday and join me in saluting her \nfor representing them at the 1996 Summer Olympic Games. I commend her \nfor her efforts in Atlanta and wish her other running successes at \nfuture competitions. Congratulations Lynn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9442-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9442-S9443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MUTUO CLUB OF BARRE, VT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mutuo Soccorso. In Italian, it means society of \nmutual aid. But for my Italian immigrant grandfather who worked in the \ngranite quarries of Barre and South Ryegate, VT, it meant much, much \nmore.\n  It meant financial security in the days before Social Security and \nMedicare. It meant affordable health care when they could not afford \nhealth insurance. It meant they had a second family when their families \nwere thousands of miles away in their homeland. To Peter and Vincenza \nZambon, my grandparents, Mutuo Soccorso meant the Mutuo Club of Barre, \nVT.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to celebrate the 90th birthday of the Mutuo \nClub, the Italian-American club of central Vermont. Since 1906, the \nMutuo Club has represented the finest values of our immigrant \nheritage--a special sense of community and friendship.\n  The Mutuo Club was first established as an offspring of the old \nsociety clubs in Italy during the 19th century. Members of the Mutuo \npaid so much a week into a common fund to help when they and their \nfamilies got sick. The Mutuo fund helped pay the doctor and hospital\n\n[[Page S9443]]\n\nbills. Members of the Mutuo pulled together to help each other. Each \nmember was in effect his brother's keeper.\n  When my grandfather came to Vermont from Italy, he went to the \ngranite quarries to earn a modest living. Life was not easy--tough \nwork, low pay, and health hazards. But in this foreign land, he had the \nMutuo Club as a special community to share friendships in good times \nand a helping hand in bad times.\n  I remember as a small child walking with my grandfather down the \nstreets of downtown Barre. He would often stop in the street to visit \nwith fellow Mutuo Club members. They would tell stories, plan to help \neach other, or just learn the latest joke. I remember sensing a special \nbond of community and friendship between my grandfather and the other \nItalian-Americans of the Mutuo Club.\n  Now, the Mutuo Club is open to Americans of all nationalities. And \nthat same special bond of community and friendship enjoyed by my \ngrandfather is still shared by members of the Mutuo Club today.\n  Mr. President, the Mutuo Club is a living tribute to that special \nbond. In celebrating the Mutuo Club's 90th birthday, we celebrate that \nspecial sense of community and friendship shared by the Mutuo Club \nmembers of yesterday, today, and tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9442-4", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n STEPHEN NORTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE'S SECONDARY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nStephen North for being named New Hampshire's Secondary School \nPrincipal of the Year. Steve is the principal of Profile Junior and \nSenior High School in Bethlehem, NH, a position he has held since 1977. \nAs a former teacher and school board chairman myself, I congratulate \nhim for receiving this prestigious award.\n  Steve celebrates a long and distinguished career in education. He has \nbeen a teacher at Hanover High School, Curriculum Coordinator for the \nDresden-Hanover School Districts, and both principal and assistant \nprincipal at Frances C. Richmond Middle School in Hanover. Steve's 18 \nyears in education have been marked with success and leadership in this \nregional school district. He has built a reputation for excellence and \nachievement in many areas, from teacher to administrator. An example of \nSteve's achievement is the completion of much needed additions and \nrenovations for Profile Junior and Senior School. This project, under \nhis leadership, was completed in just 5 years.\n  Steve's achievements can be seen in more than new buildings, he has \nearned the respect and admiration of his colleagues for his efforts. He \nis an excellent role model for his peers because of his professional \nactivities, leadership abilities, and commitment to community. Steve is \ninvolved in various educational organizations including the New England \nAssociation of Schools and Colleges, the New Hampshire Association of \nSchool Principals, and the North Country Principals Association.\n  Teachers and students alike admire Steve for what he has done for the \nschool. He is known as someone who mentors new teachers, encourages \ninnovation, promotes professionalism, and creates a sound educational \nenvironment. Under his supervision, Profile Junior and Senior High won \nthe 1995 Sportsmanship Banner for exemplifying the positive tenets of \ngood sportsmanship. This type of achievement reflects the type of \nmotivation Steve provides for his school.\n  Our children are very important to our future and I am proud to see \nthat they are in such capable hands. New Hampshire is fortunate to have \nsuch a talented educator and administrator like Steve North.

Mr. President, on June 6 of this year, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs presented four very prestigious awards \nrecognizing excellence in nursing. I am proud to congratulate all of \nthese nurses, but I am especially proud of a fellow West Virginian, \nSharon Shade, the recipient of VA's 1996 LPN of the year award. \nSharon's performance in the nursing home care unit of the Martinsburg, \nVA Medical Center is truly outstanding. As a member of the Martinsburg \ncommunity, she has made a great difference.\n  Sharon has made many changes, both big and small, that have improved \nthe lives of her patients. Because she works with the patients on a \none-on-one basis, she learns about their interests while determining \ntheir needs. For example, she found out that a reclusive patient had an \ninterest in music. With her help and encouragement, he began to DJ at \nthe noon meals and is now a thriving member of the high-level \ncommunication group. A bedridden patient now joins the noon dining \ngroup with the help of a walker, due to Sharon's special attention. \nThese are just a few examples of the changes Sharon has made in the \nlives of individual patients.\n  Sharon is truly creative and original in her approach to care, with \nideas that benefit the entire program. One of her more innovative \ntechniques includes an Adopt-A-Plant program. Here patients can adopt a \nplant to take care of, giving them a sense of hope. Another program \nincludes a reminiscence group in which the patients talk about days \ngone by. Sharon also arranged to move wheelchair-bound patients nearer \nto the windows in the dining hall where they can get a better view of \nthe outdoors. These simple, yet thoughtful acts have made an enormous \ndifference in the overall morale of both the residents and staff.\n  Sharon is known for her dedication to her profession. She is \nconstantly working to make things better for her patients and for the \nstaff. In addition to attending meetings and training seminars, she \ntook initiative in developing her own survey to evaluate the program. \nTo lend support to her coworkers, she has implemented a monthly \nrestorative LPN meeting where she shares ideas and literature. She is \npraised by fellow members of the staff, her patients, and their \nfamilies for her tireless efforts. The human spirit needs support and \nencouragement, both of which Sharon has generously given.\n  I am proud to recognize Sharon Shade and her remarkable talent for \nmaking the lives of the veterans at Martinsburg better. It is clear \nthat Sharon is a valuable asset to her staff, her profession, her \npatients, and our State of West Virginia. Her commitment to her \nprofession and her community makes me enormously proud to say that she \nis a fellow West Virginian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9443-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9443-S9444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MICHAEL TOCCI, NEW HAMPSHIRE'S ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMichael Tocci for being named New Hampshire's Secondary School \nPrincipal of the Year. Mike is the principal of Gilford Elementary \nSchool in Gilford, NH, a position he has held since 1964. As a former \nteacher and school board chairman in the Lakes Region myself, I \ncongratulate him for receiving this prestigious award.\n  Mike celebrates a long and distinguished career in education. He \nreceived his bachelors in education in 1967 his masters in public \nschool administration and Supervision in 1973 from Plymouth State \nUniversity. Mike has served as teaching principal at Danbury Elementary \nand supervising elementary principal for Newfound Area School District \nin Bristol. In his 30-year career, he has built a reputation for \nexcellence and achievement in many areas, from teacher to \nadministrator.\n  Mike is known among his colleagues for his leadership, enthusiasm, \ndedication, and contribution to children's education. His honest and \ncaring spirit is reflected in the school's positive atmosphere. As an \nindividual of distinction, Mike provides an excellent role model for \nhis students and his teachers.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nSenate's passage last night of S. 1995, legislation I cosponsored to \nauthorize construction of a Smithsonian Institution National Air and \nSpace Museum extension at Washington Dulles International Airport. This \nDulles center, which will be built without any Federal funds, will \nprovide crucial additional exhibit space for displaying national \naviation treasures to the public.\n  The current Air and Space Museum on the Mall is filled to capacity. \nThere is no room to store any more of our large, invaluable aviation \nartifacts. These artifacts are currently stored in warehouses, hidden \nfrom the public, and some even stored outside, where they are exposed \nto the elements. The passage of S. 1995 places us on track to provide a \nsafe and secure facility to house and preserve, for the public, these \nhistorical aircraft and spacecraft such as the B-29 Enola Gay, the \nSpace Shuttle Enterprise, and the SR-71 Blackbird. This bill seeks to \nsave these irreplaceable artifacts for our children and our future \ngenerations.\n  Mr. President, in 1946, President Truman, believing in the importance \nof preserving our historical aircraft, signed Public Law 722 \nestablishing the National Air Museum. Twenty years later, in 1966, \nPresident Johnson understood the importance of this museum and signed \nthe law authorizing construction of a National Air and Space Museum, \nwhich expanded the museum's collection efforts to include spacecraft \nand lunar artifacts. This museum was built on the National Mall here in \nWashington, opening its doors in 1976 and becoming the world's most \nvisited museum, averaging over 8 million visitors per year.\n  In keeping with this tradition of preservation and planning for the \nfuture, the Senate has passed S. 1995. When it becomes law, we will be \nable to house historical air and spacecraft, underscoring the major \nadvances we have developed and the contributions to history we have \nmade. Construction efforts for the Air and Space extension at Dulles, \nestimated to cost $200 million, represents exemplary coordination \nbetween public funds from the Commonwealth of Virginia and private \nsources. It is expected that the Smithsonian Institution National Air \nand Space Museum Dulles Center could be completed by 2003, in time for \nthe 100 year anniversary of the Wright Brothers' first flight. This \nDulles Center is an incredible, historical effort that will be a \nbenefit to us now and for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9444-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NEW HAMPSHIRE OLYMPIAN, BARBARA MAROIS\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nBarbara Marois of Dover, NH for her competition in the 1996 summer \nOlympic games in Atlanta. Barb captained the women's field hockey team \nin their impressive series of games. This year's Olympic hockey team is \nthe best team the United States has ever fielded. New Hampshire is \nproud of Barb's dedication and commitment to training for such a \ncompetitive sport.\n  Barb competed with the 1988 U.S. Olympic field hockey team in Seoul \nand this year she led the team into competition on home turf. Her long \nsports career, beginning 10 years ago, bears the marks of distinction \nand excellence. Barb has competed in 119 international contests and her \nteam placed third in the 1994 World Cup. Field hockey has been gaining \npopularity over recent years, largely because of outstanding athletes \nin the sport like her.\n  The women's field hockey team gave an outstanding performance at this \nyear's Olympic games. They defeated the No. 2 ranked South Korean team \nwith a 3-2 victory and tied the well-respected Dutch team with a score \nof 1-1. Incidentally, the final point in the game with South Korea was \nscored by Barb from one of the penalty corners. She is known as a \nsteady defensive force and a powerful weapon on penalty corners by her \nteammates. During the games she scored one goal and had 38 \ninterceptions and 3 steals.\n  Barb is arguably one of the keys to the field hockey team's \nimprovement over the last few years. This national team captain is the \nteam mentor and maker of history in field hockey. She is a three time \nU.S. Field Hockey Association Female Athlete of the Year and has been \nan assistant coach at her alma mater, the University of New Hampshire.\n  Barb's distinguished record is the mark of an Olympian and a \nchampion. Her driving sprit has enabled her to pursue her sport with \ndetermination and follow her dream. New Hampshire has followed her \ncareer and she has made the Granite State proud. Many people watched \nBarb lead the women's field hockey team. I join them in saluting her \nfor representing them at the 1996 summer Olympic games and I commend \nher for her efforts in Atlanta.

On June 26, 1996, Denice Reese, of Hendricks, WV, was named \n``National School Nurse of the Year'' by the National Association of \nSchool Nurses. Along with all the people of West Virginia, I am proud \nof the accomplishments of Denice Reese. She is an example of dedicated \nand skilled school nurses everywhere, and especially of the 127 school \nnurses of West Virginia. I join her colleagues in recognition and \npraise for her service to the children and families of the Tucker \nCounty, WV, school system.\n  Denice Reese is the first--and only--school nurse for the 4 schools \nand 1,400 students of Tucker County, whom she has served for the past 8 \nyears. By naming her the ``National School Nurse of the Year,'' her \npeers have recognized her outstanding work in this rural school \ndistrict with many needs but few resources.\n  Among her professional accomplishments, she helped get the Tucker \nCounty system designated as a pilot area for the Healthy Schools \nproject. She has been an innovative leader, and has created model \nstudent and faculty health education programs. She has collaborated \nwith other professionals to optimize the use of school system resources \nfor health promotion and disease prevention.\n  At a time when health, nutrition, and education programs for our \nNation's children are in jeopardy, the work of the country's school \nnurses stands as an inspiration and reminder that our children are our \nfuture. On behalf of all Americans who are working to ensure that the \nNation maintains its investment in the health and well-being of its \nchildren, I express gratitude for the partnership of our school nurses. \nMr. President, I congratulate Denice Reese on her accomplishments, and \nwish her all the best as she continues her important work on behalf of \nthe people of Tucker County.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9444-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9444-S9445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   BARRY ALBERT, NEW HAMPSHIRE'S MIDDLE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH.

Barry is principal of Franklin Middle School, a position he \nhas held since 1990. As a former teacher and school board chairman \nmyself, I congratulate him for receiving this prestigious recognition.\n  Barry has had a long and distinguished career in education. He \ngraduated from Plymouth State College in 1970 with a bachelors degree \nin secondary education and earned a master's in learning disabilities \nand special education from Rivier College in 1977. In addition, Barry \nwas a teacher at Merrimack High School and the coordinator of Raymond \nMiddle School. For over 20 years he has been serving the students of \nNew Hampshire and pursuing excellence in education. He has built a \nreputation for achievement among his colleagues in many areas, from \nteaching to administration.\n\n[[Page S9445]]\n\n  Barry is known in his school for his leadership, initiative, and \ndedication to education. Among other achievements, Barry re-started and \nre-organized the Student Congress at Franklin Middle School. His first \nconcern is always for the students and he is unfailing in his \ncommitment to support school activities while constantly seeking to \nensure that students are receiving the best possible education. Barry \nalso created a positive action program at Franklin Middle School, just \nanother of the many ways he serves his school and community.\n  Barry is the personification of an excellent middle school principal \nand the community can be certain that Barry is dedicated to his \nstudents. Franklin Middle School's success and development attests to \nBarry's outstanding leadership. The Granite State is fortunate to have \nsuch a talented educator and administrator devoted to the education of \nour children.

Mr. President, I rise today to support the \nFederal Financial Improvement Act. I want to thank Senator Brown, and \nour 11 cosponsors, for their individual efforts. I believe that the \nbusiness of the people should be done as efficiently and effectively as \npossible. Finding a uniform standard of accounting for the executive \nbranch agencies will be an important element of that efficiency and \neffectiveness. This bill will lead us to that uniform standard.\n  It is impossible to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of the \nmany Federal agencies when each may use a different accounting standard \nfor making their records or books. For each to use a different standard \nis as if each speaks and writes in a different language that is foreign \nto the next. They cannot understand each other, and the story of their \nwork cannot be written.\n  Therefore, the legislative branch cannot measure their efficiency and \neffectiveness. We cannot reconcile the consolidated Federal books. We \ncannot determine the presence of the relative financial failures or \nfinancial successes.\n  This is why this legislation is so important to the American people. \nThe Federal Financial Management Improvement Act is crucial to \nefficiently and effectively doing the people's work, and it has my \nsolid support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9445-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9445-S9447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, a former staff member of mine, Alice \nJohnson, now with the National Institute for Literacy sent me a copy of \nan article by Richard Wolkomir that appeared in the Smithsonian \nmagazine.\n  It tells the story of Richard Wolkomir and another person teaching \nKen Adams how to read at the age of 64.\n  In some ways it is a sad story, looking at his background and looking \nat all the years that could have been enriched.\n  But it is a story that ought to inspire all of us to do better.\n  We ought to have a national effort on literacy.\n  Mr. President, I ask that this article from the Smithsonian be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                  [From the Smithsonian, August, 1996]\n\n        Making Up for Lost Time: The Rewards of Reading at Last\n\n                         (By Richard Wolkomir)\n\n       I decide simply to blurt out, ``Ken?'' I ask. ``Why didn't \n     you learn to read?''Through the Marshfield community center's \n     window, I see snowy fields and the Vermont village's \n     clapboard houses. Beyond, mountains bulge. ``I was a slow \n     learner,'' Ken says. ``In school they just passed me along, \n     and my folks told me I wasn't worth anything and wouldn't \n     amount to anything.\n       Ken Adams is 64, his hair white. He speaks Vermontese, \n     turning ``I'' into ``Oy,'' and ``ice'' into ``oyce.'' His \n     green Buckeye Feeds cap is blackened with engine grease from \n     fixing his truck's transmission, and pitch from chain-sawing \n     pine logs. It is 2 degrees below zero outside on this \n     December afternoon; he wears a green flannel shirt over a \n     purple flannel shirt. He is unshaven, weather reddened. He is \n     not a tall man, but a lifetime of hoisting hay bales has \n     thickened his shoulders.\n       Through bifocals, Ken frowns at a children's picture book, \n     Pole Dog. He is studying a drawing: an old dog waits \n     patiently by a telephone pole, where its owners abandoned it. \n     He glares at the next pictures. Cars whizzing by. Cruel \n     people tormenting the dog. ``Looks like they're shootin' at \n     him, to me!'' he announces. ``Nobody wants an old dog,'' he \n     says.\n       Ken turns the page. ``He is still by the pole,'' he says. \n     ``But there's that red car that went by with those kids, \n     ain't it?'' He turns the page again. The red car has stopped \n     to take the old dog in, to take him home. ``Somebody wants an \n     old dog!'' Ken says. ``Look at that!''\n       This is my first meeting with Ken. It is also my first \n     meeting with an adult who cannot read.\n       I decided to volunteer as a tutor after a librarian told me \n     that every day, on the sidewalks of our prim little Vermont \n     town. I walk by illiterate men and women. We are unaware of \n     them because they can be clever at hiding their inability to \n     read. At a post office counter, for instance, when given \n     forms to fill out, they say, ``Could you help me with this? I \n     left my glasses home.''\n       Ken Adams is not alone in his plight. A 1993 U.S. \n     Department of Education report on illiteracy said 21-23 \n     percent of U.S. adults--about 40 million--read minimally, \n     enough to decipher an uncomplicated meeting announcement. \n     Another 25-28 percent read and write only slightly better. \n     For instance, they can fill out a simple form. That means \n     about half of all U.S. adults read haltingly. Millions, like \n     Ken Adams, hardly read at all.\n       I wanted to meet nonreaders because I could not imagine \n     being unable to decipher a street sign, or words printed on \n     supermarket jars, or stories in a book. In fact, my own \n     earliest memory is about reading. In this memory, in our \n     little Hudson River town, my father is home for the evening \n     from the wartime lifeboat factory where he is a foreman. And \n     he has opened a book.\n       ``Do you want to hear from Peter Churchmouse?'' my father \n     asks. Of course! It is my favorite, from the little library \n     down the street. My father reads me stories about children \n     lost in forests. Cabbage-stealing hares. A fisherman who \n     catches a talking perch. Buy my favorite is Peter \n     Churchmouse, a small but plucky cheese addict who \n     befriends the rectory cat. Peter is also a poet, given to \n     reciting original verse to his feline friend during their \n     escapades. I cannot hear it enough.\n       My father begins to read. I settle back. I am taking a \n     first step toward becoming literate--I am being read to. And \n     although I am only 2, I know that words can be woven into \n     tales.\n       Now, helping Ken Adams learn to read, I am re-entering that \n     child's land of chatty dogs and spats-wearing frogs. \n     Children's books--simply worded, the sentences short--are \n     perfect primers, even for 60-year-olds who turn the pages \n     with labor-thickened fingers and who never had such books \n     read to them when they were children.\n       ``Do you remember what happened from last time?'' asks \n     Sherry Olson, of Central Vermont Adult Basic Education, who \n     tutors Ken and hour and a half each week.\n       I have volunteered as Sherry's aide. My work requires too \n     much travel for me to be a full-fledged tutor. But I am \n     actually relieved, not having sole responsibility for \n     teaching an adult to read. That is because--when I think \n     about it--I don't know how I read myself. I scan a printed \n     page; the letters magically reveal meaning. It is effortless. \n     I don't know how I do it. As for teaching a man to read from \n     scratch, how would I ever begin?\n       Sherry, a former third-grade teacher, gives me hints, like \n     helping Ken to learn words by sight so that he doesn't have \n     to sound out each letter. Also, we read stories so Ken can \n     pick out words in context. Ken reads Dr. Seuss rhyming books \n     and tales about young hippopotamuses helping on the family \n     farm. At the moment, we are reading a picture book about \n     Central American farmers who experience disaster when a \n     volcano erupts.\n       ``The people had to move out, and put handkerchiefs over \n     their noses!'' Ken says, staring at the pages. He starts to \n     read: ``They . . . prayed? . . . for the . . . fire? . . .'' \n     ``Yes, that's right, fire,'' Sherry says. ``They prayed for \n     the fire to . . . go out?'' ``That word is `stop,''' Sherry \n     says.\n       I listen carefully. A few sessions ahead, it will be my \n     turn to try teaching. ``They prayed for the fire to stop,'' \n     Ken says, placing a thick forefinger under each word. ``They \n     watched from the s . . .'' ``Remember we talked about \n     those?'' Sherry says. ``When a word ends in a silent e, what \n     does that silent e do to the vowel?'' ``It makes it say \n     itself,'' Ken says. ``So what's the vowel in s-i-d-e?'' she \n     asks. ``It's i, and it would say its own name, i,'' Ken says, \n     pronouncing it ``oy.'' ``So that would be `side.''' ``Good,'' \n     Sherry says.\n       Ken reads the sentence: ``They watched from the side of the \n     hill!'' He sounds quietly triumphant. ``They-un,'' he says, \n     in backcountry Vermontese. ``That's done it.''\n       After the session, I stand a few minutes with Ken in the \n     frozen driveway. He has one foot on the running board of his \n     ancient truck, which he somehow keeps going. He tells me he \n     was born in 1931 into a family eking out an existence on a \n     hardscrabble farm. His trouble in school with reading is \n     puzzling, because Ken is intelligent.\n       For instance, he says he was late today because he had to \n     fix his truck. And now he launches into a detailed analysis \n     of the transmission mechanisms of various species of trucks. \n     Also, during the tutoring session, we played a game that \n     required strewing\n\n[[Page S9446]]\n\n     word cards upside down on a table and remembering their \n     locations. Ken easily outscored both Sherry and me in this \n     exercise.\n       Ken described himself as a ``slow learner,'' but clearly he \n     is not slow. Sherry had told me he probably suffers from a \n     learning disability. People with these perceptual disorders \n     experience difficulties such as seeing letters reversed. \n     Although their intelligence may actually be above average, \n     learning to read is difficult for them. they need individual \n     tutoring.\n       ``It was a one-room school, with eight grades, so I didn't \n     get much attention there,'' Ken tells me. ``It was just the \n     same as the folks at home were doing when they kicked me \n     along through the grades, and when you got to be 16, that's \n     when they kicked you out.''\n       After he left school, he left home. ``Then you knock \n     around, one farm to another,'' he says. ``I'd get $15 a week, \n     and room and board.'' Besides farming, he worked in bobbins \n     mills and sawmills and granite quarries. ``Then I was at a \n     veneer mill in Bradford,'' he says. `` After that I was \n     caretaker at a farm for six years until I had to give it up \n     because I had heart attacks.''\n       Now he subsists on a $400-a month Social Security \n     disability pension plus $90 a month in food stamps. He lives \n     alone in a farmhouse he built himself more than 25 years ago, \n     five miles up a mountain dirt road. He earns money for his \n     medicines by cutting firewood, haying, digging postholes with \n     his tractor, snowplowing an cutting brush. ``I'm doing odds-\n     and-ends jobs where you can take your time, because the \n     doctor told me I have to stop whenever I fell I need to \n     rest,'' he says.\n       He cannot afford electricity from the power company, but he \n     gets what current he needs, mostly for lights by--\n     ingeniously--drawing it from car batteries. To recharge the \n     batteries, he hooks them up in his truck for a day. He also \n     can charge them with a diesel generator. He waits until \n     prices dip to buy fuel for his generator and tractor. ``I've \n     got a few maples around my house,'' he tells me. ``I'll find \n     a rustedout evaporator, fix it up and make syrup--there's \n     always a few things I can do, I guess.''\n       I ask how he's managed all these years, not reading. He \n     says his bosses did the reading for him. And now a Marshfield \n     couple, lifelong friends, help him read his mail and bills \n     and notices. But they are entering their 80s. ``Now I've got \n     to learn to read myself, as a backup,'' Ken says.\n       To find out more about what illiteracy does to people like \n     Ken, I telephoned the U.S. Department of Education and spoke \n     with the Deputy Secretary, Madeleine Kunin. She told me that \n     only 3-5 percent of adult Americans cannot read at all. ``But \n     literacy is a moving target,'' she said. ``We figure the 40 \n     million who do read, but at the lowest proficiency levels, \n     have difficulty handling some of the tasks they need hold \n     a job today.'' Kunin, a former Vermont governor, cited \n     that state's snowplow drivers: ``Now they have computers \n     attached, and they need a high school degree just to drive \n     a snowplow.''\n       Ken arrives for his next session in a dark mood. It turns \n     out his tape recorder, used for vocabulary practice, is \n     broken, ``I can't fix it because the money's all gone for \n     this month,'' he says. ``I had to go to the doctor, and \n     that's $30, and it was $80 for the pills, and they keep going \n     up.'' He says one of his prescriptions jumped from $6.99 to \n     $13 in two months. ``I don't know if I'll keep taking them,'' \n     he says. Illiteracy has condemned Ken to a lifetime of \n     minimum-wage poverty.\n       He brightens reading a story. It is about a dog, John \n     Brown, who deeply resents his mistress's new cat. Ken \n     stumbles over a word. ``Milk?'' Sherry and I nod. ``Go and \n     give her some milk,'' Ken reads, then pauses to give us a \n     dispatch from the literacy front: ``I was trying to figure \n     that out, and then I see it has an i,'' he says.\n       My own first attempt at solo tutoring finally comes, and I \n     am edgy. Sherry has wryly admonished Ken, ``You help Richard \n     out.'' I show him file cards, each imprinted with a word for \n     Ken to learn by sight. He is supposed to decipher each word, \n     then incorporate it in a sentence. I write his sentence on \n     the card to help him when he reviews at home. Ken peers at \n     the first word.``All,'' he says getting it easily. He makes \n     up a sentence: ``We all went away.''\n       ``That's right,'' I say. Maybe this won't be so hard after \n     all. I write Ken's sentence on the card for him. Then I flip \n     another card. Ken peers at it, his face working as he \n     struggles with the sounds. ``As,'' he says.\n       During our last session, he confused ``as'' and ``at.'' Now \n     he has it right. So he has been doing his homework.\n       ``As we went down the road, we saw a moose,'' Ken says, \n     composing a sentence. That reminds him that the state \n     recently allowed moose hunting, game officials arguing that \n     moose have become so plentiful they cause highway accidents. \n     ``Yesterday, I come around a turn and there was ten moose, a \n     big male and female and young ones,'' Ken says. ``They \n     shouldn't be shooting those moose--they ain't hurting anyone, \n     and it ain't the moose's fault if people don't use their \n     brakes.''\n       I flip another card. ``At!'' Ken says, triumphing over \n     another of our last session's troublemakers. ``We are at the \n     school.'' But the next word stumps him, It is ``be.'' I put \n     my finger under the first letter. ``What's that sound?'' I \n     ask. When he stares in consternation, I make the sound \n     ``buh.'' But Ken is blocked. He can't sound out the next \n     letter, even though he has often done it before. ``Eeeee,'' I \n     say, trying to help. ``Now put the two sounds together.''\n       Ken stares helplessly at the word. I am beginning to \n     understand the deep patience needed to tutor a man like Ken, \n     who began these sessions a year before, knowing the alphabet \n     but able to sound out only a few words. ``Buh . . . eeee,'' I \n     say, enunciating as carefully as I can. ``Buh . . . eeee,'' \n     Ken repeats. Abruptly, his forehead unfurrows. ``Oh, that's \n     `be,' '' he says. ``Be--We should be splitting wood!''\n       ``Was that what you were doing before the tutoring \n     session?'' I ask, to give us both a break. ``Nope, plowing \n     snow with my tractor for my friend who broke off his ankle,'' \n     Ken says.\n       That is arresting information. When I ask what happened, \n     Ken says his octogenarian friend was chain-sawing cherry \n     trees when a bent-back branch lashed out, smashing his lower \n     leg. Ken, haying a field, saw his friend ease his tractor \n     down from the mountainside woodlot, grimacing in agony, \n     working the tractor's pedals with his one good foot.\n       Ken himself once lost his grip on a hay bale he was \n     hoisting. A twig poking from the bale blinded his right eye. \n     Now learning to read is doubly difficult because his \n     remaining eye often tires and blurs. These grim country \n     stories of Ken's make my worries--delayed flights, missed \n     appointments--seem trivial. I flip another card: ``But.'' \n     ``Bat,'' Ken says, cautiously. ``Buh . . . uh . . . tuh,'' I \n     prompt. ``But,'' he finally says. ``I would do it, but I have \n     to go somewhere else.''\n       I write Ken's sentence on the card and he reads it back. \n     But he stumbles over his own words, unable to sound out \n     ``would.'' I push down rising impatience by remembering the \n     old man in the woods, crawling toward his tractor, dragging \n     that smashed leg.\n       Finally, I put away the cards, glad to be done with them. \n     Tutoring can be frustrating. Why are even easy words \n     sometimes so hard to get? Now we look at a puzzle. On one \n     side it has pictures of various automobile parts. On the \n     other side are printed the parts' names. The idea is to match \n     the pictures and the names. Before I can start asking Ken to \n     try sounding out big terms like ``connecting rod,'' he points \n     to one of the drawings. It looks to me like deer antlers. \n     ``Carburetor?'' I guess. ``Exhaust manifold,'' Ken says.\n       ``What's this one?'' I inquire. For all I know, it might be \n     something Han Solo is piloting through hyperspace. \n     ``Starter,'' Ken says. It seems to me he is gloating a \n     little. He points again. ``Camshaft?'' I ask. Ken corrects \n     me. ``Crankshaft,'' he says, dryly.\n       It is a standoff. I know the printed words. Ken knows the \n     actual objects to which the words refer. ``When I was a \n     kid,'' he tells me, ``I bought an old '35 truck. Sometimes it \n     had brakes and sometimes it didn't. I was probably 17. It \n     made lots of smoke, so mosquitos never bothered me. But one \n     day I got sick of it. I put it under a pine tree and I \n     hoisted the engine up into the tree to look at it. The \n     pressure plate weren't no good. And the fellow showed me how \n     to fix it.\n       That reminds Ken of a later episode. ``One time we had to \n     get the hay in, but the baler was jammed. We had the guys \n     from the tractor place, but they could not fix it. Finally I \n     asked the old guy for some wrenches and I adjusted it, and I \n     kept on adjusting, and after that it worked perfectly. I just \n     kept adjusting it a hair until I had it. And then we were \n     baling hay!'' No wonder Ken's bosses were happy to do his \n     reading for him. Even so, in our late 20th-century wordscape, \n     illiteracy stymies people like him. And working with Ken has \n     me puzzled: Why do so many people fail to learn to read?\n       I telephoned an expert, Bob Caswell, head of Laubach \n     Literacy International, a nonprofit organization that trains \n     tutors worldwide. He told me many nonreaders, like Ken Adams, \n     suffer from perceptual reading disorders. But there are other \n     reasons for illiteracy, and it is by no means confined to any \n     one part of the population.\n       ``People think adult nonreaders are mainly poor, urban \n     minorities, but 41 percent are English-speaking whites,'' \n     Caswell said, adding that 22 percent are English-speaking \n     blacks, 22 percent are Spanish-speaking, and 15 percent are \n     other non-English speakers. More than half of nonreading \n     adults live in small towns and suburbs. Caswell cited U.S. \n     Department of Labor figures that put illiteracy's annual \n     national cost at $225 billion in workplace accidents, lost \n     productivity, unrealized tax revenues, welfare and crime. One \n     big reason for this whopping problem is parents who read \n     poorly.\n       Well over a third of all kids now entering public schools \n     have parents who read inadequately, he said. ``Everywhere we \n     find parents who want to read to their kids, but can't,'' he \n     added. ``And a child with functionally illiterate parents is \n     twice as likely to grow up to be functionally illiterate.''\n       But as I met some of Ken Adams' fellow students, I \n     discovered all sorts of causes for being unable to decipher \n     an English sentence. For instance, I met a woman who had \n     escaped from Laos to Connecticut knowing only Laotian. She \n     learned enough English watching Sesame Street (``Big Bird and \n     all that,'' she told me), and later from being tutored, to \n     become a citizen.\n       I also met a man in his 30s who worked on a newspaper's \n     printing press. He could not spell the simplest words. He \n     said it was because, at age 10, he had begun bringing alcohol \n     to school in peanut-butter jars. After his son was born, he \n     turned to Alcoholics Anonymous and mustered the courage to \n     seek tutoring.\n\n[[Page S9447]]\n\n       I met another man who had dropped out of school in \n     frustration. Not until he tried to enlist in the military did \n     he discover he was nearly deaf. The operator of a creamery's \n     cheese-cutting machine told me he never learned to read \n     because his family had been in a perpetual uproar, his mother \n     leaving his father seven times in one year. And I met a farm \n     wife, 59, who rarely left her mountaintop. But now, with \n     tutoring, she was finally learning to read, devouring \n     novels--``enjoyment books,'' she called them.\n       In central Vermont, these struggling readers receive free \n     tutoring from nonprofit Adult Basic Education offices, each \n     employing a few professionals, like Sherry Olson, but relying \n     heavily on armies of volunteers, like me. Other states have \n     their own systems. Usually, the funding is a combination of \n     federal and state money, sometimes augmented with donations. \n     Mostly, budgets are bare bones.\n       Many states also rely on nonprofit national organizations, \n     like Laubach Literacy Action (Laubach International's U.S. \n     division) and Literacy Volunteers of America, both \n     headquartered in Syracuse, New York, to train volunteers. \n     Laubach's Bob Caswell told me that, nationwide, literacy \n     services reach only 10 percent of adult nonreaders. ``Any \n     effort is a help,'' he said.\n       Help has come late for Ken Adams. Reviewing his portfolio, \n     I found the goals he set for himself when he began: ``To read \n     and write better. And to get out and meet people and develop \n     more trust.'' Asked by Sherry to cite things that he does \n     well, he had mentioned ``fixing equipment, going to school \n     and learning to read, trying new things, telling stories, \n     farming.'' He remembered being in a Christmas play in second \n     grade and feeling good about that. And he remembered playing \n     football in school: ``They would pass it to me and I'd run \n     across the goal to make a score.'' He mentioned no fond \n     family memories. But he had some good moments. ``I remember \n     the first time I learned to drive a tractor,'' he had said. \n     ``We were working in the cornfields. I was proud of that.'' \n     And a later notation, after he had several months of \n     tutoring, made me think of Ken living alone in his hand-built \n     farmhouse on ten acres atop the mountain. ``I like to use \n     recipes,'' he said. ``I use them more as I learn to read and \n     write better. I made Jell-O with fruit, and I make bean \n     salad. I feel good I can do that.''\n       In our tutoring sessions, between bouts with the vocabulary \n     cards, Ken tells me he was the oldest of four children. When \n     he was small, his father forced him to come along to roadside \n     bars, and then made Ken sit alone in the car for hours. Ken \n     remembers shivering on subzero nights. ``He always said I'd \n     never amount to nothing,'' Ken says.\n       I ask Ken, one day, if his inability to read has made life \n     difficult. He tells me, ``My father said I'd never get a \n     driver's license, and he said nobody would ever help me.'' \n     Ken had to walk five miles down his mountain and then miles \n     along highways to get to work. ``And,'' he recalls, ``I was \n     five years in the quarries in Graniteville--that was a long \n     way.'' Sometimes he paid neighbors to drive him down the \n     mountain. ``They said the same as my father, that I'd never \n     get a license,'' he says. ``They wanted the money.''\n       It was not until he was 40 years old that he applied for a \n     license. He had memorized sign shapes and driving rules, and \n     he passed easily. ``After I got my license I'd give people a \n     ride down myself,'' he says. ``And they'd ask, `How much?' \n     And I'd always say, `Nothing, not a danged thing!' ''\n       To review the words he has learned, Ken maintains a \n     notebook. On each page, in large block letters, he writes the \n     new word, along with a sentence using the word. He also tapes \n     to each page a picture illustrating the sentence, as a memory \n     aid. To keep him supplied with pictures to snip, I bring him \n     my old magazines. He is partial to animals. He points to one \n     photograph, a black bear cub standing upright and looking \n     back winsomely over its shoulder. ``That one there's my \n     favorite,'' Ken says. And then he tells me, glowering, that \n     he has seen drivers swerve to intentionally hit animals \n     crossing the road. ``That rabbit or raccoon ain't hurting \n     anyone,'' he says.\n       We start a new book, The Strawberry Dog. Ken picks out the \n     word ``dog'' in the title. ``That dog must eat \n     strawberries,'' he says. ``I used to have a dog like that. I \n     was picking blackberries. Hey, where were those berries \n     going? Into my dog!''\n       We read these books to help Ken learn words by sight and \n     context. But it seems odd, a white-haired man mesmerized by \n     stories about talkative beavers and foppish toads. Yet, I \n     find myself mesmerized, too. The sessions are reteaching me \n     the exhilaration I found in narrative as a child, listening \n     to my father read about Peter Churchmouse. Our classes glide \n     by, a succession of vocabulary words--``house,'' ``would,'' \n     ``see''--interwoven with stories about agrarian \n     hippopotamuses and lost dogs befriended.\n       One afternoon it is my last session with Ken. We have \n     wrestled with words through a Christmas and a March sugaring, \n     a midsummer haying, an October when Ken's flannel shirts were \n     specked with sawdust from chain-sawing stove logs. Now the \n     fields outside are snowy; it is Christmas again.\n       My wife and I give Ken a present that she picked out. It is \n     bottles of jam and honey and watermelon pickles, nicely \n     wrapped. Ken quickly slides the package into his canvas tote \n     bag with his homework. ``Aren't you going to open it?'' \n     Sherry asks. ``I'll open it Christmas day,'' Ken says. ``It's \n     the only present I'll get.'' ``No it isn't,'' she says, and \n     she hands him a present she has brought.\n       And so we begin our last session with Ken looking pleased. \n     I start with a vocabulary review. ``Ignition coil,'' Ken \n     says, getting the first card right off. He gets ``oil \n     filter,'' too. He peers at the next card. ``Have,'' he says. \n     And he reads the review sentence: ``Have you gone away?''\n       He is cruising today. When I flip the next card, he says, \n     ``There's that `for.' '' It is a word that used to stump him. \n     I turn another card. He gets it instantly. ``But.'' He gets \n     ``at,'' then another old nemesis, ``are.'' I ask him to read \n     the card's review sentence. ``Are we going down . . . \n     street?'' he says. He catches himself. ``Nope. That's \n     downtown!''\n       I am amazed at Ken's proficiency. A while ago, I had \n     complained to my wife that Ken's progress seemed slow. She \n     did some math: one and a half hours of tutoring a week, with \n     time off for vacations and snowstorms and truck breakdowns, \n     comes to about 70 hours a year. ``That's like sending a first \n     grader to school for only 12 days a year,'' she said. And so \n     I am doubly amazed at how well Ken is reading today. Besides, \n     Sherry Olson has told me that he now sounds out--or just \n     knows--words that he never could have deciphered when he \n     began. And this reticent man has recently read his own poems \n     to a group of fellow tutees--his new friends--and their \n     neighbors at a library get-together.\n       But now we try something new, a real-world test: reading \n     the supermarket advertising inserts from a local newspaper. \n     Each insert is a hodge-podge of food pictures, product names \n     and prices. I point to a word and Ken ponders. ``C'' he says \n     finally. ``And it's got those two e`s--so that would be \n     `coffee'!'' I point again. He gets ``Pepsi.'' Silently, he \n     sounds out the letters on a can's label. ``So that's `corn,' \n     '' he announces. He picks out ``brownies.'' This is great. \n     And then, even better he successfully sounds out the \n     modifier: ``Fudge,'' he says. ``They-uh!''\n       We're on a roll. But not I point to the page's most \n     tortuous word. Ken starts in the middle again. ``ta?'' I \n     point my finger at the first letters. ``Po,'' he says, \n     unsure. As always when he reads, Ken seems like a beginning \n     swimmer. He goes a few strokes. Flounders.\n       ``Po-ta . . .,'' Ken says. He's swum another stroke. \n     ``To,'' he says, sounding out the last syllable. ``Po-ta-to, \n     po-ta-to--Hey, that's potato!'' He's crossed the pond. \n     ``Ken!'' I say. ``Terrific!'' He sticks out his chin. He \n     almost smiles. ``Well, I done better this time,'' he says. \n     ``Yup, I did good.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9445-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE PASSING OF MR. KENNETH KOHLI\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened at the \ntragic death of Ken Kohli, an outstanding individual with whom I have \nhad the pleasure of working and knowing for years. Last Friday, the \nplane in which he and two others were flying crashed in the Cabinet \nMountains of Montana, claiming all three lives.\n  It is a tragedy when one so talented, and with such a bright future, \nis lost at such a young age. Ken was only 35, and yet he had \nestablished himself as a leader in our State. He grew up in Coeur \nd'Alene, ID and attended Northern Idaho College, serving as NIC student \nbody president. He then went on to complete his education at Colorado \nCollege and Rutger's University in New Jersey.\n  When Ken returned to Coeur d'Alene, he put his passion for public \npolicy to work for the Intermountain Forest Industry Association as its \ncommunication director. Ken's colleagues and friends will always \nremember him for the intelligence, energy, and positive attitude with \nwhich he approached his work and his life. Ken understood the basic \nnature of Idahoans and their love for the land, and he recognized the \nimportant of our State's natural resources to jobs and families.\n  He had an appreciation for and a unique ability to work toward \nconsensus and find that balance so that we were protecting our \nresources while at the same time making wise use of them for the \nbenefit of all. Ken was a strong voice at the table, but he was always \na reasonable voice.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his family, in particular with his \nwife, Susan, and their three children, Kyle, Lauren, and Luke.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9447-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9447-S9448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING OUR FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICERS\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize two fine \nand outstanding foreign service officers stationed in our Beijing, \nChina, embassy who went beyond the call of duty to help an American \ncitizen in time of need. Ms. Stephanie Fossan and Mr. Kai Ryssdale \nexemplify the ``can do'' spirit that all our foreign service officers \nprovide for many of our overseas citizens.\n  In a letter I received from a Hawaii constituent doing business in \nChina, he\n\n[[Page S9448]]\n\ndescribes an incident where he lost his passport a day before his \ndeparture from Beijing. Without his passport he knew he would most \ncertainly have to miss his scheduled flight. Because this was peak \ntravel season for many Asians and the airlines were solidly booked, it \nwould also mean an indefinite stay in China. This delay would become \nvery difficult for this person because of health concerns and the lack \nof his daily medication.\n  Ms. Fossan and Mr. Ryssdale worked beyond normal working hours to \nensure that this Hawaii resident could secure a temporary passport. \nWith temporary passport in hand, my constituent went to the Chinese \nSecurity Office to get his visa stamped, and he was able to board his \nplane to Honolulu the next morning as scheduled.\n  All too often the hard work and dedication of our foreign service \nofficers go overlooked. Many of these people live and work in very \ndifficult conditions. The Secretary of State has testified before a \ncommittee of the Senate about ``sewer gases'' leaking into the embassy \nbuilding in Beijing and the difficult living conditions under which the \nAmericans who work there must endure.\n  Ms. Fossan and Mr. Ryssdale represent the best in foreign service \npersonnel who serve and protect our citizens abroad. To all personnel \nserving in our embassies abroad and to the Honorable James Sasser, \nAmbassador to the Peoples Republic of China, and his staff, I say thank \nyou for your dedicated work for our country. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9447-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE PASSING OF MR. ALFRED HALL\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, among those tragically killed \nlast Friday in a plane crash on Crowell Mountain southeast of Libby, \nMT, was Mr. Alfred (Al) Hall.\n  Al Hall worked as the pilot for Idaho Forest Industries [IFI], and \nflew with his son Cody, as his co-pilot. I speak from personal \nexperience that Al was a fine pilot, as I was able to fly with him \nseveral times. I have to tell you that I enjoyed flying with Al and his \nson Cody because of the enthusiasm they shared for their work. I \nremember one particular flight during which Al commented that he was \nthe luckiest man he knew. When I asked him why, he responded that it \nwas because his co-pilot was his best friend, and also happened to be \nhis son.\n  His supervisors at IFI were recently quoted as saying that Al \n``probably had every rating that an aviator could have.'' He was known \nas an experienced and safe pilot, gained from years of experience \nbeginning with his time as a Navy pilot, then as a pilot for the Forest \nService, and for Empire Airlines before he went on to work for IFI.\n  Al leaves behind him his wife, Mary Mac Hall, and two adult children, \nhis son, Cody, and his daughter, Laura.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Paul \nDensen on his 80th birthday, which is on August 8. I want to honor Paul \nnot simply because he has reached a milestone, but because his life has \nbeen a model of public service and philanthropy.\n  After fighting for his country in World War II, he headed a major \npackaging corporation until the 1970's. His philosophy has always been \nthat success obligates us to give something back to the society that \nenabled us to succeed. When we succeed, we owe something to our \ncommunity and to those who may be less fortunate. Densen's record of \nphilanthropy and community service confirms that attitude.\n  He is associate governor of the international board of governors of \nthe Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and a member of the board of \ndirectors and a vice-president of the American Friends of Hebrew \nUniversity. He also serves as a board member of the Suburban Community \nMusic Center in Madison, NJ.\n  Paul has been a member of the board of directors of the National \nConference of Christians and Jews, a member of the dialog committee on \ninterreligious affairs at Seton Hall University, and a budget committee \nmember for the Jewish Education Association. He was also president of \nthe West Orange Charter Association and a member of the West Orange \nEconomic Development Committee.\n  Given this record, it's probably not surprising that it was public \nservice which initially brought Paul and I together. Our first meeting \ntook place decades ago, when we met to discuss the Lautenberg Center \nfor General and Tumor Immunology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem-\nHadassah Medical School.\n  Since 1976, Paul has been chairman of the center's endowment \ncommittee, and he has been a driving force in its development and \nvolunteer recruitment efforts. Without Paul's dedication and \nleadership, the Lautenberg Center could not have achieved the \nremarkable history of success of which we are all so proud.\n  Mr. President, many people have benefited from Paul Densen's work, \nand I have certainly benefited from our friendship. I congratulate Paul \non his 80th birthday. Reaching this milestone is a cause for \ncelebration. However, through his work, his public service and his \ncivic involvement, Paul definitely proves that what's important isn't \nsimply the years in our life, but the life in our years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9448-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9448-S9449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last night I voted against the \nDepartment of Transportation appropriations bill. I would like to take \na minute of the Senate's time to explain my reasons for my vote. I had \nintended to give the following remarks on the Senate floor last night. \nHowever, due to the late hour, I chose not to keep the Senate any \nlonger than necessary and instead therefore ask unanimous consent that \nmy statement appear in the Record at this time.\n  First, Mr. President, let me commend the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee for all their hard work on this important \nbill. Their diligence in bringing this bill up and passing it so \nquickly is ample evidence of their abilities.\n  I wish I were able to state that I could support their bill--\nunfortunately, I am not. As with other appropriations bills which I \nhave voted against, I believe that we must begin to stop the practice \nof earmarking funds. Earmarking is not fair and disproportionately \neffects where the taxpayer's money is being spent.\n  For example, Mr. President, the discretionary grants account of the \nhighway trust fund earmarks hundreds of millions of dollars for fixed \nquideway systems. The bill goes on to list where the money should be \nspent. To no one's surprise, the motherload of the funds goes to States \nrepresented by appropriators.\n  I am also very concerned that the proviso noting that funds are \navailable for fixed guideway modernization notes that such funds will \nbe available notwithstanding any provision of law. This language was \nadded as a Senate amendment. I would inquire why the Senate felt this \nproviso was necessary?\n  I would hope that there was no intention here to insulate items from \nthe line item veto or any other budget cutting tools. I would hope the \nmanagers of the bill assure me that such a result was not their \nintention.\n  Mr. President, I want to return to the subject of developing a system \nto determine national priorities. I have discussed this issue before \nand would like to return to it now. In the area of military \nconstruction, Senator Glenn and I have worked with the Department of \nDefense to develop a system where the Pentagon prioritizes their \nconstruction needs.\n  At the insistence of my good friends, Senator Shelby, the courts have \ndone the same. I want to point out that until Senator Shelby took over \nthe Treasury-Postal Subcommittee, courthouse construction in the \ncountry was based on no rational plan and hundreds of millions of \ndollars were wasted. Thanks to Senator Shelby, the courts--against \ntheir will--now prioritize which courthourses should be built. This \nenables the Congress to spend the taxpayer's money in a more \nresponsible manner.\n  I would hope we could institute a similar process for the Department \nof Transportation and the many projects and other earmarks funded by \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, such a system not only gives Members of Congress the \ninformation needed to make better\n\n[[Page S9449]]\n\nchoices about how to spend appropriated dollars, but will hopefully \ntake some of the politics out of the spending process. I hope we will \nmove in this direction in the future.\n  Again, although I intend to vote against this bill, I want to thank \nthe bill's managers, especially the chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator Hatfield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9448-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9449-S9450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PRIVATE GAMBLING AND PUBLIC MORALITY\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, Prof. George Anastaplo of Loyola \nUniversity School of Law in Chicago recently spoke at a convention in \nLas Vegas, commenting about legalized gambling and where we are going \nas a nation.\n  It is a thoughtful presentation that I am appending at the end of \nthese remarks. I have condensed his original paper somewhat.\n  What is interesting to me particularly is to read a quotation from an \n1850 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Phelan versus Virginia, in which the \nCourt comments on lotteries as compared to private gambling. The Court \nsaid:\n\n       The suppression of nuisances injurious to public health or \n     morality is among the most important duties of government. \n     Experience has shown common forms of gambling are \n     comparatively innocuous when placed in contrast with the \n     widespread pestilence of lotteries. The former are confined \n     to a few persons and places, but the latter infests the whole \n     community: it enters every dwelling; it reaches every class; \n     it preys upon the hard earnings of the poor; it plunders the \n     ignorant and simple.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that the condensed version of Mr. Anastaplo's \nremarks be printed in the Record.\n  The condensed version follows:\n\n                ``Private'' Gambling and Public Morality\n\n                         (By George Anastaplo)\n\n       Gambling is in evidence all around us. For example, Texas \n     bingo halls took in $63,000,000 in 1994. The pervasiveness of \n     gambling is evident to anyone who follows sports: the ``point \n     spread'' helps make each encounter of even mismatched \n     opponents ``interesting'' and hence the occasion for \n     wagering. Officials of professional leagues used to worry \n     about the influence of gambling. For example, it was once \n     argued, ``The values of football are hard work, \n     disappointment, and honest competition, which must exist in \n     an honest environment.'' Gambling, it was feared, would \n     ``accentuate'' the pressures on football players beyond a \n     tolerable point, and change a sporting event into a gambling \n     spectacle. Now, the officials of professional leagues \n     cooperate with the gambling industry to make sure that games \n     are not ``fixed.''\n       But, it can be noticed, the sports contests that are \n     gambled upon may often be intrinsically interesting--and can \n     attract attention without any organized wagering. But \n     lotteries, slot machines, and the like are far less \n     interesting in themselves. Even so, they can be quite \n     entertaining, even thrilling, for participants. Thus, it has \n     been observed, ``Unlike narcotics, which creates droves of \n     criminals who prey on the generally poor black community, the \n     numbers game seems to many people to be just a potent, daily \n     titillation for poor people seeking a rainbow's end.'' The \n     head of an off track betting corporation, upon being accused \n     of taking money from the poor, asked rather rhetorically, \n     ``Who's to say what's gambling and what's entertainment?'' \n     But then, nicotine, too, can be engaging for the addict, \n     however deadly cigarette-smoking may be.\n       We tend to be much more relaxed, as a community, about the \n     damage done by gambling than were some of the earlier \n     generations in this country. Tolerance for lotteries, in the \n     first quarter of the Nineteenth Century gave way, because of \n     growing abuses, to efforts by state governments to put \n     lotteries out of business. In 1895 Congress provided support \n     for these states with its own legislation, ``An Act for the \n     Suppression of Lottery Traffic through National and \n     Interstate Commerce and Postal Service, Subject to the \n     Jurisdiction and Laws of the United States.''\n       A constitutional inquiry into what was indeed ``subject to \n     the jurisdiction and laws of the United States'' elicited \n     this question from the United States Supreme Court in \n     Champion v. Ames: (The Lottery Case), 188 U.S. 121, at 356 \n     (1903):\n       ``If a state, when considering legislation for the \n     suppression of lotteries within its own limits, may properly \n     take into view the evils that inhere in the raising of money, \n     in that mode, why may not Congress, invested with the power \n     to regulate commerce among the several states, provide that \n     such commerce shall not be polluted by the carrying of \n     lottery tickets from one state to another?''\n\n     Further on the Court argued (ibid., at 357-58):\n       ``[B]ut surely it will not be said to be a part of anyone's \n     liberty, as recognized by the supreme law of the land, that \n     he shall be allowed to introduce into commerce among the \n     states an element that will be confessedly injurious to the \n     public morals. . . . We should hesitate long before adjudging \n     that an evil of such appalling character, carried on through \n     interstate commerce, cannot be met and crushed by the only \n     power competent to that end.''\n\n     It is evident how people in authority in the first decade of \n     this century were expected to speak about such gambling as \n     the lottery. The dissenting opinion in Champion v. Ames made \n     no defense of lotteries, arguing instead that the power to \n     suppress such ``a harmful business'' belong to the states, \n     not to the national government.\n       The majority of the Supreme Court in Champion v. Ames \n     insisted that Congress should be able to act:\n       ``. . . to protect the country at large against a species \n     of interstate commerce which, although in general use and \n     somewhat favored in both national and state legislation in \n     the early history of the country, has grown into disrepute, \n     and has become offensive to the entire people of the nation. \n     It is a kind of traffic that no one can be entitled to pursue \n     as a right.''\n\n     I mention in passing the likelihood that the current \n     indulgences in lotteries and the like will, because of \n     emerging abuses and harmful consequences, eventually be \n     subjected once again to severe restrictions, In fact, it is \n     already likely that lotteries would not be approved in many \n     of the states where they now operate, if put to a popular \n     vote by referendum.\n       No one on the 1903 Court doubted that state governments \n     could try to suppress lotteries if they wished. Phelan v. \n     Virginia, 8 Howard (49 U.S.) 162 (1850) was cited to this \n     effect. The opinion in that case, upholding an 1834 act of \n     Virginia forbidding the sale of lottery tickets, includes \n     this reminder of how lotteries were once regarded in this \n     country:\n       ``The suppression of nuisances injurious to public health \n     or morality is among the most important duties of government. \n     Experience has shown that the common forms of gambling are \n     comparatively innocuous when placed in contrast with the \n     widespread pestilence of lotteries. The former are confined \n     to a few persons and places, but the latter infests the whole \n     community: it enters every dwelling; it reaches every class; \n     it preys upon the hard earnings of the poor; it plunders the \n     ignorant and simple.''\n       This, then, is the sort of public opinion, running back to \n     1850 and earlier, that the Supreme Court could invoke in the \n     opening years of this century. Now, at the end of the same \n     century, not only are lotteries no longer spoken of in this \n     fashion by officials, but the states of this Union are \n     themselves in the business of running and vigorously \n     promoting lotteries with ever-growing prizes. In Illinois, \n     for example, the gambling industry contributed more than a \n     million dollars to political candidates in 1995. Furthermore, \n     it has been able to hire a former governor of the state and \n     other former Illinois officials as paid lobbyists.\n       This is not just an American phenomenon, of course. State \n     lotteries are very much in evidence in Europe and elsewhere. \n     The ``pools'' have long been a feature of British life. And \n     something is to be said for legalizing (or at least \n     decriminalizing) what is likely to be done anyway, thereby \n     permitting both regulation and taxation. But is not the \n     state's doing it, and promoting it, something significantly \n     different from toleration, taxation and regulation? Is it as \n     if the state had gotten into the business of producing and \n     selling firearms, prostitutes, alcoholic beverages, \n     cigarettes, and other narcotics?\n       The newest gambling rage in this country, however, is not \n     lotteries but rather casinos. These are licensed by states \n     which count on a hefty cut of the revenues. Respectable \n     newspapers prod their legislatures to take measures to \n     counter the competition from the casinos in neighboring \n     states. Consider, for example, the opening and closing \n     sentences of a recent Chicago Sun-Times editorial (``Casino \n     Shutdown in East Dubuque, Illinois Forces Gambling Issue,'' \n     December 7, 1995):\n       ``Two Illinois riverboat casino got no satisfaction from \n     the Legislature last month when they asked for help in \n     competing with Iowa boats across the Mississippi River. . . . \n     While the Legislature fiddles, Illinois gaming revenue floats \n     across the Mississippi to lucky Iowa.''\n\n     It is the practice of the gambling industry, by the way, to \n     refer to the ``entertainment'' it offers as ``gaming,'' not \n     as ``gambling.''\n       A recent Chicago Tribune editorial, supporting an effort to \n     exact more revenues from riverboat casinos, begins with these \n     observations (``Bet on Edgar's casino tax plan,'' March 8, \n     1996):\n       ``Who says gambling doesn't pay?\n       ``Last year the Empress Casino in Joliet hauled in $200 \n     million, after paying off bettors. For Harrah's, also in \n     Joliet, the figure was more than $190 million.\n       ``Gov. Jim Edgar's proposed 1997 state budget would impose \n     on those and other high-rolling casinos a graduated tax to \n     tap some of the windfall for the state's schools--and rightly \n     so.\n       ``Under current law, all casinos are taxed a flat 20 \n     percent of their adjusted gross receipts (that's what they \n     have left after they've paid out winnings), regardless of how \n     much money they're making.\n       ``For a struggling operation (and there are some), 20 \n     percent is too much; for the widely successful ones, it's a \n     bargain, and for the state it's an inefficient approach to \n     taxation of this protected industry.''\n\n     Immediately following this Tribune editorial about how the \n     state should take further advantage of ``this protected \n     industry'' is an\n\n[[Page S9450]]\n\n     editorial, ``No more cosying up to gangsters,'' commenting \n     upon the conviction of eight members of a gang for \n     distributing narcotics in Chicago and the suburbs. There is \n     much to be said, of course, for the decriminalization of drug \n     sales in this country, just as there has been for the \n     decriminalization of gambling. But ``cosying up'' to, and \n     relying upon, such activities, and even promoting them for \n     their revenues pose questions that we seem to have lost sight \n     of about the role of law in sustaining morality.\n       Far from encouraging morality, we find ourselves catering \n     to vices and trying to exploit them. To some extent, as we \n     have noticed, gambling is a form of self-chosen entertainment \n     less harmful in many ways than some other forms of \n     entertainment. It tends to be for most of the ``players'' \n     more self-correcting than several other forms of self-abuse, \n     such as alcohol and drug addiction.\n       But this sort of entertainment is not intrinsically \n     satisfying, requiring as it does constant intensification in \n     order to maintain its interest for participants. Thus, it has \n     been noticed by a Haverhill, Massachusetts newspaper \n     (``Opinionline,'' USA-Today, November 13, 1995, p. 13A):\n       ``We've gone from the Sweepstakes era, with a once-a-week, \n     50-cents-per-ticket drawing, to state-run and fostered \n     gambling industry which is worth millions. The state \n     government is addicted to gambling, as government finds ways \n     to avoid dealing with the issues of how much money it should \n     spend and what tax it ought to levy. But something is \n     drastically wrong when government becomes increasingly \n     dependent on the misfortunes of its people to finance its \n     operations.''\n       There is something ``realistic'' in recognizing that people \n     will gamble, however much government attempts to suppress it. \n     The considerable lure of gambling, sometimes with \n     catastrophic consequences, has long been known. But what \n     seems to be forgotten from time to time is the price paid, \n     even in economic terms, for widespread gambling. The next \n     decade should see the publication of more and more studies \n     which expose to public view the hidden costs of the revenues \n     that are derived from the gambling industry. These include \n     the effects upon small businesses as large sums of money are \n     siphoned out of the community by casinos. These hidden costs \n     include, as well, the social services that have to be \n     provided the families that are victims of gambling \n     addictions. (The University of Chicago library has extensive \n     entries under the catalogue heading: ``Addictive disorders \n     update: alcoholism, drug abuse, gambling.'')\n       Even more important than the economic and social costs of \n     intensified addiction is what has been happening (but not \n     only because of the gambling industry) to the authoritative \n     opinions of the community. Hedonism is encouraged along with \n     the notion of getting ``something for nothing.'' Self-\n     centeredness is thereby legitimated, as may be seen in the \n     growing scandal of the level of compensation these days for \n     the chief executive officers of our major corporations \n     (especially when their compensation is compared to that of \n     their equally successful European and Japanese counterparts). \n     It sometimes seems that shamelessness has become the order of \n     the day. . . . A billboard recently on display in Chicago \n     invited us to a Wisconsin Dells casino with the slogan, \n     ``Come to the Land of Milk and Money.'' (This advertisement \n     was illustrated by the drawing of a slot-machine showing \n     three cows lined up: a real winner!) That, we are thus told, \n     is the new Promised Land.\n       The public should be encouraged in these matters to face up \n     to two sets of delusions. This can help us face up in turn to \n     what we are doing and how best to accommodate ourselves to \n     the vices that human beings are bound to have.\n       The first set of delusions has to do with what organized \n     gambling depends upon: the systematic fleecing of the \n     ignorant by the informed. Professional gamblers do not \n     believe in gambling any more than professional panderers \n     believe in love: gambling magnates are no more gamblers than \n     casino riverboats are boats. The huge outlays that casino \n     operators are willing to devote to securing licenses reveal \n     what a treasure-trove the well-placed casino must be. The \n     sooner that casino customers recognize that they are suckers, \n     the sooner most of them are likely to entertain themselves \n     some other way.\n       The second set of delusions has to do with the notion that \n     revenues derived from the gambling industry are a painless \n     substitute for the taxation required for schools and other \n     essential community services. Thus, it can be said that \n     ``money raised through legalized gambling is one of the few \n     forms of taxation that people voluntarily and cheerfully \n     pay.'' (Geis, Not the Law's Business?, p. 237) But for an \n     action to be truly voluntary a minimum of understanding is \n     required. Consider, for example, these observations (``Take a \n     Hard Look at Costs of Gambling,'' Chicago Sun-Times, \n     September 28, 1955:\n       ``Some $330 billion was wagered legally in 1992, up 1,800 \n     percent from 1976. In Mississippi last year, gamblers wagered \n     $29.7 billion, whole total retail sales were only $27.6 \n     billion. Since casinos opened in Atlantic City in 1978, 100 \n     of the 250 restaurants have closed, as have all the movie \n     theaters.''\n       ``Despite evidence that gambling may not be the panacea \n     once thought, legislators continue to legalize gambling as a \n     way to bring money into state coffers. But what are its costs \n     long-term?''\n\n     The need for reliable information here, to which I have \n     already referred, may well be served by the current efforts \n     in Congress, by Senator Paul Simon and others, to investigate \n     gambling in this country. The thesis to be tested is that \n     offered last year by a syndicated columnist (William Safire, \n     ``New Evil Empire,'' New York Times, September 28, 1995, p. \n     A17):\n       ``Gambling is a [massive] industry that is inherently \n     immoral, corrupting public officials, enriching criminals, \n     addicting and impoverishing the young and vulnerable.\n       ``But the gambling racket--whether in state-licensed \n     casino, state-sponsored lotteries or on glitzy reservations \n     of phony Indian tribes--has been promoted by public officials \n     as a great way of painlessly raising revenues, with state \n     voters acting as suckers. As a result officially endorsed and \n     government-advertised gambling now has America by the \n     throat.''\n       A report from Deadwood, South Dakota sums up the suicidal \n     course we have followed in our delusions. A woman who has \n     supported the effort to legalize casinos in 1989 is now \n     appalled upon seeing that the casinos ``have all but wiped \n     out [her] town's retailers'' (James Sterngold, ``Spread of \n     Gambling Prompts Calls for Federal Study of It,'' New York \n     Times, November 24, 1995, emphasis added):\n       ``Strolling past storefront casinos that have replaced \n     everything from the state social services office to the \n     insurance broker and department store, [she] commented, `I'm \n     homesick all the time and I never left home. We were \n     completely unrealistic.' ''\n\n     Perhaps the most troublesome feature of all this may be that \n     we have drifted into a much-changed way of life without much \n     serious study or deliberate choice.\n       This paper was prepared for the Law Panels at the American \n     Culture Association Convention, Las Vegas, Nevada, March 25, \n     1996.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss something \nthat probably has not been debated much in the Senate since this body \nconsidered the FDIC Improvement Act back in 1991. I want to talk about \nthe need to modernize the outdated laws that govern America's financial \nservices industry.\n  The vital role that financial services play in our daily lives cannot \nbe understated. We take out loans to go to college, to buy a car, and \nto purchase a home. We buy insurance to provide greater security to \nourselves and our families. We make investments throughout our life so \nthat we may retire in comfort and dignity.\n  Today, technological advancements and increased innovation in the \ndelivery of financial services make it easier than ever for consumers \nto get loans, purchase insurance, and invest their earnings. \nUnfortunately, our archaic and burdensome laws governing financial \ninstitutions continue to discourage, rather than encourage, such \nadvancement and innovation.\n  The laws to which I am referring are not those governing the safety \nand soundness of financial institutions, such as setting minimum \ncapital requirements or requiring periodic oversight by Federal or \nState regulators. Safety and soundness laws and regulations are \nbeneficial and necessary, as they enhance the security of the consumer \nwhenever he or she deposits money in a bank or purchases an insurance \npolicy.\n  The outdated laws that I am referring to are the laws that create \nbarriers to competition by artificially compartmentalizing the three \nmajor sectors of financial services--banking, securities, and \ninsurance. For example, under the Banking Act of 1933, more commonly \nknown as the Glass-Steagall Act, banks are generally barred from \ndirectly investing in corporate securities, underwriting new corporate \nissues, or sponsoring mutual funds. Under the Bank Holding Company Act \nof 1956, securities underwriters, insurance underwriters, and \nnonfinancial companies are generally prohibited from owning banks or \nbeing owned by a bank holding company.\n  These outdated financial institution laws hurt consumers by \nartificially increasing the costs of financial services, reducing the \navailability of financial products, and reducing the level of \nconvenience in the delivery of financial services. These outdated laws \nhurt small businesses--an engine of job growth in the American \neconomy--by artificially limiting the amount of equity capital \navailable for expanded activity. And finally, these outdated laws \nweaken the international competitiveness of America's financial \ninstitutions\n\n[[Page S9451]]\n\nby prohibiting them from offering the range of financial services that \nforeign financial institutions may offer.\n\n  It should be noted that the Glass-Steagall Act--which created the \ncompartmentalized structure of financial services that we have today--\nwas based upon the false premise that the massive amount of bank \nfailures that occurred during the Great Depression was caused by the \nsecurities activities that these banks conducted. However, just the \nopposite is true: Diversification in financial services actually \nincreased the safety and soundness of the banks. Between 1929 and 1933, \n26.3 percent of all national banks failed. However, the failure rate \nfor those banks that conducted securities activities was lower. Of the \nnational banks in 1929 that either had securities affiliates or had \ninternal bond departments, only 7.2 percent had failed by 1933. The \nmessage from these statistics is clear: We should encourage competition \nand diversification, not discourage it.\n  Earlier this year, Congress passed a bipartisan and comprehensive \nlegislative initiative to reform the Telecommunications Act and \nstimulate competition and innovation in the telecommunications \nindustry. Similar action is needed to stimulate the growth and global \ncompetitiveness of our financial services industry.\n  There are currently three financial institution modernization bills \nthat have been proposed: S. 337, the Depository Institution Affiliation \nAct, sponsored by Senator D'Amato, Chairman of the Senate Banking \nCommittee; H.R. 2520, the Financial Services Competitiveness and \nRegulatory Relief Act, sponsored by Representative Leach, Chairman of \nthe House Banking Committee; and finally, a proposal submitted at the \nbeginning of this year by the Alliance for Financial Modernization, \nwhich consists of various financial services industry organizations.\n  It appears likely that next year, the Senate Banking Committee will \nconsider the issue of financial institution modernization. So that \nMembers of the Senate may have more information about the current \ncompartmentalized structure of America's financial institutions, the \nthree proposals for reforming this structure, and the issues that arise \nfrom these proposals, I am announcing the formation of the Financial \nInstitution Modernization Working Group.\n  The purpose of the Financial Institution Modernization Working Group \nis not to endorse any one of the currently proposed bills. Rather, it \nwill engage in analyzing the merits of the current proposals and the \ncurrent controversies surrounding these proposals.\n  The Working Group will, however, endorse five principles that should \nbe met by any financial institution modernization legislation package \nthat is presented to the Senate:\n  First, the legislation should lower the costs to consumers for \nfinancial services by increasing competition in the provision of these \nservices.\n  Second, the legislation should maintain the safety and soundness of \nthe Federal deposit insurance system.\n  Third, the legislation should not create a new structure that \nprevents current financial institutions from conducting any activities \nthat they currently conduct.\n  Fourth, the legislation should create a Financial Services Holding \nCompany structure to increase competitive equality among all financial \nservice providers.\n  And fifth, the legislation should definitively resolve the current \nconcerns about the future of the Savings Association Insurance Fund by \nmerging the bank and thrift deposit insurance funds, unifying the bank \nand thrift charters, and consolidating the bank and thrift regulators.\n  It is my hope that these five principles will provide a solid \nfoundation for the Financial Institution Modernization Working Group's \ndiscussions in the coming months.\n  In closing, I look forward to working with Senators who are both on \nand off of the Banking Committee to make the Financial Institution \nModernization Working Group a useful source of information and ideas. \nIt is my hope that 1997 will be the year that we join together and \ncreate a bipartisan bill that will reform our financial institution \nlaws so that America's financial institutions will be able to compete, \ninnovate and grow to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9450-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9451-S9452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE 120TH ANNIVERSARY OF COLORADO STATEHOOD\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 120th anniversary of Colorado statehood. My home State \nhas a rich and colorful history, having sustained itself as a mecca of \ncultural diversity, a geographic wonder, and the birthplace of numerous \ngreat men and women.\n  Colorado made several attempts at statehood, one in 1863 and another \nin 1866, before a convention was held in December 1875 to draft a third \nconstitution for the people's ratification. On August 1, 1876, Colorado \nwas finally admitted to the Union as the 38th State. It was titled the \nCentennial State for gaining admittance during the centenary of our \nNation's independence.\n  Colorado was a progressive young State, leading the race to erect \ninstitutions of higher education, develop advances in mining and \nagriculture, and most notably, politics. In 1893, less than a \ngeneration after its admittance, Colorado became the second State to \ngrant suffrage to women. Since its inception, the State of Colorado has \ncontinued to welcome people of all origins and serve as a source of \nprogress and equality.\n  Colorado is home to two American Indian tribes, the Southern Ute and \nthe Ute Mountain Tribes. The Ute Indians are Colorado's chief \nrepresentatives of Shoshonean ancestry, and are the only tribe \nindigenous to Colorado. The Southern Ute reservation, of more than \n300,000 acres, has spanned the southwestern corner of Colorado since \n1868. The Ute Mountain Reservation occupies just under 600,000 acres in \nthe far southwestern corner of the State, overlapping its borders with \nUtah and New Mexico.\n  Both tribes have laid their economic foundation on the land they \ninhabit, honoring it with memorials and symbolic events. While these \ntangible signs of reverence are a treasured part of Colorado's \nidentity, the traditions of trust, respect, and honor are the true gift \nof these tribes to Colorado.\n\n  The geographic splendors of Colorado are simply breathtaking. I will \nnever tire of the raw beauty of my State. From the mountains to the \nGrand Canyon to the massive expanse of virgin forests, Colorado may \nwell be one of the most beautiful places on Earth. I know my sense of \npride is shared by Coloradans and others alike.\n  While there is greatness in the history, culture, and land of \nColorado, there is a shared greatness in many individuals hailing from \nthe State. One woman is particular proved herself to be truly heroic to \nColorado and the rest of the Nation. As a teacher, scientist, and \nhumanitarian, Dr. Florence Rena Sabin was a pioneer for all women in \nthe field of medicine, playing a critical role in the drafting and \nimplementation of the Sabin Health Laws in the State. Her ground-\nbreaking accomplishments earned her one of Colorado's two places in \nStatuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol, one of the Nation's highest honors.\n  Just this summer, the Colorado General Assembly designated that a \nstatue of the Honorable John L. ``Jack'' Swigert, Jr., join Dr. Sabin \nin Statuary Hall. As a patriot to his country and a leader in the \nState, Jack Swigert is considered one of Colorado's most courageous and \nrenowned citizens. As command module pilot of the Apollo 13 Mission, \nJack Swigert carried out a heroic maneuver and saved the lives of his \ncrew as he piloted the damaged spacecraft safely to Earth. The work of \nJack Swigert has made a staggering contribution of Colorado's 120 years \nof excellence, setting the State apart in space operations and \nplanetary environmental technology.\n  Aviation has been a field of continued outstanding achievement for \nthe State of Colorado. Six years ago, the Colorado Aviation Hall of \nFame welcomed another inductee, George ``Gib'' Nesbitt, for his \nremarkable contribution to improving aviation in Colorado and \nnationwide. His dedication to teaching people to fly safely spanned two \ndecades and today serves as a benchmark by which all other flight \ninstructors are measured. Having begun his flying career as a teenager, \nhe went on to serve as flight commander in World War II, where teaching \nyoung\n\n[[Page S9452]]\n\nArmy and Air Force cadets soon became his focus. He personally \ntransformed two primitive air strips in rural Colorado into functional \nairports capable of opening vast segments of the State to air travel. \nThe residents, businesses and visitors of Colorado will continue to \nbenefit from his contributions.\n\n  The philanthropic efforts of one individual and his family have also \nleft a lasting impression on Colorado's business and arts communities, \nchildren, and troubled populations. Bill Coors, chairman and president \nof Adolph Coors Co., is the senior employee at Coors with over 57 years \nof service. His contributions to the industry range from the \nintroduction of now widely consumed products, to innovations in the \ntechnology and production of numerous industry standards. Bill Coors \nhas been touted as a visionary in the areas of employee wellness and \nhealth care. Businesses, organizations and communities within the State \nand across the Nation have looked to the work of Bill Coors as a model \nto follow, a standard to meet.\n  Mr. Coors has lent his support in the areas of higher education, \nproviding his expertise in business and community cooperatives. He has \nactively cultivated youth groups and associations accessed by children \nfrom across the country. His support of the arts, in a climate where \nthe riches of our history and culture are considered an expense, has \nbeen instrumental to Colorado's continued recognition of its proud \nheritage. Bill Coors' tremendous success makes his consistent \ncontributions to the State of Colorado that much more honorable. He is \ntruly a man of integrity, whose devotion to the citizens of Colorado \nwill continue to serve the State for generations.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention the timely accomplishments of \nour Colorado Olympians. Although the games are still underway, there \nare two notable Colorado women who have touched our hearts and made us \nswell with pride. Amy Van Dyken will go down in the Olympic history \nbooks with her four gold medals in swimming. Susan DeMattei, competing \nin mountain biking, an event offered for the first time, won bronze \nafter a grueling 22-mile trek.\n  Mr. President, I have just skimmed the surface of the incredible \nachievements made by Coloradans and their State. Even after 120 years, \nColorado has not slowed in its accomplishments nor tarnished in its \nbeauty.\n  I want to thank you for allowing me to speak for my fellow Coloradans \nin celebrating our 120th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9451-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE PASSING OF SETH DIAMOND\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE.

I have been reminding Senators and urging \nSenators--I know the whip has been doing it on the other side--that \nFriday, August 2, is a red letter day and that we should all plan on \nbeing here and being here until we get our work done.\n  So I hope there will not be any panting and hoping to leave at 4:30 \ntomorrow afternoon unless we have gotten these conference reports done \nas we have listed here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/01/senate-section/article/S9452-4", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M.
