Mr. President, I am very anxious that we proceed with the \nbill before us. In the meantime, I would like to just for a moment or \ntwo continue on our freshman focus on the idea of moving forward with \nthese issues that are before the Senate and the House and that do need \nto be resolved soon, and to emphasize the opportunity that we have to \nsolve them. Specifically, of course, to the budget and more \nspecifically Medicare.\n  We have talked about Medicare for a good deal of time over the past, \nbut now we come to a time when there is no choice as to whether we have \nto make a decision or whether we do not. We have before us a report \nfrom the trustees, of course, which indicates that unless we do \nsomething the fund will be broke in probably 3 years. So it is not a \nmatter of not doing something. It is a matter of what do we do.\n  I am disappointed, I must say, that the administration has taken the \nposition that we are just going to wait; we are just going to see what \nhappens; we \n[[Page S6472]] tried last year; our plan was not acceptable; and \ntherefore we are not going to do anything.\n  That is not a strong leadership position. That is not a position that \nthe administration should take. Nevertheless, the issue has to be dealt \nwith. We propose to deal with it. The budget will suggest that in terms \nof part A the remedy might be found in the area of reducing growth--not \ncuts, not draconian cuts but, rather, reducing the growth from 10 \npercent to 7 percent, 8 percent,\n and that we can do this by changing some of the processes.\n\n  I think that this is the important thing that we have to talk about; \nthat there ought to be some choices for seniors; that we ought to have \nsome opportunities to use managed care; that there ought to be some \nincentives for people to find better ways of receiving services.\n  But the idea that we can simply sit back and continue to do what it \nis--the suggestion was made yesterday, if we can do something with the \nbudget, we simply ought to take more money and put it into the program \nwithout changing.\n  Mr. President, that is not a useful solution. We have to find some \nways to make the program work better. It seems to me that that is the \ngreat opportunity that we have had in this Congress for the first time \nin a number of years, to examine programs; not to do away with \nprograms, but to find ways to deliver services more efficiently, to \nfind ways, better ways, to deliver services to people who are eligible \nfor those services. That is the challenge that we have.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague, the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank my colleague from Wyoming. As usual, he hits \nthe mark squarely. He outlines the problem.\n  Mr. President, I think what we are about here today is a part of a \nbroader consideration, and that is our responsibility to the American \npeople. We are getting about, I believe, responding to an issue here \nthat is on the minds of the American people and we are doing something \nthat is different, I think, than what has been going on in this body \nand in this city for a long time. And that is, we are facing up to our \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I feel that for a long period of time in this country \nthe U.S. Congress, in being more interested in the next election and \nthe next election cycle than the next generation, for a long time has \nbeen putting its problems off and rolling them forward again and again \nand again hoping that perhaps the next generation or someone else will \nfigure out how to dig out from under the present problems that we have \nlaid on them.\n  This Medicare situation falls into that category. We have to face up \nto it. I believe it is the responsibility of this body to identify \nthose items, those matters which we have concluded represent a \nsubstantial affect on peoples lives in the future. I think the Medicare \ntrustees have put us in that position. They have given us information. \nWe have the bully pulpit. We must inform the American people of what is \nhappening. There is no room for recriminations right now as to how we \ngot there, why we got there. We need to get about solving this problem.\n  Put in blunt terms, Mr. President, the trustees have informed us \nthat, if we do not do anything, in 7 years Medicare is going to go \nbroke. I do not know how much more simply we can explain it.\n  Medicare expenditures are increasing at the rate of 10 percent a \nyear. We cannot sustain 10 percent a year. Now, the budget that has \nbeen put forward by the Budget Committee increases Medicare spending. \nIt increases Medicare spending at the rate of 7.1 percent a year; not \nthe 10 percent, but 7.1 percent.\n  We can get the job done at that rate, Mr. President. We can save the \ntrust fund. Obviously, it has budget implications. But, separate and \napart from any budget considerations, the Medicare problem, the \nMedicare crisis, must be addressed.\n  The budget that was submitted at 7.1 percent is an increase of \nMedicare spending of twice the rate of inflation. We can increase \nMedicare spending at twice the rate of inflation and still, by not \ngoing the full 10 percent, we can get out of this problem and save the \nMedicare Program for the 36 million Americans that depend on it. You \nwould think that when you have a clear problem like that pointed out by \na bipartisan commission--everyone in this body knows there is a \nsubstantial problem--that you would have both branches of Government, \nthe executive branch and the legislative branch, pulling together. You \nwould think you would have both political parties pulling together; \nthat this is indeed a matter of national interest that we all have to \nwork together to solve.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, it seems that the President of the \nUnited States has taken the position that, because we did not pass his \nhealth care bill last year, he is going to somehow get back at us by \nnot being a player in this game.\n  These are tough decisions. These are tough political decisions. Even \nreducing the rate of growth on any program in America is a tough \npolitical decision, one that we are prepared to face up to.\n  But next year, being an election year, apparently the President has \ndecided to sit on the sidelines and not participate because we did not \npass his broad-sweeping health care program last year.\n  I think the President misses the point. People knew last year that \nthe problem was not in the private sector. The problem was with the \nFederal sector; that is, the Medicare-Medicaid sector. In the private \nsector, costs are actually stabilizing; in many cases costs are \nactually going down in the private sector.\n  What the American people said ``no'' to was a broad-sweeping, \nperceived-to-be Federal takeover, which included the private sector. \nThey did not say ``no'' to reforming and saving the Medicare Program \nthat we have in this country. And that is what we are dealing with here \ntoday.\n  So let us decouple that. Let us get away from the past politics and \nwho did what when. Let us give the President the benefit of the doubt. \nLet us say everything he says from a political standpoint is true; that \nhe tried to save the entire health care system and we would have saved \nall this money. The facts are otherwise in my opinion, but let us give \nhim the benefit of the doubt.\n  Let us say, assuming all that is true, assuming all that is true, \nthat is the past. This is the future. The problem is a severe one. We \nhave been told by a bipartisan commission that we are going to go \nbankrupt in this system within 7 years if we do not do something. We \nhave to pull together to save the Medicare system for the 36 million \nAmericans that depend on it.\n  How do we do that, Mr. President? I do not know anybody in this body \nor anybody on this side of the aisle who claims that we have all the \nanswers as to exactly how to do that. The Senator from Wyoming has \nmentioned several different proposals, possibilities. It has been \nsuggested that a commission be formed to look at ways of saving \nadditional moneys, hopefully keeping the same amount of benefits; not \nbeing under the illusion that we can squeeze providers forever and get \nit from that source, but to have more choice, give elderly people more \nchoice and more opportunity, perhaps, to save moneys that have \nheretofore been spent on the Federal program by availing themselves of \noptions in the private sector.\n  There are any number of possibilities there. But we have to work \ntogether to solve this problem. We have to put aside partisan politics. \nWe have to put aside past politics. The problem is too great. There are \ntoo many people that depend on our solving that problem.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                        THE BUDGET AND MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I thought I might just \nrespond very briefly to my colleagues about the budget and specifically \nabout Medicare.\n  Mr. President, let me just simply say that the most fundamental \nproblem about the proposed cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, up to about \n$400 billion between now and 2002, is that these cuts reflect, I fear, \na real lack of knowledge about health care policy. That is what bothers \nme more than anything else, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, no one should be surprised about the increase in the \ncost of Medicare, which, by the way, is a benefits program. It is not \nan actuarial program. It is a commitment we made in 1965; by no means \nperfect. Catastrophic expenses are not covered, prescription drug costs \nare not covered. There are many gaps.\n  But, Mr. President, the reason that this is an expensive program and \nthe reason the expense increases is because more and more of our \npopulation are aging and more and more of the aged population are now \nin their eighties.\n  Obviously, we are not going to be able to do anything about that, and \nI do not think we want to do anything about that.\n  The second reason is general inflation.\n  The third is medical inflation.\n  Mr. President, the problem with this proposal is you cannot single \nout one part of the health care costs, one segment of the population \nand cut there without very serious consequences.\n  Let me spell out a couple. First of all, you do ration. This time we \nreally do ration. Last year, last Congress, there was a hue and cry \nabout rationing when we wanted to have universal coverage. You are \ngoing to ration by age, you are going to ration by income, and you are \ngoing to ration by disability.\n  Mr. President, that is what happens when you just pick out one part \nof the health care costs and you target the elderly and you target low \nincome, and I want to talk about Medicaid as well.\n  Second of all, the reason the business community, the larger \nbusinesses--and I think they are going to get joined by other \nbusinesses as well--are going to be uniformly opposed to this--and we \nare already hearing from the business community--is because it is just \ngoing to get shifted to them. This is the problem of charge shifting, I \nsay to my colleague, of cost shifting. This is the shell game to this \nwhole proposition.\n  When you pay less than what the providers need, when you do not have \nadequate reimbursement, which is already too low in rural America, \nthose providers have no other choice but to shift it to those who can \npay. That is private health insurance. Then businesses are hurt more. \nThen employees are hurt more. That is what is going to happen. And more \npeople get dropped. You are going to have a huge amount of cost \nshifting. You cannot single out one segment of the population. You \ncannot do it. Welcome to health care reform. That is what we have to \nget back to.\n  Mr. President, third of all, in rural America, in rural Minnesota, \nmany of our hospitals and clinics have 75 percent of their patient mix \nfinanced by Medicare payments. These hospitals are already having a \ndifficult time. They are going to go under. It is not crying wolf; that \nis what is going to happen. That is exactly what is going to happen, \nMr. President.\n  Fourth of all, and there are a lot of ``alls,'' but there is another \nissue I want to talk about as well. But fourth of all, I smile when I \nhear some of my colleagues make these proposals about vouchers; people \ncan go out and purchase their own health insurance and people have the \nfreedom to do so. Has anybody ever heard of preexisting condition? Do \nyou think that these health insurance companies are going to grant \ncoverage to people who are old and sick? They do not do that. It is \ncalled preexisting condition.\n  By the way, managed care plans, by and large, have been most \ninterested in people that are healthier. I am telling you right now, \nthese cuts--they say they are not cuts--are in relation to an ever-\ngrowing percentage of the population who are aged, many who require \never more by way of medical care. I will tell you what, if it is my \nfather and mother--both of them had Parkinson's disease--you better \nbelieve I want to make sure they get the best care. So do not tell me \nyou are not going to seriously cut into the quality of care for older \nAmericans. You certainly are.\n  In addition, you are going to cause a lot of havoc in this whole \nhealth care system. Just ask doctors, hospitals, clinics, all sorts of \nconsumer organizations, all sorts of other people whether or not that \nwill not be the case.\n  So, Mr. President, the irony is we get back to health care reform. \nThere were some very interesting proposals about how to contain costs \nwhich we have to do if we are willing to have the courage to go \nforward. But this just picks out one segment of the population, and, in \nthat sense, it is not intended but I think it will be very cruel in its \neffect. I do not think it is an intended effect. And it will create \nwidespread havoc in the health care field. No question about it. From \nwhere do you think the teaching hospitals are going to get their \nfunding?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/11/senate-section/article/S6473-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6473-S6474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, to shift, I want to talk about this \n1995 farm bill, and I want to talk about what has come out of the \nBudget Committee.\n  I thought we were going to have a farm bill as opposed to just \ndrastic budget cuts. The document that comes out of the Senate proposes \ncuts of $28 billion over 5 years and $45 billion over 7 years. A fair \npercentage of these cuts, the majority of these cuts are in nutrition \nprograms--food stamps, Women, Infants and Children Program, School \nLunch Program.\n  By the way, my colleagues in the Senate have gone on record that we \nwill not take any action to create more hunger or homelessness among \nchildren. We had studies in the mid- and late 1960's about hunger in \nAmerica, TV documentaries. That is when we expanded the Food Stamp \nProgram.\n  Guess what? You bet it was a program that worked. I am not going to \nlet anybody get away with talking about fraud here and fraud there. \nYes, there are examples of fraud, no question about it, which should be \nstopped, but on the whole, this Food Stamp Program has made a gigantic \ndifference in reducing hunger and malnutrition in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Now we want to have drastic cuts in the Food Stamp Program, Women, \nInfants, and Children Program, and, in addition, you go after the \ndeficiency payments, the target prices, I say to the Chair, for \nfarmers.\n  The farmers in Minnesota are real clear. We took a big hit last time \naround on deficit reduction, and people in agriculture in my State are \nnot opposed to deficit reduction, but they want to see some standard of \nfairness. What family farmers say in Minnesota is, ``If you give us a \nprice in the marketplace, you can eliminate the target prices, you can \neliminate the deficiency payments.''\n  But if we do not have a fair price in the marketplace and you have \ndrastic cuts in deficiency payments, you will erode family farm income, \nyou will erode the value of the land and just as sure as that happens, \nwe will see family farmers go under.\n  This is simply unacceptable. If you want to raise the loan rate to a \nhigher level, if you want to give us a fair price in the marketplace, \ngreat, that is what people want. But instead what we have had is a \npolicy of low prices which, by definition--correct me--means target \nprice deficiency payments are higher, then that is now used as an \nexcuse for cutting these programs, when we have already taken one hit \nafter another.\n  The future for agriculture in this country is a fair price in the \nmarketplace. The future for agriculture is let us put value to our \nproducts. In Minnesota, we lead the Nation with farmer-owned value-\nadded farm co-ops. That is a big part of what people want to do. But we \nare not interested in not getting the fair price in the marketplace, \nnot having access to capital to move forward with our own cooperatives, \nnot being able to keep the value of what we produce in our communities \nand, in addition, seeing severe cuts in programs that provide needed \nincome to family farms. That is what these budget cuts do, Mr. \nPresident. That is what these budget cuts do.\n  [[Page S6474]] Why impose the most pain on those for whom it will be \nmost difficult to bear? Why ask the very people who cannot tighten \ntheir belts to tighten their belts? Where is the Minnesota standard of \nfairness?\n  I do not see a focus on cutting more unneeded military and corporate \nwelfare spending. I do not see a focus on eliminating lucrative tax \nbreaks for special interests. I do not see a focus on moving away on \nthe House side, and it seems to be that some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have split on this, on dealing with the problem \nof tax cuts for wealthy people.\n  What are we talking about? We are talking about $370-some billion, \nthe vast amount of which flows to people on the top. If you have an \nincome of $200,000 a year, it is a break of about $30,000. If you have \na family income of under $30,000 a year, it is a break of about $100 a \nyear. What are we talking about here? Where is the standard of \nfairness?\n  Mr. President, over and over and over again, through the time of this \n104th Congress, I have been on the floor. I remember when I first \nuttered these words, I thought to myself, ``Are you just giving a \nspeech or is it going to happen?'' I had to believe it was going to \nhappen to say it. I said that my fear is the deficit reduction is going \nto be based on the path of least political resistance. That is exactly \nwhat is going on.\n  I remember David Stockman's book about the early eighties. He said \nwhat we should have done was go after the weak claims, not the weak \nclaimants. We are not going after the weak claims, we are not going \nafter the corporate welfare, we are not going after the military \ncontracts, we are not going after the tax breaks, but we are going \nafter the family farmers, we are going after the children, we are going \nafter senior citizens, we are going after education.\n  There is no standard of fairness whatsoever. It is all based upon who \nare the folks who have the financial and the political clout to get \ntheir voice heard here and who are the vast majority of the people who \nare shut out of the process. We are going to have one sharp budget \ndebate. When it gets to Medicare and Medicaid, I am going to insist \nthat my colleagues know this policy well and understand exactly what \nthe consequences are of what they are doing. When it comes to the cuts \nin agriculture--disproportionate cuts--I want to make sure that people \nknow that we are talking about farmers not out of sight out of mind, \nbut the producers in this country, and what this is going to do to \nfamily farmers. When it comes to education, I want people to understand \nthe consequences of what it means when we do not invest in education \nand young people. When it comes to children and child nutrition \nprograms, I want to make this argument: Do not go after the most \nvulnerable citizens in this country.\n  When it comes to alternatives, I want to talk about the corporate \nwelfare, I want to talk about the tax dodgers, I want to talk about the \nmilitary contract, and I want to talk about how we really can contain \nhealth care costs. I look forward to this debate. I hope all of the \npeople in the United States of America are engaged in it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

The Republican budget plans in the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives propose unprecedented cuts in Medicare, some $250 to \n$300 billion over the next 7 years. Cuts of this magnitude will break \nAmerica's contract with the elderly. Millions of senior citizens will \nbe forced to go without health care they need. Millions more will have \nto choose between food on the table, adequate heat in the winter, \npaying the rent, and medical care.\n  These cuts will also be a heavy blow to the quality of American \nmedicine. It will damage hospitals and other health care institutions \nthat depend on Medicare and that provide essential care for Americans \nof all ages, not just senior citizens. Progress in medical research and \ntraining of health professionals depend on the financial stability of \nthese institutions. Academic health centers, public hospitals, and \nrural hospitals will bear an especially serious burden if these deep \ncuts are enacted.\n  In addition, such cuts will inevitably impose a hidden tax on workers \nand businesses who will face increased costs and higher insurance \npremiums as physicians and hospitals shift even more costs to the \nnonelderly.\n  According to recent statistics, Medicare now pays only 64 percent of \nwhat the private sector pays for comparable physician services. For \nhospital care, the figure is 68 percent. The proposed Republican cuts \nwill widen this already ominous gap even farther.\n  Because of the current gaps in Medicare, senior citizens already pay \ntoo much for the health care they need. Elderly Americans pay an \naverage of one-fifth of their income to purchase health care, a higher \nproportion than they paid before Medicare was enacted.\n  Yet the reason Medicare was enacted in the first place, 30 years ago, \nwas to deal with the health care crisis affecting the lives of older \nAmericans at that time. How can we care any less about their needs \ntoday?\n  Medicare today does not cover prescription drugs. Its coverage of \nhome health care and nursing home care is extremely limited. We go to \nany senior citizen home in America and ask the senior citizens there \nhow many of them are paying, say, $50 a month for prescription drugs, \nhalf the hands will go in the air. If asked how many pay $25 a month or \nmore per month for prescription drugs, three-quarters of the hands go \nin the air.\n  Looking at what has happened in terms of cost of those prescription \ndrugs, which are so necessary for the senior citizens, we find those \ncosts have been going right up through the roof. They are absolutely an \nessential part of the needs for our elderly people, and they are not \nincluded in the Medicare Program, and they are draining down scarce \nresources for retirees and for senior citizens.\n  Unlike virtually all private insurance policies, Medicare does not \nhave a ceiling on out-of-pocket costs. It does not cover eye care, it \ndoes not cover foot care, it does not cover dental care. All of those \nare important needs for our senior citizens.\n  Yet the Republican budget cuts will ask senior citizens to pay $900 \nmore a year out of their pockets when the cuts are fully implemented. \nAnd the Republican tax bill already passed by the House of \nRepresentatives gives the tax cut of $20,000 to wealthy individuals \nmaking more than $350,000 a year. That is not right and the American \npeople know it.\n  The assault on Medicare is based on five myths. Myth No. 1 is that \ndeep cuts are needed to save Medicare from bankruptcy. The hypocrisy of \nthis claim is astonishing. A few weeks ago, the House Republicans \nincluded a provision in their tax bill to take $90 billion out of the \nMedicare hospital insurance trust fund over the next 10 years. We did \nnot hear a word then about the impending bankruptcy of Medicare. They \ntook that amount of money out of the Medicare trust funds. They did not \nhave to unless they were interested in increasing the tax reductions \nfor the wealthiest individuals, but they took that out of the Medicare \ntrust funds.\n  Now they are talking about how the Medicare fund itself is facing \nfinancial difficulties, when just 3 weeks ago they took $90 billion out \nof there to use it for tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals.\n  It is true that an April 3 report of the Medicare trustees projects \nthat the Medicare hospital insurance trust funds will run out of money \nby the year 2002. Few, if any, Republicans will be talking about deep \nMedicare cuts to cure that problem if they did not also need such cuts \nto finance their tax cut for the wealthy.\n  As the Medicare trustees themselves noted in their report, modest \nadjustments can keep Medicare solvent for \n[[Page S6475]] an additional decade--plenty of time to find fair \nsolutions for the longer term. Similar projections of Medicare \ninsolvency have been made numerous times in the past. Each time, \nadjustments enacted by Congress were able to deal with the problem \nwithout jeopardizing beneficiaries, and we can do the same again.\n  For example, an estimated 20 percent of all Medicare hospitalizations \ncould be avoided with better preventive services, and more timely \nprimary and outpatient care. As much as 10 percent of all Medicare \nexpenditures may be due to fraud, and that could be reduced \nsubstantially by the better certification procedures. This has been \nshown by the hearings that have been held by Senator Cohen of Maine \nwith a series of recommendations which, fully implemented, would \nstabilize the Medicare trust fund.\n  The message is clear: We do not have to destroy Medicare in order to \nsave it. The American people understand that basic point, and Congress \nshould recognize it, too.\n  Myth No. 2 is that the Republican budget proposal is not a cut, \nbecause the total amount of spending will continue to grow. In fact, \nthe Republican plan calls for spending $250 billion less on Medicare \nthan the Congressional Budget Office says is necessary to maintain the \ncurrent level of services to beneficiaries.\n  Every household in America knows that if the cost of rent and \nutilities goes up and income stays the same, there is a real cut in \nyour standard of living. If Medicare pays $80 toward the cost of your \nvisit to a doctor in 1995 and the same $80 in 1996, but his fee goes up \nby $20, the value of your Medicare protection is cut by $20. Every \nsenior citizen understands that.\n  The irony is that our Republican colleagues accept this argument when \nthey talk about defense expenditures. They know that defense is being \ncut if funds increase more slowly than inflation. Our colleagues should \napply the same accounting rules to the needs of senior citizens as they \ndo the purchase of guns and tanks.\n  Myth No. 3 is that Medicare is different from Social Security and is \nan entitlement less deserving of protection. In fact, the distinction \nbetween Medicare and Social Security is false because Medicare is a \npart of Social Security.\n  Like Social Security, Medicare is a compact between the Government \nand the people. It says, ``Pay into the trust fund during your working \nyears and we will guarantee decent health care in your old age.'' Any \nelderly American who has been hospitalized or suffers from a serious \nchronic illness knows there is no security without Medicare. The cost \nof illness is too high. A week in intensive care can cost more than a \ntotal yearly income of most senior citizens. Low- and moderate-income \nelderly will suffer the most from Medicare cuts. Eighty-three percent \nof all Medicare spending is for older Americans with annual incomes \nbelow $25,000. Two-thirds is for those with incomes below $15,000.\n  Imagine, average income of $15,000 and trying to make ends meet when \na person fought in the world wars of this country, has been a part of \nthe whole building of the American economy, sacrificed to bring up \nchildren, and is barely making it at $15,000, and then there are the \nimportant health care needs to be attended to that are no fault of your \nown. Those are the people that we are talking about that are going to \nbe adversely impacted with these cuts.\n  When the Republicans tried to cut Social Security in the 1980's, the \nAmerican people said, ``No,'' and they will say no to these equally \ndamaging proposals to cut Medicare in the 1990's.\n  Myth No. 4 is that Medicare costs can be cut by encouraging seniors \nto join managed care. True, it can help bring medical costs under \ncontrol in the long run. Enrollment by senior citizens in managed care \nis already increasing rapidly. It is up by 75 percent since 1990, but \nno serious analyst believes that increased enrollment in managed care \nwill substantially reduce Medicare expenditures in the timeframe of the \nproposed Republican cut. In fact, according to the General Accounting \nOffice, Medicare is now actually losing money on managed care because \nonly the healthiest senior citizens tend to enroll in it, leaving \nMedicare left to pay for those more seriously ill.\n  The only realistic way to save money in the short term on managed \ncare is to penalize senior citizens who refuse to enroll. This option \nhas already been suggested by the Republican health task force in the \nHouse. I say it is wrong to force senior citizens to give up their \nfreedom to choose their own doctors and hospitals. It is wrong to \npenalize them financially if they refuse to enroll in managed care.\n  I will add, in the debate we had on the health care measures of last \nyear, that particular option was preserved for our senior citizens and \nit ought to be preserved in any health care reform.\n  Myth No. 5 is that the deep, unilateral cuts in Medicare are \nnecessary to balance the budget. As President Clinton told the White \nHouse Conference on Aging last week, 40 percent of the projected \nincrease in Federal spending in coming years will be caused by \nescalating health costs.\n  What this Republican budget fails to recognize is that the current \ngrowth in medical care is a symptom of the underlying program in the \nentire health care, not a defect in Medicare alone. In fact, Medicare \nhas done a better job than the private sector in restraining costs in \nrecent years.\n  Since 1984, Medicare costs have risen at an annual rate of 25 percent \nlower than comparable private health care spending. Slashing Medicare \nunilaterally is no way to balance the budget. It will simply shift the \ncosts from the budget of the Federal Government to the budgets of \nsenior citizens, their children, and their grandchildren.\n  If Medicare is cut in isolation, senior citizens will also face \ngreater discrimination from physicians and hospitals, who are less \nwilling to accept the elderly as patients, because Medicare \nreimbursements are much lower than the reimbursements available under \nprivate insurance.\n  We know that previous cuts in the Medicare reimbursement have led to \nserious cost-shifting, as physicians and hospitals seek to make up \ntheir reduced income from Medicare patients by charging higher fees to \nother patients. The result has been higher health care costs and higher \nhealth insurance premiums for everyone, as cost-shifting becomes a \nsignificant hidden tax on individuals and businesses.\n  The right way to slow Medicare growth is in the context of overall \nhealth reform that will slow rising health costs in the economy as a \nwhole. That is the way to bring Federal health costs under control \nwithout cutting benefits or shifting costs to working families, \ncomprehensive reform, to try to make available to our seniors good \nhealth care, preventive care programs to provide the services to keep \npeople out of the hospitals so they do not go into the high-cost \nfacilities, and to try to do something in terms of home care, \ncommunity-based care, which is much more satisfactory for our seniors \nand can be done at considerably less cost. And to build upon the \nnurses, nursing profession, to assist with skilled nursing attention \nsome of the needs for our seniors.\n  In the context of broad health reform, the special needs of academic \nhealth centers, rural health centers, inner-city hospitals also can be \naddressed. Deep Medicare cuts alone, by contrast, will undermine the \navailability and quality of care for young and old alike.\n  We are talking about the kind and quality of trained health personnel \nthat Medicare participates in. We are talking about necessary \ninstitutions, academic institutions which are the center for much of \nthe research that benefits our senior citizens. We are talking about \ndiminishing the kinds of research that has to take place in those areas \nas well.\n  President Clinton has emphasized he is willing to work for bipartisan \nreform of the health care system, but the Republicans have said no. The \nonly bipartisanship they seem to be interested in is the kind that \nsays, ``Join us in slashing Medicare.'' That is not the kind of \nbipartisanship the American people want. It is not the kind of \nbipartisanship that senior citizens deserve.\n  It is especially telling that Republicans are proposing these harsh \ncuts in Medicare at the same time they support the massive tax cut that \nwill disproportionately benefit the richest individuals and \ncorporations in our society. The Republican tax plan that has \n[[Page S6476]] already passed the House will reduce Federal revenues by \n$250 billion. Without that tax cut for the wealthy there would be \nvirtually no need to cut Medicare in order to achieve a balanced budget \nunder their plan. The Senate Budget Resolution reserves $170 billion \nfor tax cuts. Without that allocation the Medicare cuts could be \nreduced by two-thirds without any increase in the deficit.\n  The arguments used to justify deep cuts in Medicare cannot pass the \ntruth-in-labeling test. They will not fool the American people. As the \nceremonies on V-E Day earlier this week commemorating the end of World \nWar II in Europe reminded us, today's senior citizens have stood by \nAmerica in war and peace and America must stand by them now. The senior \ncitizens of today are the veterans of the Army, the Navy, the Air \nForce, the Marines, and the hard-working men and women on the home \nfront. They pulled us through that terrible war. We cannot pull the rug \nout from under them on Medicare now.\n  I urge the Senate to reject these unwise Republican proposals.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, we have all been receiving phone calls and \ngetting letters about the proposed budget that is being recommended now \nor being talked about and marked up in the respective committees in the \nSenate and House of Representatives. We have had time to talk to the \nchairmen of those committees and get copies of the proposal that they \nhave put forth. In other words, the great debate has started on this \nyear's budget.\n  I think we have to applaud the chairman of each committee because \nthey have come forward with very daring proposals. I applaud the \nchairmen, especially Senator Domenici of the Senate Budget Committee. \nWhen you look at our deficit spending we see, yes, that the deficit did \nbecome lower last year. It went down. But it now continues to climb. \nThe deficit this year alone stands at $175 billion, and for a while. \nBut, nonetheless, it is growing at the outrageous rate of $482 million \na day. That sounds like a lot of money to me.\n  So, consequently, it is time for this body and this Government to do \nsomething responsible and to deal very frankly with the budget, to be \nup front about it, and to try to address some of the problems that we \nhave because I think most Americans are wanting something done to rein \nit in.\n  It is absolutely necessary if we are to continue the economic \nviability and the leadership in this world for our Nation. We cannot \ncontinue to stand by and conduct business as usual, and in so doing \nallow the national debt to increase by $1 trillion every Presidential \nterm.\n  So the time has come for bold initiatives to look at getting spending \nunder control, and Senator Domenici's budget right now does exactly \nthat.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee slows the annual growth of most \nlines. Every line in that budget, with the exception of a few, grow \nevery year. We have heard a lot of attention brought to the Medicare \nline, growing 10 to 11 percent every year. Now we want to slow that \ngrowth because already the trustees of that trust fund have told us \nthat by the year 2002 it will be broke and they will pay no bills at \nall.\n  Also it transforms Medicaid into block grant funds to the States \nwhere they will have the responsibility to do something responsible to \nget spending under control.\n  It further calls for the establishment of a bipartisan congressional \ncommittee to represent policy changes needed to maintain the short-term \nsolvency of the Medicare system. Such measures would generate the \nsavings needed to put the system on a financially sound footing for the \nnext 7 years while we work together to develop a long-term solution for \nMedicare solvency gap. There can be no getting around the fact that, if \nwe continue on the path that we are presently on, Medicare will lapse \ninto bankruptcy within 7 years and then it will be too late, or too \nexpensive, to solve the problem.\n  The chairman's budget proposes the elimination of spending for the \nNational Biological Survey. I have long said that we had the resources \nwithin the organizations of the Fish and Wildlife, the Park Service, or \nin the Department of the Interior to do that without creating another \nbureau or the money that goes with it. We also want our policy \ndecisions based on sound science and we start dealing with the \nbiological makeup of this country or this world. And I think we can do \nit without the National Biological Survey.\n  The chairman's budget proposes the reduction in the Agricultural \nResearch Service by 10 percent which would reduce the total outlays in \nthis program by $1 million.\n  It is true that we all will not agree with this budget. This is one \narea where I do not agree. This is one area where we cannot pull back \non any investment in the research and development in agriculture. I \nwill stand on this floor and maintain until I can draw my last breath \nthat the second thing everybody who lives in this Nation does every \nmorning is eat. I do not know what the first thing is that they do. \nThey have a lot of options there. But I know the second thing they do \nis eat.\n  We still have an obligation to feed this Nation and this society.\n  So when it comes time to talking about budgets, basically that is \nwhat a balanced budget amendment would have done; make us talk about \nthe most important things and to set our priorities where we think \nthose important things are.\n  We have to look to the necessities of life, not to the frills but the \nnecessities of life and also the individual responsibility that each \none of us has at just being a citizen of this great country.\n  You might be surprised to know that for the first time in the history \nof agriculture our yields in wheat are going down, because we are just \nnot getting enough money for research, plant breeding, developing those \nstrains of wheat that are disease resistant because that is a constant \nthing; it goes on all the time. And so we must, if we are going to feed \nthis Nation--and right now, 1 farmer feeds 145 other people. Also, one \nof our greatest exports is agriculture. In fact, it has been in the \nblack forever. We have to continue with our ability to produce \nfoodstuffs, food and fiber for this society.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee also proposed the privatization \nof the PMA's, the power marketing administrations. They are making \nmoney for the Treasury. They also generate and produce power for our \nREA's. In rural America, we would not have electricity yet if it was \nnot for REA's. My father served on an REA board. I have often said if \nit was not for REA on the farms, we would be watching television by \ncandlelight.\n  We have to be very cautious in the way we set our priorities in this \nbudget. So consequently I think we have to take a very hard look at \nlong-term revenue implications that would happen, that is, if WAPA, \nwestern area power marketing, and the Southwest and the Southeast are \nmoved into private hands.\n  And this is nothing new. We will argue about different parts of the \nbudget. Where we set our priorities is what is really important for \nthis Nation and the people who live in it. That is what this budget \nwill do. But it will be a responsible budget that I am sure, after \nAmerica looks at it, we will have the confidence in its integrity to do \nwhat we have to do, and that is to balance the budget by the year 2002.\n  I do not think there is anything that will come before this body that \nwill be any more important than the issue of this budget and the \nroadmap, the blueprint to get us where we want to be as \n[[Page S6477]] not only an economically free and viable leader of the \nworld but also that keeps us free.\n  In conclusion, I wish to again praise the chairman. He presented a \nresponsible budget resolution, and I pledge to work with the Budget \nCommittee and all my colleagues to make sure we do those things that \nare necessary and do away with those things, those frills at this time \nin our history that we cannot afford just because we like to say we \nhave them.\n  So I wish to work with the chairman and this body in producing a \nbudget that will work for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n                              flow control\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nSenator Chafee, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and Senator Baucus, the committee's ranking member, regarding \nthe intent of S. 534 with respect to flow control.\n  Is it the intent of this bill to allow for the refinancing of public \ndebt for waste management facilities where only the interest rate would \nchange, and not the amount or maturity date of the bond?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, that is the intent of the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Is this the understanding of the Senator from Montana?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, that is my understanding as well.\n\n\n                  flow control and free market issues\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I seek recognition for the purpose of \nengaging in a colloquy with the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire, Senator Smith, the manager of S. 534.\n  First, may I congratulate my colleague on his skillful handling of \nthis difficult legislation.\n  Second, it is that very difficulty on which I would like to focus in \nthis colloquy.\n  I think my colleague would agree with me in my characterization of \nthis legislation as statutory interference with the commerce clause of \nthe Constitution of the United States. This interference comes as a \nresult of the Carbone versus Clarkstown decision, which has caused \nproblems with certain public facilities financed by revenue bonds. \nCarbone invalidated State and local laws which create a solid waste \nmonopoly for those facilities. And, of course, there is the continued \ndesire to come to grips with the problem of interstate transfer of \nsolid waste. I am especially aware of this problem because my own State \nof Pennsylvania has been the unwilling recipient of solid waste \nexported from New Jersey and New York, in particular.\n  Thus, we have a clash between the fundamental wisdom of the commerce \nclause and the practical effects of the interstate trade in solid \nwaste. May I ask my colleague from New Hampshire the following \nquestion?\n  Is it fair to state that he has attempted to craft legislation which \nwould interfere as little as possible with the commerce clause and \nthereby he would try to protect the free market where it has worked?\n  Mr. SMITH. I have stated before that I am not in favor of flow \ncontrol. Flow control is anticompetitive. But it is only fair and \nequitable that communities that have indebted themselves--completely \nwithin the law prior to the Supreme Court decision--must not be left to \nsuffer the consequences of financial failure. The outstanding municipal \nbonds that total more than $20 billion must be honored and the \ncommunities' financial stability must be maintained. However, only \nthose facilities with bonded revenues are given grandfather coverage \nunder this bill. Any municipality indebted after the Carbone decision \nis not and will not be protected.\n  The free market must prevail. Rather than assisting with the creation \nof yet another bloated Government bureaucracy, we should be encouraging \nthe establishment of a healthy free market, one in which competition \nkeeps prices low, offers consumers better services, and disposal \ntechniques are state-of-the-art.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Further, it appears to me that the interstate title of \nthis legislation gives my Commonwealth of Pennsylvania the tools it \nneeds to prevent abuse of our resources and environment. Could my \ncolleague comment on that?\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes, the interstate title gives the Governor of \nPennsylvania and the Governors of other affected States authority to \nensure that their States do not continue as unabated dumping grounds \nfor States which do not act to site their own disposal capacity.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Last, with regard to title II, flow control, may I \ninquire of my colleague whether this legislation imposes flow control \nor in any way makes it mandatory and thereby suppresses the free \nmarket?\n  Mr. SMITH. This legislation does not impose flow control. Flow \ncontrol is fundamentally incompatible with the principles of free \nenterprise, market competition, and the best interest of the consumer. \nRequiring the use of flow control would be a step backward in the \nhandling of municipal solid waste. This bill is designed specifically \nto protect the bond holders and commitments previously made. The free \nmarket is not broken, and with the inclusion of a 30-year sunset \nprovision, the free market will once again take over.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Based on the response of my colleague, may I validly \ndraw the following two conclusions?\n  First, this legislation allows the continuation of flow control as \npreviously enacted under State law under certain conditions but not \nrequire or mandate flow control.\n  Second, it is the intention of the distinguished subcommittee \nchairman that this legislation not be used in and of itself as an \nargument to suppress the free market.\n  Mr. SMITH. My colleague from Pennsylvania is correct in his \nconclusions regarding the spirit of the legislation. Flow control will \ncontinue under certain conditions but is not required or mandated. As I \nhave said before, the free market must be allowed to prevail.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank my distinguished colleague and again commend \nhim for so ably discharging this difficult responsibility.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am fortunate to come from a State with \n[[Page S6478]] sparsely populated expanses of some of the most \nbeautiful land in this country. States like South Dakota have a special \ninterest in the legislation before the Senate today, as it will \ndirectly affect their future.\n  The legislation, S. 534, amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to \nprovide important authority for States and local governments to better \ncontrol the transportation of municipal solid waste between and within \nStates.\n  The time has come to enact this legislation. States and local \ngovernment are facing increasing challenges in the responsible \nregulation of municipal waste management. Interstate shipments of waste \nhave been growing in recent years. Between 1990 and 1992, interstate \nshipments of waste grew by 4 million tons--a 25% increase. Currently, \nabout 15 million tons of municipal waste is transported between States \nfor treatment and disposal, much of it from densely populated regions \nto less populated areas.\n  Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that unless Congress acts \non this issue, States and local governments can have no meaningful role \nin controlling the movement of waste into and within their borders.\n  The combination of increasing interstate shipments of municipal waste \nand recent Supreme Court decisions understandably has created concern \namong States like South Dakota, who fear that without authority to \nrestrict unwanted imports of municipal waste, they will become the \ndumping ground for other, more heavily populated areas.\n  In addition, Congress has a responsibility to help protect the \ninvestments made by towns across America in municipal waste management \nfacilities--investments that have been placed in jeopardy by the \nSupreme Court's recent Carbone decision.\n  The temptation can be great to ship waste to the more remote regions \nof our country. But some of these lands are fragile and are home to \nsome of our country's greatest natural assets. In South Dakota alone, \nthe geological wonderland of the Badlands, the expansive prairie, and \nthe majestic Black Hills are examples of areas that deserve protection \nfrom the designs of anyone who would use them for waste disposal.\n  The responsibility for disposing trash produced by large urban areas \nshould be confronted and met by the citizens and community leaders who \nlive there. Rural States should never be considered as a waste \nmanagement option, unless they willingly choose to make their land \navailable for that purpose. In the end, the choice must belong to the \nState and local governments that would bear the long-term environmental \nconsequences of waste disposal.\n  This bill addresses the rights and responsibilities of States and \nlocal governments to achieve their own environmental and economic \nobjectives. It is about State and local self-determination. The \ninterstate waste provisions of this bill represent a delicate balance \nbetween States that import and export waste. It is a step in the right \ndirection because it encourages States to take responsibility for \nmanaging the waste they generate, rather than sending it elsewhere. Out \nof sight and out of mind will not work when it comes to management of \nmunicipal solid waste, particularly if it means leaving it within the \nsight and on the minds of those who do not want it.\n  Reduce, reuse, and recycle is a better solution. It represents a \nphilosophy that more States will have to adopt as a result of this \nbill.\n  Like most legislation, this bill will not completely satisfy the \nobjectives of every State or local government. Some States, like South \nDakota, would like, and I believe deserve, even greater authority to \nprevent imports of waste. Other States, which with an interest in \nexporting municipal waste, would prefer to see fewer restrictions. \nLikewise, I am aware that while there are cities and towns that would \nprefer to have greater and more enduring authority to regulate flow \ncontrol, there are Members of this body who feel that the free and \nunfettered competition of the marketplace should be given a greater \nopportunity to determine the flow of municipal waste.\n  This bill strikes a reasonable balance between these competing \ninterests, one that I believe is essential if we are to move forward \nand enact meaningful legislation. It gives States and local governments \nthe ability to promote their own environmental goals and meet important \nfinancial obligations. We must pilot a course of responsible \nstewardship of our resources. This bill gives States and cities the \npower to do just that, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this important and timely legislation.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, this amendment addresses a problem of \nincreasing urgency in my part of the country, my home State of New \nMexico. That is, the disposition of solid waste, along the United \nStates-Mexico border.\n  As the United States and Mexico move further into their trade \nrelationship under the North American Free-Trade Agreement, increased \ndevelopment along the border is inevitable. With that development comes \nnew challenges regarding the transport and disposal of solid waste.\n  This is not just an issue for the Governments of the United States \nand Mexico, it is also an issue for the four border States of \nCalifornia, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. It is one that we need to \ndeal with in this legislation, and capitalize on the opportunity \noffered by NAFTA. We are going to have to plan for this increased \ndevelopment. This means conducting necessary research on the scope of \nthe problem.\n  The amendment authorizes the Administrator of EPA to conduct a study \nof solid waste management issues associated with this increased use of \nthe area along the border, in order that States and localities can \nproperly plan for waste treatment, transportation, storage and \ndisposal.\n  The study will address six key issues. First, planning for additional \nlandfill capacity; second, related impact on border communities of a \nregional siting of solid waste storage and disposal facilities; third, \nresearch on methods of tracking the transportation of materials to and \nfrom industries located along the border; fourth, the need for \nmaterials safety training for workers; fifth, the adequacy of existing \nemergency response networks in the border region; sixth, a review of \nsolid waste management practices in the entire border region.\n  It is my expectation that the Administrator, in order to fulfill the \nrequirements of the amendment, would enter into contractual agreements \nwith other entities such as States and universities and university \nconsortia.\n  Mr. President, I am convinced in the long run NAFTA will prove to be \na good movement, a good initiative for economic opportunities for my \nhome State of New Mexico and for the entire border region.\n  This is only true if we manage these opportunities correctly and deal \nwith the potential health and environment problems that the increased \ndevelopment will bring. This amendment helps to do that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I understand the \namendment has been reviewed by both the manager and the ranking member, \nand that this amendment is accepted.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this is a good amendment, and I \ncongratulate the Senator from New Mexico. It is acceptable to this \nside.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I agree. The Senator from New Mexico has \nconsulted with Senators, and I appreciate the approach he is taking. \nThere is a problem with respect to what he raises.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 761) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Privilege of the Floor--S. 534\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ken Berg, a \nfellow from the office of Senator Boxer, have the privileges of the \nfloor during consideration of S. 534, and that Linda Critchfield, a \nfellow from the office of Senator Lieberman, be allowed on the floor \nduring consideration of S. 534.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment for the purpose of offering an amendment which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. KYL] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 769.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 57, strike line 16 and all that follows through \n     page 58, line 22, and insert the following:\n       ``(4) Continued effectiveness of authority during \n     amortization of financing.--\n       ``(A) In general.--With respect to each designated waste \n     management facility or facilities, or Public Service \n     Authority, authority may be exercised under this section \n     only--\n       ``(i) until the date on which payments under the schedule \n     for payment of the capital costs of the facility concerned, \n     as in effect on May 15, 1994, are completed; and\n       ``(ii) so long as all revenues (except for revenues used \n     for operation and maintenance of \n     [[Page S6480]] the designated waste management facility or \n     facilities, or Public Service Authority) derived from tipping \n     fees and other fees charged for the disposal of waste at the \n     facility concerned are used to make such payments.\n       ``(B) Refinancing.--Subparagraph (A) shall not be construed \n     to preclude refinancing of the capital costs of a facility, \n     but if, under the terms of a refinancing, completion of the \n     schedule for payment of capital costs will occur after the \n     date on which completion would have occurred in accordance \n     with the schedule for payment in effect on May 15, 1994, the \n     authority under this section shall expire on the earlier of--\n       ``(i) the date specified in subparagraph (A)(i); or\n       ``(ii) the date on which payments under the schedule for \n     payment, as in effect after the refinancing, are completed.\n       ``(C) Any political subdivision of a State exercising flow \n     control authority pursuant to subsection (c) may exercise \n     such authority under this section only until completion of \n     the original schedule for payment of the capital costs of the \n     facility for which permits and contracts were in effect, \n     obtained or submitted prior to May 15, 1994.''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the amendment which I offer now will tighten \nthe flow control provisions of title II to more accurately reflect what \nI believe is the committee's intent; namely, to authorize flow control \nfor a limited period of time to ensure that States and political \nsubdivisions are able to service the debt that they incurred for the \nconstruction of solid waste management facilities prior to the Carbone \ndecision.\n  Flow control is inherently anticompetitive. It was ruled a violation \nof the Constitution's commerce clause by the U.S. Supreme Court in the \nCarbone case. The Court ruled:\n\n       State and local governments may not use their regulatory \n     power to favor local enterprise by prohibiting patronage of \n     out-of-State competitors of their facilities.\n\n  While Justice O'Connor in a concurring opinion noted Congress' power \nto authorize local imposition of flow control, I do not believe it is \nin the public interest to sanction these Government monopolies \nintrastate, and it could impede competition, particularly for any more \nthan the minimum amount of time required for State and local \ngovernments to pay off the debt that they incurred prior to the Supreme \nCourt decision.\n  So my amendment would authorize flow control authority only until the \ndebt incurred prior to the Carbone decision is repaid. During the \nperiod for which flow control is authorized, revenues derived from \ntipping fees and other fees charged at the flow control designated \nfacility--these are net of revenues used for operation and maintenance \nof the facility, of course--must be used to pay off the debt \nobligations.\n  This amendment would permit the refinancing of debt to allow State \nand local governments to take advantage of lower interest rates when \nthey are available. However, flow control authority would end on the \ndate on which the original debt would have been repaid or the date on \nwhich the refinanced debt is repaid, whichever is earlier.\n  Mr. President, it appears to me that flow control has only one \npurpose; and, that is, to protect State or local monopolies that have \ndeveloped in the disposal of municipal solid waste. That only hurts \ntaxpayers, and there is no good reason for it.\n  Flow control does not offer the benefit of added protection for human \nhealth and the environment either. According to a March 1995 report by \nthe Environmental Protection Agency:\n\n       Protection of human health and the environment is directly \n     related to the implementation and enforcement of federal, \n     State, and local environmental regulations. Regardless of \n     whether State or local governments administer flow control \n     programs, States are required to implement and enforce \n     federally approved regulations that fully protect human \n     health and the environment. Accordingly, there are no \n     empirical data showing that flow control provides more or \n     less protection.\n\n  That is the end of quoting from the EPA report. In other words, \ndisposal facilities, whether public or private, must meet the same \nstandards of environmental protection. Flow control does not add to the \nenvironmental protection.\n  Flow controls do result in substantially increased costs to \ncommunities across the country. That can have negative impacts on the \nenvironment due to the extent that it creates incentives for illegal \ndumping. In fact, in a column that appeared in the Washington Times on \nMarch 23 of this year, the mayor of Jersey City, Bret Schundler, noted;\n\n       All of the illegal dumping that New Jersey is now suffering \n     from because of the soaring costs of waste disposal.\n\n  In New Jersey, where flow control is in place, the price of disposal \nis approaching $100 per ton. That compares to an average of about $35 \nper ton in areas without flow control.\n  Although flow controls do not typically add as much as that to the \ncost of disposal in other parts of the country, the increased costs can \nstill be substantial. A study just released by National Economic \nResearch Associates found that flow controls increase disposal costs on \naverage $14 a ton, or 40 percent. That is 40 percent, Mr. President, \nthat flow controls add to the cost of disposal. That is an additional \ncost that individuals and businesses must ultimately bear.\n  For example, again, Mayor Schundler notes that flow control prevents \nhis community from reducing property taxes or taking advantage of lower \ncost alternatives.\n  That is wrong and it is unnecessary.\n  Some might say that flow control is needed to ensure sufficient waste \nmanagement capacity or to help State and local governments achieve \ngoals for source reduction, reuse and recycling. Again EPA's answer is \nno. In its March report, EPA stated, and I am quoting:\n\n       There are no data showing that flow controls are essential \n     either for the development of new solid waste capacity or the \n     long-term achievement of State and local goals for source \n     reduction, reuse and recycling.\n\n  What about the necessity of flow control to finance new landfills or \nlandfill expansions? Again EPA's answer is no. Again quoting:\n\n       Flow controls do not appear to have played a significant \n     role in financing new landfills.\n  In fact, Mr. President, EPA goes on to note that private landfill \nfirms have demonstrated their ability to raise substantial capital from \npublicly issued equity offerings, indicating that investors are willing \nto provide capital for the expansion of landfills without flow control \nguarantees. In other words, the private sector is willing and able to \naccommodate the demand for landfill capacity.\n  In some instances, flow control laws have not merely been used to \ngenerate revenues to finance construction and O costs but also for \nthe purpose of funding other activities, like recycling, composting, \nand hazardous waste collection, to name a few. That would be fine if \nState and local governments were not using the force of law to compel \nthe use of specified facilities at specified rates, if they competed in \nthe free market. But they are using statutory authority to compel \ncertain sites. Users are therefore required, by law, to subsidize other \nactivities.\n  To the extent that we are considering limited flow control relief to \nhelp protect State and local investments, the revenues derived should \nbe used solely for that purpose and not other things. My amendment will \nlimit the use of revenues to that purpose.\n  Mr. President, our goal here should not be to preserve \nanticompetitive practices but to establish a framework for orderly \ntransition, to allow limited relief for State and local governments \nthat had in good faith made commitments based on the law as they \nunderstood it prior to the Carbone decision.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment and \nresist efforts to carve out exceptions to protect or extend local \nmonopoly power. And, Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, I \nask that the full text of Mayor Schundler's column be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Washington (DC) Times, Mar. 23, 1995]\n\n                The Smelly Truth About Garbage Disposal\n\n                          (By Bret Schundler)\n\n       Last May, in a case called Carbone vs. Town of Clarkstown \n     the United States Supreme Court held that state-imposed \n     waste-flow regulations violate the commerce clause of the \n     Constitution.\n       This was an important and proper decision.\n       But today, the Republican-controlled House Commerce \n     Committee will hold hearings on anti-free-market legislation \n     that would re-establish the authority of states to set up \n     government monopolies in garbage disposal. The flow-control \n     legislation that \n     [[Page S6481]] will be considered is bad public policy, and \n     it should be rejected.\n       To understand how this issue affects you, let's look at the \n     experience of New Jersey.\n       Prior to the Carbone decision, New Jersey used the guise of \n     solid-waste-flow regulation to establish county government \n     monopolies called ``improvement authorities'' that are given \n     the power to dictate to mayors where--and at what price--they \n     must dispose of their municipal garbage. Experience teaches \n     us that anytime a public or private monopoly controls the \n     quantity and price of a service, that monopoly will have no \n     incentive to control costs or improve services. And this is \n     precisely what has occurred in New Jersey.\n       Let's look at the issue of cost. The average price for the \n     disposal of solid waste in America is only $35 per ton. But \n     in New Jersey, thanks to the establishment of governmental \n     disposal monopolies, the price is fast approaching $100 per \n     ton.\n       Now let's look at the quality of services delivered. The \n     defenders of the status quo argue that allowing private \n     disposal sites to compete on the basis of cost is \n     environmentally unsound. But, in fact, it is easy to regulate \n     private disposal sites to ensure that proper environmental \n     standards are maintained. What is not easy to regulate is all \n     of the illegal dumping that New Jersey is now suffering from \n     because of the soaring costs of waste disposal.\n       Apologists for the former Soviet Union used to contend that \n     government-run industries are more environmentally sensitive \n     than industries under private control. But we now know that \n     the reverse is true. Government-controlled industry tends to \n     be less responsible than private industry, because when \n     industry and regulator are one in the same, the inherent \n     conflict of interest is invariably resolved in favor of lax \n     enforcement of environmental safeguards.\n       Instead of building and protecting government monopolies, \n     we should be encouraging the creation of a healthy free \n     market of properly regulated private disposal firms. These \n     firms should compete not only on the basis of price, but also \n     in terms on the basis of price, but also in terms of \n     environmentally sound disposal techniques. Protected \n     government monopolies, in contrast, will never have any \n     incentive to innovate.\n       The New Jersey Environmental Federation, representing all \n     of the state's lending environmental organizations, has \n     joined me and other New Jersey mayors in opposing waste-flow-\n     control legislation. According to the Federation, New \n     Jersey's governmental monopoly in waste disposal stifles \n     ``technical innovation, private investment, and market \n     development for lower cost, environmentally preferable \n     material recovery and composting technologies.'' The \n     Federation is right on target.\n       New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd, Whitman supports the \n     maintenance of country waste disposal monopolies. This is \n     because the governor believes that a competitive market would \n     cause financial chaos. She worries that without having a \n     guaranteed source of revenue, county improvement authorities, \n     which have borrowed large sums of money to build \n     incinerators, could possibly default on their bonds. But \n     there is a solution to this problem that is much preferable \n     to the current flawed policy.\n       Stated simply. New Jersey could issue bonds to pay off the \n     existing debt that county governments have incurred to build \n     government disposal facilities. Next the state could \n     establish a $10-per-ton surcharge on solid waste disposal \n     fees, which could be used to fully amortize the new bonds in \n     just 10 years. County disposal facilities, freed of debt \n     service costs, could immediately drop their rates by a like \n     $10-per-ton--or more. Municipalities, able to find less \n     expensive disposal alternatives, could take advantage of the \n     opportunity, and thereby provide their residents with much-\n     needed property-tax relief.\n       In many New Jersey counties, the property-tax relief that \n     could be realized is substantial. In some counties, market \n     prices for disposal are than $50-per-ton less than the \n     governmental monopoly price. After the $10-per-ton surcharge \n     that would have to be paid to the state, local taxpayers \n     could still save $40-per-ton of waste generated.\n       The current system makes no sense. In Jersey City, because \n     of government monopoly pricing we pay almost 50 percent more \n     to dispose of our solid waste than does neighboring New York \n     City, which pays free-market rates to dump at a disposal \n     facility located just outside Newark, NJ. This is ridiculous!\n       As a mayor, I'm the one who must collect from property \n     owners the taxes they pay for garbage disposal. But New \n     Jersey's waste-flow-control regulations prevent me from \n     taking advantage of lower priced, more environmentally sound \n     disposal alternatives.\n       The effect of these flow-control regulations is to prohibit \n     me from reducing property taxes for my residents. And when I \n     have to raise property taxes to pay for skyrocketing disposal \n     costs, residents do not get angry with the state. Neither do \n     they direct their ire at the executive director of the county \n     improvement authority for running a costly, inefficient \n     government bureaucracy, bursting at the seams with \n     unnecessary patronage workers. Instead, property owners get \n     mad at me, because I am the one who must send out the bills \n     to pay for all of this foolishness.\n       I know very well why some county governments in New Jersey \n     support flow-control legislation. It's nice to have a \n     relatively anonymous place where you can place patronage \n     hires and generate huge contracts for law firms and \n     consultants, who subsequently get tapped for political \n     campaign contributions. This arrangement is especially nice, \n     in the view of some county officials, since it is the mayors, \n     and not county executives, who will get the blame for soaring \n     property taxes.\n       But we should realize by now that government never works \n     well when power is insulated from accountability. Good \n     government requires that power be kept as close to the people \n     as possible. Good government also requires that a clear \n     demarcation of responsibility exist between different levels \n     of government, so that the people know whom to throw out of \n     office for unnecessarily inflating service costs or degrading \n     the environment. Flow control legislation flies in the face \n     of these principles. It is not good government.\n       America was built on the principles of the free market, \n     where there are natural incentives for the providers of goods \n     and services to be efficient and to keep prices down. There \n     isn't any legitimate reason not to allow these same market \n     forces to ensure that municipalities have the freedom to \n     dispose of garbage by taking advantage of the least \n     expensive, most environmentally sound alternatives.\n       With Congress now looking at school choice and other forms \n     of empowerment as the way to reform our education system and \n     enhance the provision of essential government services, it \n     would be a travesty to allow states to move away from free-\n     market solutions in the area of garbage disposal.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me conclude by summarizing in this \nfashion.\n  What we are dealing with here is municipalities coming to Congress \nand asking for relief from a Supreme Court decision which said that \nwhat certain States had done in the past, limiting the free flow of \ninterstate commerce, in this case in treating garbage, solid waste, was \nan unconstitutional infringement on the commerce clause, and so unless \nthe Congress acts, these arrangements that have been entered into by \nthe States will not be able to proceed in a monopoly fashion. They will \nhave to compete with the private market. As the EPA report notes, the \nprivate market is quite capable of working in this area.\n  And so some municipalities have said, well, since we made our \ndecision on good faith, based upon the law as we knew it, we should at \nleast be protected to the extent that it takes us to pay off the \ninvestment, to pay off the bonds, and my amendment would grant that \ngrandfathering authority. We would say to these municipalities, \nwhatever the length of your bond period is to pay off those bonds, we \nwill grant you the authority to create a monopoly so you have no \ncompetition, if that is what you want, and you can pay off those bonds. \nBut you should not be entitled to have a monopoly beyond that point.\n  What this amendment boils down to, Mr. President, is which side you \nare on. Are you for saying that for the period of time that it takes a \nmunicipality to pay off the bonds we should grant this grandfathering \nexception, or should we grant even further extensions, and here are the \ntwo that are most frequently cited.\n  In some cases it is said that a municipality has a contract to accept \nwaste and dispose of it lasting longer than the period of the bond \nrepayment. So let us hypothetically assume you have a 20-year bond and \na 30-year contract. They would argue that the length of time for the \nmonopoly protection should be 30 years, not 20 years. There is \nabsolutely no logic to that whatsoever.\n  Once the 20 years has elapsed, the bonds have been paid, the facility \nnow exists debt free, it ought to be able to compete, for the last 10 \nyears of its contract, with anybody in the private market who comes \nalong with the necessity of raising the capital to construct a facility \nto compete with that municipal facility and then to treat this garbage \nat a lesser rate.\n  In any event, the city has the contract for the remaining 10 years, \nand the other contracting party is required to comply with the terms of \nthe contract. So there are two reasons why there is no reason to extend \nthe grandfathering protection, monopoly protection, of this legislation \nbeyond the term that it takes to repay the debt.\n  No. 1, the party providing the garbage has to fulfill its end of the \ncontract regardless of what we do, so the municipality is protected in \nthat regard. And No. 2, the municipality has a free facility, in \neffect, a facility that is \n[[Page S6482]] now totally paid up. If it cannot compete with the \nprivate market under those circumstances, then there is something \ndrastically wrong and the Congress should not be creating a monopoly to \npermit that to occur.\n  As I noted, EPA has noted there is neither a problem with \nenvironmental laws nor a problem with generating fees for other \npurposes here.\n  So that is the first argument that is raised, that we should extend \nit to the contract period. The other is more amorphous, and that is \nthat we should extend this to the useful life of the plant. That is in \neffect selling the entire concept of the free market down the drain. We \nmay as well say let us have socialized garbage. If we are saying that \nthe municipality can have the monopoly protection for the entire life \nof the plant, then we are providing no opportunity for competition \nwhatsoever.\n  Is it not enough that we allow them the monopoly protection until \nthey have repaid all of their debts? Is it not enough that a \ncontracting party would still have to abide by the terms of the \ncontract and sell its garbage to the city under the terms of that \ncontract? Are we now being asked to also extend this monopoly power to \nthe useful life of the plant, whatever they may define that to be? It \nis a very unclear definition as to what that is. And there are not very \nmany plants that are that well planned whose life can be extended \nwithout modernizing the plant. So we want municipalities to do this. \nThat is fine. So municipalities are asking for virtually unlimited \npower.\n  With that in mind, the committee has wisely said ``enough.'' At 30 \nyears, enough is enough. We will not extend this protection beyond 30 \nyears. That was a wise thing for the committee to do. But I submit the \ncommittee should not have gone that far; that it ought to be sufficient \nthat the municipality is granted the monopoly protection until all of \nits obligations for repayment of the bonds have been satisfied. At that \npoint, it ought to have to compete along with anybody else. And for us \nto grant an exemption beyond that is to do something which the U.S. \nSupreme Court has said is violative of the commerce clause of the \nConstitution. And our oath requires us not to do that.\n  That is why, despite the fact that I have no interest in this--my \nState is not involved. I have no municipality or county government in \nthe State of Arizona contacting me on this because we are not a State \nthat does this. So I have no personal interest in this, or political \ninterest. But it does seem to me that as Senators we have an obligation \nto do what is right as a country. The legislation which the committee \nhas crafted has very carefully taken care of very severe problems in \nvery specific situations.\n  Those States--and I would mention one, New Jersey--have been \naccommodated under the committee legislation. It is not necessary to \nbroaden this exemption any beyond what my amendment would provide for.\n  So, Mr. President, I would be happy to engage in a colloquy with \nanyone who would like to inquire further as to the effect or intent of \nmy amendment. I intend eventually to call for a vote. I will be very \nhappy to debate this under a time agreement, starting with whenever \nanyone would wish to enter into such an agreement.\n  But I certainly hope that my colleagues will realize that the \nmunicipalities that need this relief are not in a position to hold \nleverage over our head. The U.S. Senate does not have to succumb to \nwhat municipalities would desire or like to have in this regard, but \nonly that which they need. And that is all that we ought to be granting \nthem if we are talking about monopoly power in an area where the free \nmarket should work just fine, again, according to the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  I yield the floor at this point. If no one wishes to examine my views \non this at this point, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, is there a pending amendment and, if so, I \nask unanimous consent that it be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a tabling \nvote occur in relation to the pending Kyl amendment at 2:30 p.m. today \nand that no second-degree amendments be in order to the Kyl amendment \nprior to the tabling vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, that vote will occur at 2:30 p.m. on the \ntabling motion unless it is vitiated. As it is now, it appears we will \nbe having that tabling vote at 2:30.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 773\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf \nof Senator Faircloth and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for Mr. \n     Faircloth, proposes an amendment numbered 773.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 59, after line 20, insert the following:\n       (6) Flow Control Ordinance.--Notwithstanding anything to \n     the contrary in this section, but subject to subsection (j), \n     any political subdivision which adopted a flow control \n     ordinance in November 1991, and designated facilities to \n     receive municipal solid waste prior to April 1, 1992, may \n     exercise flow control authority until the end of the \n     remaining life of all contracts between the political \n     subdivision and any other persons regarding the movement or \n     delivery of municipal solid waste or voluntarily relinquished \n     recyclable material to a designated facility (as in effect \n     May 15, 1994). Such authority shall extend only to the \n     specific classes or categories of municipal solid waste to \n     which flow control authority was actually applied on or \n     before May 15, 1994. The authority under this subsection \n     shall be exercised in accordance with section 4012(b)(4).\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this deals with flow control and it \npertains to a community in North Carolina which had a very specialized \nsituation. In effect, it is a technical amendment. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If not, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 773) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment before the Senate be set aside for such length of \ntime as it takes me to offer an amendment which has been accepted by \nthe other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 775\n\n  (Purpose: To revise the provision providing additional flow control \n                               authority)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       [[Page S6483]] The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] \n     proposes an amendment numbered 775.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 58, strike line 23 and all that follows through \n     page 59, line 20, and insert the following:\n       ``(5) Additional authority.--\n       ``(A) Application of paragraph.--This paragraph applies to \n     a State or political subdivision of a State that, on or \n     before January 1, 1984--\n       ``(i) adopted regulations under State law that required the \n     transportation to, and management or disposal at, waste \n     management facilities in the State, of--\n       ``(I) all solid waste from residential, commercial, \n     institutional, or industrial sources (as defined under State \n     law); and\n       ``(II) recyclable material voluntarily relinquished by the \n     owner or generator of the recyclable material; and\n       ``(ii) as of Jan 1, 1984, had implemented those regulations \n     in the case of every political subdivision of the State.\n       ``(B) Authority.--Notwithstanding anything to the contrary \n     in this section (including subsection (j)), a State or \n     political subdivision of a State described in subparagraph \n     (A) may continue to exercise flow control authority \n     (including designation of waste management facilities in the \n     State that meet the requirements of subsection (c)) for all \n     classes and categories of solid waste that were subject to \n     flow control on Jan 1, 1984.''\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment follows the construct \nof this bill by protecting flow control authority that was in effect \nbefore May 15, 1994. Its provisions will sunset in 30 years.\n  With these limitations or restrictions, the amendment is narrowly \ncrafted to respond to a very special situation in New Jersey, about \nwhich I spoke on the floor yesterday. I appreciate the willingness of \nthe committee chairman, Senator Chafee, and the subcommittee chairman, \nSenator Smith, to accept this narrowly crafted amendment, which will \navoid the need for New Jersey to export increasing volumes of waste and \nwill permit the State to meet its self-sufficiency goals by the year \n2000.\n  While I cannot say that I share the enthusiasm that some have for the \nstructure created by this bill, I, nevertheless, accept it. At present, \nI intend to support the bill and vote for it. I say at present, \nobviously, because if there are any amendments that are new and \nadopted, I reserve the right at that point to reexamine my decision.\n  At present, as I say, I intend to support the bill. I hope and trust \nthat the bill itself will quickly be adopted in the Senate, in \nconference, and sent to the President to be signed into law. Otherwise, \nNew Jersey and many other States face a potential waste disposal crisis \nand serious financial disruption of the plans and the indebtedness that \nexists out there.\n  As I earlier said, it has been my understanding that the chairman of \nthe subcommittee, who I worked very closely with on several \nenvironmental matters, Senator Smith, has accepted this amendment. I \nask him for any comments he wants to make.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, we have accepted the amendment. The Senator \nfrom New Jersey has mentioned his amendment is a special situation in \nNew Jersey. We are aware of this. It was the spirit and intent of the \ncompromise language in the bill to deal with those special \ncircumstances that New Jersey has, being an entire system for flow \ncontrol.\n  Even though we have some philosophical disagreements on the subject \nof flow control, part of the very carefully crafted compromise was that \nwe would do our best to deal with those folks who had made certain \ncommitments in this rather unique situation in New Jersey.\n  This side has no objection to the amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the subcommittee chairman.\n  Mr. President, this amendment recognizes the unique situation in New \nJersey. New Jersey is the only State in our Nation in which all \nmunicipal solid waste is now flow controlled and has been flow \ncontrolled for over a decade. This extensive use of flow control was \nnecessary in order to reduce our exports of garbage to other States. \nAnd it has worked.\n  New Jersey has decreased exports by 50 percent since 1988 and we are \non target to be self-sufficient by the year 2000.\n  However, we do face some problems in terms of our existing \nfacilities. Although New Jersey already recycles 53 percent of its \nwaste stream, New Jersey exports 2 million tons of waste. There is not \nsufficient capacity in my State today to handle that volume. Facilities \nwill be needed if we are to further reduce exports and become self-\nsufficient.\n  Therefore, New Jersey will need to build new facilities. Without flow \ncontrol, however, it will be impossible to provide the needed capacity.\n  Lenders will not finance new facilities when it appears waste can \neasily and cheaply be exported. Without this amendment, therefore, it \nwill be impossible to handle the waste volumes that we do export and we \nwill continue to export more waste. That is not what Senators from \nother neighboring States want. And it is not what New Jersey wants.\n  New Jersey has attempted, probably more than any other State, to \nlimit its exports. Title I, to restrict exports of solid waste, and \nfurther restrictions discussed by Mr. Coats, will make it harder to \nsend waste across State lines.\n  Under my amendment, New Jersey will be able to live with some \ninterstate restrictions because the amendment will protect the system \nNew Jersey has worked so hard to develop. Under this amendment, title I \nrestrictions on interstate shipments will not be a problem to my State.\n  And the title II flow control provisions will allow facilities to be \nbuilt so that New Jersey can control and dispose of its waste.\n  This amendment follows the construct of the bill in that it protects \nflow control authority that was in effect before May 15, 1994. It will \nsunset in 30 years.\n  With these limitations and restrictions, this amendment is narrowly \ncrafted to respond to the very special situation in New Jersey that I \nspoke of yesterday on the floor.\n  I appreciate the willingness of Chairman Chafee and Subcommittee \nChairman Smith to accept this narrowly crafted amendment which will \navoid the need for New Jersey to export increasing volumes of waste and \nwill allow the State to meet its self-sufficiency goals by 2000.\n  While I cannot say that I share the enthusiasm that some have for the \nstructure created by this bill, I do accept it. I intend to support the \nbill and vote for it. And I hope and trust it will quickly be adopted \nin the Senate, conferenced, and sent to the President to be signed into \nlaw.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 775) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SMITH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, it is a unique situation when the Senator \nwho has an amendment on the floor is presiding, because he is in the \nunfortunate situation of not being able to respond at this particular \ntime. I apologize to the Senator for that, because I have another \ncommitment. I have to chair a subcommittee meeting at 1:30.\n  I do want to make some remarks, but at some point later, if the \nSenator wishes to engage in any type of colloquy, I would be more than \nhappy to do that with him.\n  Mr. President, I want to clarify that the current business before the \nSenate is the Kyl amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Hatch amendment to the Specter amendment \nto the substitute.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 769\n\n  Mr. SMITH. I will make some remarks in response to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, in regard to \nshortening the grandfather to the length of the bonds.\n  This is a difficult situation for this Senator, because in concept \nand in philosophy I totally agree with what the Senator from Arizona is \ntrying to do.\n  I have made my statement here on the floor regarding this issue in \nthe opening debate on the bill that I oppose \n[[Page S6484]] flow control. I think that the interstate commerce \nclause should be safeguarded. I do not want Congress to interfere.\n  The reason why we have had a difficult time with this issue, I say to \nmy colleagues, is that there are special circumstances where people \nhave incurred a tremendous amount of expense. As the Senator from \nArizona, Senator Kyl, said in his very eloquent remarks regarding his \namendment, the free enterprise system should be allowed to work.\n  We might say, why did those people go ahead and make these financial \nobligations, knowing full well that they did not have the protection of \nthe law? I think that is a very valuable argument and an argument that \nwe certainly considered as we crafted this bill.\n  The problem was, and we had a hearing on this matter, and as we heard \nfrom so many witnesses, there truly are some real national hardships \nout there that, in terms of the investors, in some cases through no \nfault of their own, perhaps, although not deliberately misled, some of \nthe bondholders probably did not get the full explanation of the impact \nof the Carbone decision and what it meant for all of their investments \nin these bonds.\n  It was something that we really struggled with, those members on the \ncommittee, Senator Chafee and myself and others on the committee, who \nreally oppose flow control and did not want to interfere with the free \nmarket on this issue.\n  On the other side there are two sections of the bill. The interstate \nwaste transfer is part of this legislation as well. So we have flow \ncontrol and interstate waste. The two parts of this bill, together, is \na very carefully crafted compromise to move both things forward at the \nsame time.\n  I guess with some amusement we think of how when laws and sausages \nare made, we would be sick if we knew it. Maybe this is an example of \nthat.\n  Again, I will with great reluctance oppose the amendment of the \nSenator from Arizona because of the fact it interferes with the \ncompromise. I will be specific, again, on the basis of the compromise, \nnot on the basis of philosophy.\n  We heard testimony from the Public Securities Association that $20 \nbillion in bonds were used for flow control facilities. So, nationwide \nthere is some $20 billion in bonds out there.\n  These people have a liability. There is some question, we would say, \nwell, we went in knowing full well--maybe they did, maybe they did not. \nThis Senator is not convinced that all investors knew this. I could be \nwrong.\n  I think it is pretty obvious, based on the testimony, all investors \nwere not fully aware of the impact of this, and I think people invested \nin these facilities believing that they were going to have the \nprotection of flow control. Right or wrong, they believed, in some \ncases, that they did. I am sure on the other side there are many people \nwho knew full well that they did not and took the risk. Again, every \ninvestor bondholder, I do not believe, was fully aware of the \nramification.\n  When Carbone invalidated flow control, this whole situation was left \nin limbo. Nothing is happening, no one knows what to do. No one knows \nwhether there will be flow control or no flow control. So here it is \nbefore the Congress.\n  Now, most members on the EPW Committee did not want to have the \nCongress speak to overturning the interstate commerce clause of the \nConstitution.\n  There are dozens of incinerators and landfills in immediate danger if \nflow control is not reauthorized immediately. What we have here is not \nonly a delicately crafted compromise, but an urgency in the sense that \nevery bond based upon flow control authority at this point is \nthreatened.\n  So I think there is an emergency. Senator Chafee asked me to hold \nhearings on this quickly and to try to move this out of committee and \nto the floor, and it has been on the calendar for quite some time. We \nwere looking for an opening to get it here.\n  The purpose, again, looking at the negatives of this which the \nSenator from Arizona pointed out, the purpose, though, is to try to \ngive relief to these people. It is not to permanently interfere with \nthe free market, which is why the 30-year grandfather was placed there.\n  The reason for the 30 year was we did not want to go back and review \nevery single bond, whether it was a 10-year bond, a 5-year bond, 20-\nyear bond, or 25-year bond. There were not any bonds beyond 30 years, \nwhich is why we selected that date. Could we have selected 15 years and \nbeen more in line with what the Senator from Arizona favors? Yes, we \ncould have. Could we have selected the life of the bond as the \nSenator's amendment addresses?\n Yes, we could have.\n\n  The problem is, though, we also added through language in the bill \nthe opportunity to upgrade facilities. And I think that is where we get \ninto a problem with the amendment of the Senator. If, after the \nexpiration of a bond, someone wants to upgrade these facilities--not \nreally expand but upgrade, keep them maintained--then they have no \nprotection under the Kyl amendment. The underlying bill provides a very \nnarrow flow control authority to protect these bonds. It may not be a \nperfect compromise, it certainly is not. But I think it is a fair \ncompromise. It serves notice on everyone.\n  I hope 20 years from now, 25 years from now, Congress will not go \nback and extend this. It is our intent it be ended. Everybody, all 50 \nStates, all the entities in those 50 States, all the haulers and the \nGovernors and the systems, everyone who is involved with flow control \nin any way should be on notice that, effective with the passage of this \nbill, it is over in 30 years and they ought to plan accordingly. That \nis the goal. The Kyl amendment disrupts that slightly and provides more \nuncertainty, although it is well intended. Again, the Kyl amendment \ndoes limit flow control. There is no question about it. It limits it \nfurther than the underlying bill. Philosophically I agree with that \nbut, again, it is the compromise we are concerned about.\n  The amendment would provide grandfathered authority only until the \ntime the bonds are paid off. So if you have a 15-year bond and a \ncontract that extends beyond those 15 years, or the need to upgrade \nyour facility beyond the 15-year length of the bond, then you cannot do \nit under the Kyl amendment. You cannot do it with the protection of the \nflow control legislation.\n  This amendment also does not cover contracts. It will create havoc in \na number of cities and towns that made financial commitments based on \nthe mistaken impression--true, mistaken impression--that they had this \nauthority. I think the phrase ``mistaken impression'' really goes to \nthe heart of why I came down on the side I did on the amendment, on the \nKyl amendment, as well as the underlying bill. There are innocent \npeople here who have been impacted. I could not in good conscience \nallow that to continue without the protection they thought they had \nwhen they entered into this agreement.\n  Maybe it is an interesting conclusion here that it is a compromise, \nand if to you wanted to put it in direct statements, those who love \nflow control do not like the Smith-Chafee bill. Those who oppose flow-\ncontrol do not like the bill. I think that probably means the \ncompromise is about right. It is in the middle.\n  I know there are those who are going to, from a philosophical \nperspective, support the Kyl amendment. My fear, and I think it is a \nlegitimate fear, is that at the time the Kyl amendment is agreed to and \nbecomes part of the underlying bill I think it could possibly, \nconceivably, kill the bill or at least kill the compromise. I think if \nthat happens and the bill gets pulled back from the floor because of \nthe budget legislation which will be coming up next week, the budget \nresolution that will be coming up next week, then I do not know when we \nwould get back to it as we get into the pressures of time with more \nlegislation. Again, those people who need immediate relief will not \nhave it.\n  I might just say in conclusion, we have tried to work with a number \nof States that have had concerns: Florida, Maine, Minnesota--the \nSenator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, and I agreed on an amendment \nyesterday. Senator Lautenberg and I disagreed on another amendment in \nNew Jersey. States do have special considerations and special problems. \nBut, again, the intention here--and I want to make \n[[Page S6485]] this point, because it is important--the intention here \nwas to strike this balance and not to move too far. Not to allow open-\nended flow control authority on the left, if you will, on the one side; \nand at the same time not to allow it to go back so far over to the free \nmarket side on this particular bill that we would lose the balance.\n  I might say for the benefit of the Senator from Arizona, we have \nrejected a number of amendments that would allow for open-ended action. \nIf this community says, ``We would like to think about having flow \ncontrol at some point within the 30-year period, will you exempt us?'' \nThe answer is, ``No, we will not.'' In other words, there had to be \nsome financial commitment, preferably a bond or contract, some amount \nof money had to be committed, usually in the form of a contract or a \nbond. So we were very, very tough on those people who came to us. We \ndid not agree to allow that far-reaching aspect of the bill.\n  Again, it might not be exactly what everybody wanted but it is a \ncompromise and I urge my colleagues, no matter whether you are moving \nfurther to the free market side as I am, or whether you are moving \nfurther toward flow control where Senator Lautenberg and others are, \nwhichever one of those positions you favor, I urge my colleagues to \nstay here in the center, in the compromise, and reject the Kyl \namendment and reject any amendments on the other side that may come up \nto expand flow control authority. So, on the one hand let us not expand \nit. On the other hand, let us not restrict it.\n  I again encourage my colleagues, when the vote does come on this \namendment, to defeat it for the reasons given.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. If no other Senators are seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a few weeks ago on this Senate floor I \ndiscussed the problem of school bus safety. In February of this year a \nyoung girl by the name of Brandie Browder, an eighth grader in Beaver \nCreek, OH, was killed when the drawstring around the waist of her coat \ngot caught in the handrail of her school bus.\n  Just 4 days later, in Cincinnati, a seventh grader suffered a broken \nfoot in a very similar accident.\n  As I pointed out when I spoke previously about this matter, while \nschool buses are certainly among the very safest modes of \ntransportation, the sad fact remains that an average of 30 \nschoolchildren are killed every single year in America either getting \noff or getting back on their own school buses--30 children.\n  Each child, Mr. President, with parents, grandparents, brothers, and \nsisters, and because of that child's death their life will never be the \nsame; 30 children who will never have the opportunity to grow up, 30 \nchildren who will never have the opportunity to live out their \npotential. The sad fact is, Mr. President, that almost without \nexception these are preventable deaths.\n  When I last spoke on this issue, I discussed three specific safety \nissues, three problems that cause these deaths. One was a handrail \nproblem. The second was the problem of the child getting on and off the \nbus and how we can make that area safer so the school bus driver will \nknow what is going on in that area. And finally, I talked about the \npossibility of better training for school bus drivers.\n  Today, I would like to concentrate on the issue of handrails on these \nschool buses because between the time that I last spoke to the Senate \nabout this issue myself and my staff have spent a great deal of time \nlooking at this issue and finding out additional facts. And the sad \nfact is that we lose many children because of this handrail problem.\n  This is a problem, Members of the Senate, that can be corrected very \neasily for less than $20 per school bus. So it is not something that is \ngoing to cost a great deal of money. It is something though that will \nnot be fixed unless parents, teachers, administrators, and members of \nthe public demand that this problem be fixed in each school bus in the \ncountry.\n  As I previously mentioned, an alarming number of these accidents are \noccurring when a strap from a backpack on a child or the drawstring of \na little girl's or little boy's coat gets snagged in the handrail while \nthat child is exiting the bus. We all know I think from our own \nexperience from our own children how many kids today have backpacks or \nhave a poncho or something that has a string that can in fact get \ncaught as that child is getting off the bus.\n  Mr. President, with many of these handrails there is a small space \nbetween the handrail and the wall of the bus where something like the \ndrawstring around the waist of a coat can get snagged. The child is \ngetting off the bus. The child begins to get off that bus but the \nchild's clothing is stuck and is still attached when the bus driver \nmistakenly begins to pull away thinking the child has exited the school \nbus. As I pointed out, a number of children have been killed in this \nexact manner since 1991.\n  Let me give a little background on the analysis of this problem. \nBeginning in early 1993, the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration [NHTSA] initiated a series of investigations to find out \nif the handrails on school buses were actually designed in an unsafe \nmanner. As a result of these investigations, nine distinct models of \nschool buses were recalled because of potentially unsafe handrails. \nHowever, tens of thousands of these unsafe buses were not recalled. \nThey are still on the road. The bus that killed little Brandie was not \nrecalled, not because the bus was safe--just the contrary--but it was \nnot recalled because the company that made the bus had already gone out \nof business.\n  Mr. President, we clearly must track down these buses. We must make \nsure that every single bus in this country is inspected. We have to fix \nthem or get them off the road.\n  Let me again repeat. We are not talking about a very expensive \nrepair. It is not a cost question. It is a question of locating the \nbuses. It is a question of public awareness, which is why I am on the \nfloor today.\n  We as parents need to make sure our children are not getting on an \nunsafe bus this afternoon, tomorrow morning, or ever. We can all look \nfor ourselves. When our child gets on the bus tomorrow morning, or gets \noff the bus this afternoon, look at the handrail to see if that gap \ndoes in fact exist. We must not rest until every one of these buses is \nidentified and fixed.\n  Let me advise my colleagues what we are doing in the State of Ohio \nwith regard to this. I had the opportunity this morning to talk to \nhighway patrol officials who are in charge in the State of Ohio of \nschool bus inspections.\n  As I have indicated, there really is a simple solution to this \nparticular handrail problem. Every year the Ohio State Highway Patrol \nduring the summer months when school is not in session conduct \ninspections of every single school bus in the State of Ohio. I suspect \nthat there are other law enforcement agencies that perform the same \nfunction in all the other States of the Union as well.\n  The Ohio State Highway Patrol, when they begin these inspections in \nthe next several weeks, are going to in addition to what they normally \ndo look for this specific problem. When they find the problem, if they \ndo, they are going to take the bus off the road until the problem is \ncorrected because as I indicated it is a very relatively simple problem \nto solve at a cost of probably no more than $20.\n  They use an inspection device, a tool. If I describe it, I think it \nwill give our listeners and Members of the Senate a good idea how \nsimple it is. It is a tool made with a long string with a nut attached \nto the end. From outside the school bus door, you drop the nut end of \nthe device into the crevice where \n[[Page S6486]] with the lower end of the handrail is attached to the \nlower area of the stepped wall. When you pull the device toward the \noutside of the school bus through the crevice, if the tool gets caught \nthe bus is rejected and then not allowed onto the road until this is \nfixed.\n  As I point out, fixing these buses is relatively easy. For around $20 \nyou can put a safe new handrail on the bus, a whole new handrail, or \nfor even less money than that you can modify the handrail by inserting \na special wood or rubber spacer between the bottom attachment point of \nthe handrail and the bus wall itself. The process is cheap, simple and \nwill save lives.\n  Mr. President, I urge that all States that are not currently \nfollowing this inspection policy and are not looking for this problem \nstart doing this as soon as possible. Ohio certainly does not have a \nmonopoly on these potentially unsafe buses. These unsafe buses can \nprobably and I am sure can be found in any State in the Union.\n  Mr. President, this week just happens to be National Safe Kids Week. \nThere is no better time than the present during this week to focus our \nattention on the real dangers to schoolchildren who travel by \nschoolbus.\n  The goals of National Safe Kids Week are fourfold, but they are quite \nsimple.\n  First, raise awareness of the problem of childhood injuries.\n  Second, build grassroots coalitions to implement prevention \nstrategies.\n  Third, stimulate changes in behavior and products to reduce the \noccurrence of injuries.\n  Fourth, make childhood injuries a public policy priority.\n  Mr. President, these four goals should set our agenda for safety for \nchildren and specifically should set our agenda for school bus safety. \nI will in the weeks ahead again return to the floor to revisit this \nentire issue, but at this time I think it is important that we get \nabout the business of dealing with this handrail problem.\n  In conclusion, I should like to alert my colleagues and other \nconcerned Americans to an important satellite feed about this issue of \nschool bus safety. Later today and tomorrow, the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration will be showing a TV program on this very \nissue. This program will be available by satellite, and I would urge \nthose who are interested in this vital issue to contact NHTSA about the \ndetails.\n  Again, Mr. President, I thank all the concerned parents and the \neducators and others who are contributing to the success of National \nSafe Kids Week. To them I simply say thank you, thank you for caring, \nand, believe me, you are in fact making a difference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator suggest the absence of a \nquorum?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I do suggest at this time the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while I was presiding, the Senator from New \nHampshire made some comments relative to the amendment I had just \nintroduced and spoken on. I regret he is not here, but I would like to \nrespond to those remarks. They were well put, and I appreciate the \ncooperative spirit in which he gently opposed my amendment. I wish to \nrespond to the points he made to illustrate why I still think my \namendment should be adopted.\n  As you will recall, my amendment provides very simply that the \ngrandfathering of monopoly status that these facilities need because \nthe Supreme Court has declared them unconstitutional ought to be \nlimited to the period of time that it takes for these facilities to \nrepay the bonds; that beyond that time there is no rationale, at least \nno rationale that the Senate ought to be a party to, that once the \nbonds are paid off, the investor's money has been returned in full, \nthere is no rationale for protecting the municipality from competition \nin the handling of garbage.\n  That is why my amendment would cut it off at that point and not allow \nthe remaining exceptions, which include expanding the life of the \nplant, or the useful life of the plant to some unknown length of time \nwith a 30-year time limit or for contracts that are in existence.\n  It would limit the grandfathering to that which is necessary or \nrequired but not beyond.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire made the point that \ninvestors believed that they would have the protection of the law and \nwe ought to give it to them, and that is precisely what my amendment \ndoes--no less but no more. It says to those investors, you get your \nmoney back when the bonds are fully paid off; that then but only then \ndoes this exemption from the U.S. Constitution apply. So we give them \nthat grace period. That is point No. 1.\n  Point No. 2. The Senator from New Hampshire said, well, there is a \nprovision in this carefully crafted compromise for upgrades of \nfacilities. And my response to that is, yes, that is there, but it is \nnot needed and certainly not deserved. It creates a giant loophole \nwhich in effect means that all that the owners of these plants have to \ndo is to provide some kind of upgrade to their facility--I presume that \nis anything beyond usual maintenance--and up to a 30-year period they \ncan foreclose all competition.\n  That is un-American, it is unconstitutional, and it is not something \nthat the Senate should be a party to, Mr. President. That is why my \namendment specifically would not permit this special monopoly to exist \nbeyond the time that it takes to repay the bonds. You cannot just fix \nyour facility up and say we have extended its useful life and we want \nto continue to have a monopoly during the useful life of the plant.\n  That would not be a justifiable reason, and I know of no reason which \njustifies that particular exemption. None has been suggested.\n  Third, our colleague from New Hampshire made the point that innocent \npeople were impacted as a result of the Supreme Court decision, and \nthat is true. My guess is that most of the people who invested in these \nbonds had no idea that the Supreme Court would declare the whole \npractice unconstitutional.\n  Agreeing with the principle that those innocent people should be \nprotected, my amendment does precisely that. It protects them. It says \nthat until those bonds are paid off, the monopoly status of the \nfacility is protected. So, in other words, the bonds get paid off, the \ninvestors get made whole, all of those innocent people have their \ninvestment returned, and they lose nothing as a result of my amendment.\n  Mr. President, there are other innocent people involved in this as \nwell. These are the people who are required to pay the higher taxes \nbecause of the unreasonably high prices extracted by virtue of the fact \nthat this is a monopoly. That is why we have antitrust laws. That is \nwhy our Constitution contains a clause that says that States cannot \ninterfere with interstate commerce.\n  But that is what has been done in this case. That is what the Supreme \nCourt outlawed. And the U.S. Senate ought to pay attention not only to \nthe innocent people who invested, who are totally protected under my \namendment, but also the totally innocent people of the State who are \nhaving to pay two, three, four times as much; the EPA estimates 40 \npercent more than they would otherwise have to pay as a result of this \nmonopoly status that is being granted. So if the argument is that we \nshould protect innocent people, then the Senate should adopt my \namendment.\n  Finally, and the real reason why I think there is an objection to my \namendment is that it might unravel a carefully crafted compromise.\n  Mr. President, that is the unprincipled but very pragmatic reason \nfrequently given to opposing amendments in this Chamber and in the \nother body. We have all been a party to those. It is \n[[Page S6487]] necessary to craft legislation that is required to make \ncompromises and no one argues against that practice.\n  But there are certain situations where there are fundamental \nprinciples involved. And where fundamental principles are involved, we \nneed to be very, very careful about justifying opposition to principles \non the basis of compromise. In other words, Mr. President, there are \nsome things that ought not to be compromised. One of them is the United \nStates Constitution.\n  When the Supreme Court says that a practice is unconstitutional, we \nought to be very, very careful how we override that decision. We ought \nto do it in the narrowest possible way. That is what my amendment does. \nIt says, until the bonds are repaid, we will grant these municipalities \na monopoly power that nobody else can get, that the United States \nSupreme Court says is unconstitutional but, recognizing that investment \ndecisions were made based upon the previous existing law, we will \nacknowledge that that exemption should last at least until the bonds \nare paid off. But my amendment says, at that point, no further. We do \nnot need to go any further. No one else needs protection here.\n  All we are doing at that point is creating a monopoly protection \nwhich creates higher prices and prevents the free market from \noperating. Now it may be true that standing on that principle will \ncause a bill to unravel; that if my amendment were to pass, there is \ninsufficient support then for the legislation to get it passed. My \nresponse to that is that we do much better politically in this body \nwhen we do what is right and that, if we will stick to principles, in \nthe end we will get the kind of legislation that is necessary; that we \nmake mistakes when we compromise principle for the sake of getting \nsomething through rather than for the sake of doing what is right.\n  This is a constitutional issue. I would perhaps suggest an analogy \nhere.\n  Mr. President, what if a municipality had passed an ordinance \ndeclaring that certain speech could no longer be engaged in in the \ncommunity, and everyone rose up in arms and said, ``Why that is \nunconstitutional''? A lawsuit was brought and the Supreme Court says, \n``That is correct. You cannot impede free speech. Municipality, your \nactions are unconstitutional.'' And the municipality said, ``But we \nhave a real need to impede free speech in this particular area.''\n  Do you not think that the U.S. Senate would be very, very careful \nabout granting an exemption from the Constitution, in effect, here; \nwould be very, very careful? Obviously, we could not constitutionally \ndo that, but we would want to be as limited as possible in crafting \nlegislation that would meet the constitutional standards the Court laid \ndown.\n  That is what we should be doing in this case, because the Court has \nalready spoken. The Court has said that States that have this flow \ncontrol do so in violation of the U.S. Constitution.\n  So, in trying to figure out a way around that, we ought to be as \ncareful and as limited as possible, not as expansive as we can think \nof. And that is why my amendment, I submit, is the only constitutional, \ncommonsense course of action that the Senate can take to protect those \nsituations where there has been an investment made until the investment \nis paid off. But, after that, no more monopoly.\n  And if that should cause the compromise to break apart, then it would \nbe necessary, as the Senator from New Hampshire said, to go back to the \ndrawing board and redo it. And I think that would be a good thing. But \nmy hope would be, Mr. President, that it would not cause the compromise \nto fall apart; that we would all recognize that a limited exemption is \nall right to pass, we should pass it, but that we should not do more \nthan that simply because some Senators might want to, in effect, \noverreach beyond what is really necessary or appropriate given the \nSupreme Court's decision.\n  So with all due respect to my friend and colleague from New \nHampshire, who really helped to make the argument in principle to what \nI am saying but found it necessary to object nonetheless because of the \nposition he finds himself in, I suggest the best way to a deal with \nthis issue is to adopt my amendment, provide full protection for all \nthose who need protection, but to limit the exemption to that point.\n  Mr. President, we are going to be voting on the Kyl amendment at 2:30 \nand, unless our colleagues, who have not been here on the floor, are \nwatching from wherever they may be, it is going to be very confusing \nwhat this is all about, because this was not part of the committee \naction. I just urge my colleagues to consider this, to ask questions \nabout this, come to the floor to engage me in a colloquy if that is \ntheir desire. I would be happy to answer any questions I can.\n  No one--no one--has made the case why we should extend to the useful \nlife of a project a special exemption after the bonds have already been \npaid off; how it is that an operator cannot simply add something to the \nplant and say they have extended the useful life, thereby going to the \nfull 30-year limit of this legislation. No one has made the case of why \nthat should be the law. And until that case is made, if it can be made, \nwe should not accept that proposition in dealing with something as \nsacred as a constitutional principle here.\n  Mr. President, I will ask my colleagues, again, to support the Kyl \namendment when we vote on it at 2:30.\n  At this time, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum having been suggested, \nthe clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, yesterday I came to the floor to begin a \ndiscussion about the crime bill that within the next several days I \nwill be introducing. I would like today to continue to talk about other \nprovisions of that crime bill.\n  As I indicated yesterday, I believe that there are really two truly \nfundamental issues that we always need to address when we are looking \nat the validity or the merits of any particular crime bill. First, what \nis the proper role of the Federal Government in fighting crime in this \ncountry? Second, despite all the rhetoric, what really works in law \nenforcement; what matters and what does not matter?\n  It has been my experience, Mr. President, as someone who does not \npretend to be an expert in this area but someone who has spent the \nbetter part of 20 years in different capacities dealing with this, \nbeginning in the early 1970's as a county prosecuting attorney, it has \nbeen my experience that many times the rhetoric does not square very \nclosely with the reality, and that really, if we are serious about \ndealing with crime, the people that we ought to talk to are the men and \nwomen who are on the front lines every single day--the police officers, \nthe tens of thousands of police officers around this country who really \nare the experts and who know what works and what does not work.\n  The bill that I will introduce is based upon my own experience, but \nit is also based on hundreds and hundreds of discussions that I have \nhad over the years with the people who, literally, are on the front \nline.\n  Yesterday, I discussed these issues with specific reference to crime-\nfighting technology. The conclusion I have reached is that we have an \noutstanding technology base in this country that will do a great deal \nto catch criminals. Technology does, in fact, matter, and it clearly \nmatters in the area of law enforcement. But we need the Federal \nGovernment to be more proactive in this area, more proactive in helping \nthe States get on line with their own technology.\n  Having a terrific national criminal record system or a huge DNA data \nbase for convicted sex offenders in Washington, DC, is great, but it \nwill not really do much good if the police officer in Lucas County, OH, \nor Greene County or Clark County or Hamilton County cannot tap into it. \nIt will not do any good if we cannot get the information, the primary \nsource of this information, from them and get it into the system.\n  Crimes occur locally. Ninety-five percent of all criminal \nprosecution, of all \n[[Page S6488]] criminal investigations, occurs locally, not at the \nnational level. Crime occurs locally, so we have to make sure that the \ncrime-fighting resources, like this high-technology data base that I \ntalked about yesterday, are available to local law enforcement.\n  Mr. President, today I would like to continue this discussion, and I \nwould like to discuss another component of my crime legislation: How do \nwe go about protecting America from armed career criminals? I am \ntalking about repeat violent criminals who use a gun in the commission \nof a felony. In this area, too, we need to be asking what works, what \ndoes not work, and what level of Federal Government is most appropriate \nto do what, what level of Federal Government is most appropriate to get \ncertain help from.\n  Again, experience tells us that we really do know what matters, we \nreally do know what works. In the area of gun crimes, we have a pretty \ngood answer.\n  We all know that there is a great deal of controversy about guns, \ncontroversy over whether general restrictions on gun ownership would \nhelp reduce crime. But, Mr. President, there is no controversy over \nwhether taking guns away from convicted felons will reduce crime. Let \nme guarantee you, if we know one thing, it is this: If we take guns out \nof the hands of convicted felons, we will reduce crime and we will have \nfewer victims.\n  There is legitimate disagreement over bills such as the Brady bill, \nwhether that will reduce crime. Similarly, reasonable people can \ndisagree concerning the question of whether a ban on assault weapons \nwill reduce crime. I happen to support both of these measures, but I \nrecognize that many people do not and many people think that they are \nnot effective.\n  But what I am talking about today is something on which there is \nabsolutely no controversy, absolutely no dispute. There simply is no \nquestion that taking the guns away from armed career criminals will, in \nfact, reduce crime, and history shows that that works.\n  When it comes to armed career criminals, we need to disarm them, we \nneed to lock them up, we need to get them out of society. Let us disarm \nthe people who are hurting our victims, who are hurting the citizens of \nthis country. As I said, history indicates that this works. We have a \nhistoric track record to point to. We actually have tried this and it \ndoes, in fact, work.\n  One of the most successful crime-fighting initiatives of recent years \nin this country was a project that was known as Project Triggerlock. \nThis project was very successful, wildly successful, precisely because \nit addressed a problem squarely and it placed the resources where they \nwere most needed.\n  Let me tell the Members of the Senate a little bit about the history \nof this Project Triggerlock.\n  The U.S. Justice Department began Project Triggerlock in May of 1991. \nThe program targeted for prosecution in Federal court armed and violent \nrepeat offenders. Under Triggerlock, U.S. attorneys throughout the \ncountry turned to the local prosecuting attorneys in whatever \njurisdiction they were located and said: ``If you catch a felon with a \ngun, if you want us to, we, under existing Federal statute, we the \nFederal prosecutors, we the U.S. attorneys will take over that \nprosecution for you. We will prosecute that individual, we will convict \nthat individual, and we will hit that individual with a stiff Federal \nmandatory sentence, and we will lock this individual up in a Federal \nprison at no cost to the local community, to the State.''\n  That is true Federal assistance. That is Federal assistance that \nmatters. That is Federal assistance that makes a difference. That is \nFederal assistance and Federal action that will save lives by taking \nthese career criminals off our streets.\n  Mr. President, that is what Project Triggerlock did. Triggerlock was \nan assault on the very worst criminals, the worst of the worst in \nAmerican society. And it worked. This program took 15,000--15,000--\ncareer criminals off the streets in just an 18-month period of time. \nIncredibly--at least incredibly to me as a former prosecutor--the \nClinton Justice Department abandoned Project Triggerlock. It was the \nmost effective Federal program in recent history for targeting and \nremoving armed career criminals from our society. But for some reason--\nfor some reason--the Justice Department stopped Triggerlock dead in its \ntracks.\n  What I propose in my crime legislation is that we resurrect Project \nTriggerlock, and we can do it. My legislation includes a provision \nrequiring the U.S. attorneys in every jurisdiction in this country to \nmake a monthly report to the Attorney General in Washington on the \nnumber of arrests, the number of prosecutions and convictions they have \ngotten within that last 30-day period of time on gun-related offenses. \nThe Attorney General then would report semiannually to the U.S. \nCongress on the success of this program and report on the number of \nthese individuals who have been convicted.\n  Like all prosecutors, U.S. attorneys have limited resources. In fact, \nwith U.S. attorneys, they have more discretion because of the fact that \nmany times we have concurrent jurisdiction between the local \nprosecutors under State law and Federal prosecutors under Federal law. \nSo the Federal prosecutors have a great deal of discretion about what \ntype cases to pursue. It really is a question of what the priorities \nare. It is a question of prioritization.\n  Like all prosecutors, U.S. attorneys do have to exercise discretion \nabout whom to prosecute. We all recognize that Congress cannot dictate \nto U.S. attorneys, cannot dictate to the Attorney General who should be \nprosecuted. But it is clear that we should go on record with the \nfollowing basic proposition, and that is this: There is nothing more \nimportant than getting armed career criminals off the streets. There is \nnothing more important that the Justice Department can do than to set \nthis as a priority.\n  Mr. President, I think Project Triggerlock was a very important way \nto keep the focus on the prosecution of gun crimes. Getting criminals \noff the streets, criminals who use guns, is a major national priority \nand we all should behave accordingly.\n  Let me turn now to a second portion of this bill that deals with the \nproblem of criminals using guns in the commission of a felony. The \nsecond thing we need to do is to change the law. We need to toughen the \nlaw against those who use a gun to commit a crime. My bill would say to \ncareer criminals: If you are a convicted felon and you possess a gun, \nyou will get a mandatory sentence. Under current law, a first-time \nfelon gets a 5-year mandatory sentence. A third-time felon gets a \nmandatory minimum of 15 years. But there is a gap in current law. There \nis no mandatory minimum for a second-time felon.\n  My legislation, Mr. President, would fix that. It would provide a \nmandatory minimum of 10 years for a second-time felon with a gun. That \nwould make it a lot easier for police to get that gun criminal off of \nour streets.\n  Third, bail reform. The third thing we need to do is to reform the \nbail system. Under current law, the Bail Reform Act, certain dangerous, \naccused criminals can be denied bail if they have been charged with \ncrimes of violence. But it is unclear under current law whether \npossession of firearms should be considered a crime of violence or not.\n  Mr. President, let us do a reality check here today. If someone who \nis a known convicted felon is walking around with a gun in your \ncommunity in Michigan, or in my community in Ohio, what is the \nlikelihood that that person is carrying the gun for law-abiding \npurposes? Convicted felon with a gun. I think it is perfectly \nreasonable to consider that person prima facie dangerous. We should \ndeny bail to keep that convicted felon off the streets while awaiting \ntrial on the new charge.\n  My legislation would eliminate the ambiguity in current law. My bill \nwould define a crime of violence to specifically include possession of \na firearm by a convicted felon. If you are a convicted felon and you \nare walking around with a gun, you are dangerous and you need to be \nkept off the streets. We need to give the prosecutors the legal right \nto protect the community from these people while they are awaiting \ntrial.\n  Mr. President, a fourth way we can crack down on gun crimes is to go \nafter \n[[Page S6489]] those who knowingly provide--knowingly provide--guns to \nfelons. Under current law, you can be prosecuted by providing a gun \nonly if you knew for certain that it would be used in a crime. The \nrevision I propose would make it illegal to provide a firearm if you \nhave reasonable cause to believe that it is going to be used in the \ncommission of a crime. This is the best way, I believe, to go after the \nillegal gun trade, those who provide guns to those people who are \npredators in our society. We will no longer, under this provision, \nallow these gun providers to feign ignorance. They are helping felons \nand they need to be stopped.\n  Mr. President, all of these proposals are motivated by a single \npurpose. I, along with the police officers of this country, believe \nthat we have to get the guns away from the gun criminals. Project \nTriggerlock was one major initiative that we can pursue at the Federal \nlevel to help make this happen. Imposing stiff mandatory minimums, \ncracking down on illegal gun providers, are also good, important \nmeasures.\n  All of the gun proposals contained in my crime legislation, Mr. \nPresident, really have the same goal. They are designed to assure \nAmerican families who are living in crime-threatened communities that \nwe are going to do what it takes to get guns off of their streets. We \nare going to go after the armed career criminals. We are going to \nprosecute them, convict them, and we are going to keep them off of our \nstreets. That is why we have a Government in the first place, to \nprotect the innocent, to keep ordinary citizens safe from violent, \npredatory crimes.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Government needs to do a much better \njob with this fundamental task. That is why targeting the armed career \ncriminals is such a major component of the crime bill that I will be \nintroducing.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow I intend to talk briefly about a third major \ncomponent of my bill, and that is how we help the victims of crime, \nthose who are victimized by the criminals, those who we, many times, \nforget.\n  It has been my experience that, unfortunately, many times society \ntreats the criminals as if they are victims and the victims as if they \nare criminals. Provisions in the bill that I will be discussing \ntomorrow deal with that. We will reach out to the victims of crime to \nhelp them and to make the playing field more level.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I will yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/11/senate-section/article/S6487-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6489-S6494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 789\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 38, line 18, strike the phrase ``the Administrator \n     has determined''.\n       On page 39, after line 8 insert the following: ``For \n     purposes of developing the list required in this Section, the \n     Administrator shall be responsible for collating and \n     publishing only that information provided to the \n     Administrator by States pursuant to this Section.

Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The amendment (No. 789) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, in his capacity as a Senator from \nArizona, moves to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 769\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to address the pending \namendment which is, indeed, the Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would just like to say a few words about \nthe amendment presented by the distinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  In our Environment and Public Works Committee, there are 16 members: \n9 Republicans and 7 Democrats. The bill that is before the Senate today \nthat the Senator from Arizona seeks to amend was approved in the \ncommittee by a vote of 16 to 0. Every Democrat and every Republican \nvoted for it.\n  Now, this bill before the Senate represents a delicate balance. There \nare two sides to this issue. On one side is the following: The State \nand local governments say, why should we not be allowed to designate \nthat all municipal solid waste, all solid waste within this entity, be \nit the city of Detroit or be it some small town in Michigan or town or \ncity in Rhode Island, whether it is in the Nation--why should we not be \nable to designate that all of the municipal waste within that community \ngo to a facility that we designate--we, the town fathers; and in that \nfashion, we, the town fathers and the community, will be able to afford \na proper disposal facility, be it an incinerator or be it a licensed \nproper landfill?\n  If our citizens do not like this arrangement, if they think they can \nhave their solid waste hauled away by some private entrepreneur in a \ndifferent fashion, then they can vote Members out of office and we will \nbe gone and the citizens can have a separate system, if that is what \nthey want. At least we ought to have that power.\n  Now, on the other side of the equation is the view espoused by \nSenator Kyl, which is that flow control is anticompetitive and is \nagainst the U.S. Constitution, in addition to all that. The \nConstitution has said that flow control is against the commerce clause \nand it should not be permitted.\n  However, the Senator in his amendment recognizes that there are some \nfacilities that have been built pursuant to the belief that flow \ncontrol will be there in perpetuity and, therefore, he has arranged \nunder his amendment that those investments made by those communities \ncan be paid off. In other words, his amendment is tailored to the life \nof the outstanding bonds.\n  Once they are paid off, then that ends it regarding flow control \nexisting in that community. In other words, he has kept the flow \ncontrol limited to a minimal period to provide for the payment of the \nbonds. Now, he has put a lot of thought into that argument, and as I \nsay, an argument can be made for it, as indeed he has made.\n  In crafting this view, we balanced these two views. The ones who say \non \n[[Page S6490]] one side, we do not want to have anything that inhibits \ncompetition; and on the other side those who say, why should we, in our \ncommunities, not be able to do what we want to do? If it is wrong we \nwill be voted out of office. Leave that to the citizens. Do not have \nBig Brother in Washington, DC, saying how to do things.\n  We had those views vigorously brought to our attention both in the \ncommittee and on the floor of the Senate and in our conversations with \nother Senators.\n  What did we say? We set limits. We said, ``We are going to give \nbroader flow control possibilities than that suggested by the Senator \nfrom Arizona in his amendment.'' However, we are going to set an \noutside limit. This is going to end at a certain time under our bill. \nIt ends at 30 years. That does it. But we did not want to cut it off \nimmediately, for the same reasons the Senator from Arizona has \nsuggested. We go a little beyond him because there are communities here \nthat are tied up in contracts that are different from just paying off \nthe bonds. They have different situations.\n  Indeed, they feel very strongly about the arrangements they have made \nwithin their communities, within some States. They do not want this \nlimitation. If we are going to have this legislation passed, then it \nseems to me we have to recognize the views on both sides to a greater \nextent than is recognized by the Senator from Arizona in his amendment.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, when the proper time comes I will move to \ntable the amendment of the Senator from Arizona--not that I think it is \ntotally out of line. I can see the rationale that is behind his \namendment.\n  The truth of the matter is it will upset this delicate arrangement \nthat we have put together here over the past several weeks. I might say \nthis was not just created by the imagination of this Senator or that \nSenator. It came as a result of hearings we had in connection with flow \ncontrol and trying to craft a bill that is very, very difficult.\n  Indeed, what has been going on today and yesterday? We were on this \nbill starting at 12 o'clock yesterday, going up until something like \n6:30. Today we have been on it since 9:30, with very little action on \nthe floor.\n  Why? Because we are trying to compromise and recognize and deal with \nthese various forces that are tugging in exactly opposite directions \nhere. That is difficult to reconcile.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I would hope that our colleagues would \nsupport the efforts of the committee in trying to meet this very, very, \ndifficult compromise.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Rhode Island \nwould engage in a colloquy with me regarding this legislation?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate his characterization of my \nremarks. They are precisely as he described them. I appreciate the \ndifficult dilemma that a chairman always has in trying to get \nlegislation which is not uniformly agreed to and, therefore, requires \nsome compromise.\n  Having conceded that much, first I want to make a very quick point, \nbecause there is some misinformation, I think, being conveyed, and that \nis that our amendment does not permit refinancing.\n  This is not something that the Senator from Rhode Island addressed \nbut was addressed earlier. Under our amendment, I make it clear, that \nrefinancing is committed so you are not bound by the original \nfinancing. Entities can refinance, and however long it takes for either \nthe original bond issue or the refinanced bond issue to be repaid, that \nwould be the length of time that this exemption under my amendment \nwould pertain.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. In your bill--in other words, you refinance and you could \nextend beyond the period of the original bond?\n  Mr. KYL. I believe that is correct, yes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It was my understanding that refinancing was permitted \nbut it could not extend beyond the date of the original financing. I \nmay be wrong there.\n  Mr. KYL. I am sorry, yes. The Senator from Rhode Island is correct. \nIn subsection (B):\n\n       (A) shall not be construed to preclude refinancing of the \n     capital costs of a facility, but if, under the terms of a \n     refinancing, completion of the scheduled for payment of \n     capital costs will occur after the date on which completion \n     would have occurred. * * *\n\n  Then the authority expires at the earlier of those two dates. The \nSenator is correct. With respect to the issue generally that a \ncommunity should have the right to grant a monopoly, and that the \nremedy is to vote them out of office--the argument posited against \nthis--I ask my colleague this question:\n  It is true that if a municipality, a county government or whatever, \ncreates this monopoly they could be voted out of office. But is it not \ntrue that the U.S. Congress, by this legislation, will have created the \nsituation where despite these people being voted out of office, the \ncontract, under the bill as written--the contract term, or as long as \nit takes to refinance, or even the point at which the useful life \nceases to exist, after it has been extended, up to 30 years--would \nstill allow the monopoly to continue? So the candidates themselves may \nbe defeated but that which they constructed, because we protected it, \nwould continue to exist?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. I think that makes my point. We ought to be very, very \ncareful when we are seeking ways to get around the U.S. Supreme Court \ndecision interpreting the Constitution; that we should do so in the \nnarrowest way possible. I think what we have done here is, in order to \naccommodate the special desires of different Senators from different \nStates to go beyond just the repayment obligations but to actually \ncontinue to act as a monopoly so they will have a competitive advantage \nover others who might wish to provide the same kind of service, that in \nconstructing the compromise we have, I think, gone too far and acted \nbeyond the principle which justifies the more limited grandfathering, \nif you will, more limited exemption which I provided for in my \namendment.\n  That is why, while I certainly recognize the difficulties the \nchairman has in cobbling together a compromise in something of this \nnature, I suggest colleagues may wish to support my amendment. I hope \nthey would support my amendment. If that means we then have to go back \nand do some more working of the bill, then at least it might be done \nfrom a better basis.\n  I might ask the Senator from Rhode Island another question here. I \ncan understand, under a very limited circumstance, why we might want to \nrecognize a contract term which extends beyond the term for refinancing \nor financing bonds. There are basically three reasons why the monopoly \nis being granted here. One, to allow the refinancing to occur--both of \nus have agreed on that. Two, in order to extend the exemption to the \npoint that contracts are outstanding. And, three, to extend it when \nsomething has been done to the plant to extend its useful life. I can \nunderstand a limited rationale in the second situation and we both \nprovided for the first.\n  What I cannot understand is a rationale for the third aspect of the \nexemption whereby, simply because it makes economic sense to do so, or \nthe jurisdiction in question decides to do something to the plant to \nextend its useful life, that fact ought to occasion us to grant an \nadditional exemption.\n  At that point there is no longer contract obligation that might be \nmore difficult to fulfill. There is no more investor interest out \nthere. This is simply, perhaps, a very rational decision to extend the \nlife of the plant, but not one which creates in my mind any rationale \nfor extending the grant of authority here.\n  Would the Senator from Rhode Island care to respond to that?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is a good question. But the answer is--and we have \nhad this raised, obviously, not only on the floor here but in calls \nfrom Governors that come to us. The original plea of the Governors is, \n``Why can't we do what we want to do? Who are you in Washington, always \ntelling us, yes/no?''\n  As the Senator has pointed out, it is the Supreme Court that said no. \nIt is not us who said ``no.'' Indeed, what we \n[[Page S6491]] are doing is in effect coming to the rescue, if you \nwould, of those communities that want to extend flow control or have \nflow control because, as the Senator knows, it was declared \nunconstitutional. So we are stepping in, trying to fill a void, fill a \nproblem that exists.\n  But you say, OK, if you step in just step in for this limited period \nwhich is, as you say, the length of the bonds that are outstanding or \nwhat the contract requires between the facility and the community--\nwhatever it might be. But the answer is that in many of these States \nand communities they set up arrangements based on flow control \ncontinuing to exist. In other words, they pass statutes that flow \ncontrol be there. So we have some occasions where the length of time of \nthe contract is not necessarily going to cover all the expenses and is \ngoing to be renegotiated for a variety of reasons, but all with the \nanticipation that the flow control statute that the municipality had \nentered into was going to continue to be there.\n  So they say, ``We made arrangements.'' The arrangements might be the \noriginal bonds, for example, and did not cover the total construction \ncost of the facility. Or that they were dependent upon flow control to \nprovide the flow of waste and the tipping fees for the rather high \nmaintenance costs. They had it all worked out and they say, ``Why can't \nwe continue to do that?''\n  That is the rationale that we have, when we have State A, or B, or C, \nor Governor A, B, or C, calling us and saying this is what we want. So \nwe have tried to juggle it around, leaving not everybody happy, as is \napparent today.\n  Mr. KYL. If I could respond, I appreciate that fact. And I suspected \nthat basically was the rationale for it. But it does seem to me that \njust because the operators of the plant want a monopoly does not \nnecessarily mean that is good public policy or that we ought to go \nalong with it. By definition, if at the time bonds have been paid off--\nsince I doubt seriously these plants are constructed by anything other \nthan bond issues--but once the bonds have been paid off, they have been \nbuilt. They may continue to have high operating costs. But at that \npoint it is the citizens of the State and the community whose interests \nwe ought to have in mind, which is the rationale behind the interstate \ncommerce clause in the first place, that a State should not grant a \nmonopoly to either a private business or a State enterprise to extract \nmore money from the taxpayers of the community than is necessary.\n  And if a private investor or some other competitor can build a plant, \ncan come up with the capital to do so and compete favorably with an \ninstitution that has already been totally financed by public funds and \nhad that financing repaid, then at that point public policy would \nsuggest that the people are more benefited by the lower prices and the \ncompetition because, by definition, they are the ones who are getting \nthe contract rather than the older, outmoded or very expensive facility \nthat we have been protecting in the meantime.\n  So I guess I can recognize that the owners or operators of the plants \nmay wish to stay in business without competition. I still am not clear \nas to why that should occasion us to grant an exemption from an \notherwise constitutional prohibition here.\n  As I say, I can understand the rationale as to the first point as to \nthe bonds, and to some extent on the contracts, but on this third area \nhere--and what I am searching for here is a possible accommodation with \nthe chairman and others who would be involved in this--I just really \nfail to see the rationale for the third. Perhaps that is something we \ncould explore an agreement on.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I think the Senator made a rather telling point. He \npointed out that if they enter into these contracts and the town \nfathers say, ``Look, if you do not like it you can vote us out of \noffice,'' you say, ``What good does it do to vote you out of office, \nyou have locked us in for 20 years? It is little satisfaction for us \nthat you are gone but we are stuck with the contract.''\n  But I would like to say this. Here we are in a situation where if \nthis Senate does nothing or this Congress does nothing, there will be \nno flow control at all.\n  Yet we have publicly elected servants, Governors, Senators, coming to \nus and say, ``Extend this in perpetuity.'' That is what many of them \nwant. These are people who are saying this before it is a done deal. In \nother words, the public knows their position, should know it, and many \nGovernors--it has been no secret--do not say, ``Don't tell anybody, I \nam urging you to do this.''\n  So there are a lot of factors involved. But pursuant to the wishes \nand the views of the Senator from Arizona, and our own views likewise, \nwe have set a sunset. We said this is all over with. We do not care \nwhat your arguments are. At the end of 30 years, there is not going to \nbe any more flow control. You did give us arguments about bonds, this, \nthat, but that is it. You may say 30 years is a long time. It is not \njust some people on the floor of the Senate who are after us to change \nthat.\n  Mr. KYL. Unlike Strom Thurmond, we are going to be gone by the end of \n30 years. But I see the point.\n  If the Senator will just yield for one final comment, I appreciate \nthe arguments the Senator has made. I think what I am suggesting is \nsomething that is correct on principle. I would not want it to impede \ngood legislation. I tried to suggest a couple of areas of possible ways \nof dealing with the issue and would be happy to continue to pursue \nthose areas should anyone be interested.\n  On my behalf, I am not doing this for anybody in my State, because we \ndo not have this. But I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and \nenable us perhaps with a little stronger leverage to go back and \nconstruct something that would make a little more sense.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I find this a rather distressing \nmoment because the amendment that is proposed, frankly, will do much to \nundo a lot of hard work that was done in a consensus fashion in trying \nto arrive at a way to accommodate the need for States to dispose of \ntheir trash in a sensible way. When you say ``trash, garbage,'' et \ncetera, immediately it sounds like the subject is on the trivial side \nof things. It is hardly that because there are a few States that do not \nhave a problem. As a matter of fact, this country of ours, and this \nworld of ours is filled with problems created by the excess creation of \ntrash by its citizens.\n  It is a serious problem when you come from a State like mine, the \nmost crowded State in the country. We still value the quality of life \nthat we can develop. We like our hills. Some call them mountains. It \ndepends on whether you have seen mountains or not. But they are our \nhills and they are our forests, they are our woodlands, and our \nstreams. And we try to make as good use of those as we can. We want for \nour children nothing different than those who live in Montana or \nWyoming or in the other places, the wide open places. As a matter of \nfact, population growth in this country is much more toward the crowded \nareas because young people like to be where other young people are, and \nas a consequence there has to be a national cooperation on efforts like \nthis to help us deal sensibly with the problem.\n  Now, this bill is carefully crafted--the bill itself; I am not \ntalking about the amendment of the Senator from Arizona--to give States \nthe power to restrict in some form or fashion the amount of trash that \ncomes to their States from other States. This is not a simple \ncalculation because within States there is often enormous disputes \nbetween those who govern the local community--mayors, councils--those \nsometimes who are responsible for county government and State \ngovernment because the mayor in a town may very well be able to find a \nway to get rid of their trash from the community by shipping it to the \nnearest, cheapest out-of-State facility.\n  To give you an example, in my own State we have created some waste \ndisposal facilities, and in order to build \n[[Page S6492]] those facilities we had to go out and arrange for \nfinancing, indebtedness, and that indebtedness, like any other \nbusiness, was calculated on a particular revenue or financial stream \nthat was going to permit them to pay their bills and also to pay off \ntheir indebtedness.\n  So lots of communities across this country developed something called \na flow control program that says a State may regulate where the trash \nis going to go, not simply permit a mayor, even though it looks on its \nsurface to be in the best interests of the residents of the community, \nto simply say OK, tipping fees, which are the fees associated with the \ndisposal of garbage, to send it to State X nearby are one-third or 40 \npercent of what it might cost to send it to a nearby waste processing \nfacility. That can be true on a particular day at a particular moment.\n  However, Mr. President, what happens if suddenly the opportunity to \nship to State X, Y, or Z is terminated by laws that are pending in this \nbody that say look, we are not going to take your garbage. We are not \ngoing to permit our communities to take it even though it is a revenue-\nproducing source, even though it is clean, even though it has met all \nof the standards under RCRA for being a sanitary landfill where there \nis no possibility of leaching into the water supply, there is no danger \nto the community, even though we know it is great politics to keep the \ngarbage out of the contract State. The fact is we have a contract and \nthe Supreme Court says you cannot interfere with interstate commerce--\nunless, of course, laws are drawn to permit obstructing it in an \ningenious way so that it gets around the constitutional question.\n  Well, what happens is those of us who live in exporting States are \nvery nervous about the future, of what happens if suddenly the export \npossibility is cut off. And I repeat, though I have said it on this \nfloor several times, the New Jersey story. When we were an importing \nState for garbage--Philadelphia used to ship its trash to my State--we \ntried through the courts to stop it. We went as far as the Supreme \nCourt, and the Supreme Court said no, you cannot stop it. Well, we \nlearned something. We were a net importer, and now as fate would have \nit we are an exporter. And in order to protect the solvency of our \nState, it was determined that my State would have a flow control \nstructure, and they tried to direct the trash to the facilities that \ncan accommodate it not just now, not just next year but in much of the \nnext century as well.\n  That is the thought that went into this bill. Do not cut us off at \nthe border and at the same time not permit us to control the flow \nwithin our States. My State of New Jersey wants to be independent. We \ndo not want to depend on anybody else, to be gracious and fair and all \nthat kind of stuff. We know that we have to take care of ourselves, so \nas a consequence we wrote the law to permit us to do that.\n  Well, now, after all of the deliberations that have gone on--and the \ndistinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee \nfrom Rhode Island is in the Chamber. He worked very hard to get a \nconsensus. He supports the flow control notion because he knows how \nimportant it is to the States that are concerned. Forty States in this \ncountry of ours have flow control authority, and they will be adversely \naffected by this amendment.\n  The amendment makes it difficult to expand landfills. For example, \nthere are many landfills that need to be improved. If a 10-year bond \nwas taken out for the original landfill 8 years ago, then that landfill \noperator will have little incentive to make improvements because he \ndoes not know how much waste will be coming in after 20 years. How good \nbusiness is going to be he does not know because we are liable to cut \noff the opportunity for him to continue financing.\n  So we have an amendment now which I frankly believe would be very \ndisruptive, and I want all the Senators from all the States that have \nflow control authority to pay attention because they could be losing a \nvaluable asset, the sensible management of their trash problems.\n  We are going to have a vote on this amendment, I understand, at 2:30, \nand I would caution those offices where there is any interest at all in \nwhat happens with flow control to make sure that those Senators are \nalerted to the problems that might be created for them.\n  This amendment, by the way, is opposed by the National Association of \nCounties. They know what the problems are. It would be difficult to \nfinance equipment, to finance new facilities because the amendment \nlimits very specifically the financing of facilities to those that are \npresently in operation; would limit them to 30 years of life even if 25 \nhave gone by. That means only 5 more. And the State may not have any \nother solution to its problems.\n  So I hope our colleagues will listen very carefully to what is being \ndiscussed, to note that the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, that the chairman of the Subcommittee on Superfund, \nunder whose jurisdiction this is, will be opposing this amendment and \nthat others will take leave from them.\n  With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague, the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will submit an amendment to the \npending bill. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 867\n\n  (Purpose: To provide flow control authority to certain solid waste \n                               districts)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for himself and \n     Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 867.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 64, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(f) State Solid Waste District Authority.--A solid waste \n     district of a State may exercise flow control authority for \n     municipal solid waste and for recyclable material voluntarily \n     relinquished by the owner or generator of the material that \n     is generated within its jurisdiction if--\n       ``(1) the solid waste district is currently required to \n     initiate a recyclable materials recycling program in order to \n     meet a municipal solid waste reduction goal of at least 30 \n     percent by the year 2000, and uses revenues generated by the \n     exercise of flow control authority strictly to implement \n     programs to manage municipal solid waste, other than \n     development of incineration; and\n       ``(2) prior to May 15, 1994, the solid waste district--\n       ``(A) was responsible under State law for the management \n     and regulation of the storage, collection, processing, and \n     disposal of solid wastes within its jurisdiction;\n       ``(B) was authorized by State statute (enacted prior to \n     January 1, 1990) to exercise flow control authority, and \n     subsequently adopted the authority through a law, ordinance, \n     regulation, contract, franchise, or other legally binding \n     provision; and\n       ``(C) was required by State statute (enacted prior to \n     January 1, 1992) to develop and implement a solid waste \n     management plan consistent with the State solid waste \n     management plan, and the district solid waste management plan \n     was approved by the appropriate State agency prior to \n     September 15, 1994.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be listed as \na cosponsor with the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, hopefully we will be able to reconcile \nour differences that we have right now with respect to the pending \nbill.\n  Vermont, I think, is a pioneer in this area. Some years ago, it set \nup a methodology of trying to reach what we believed were national \ngoals as well as our own State's goals, and that was to try and develop \nrecycling to reduce the amount of solid waste that enters into our \nwaste system. Thus, we organized districts throughout the State. And \nalso to try to enhance the ability to recycle, we have allowed some \ntipping fees to be exacted in order to take care \n[[Page S6493]] of the costs that are involved with recycling.\n  If my memory serves me right, when I was on the committee that is \nhandling this legislation, we had set or were going to set national \ngoals that we ought to try to reach a 30-percent goal of recycling. \nVermont right now is over 25 percent and moving toward 30 percent.\n  What would happen, if this bill passes and if the existing Supreme \nCourt decision is not changed, is that Vermont will have to move away \nfrom what is a very desirable situation, and that is to be able to \nreduce our flow of trash by over 25 percent.\n  Mr. President, in 1987 the State of Vermont passed a solid waste \nmanagement act which allowed small rural towns and cities to band \ntogether to solve their solid waste problems. Building a landfill which \ncomplies with EPA standards under the Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act is not cheap. Recognizing that landfills out of compliance \nwould be shutting down, and facing the reality that landfill space was \ndramatically declining, Vermont acted to assist small communities in \ntheir effort to handle their solid waste. The 1987 solid waste \nmanagement law allows Vermont towns the ability to band together. \nPassage of Vermont's solid waste law and the implementation of the \nState's solid waste plan has been incredibly successful to date in \nachieving this goal. But we are not finished yet.\n  Mr. President, Vermont has spent over $20 million developing its \ndistrict waste management plans. The vast majority of these plans rely \non flow control. Without this ability, many small towns and cities \nwould not have been able to plan for the future, reduce their \nproduction of waste or implement far reaching recycling and waste \nreduction programs. The communities in my State need to be able to \ncount on the results of their investments. They need to continue to \nwork to solve their solid waste problems together, in coordination with \nthe State.\n  The loss of local authority over solid waste planning would be \ndisastrous. These solid waste districts have developed comprehensive \nwaste reduction plans, in order to reduce the costs of disposal and \nremove the need to\n continually open new and costly landfills. Since 1992, there has been \na dramatic increase in the number of households and businesses \nparticipating in local waste reduction and recycling programs. And it \nis working. Currently, Vermont recycles approximately 25 percent of its \nsolid waste and over 40 percent of Vermont's towns have recycling \nprograms in place. And these are rural towns. Recycling in rural areas \nis not easy, nor cheap. I am proud of what these Vermont communities \nhave achieved and want to ensure the continued growth of this trend in \nthe future.\n\n  Mr. President, Vermont is among the most rural States in the Nation. \nOur solid waste districts generally have not financed disposal \nfacilities, such as landfills, nor recycling infrastructure through the \nissuance of revenue bonds. Therefore, the exemptions in the bill will \nnot hold. But the financial health of these communities necessitates \nthe continuation of their ability to direct flows of waste. And these \nwaste districts are just beginning to fully implement their waste\n management plans, which may include the sighting of safe, but \nexpensive, waste disposal facilities.\n\n  My State has chosen to manage its waste in this manner. Now, in this \ntime when the theme is to reduce mandates from Washington, are we going \nto impose a Washington solution on Vermont and other States who are \nproperly managing their waste? Essentially, Washington will be removing \nVermont's ability to implement their solid waste management plan. \nWashington will dismantle Vermont's recycling program. Washington will \nincrease Vermont's waste generation, thereby increasing costs \nassociated with waste disposal. Washington will end Vermont's ability \nto safely manage its waste, waste which without my amendment can go to \nout-of-State incinerators and less preferable landfills.\n  I ask my colleagues to let Vermont manage its waste as it chooses, \nnot as Washington dictates. Do not impose a Washington mandate on \nVermont. Let us maintain our extremely successful waste reduction and \nrecycling programs.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join with Senator Jeffords on this, \nbecause I think it is extremely important to our State. S. 534, as it \nis presently written, trashes Vermont's solid waste management plan, I \nmight say literally and figuratively.\n  What we want to do is let the Vermont solution work in Vermont. We \nhear a lot about States' rights these days, but we are about to \nundermine our State's right to manage waste in Vermont. We hear a lot \nabout how States could find the best solutions to their problem, but \nthis bill says the States' solutions are wrong. We hear a lot about not \nforcing States to adhere to national environmental standards, but when \nmy own State goes and exceeds the national standard within the borders \nof our own State, we are told we cannot do that.\n  Now here we have a bill that says States can control what comes \nacross their borders, but they cannot control what is within their \nborders. That is absurd.\n  My State uses flow control to reduce the leakage of household \nhazardous waste into the environment. That is something that benefits \nall Americans. My State uses flow control to increase recycling in \nrural areas.\n  Vermont manages waste better than Federal statutes, like the Clean \nAir Act and the Clean Water Act require. If a State like Vermont wants \nto go above and beyond the call of duty in addressing solid waste \nproblems, then the Federal Government ought to stand out of its way. We \nare not suggesting we do less. We are just saying give us the right to \ndo more if that is what we want.\n  The opponents of this amendment say the free market will take care of \nour solid waste management. Well, the fact is in a rural State like \nVermont the free market will not increase recycling nor separate and \ncollect household hazardous wastes or address a number of the other \nthings that we are doing in Vermont.\n  When the State legislature or an individual waste management district \nchooses to pursue the policy suggested by Senators from other States, \nthey will have the opportunity to do so. Until then, they ought to be \nallowed to pursue the policies they have set up themselves, especially \nwhen everybody agrees the policy goes beyond any national standards. We \nought to be able to do what we want within our own borders in a case \nwhere we are not only not harming anybody else, but we are actually \nmaking the environment better.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would also point out that this does \nnot interfere in the sense of competition. There are bids that go out \nfor those who want to bid. The only problem that is created is the \ntipping fee, which has to eventually, of course, be paid by the people \nthat are getting the advantage of the waste disposal. And that helps in \npaying for the recycling programs.\n  In rural areas where you do not have large amounts of trash that is \nrecyclable in the sense that it can be sold, you have to make up that \ncost some way. The question is, is it not better to put that cost on \nthose that are getting the advantages of the waste disposal system? I \nthink everyone would agree, the answer is yes. And if the answer is \nyes, then why should we not be allowed to do it? It is not in any way \ninterfering with the problems that the Supreme Court handled, which was \ninterfering with respect to fair and open competition\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, am I correct in believing that 2:30 is the \ntime set for the vote on the Kyl amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is the pending amendment, right?\n                    [[Page S6494]] Amendment No. 769\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of amendment No. 769 offered by the Senator from \nArizona [Mr. Kyl].\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to table the Kyl amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me and I \nthank the distinguished managers for allowing me to speak.\n  Mr. President, this morning's Washington Post and many television and \nradio news programs throughout America and perhaps the world, reported \non what I would like to call a portrait in courage, and the person \nstanding tall in that portrait was none other than former President \nGeorge Bush.\n  Like many of my friends and family in Arkansas, former President Bush \nis a gun enthusiast. He is a long-time member of the National Rifle \nAssociation.\n  But like many other NRA members, President Bush was deeply offended \nby a recent NRA fundraising letter signed by Mr. Wayne LaPierre, the \nNRA's executive vice president. The LaPierre letter referred to several \nlaw enforcement officials: ``Jack-booted thugs who harass, intimidate, \neven murder law-abiding citizens.'' The NRA referred to Federal agents \n``wearing Nazi bucket helmets and black storm trooper uniforms to \nattack law-abiding citizens.''\n  This irresponsible, inflammatory NRA fundraising letter incited the \nformer President of the United States to the point that he wrote NRA \nPresident Thomas Washington to resign his NRA membership.\n  Former President Bush's letter reads as follows:\n\n       Your broadside against Federal agents deeply offends my own \n     sense of decency and honor and it offends my concept of \n     service to our country.\n\n  President Bush continues in his letter:\n\n       It indirectly slurs a wide array of government law \n     enforcement officials who are out there day and night, laying \n     their lives on the line for all of us.\n\n  Mr. President, I am asking unanimous consent that an excerpt from the \nstory in the Washington Post about President Bush resigning his \nmembership from the National Rifle Association be printed at this point \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       But his resignation letter was more personal than \n     political.\n       ``Al Whicher, who served on my [Secret Service] detail when \n     I was vice president and president, was killed in Oklahoma \n     City,'' Bush wrote. ``He was no Nazi. He was a kind man, a \n     loving parent, a man dedicated to serving his country--and \n     serve it well he did.\n       ``In 1993, I attended the wake for ATF agent Steve Willis, \n     another dedicated officer who did his duty. I can assure you \n     that this honorable man, killed by weird cultists, was no \n     Nazi.'' Willis was one of four federal agents killed in the \n     initial February 1993 raid on the Branch Davidian compound \n     near Waco, Tex.\n       ``John Magaw, who used to head the [Secret Service] and now \n     heads ATF, is one of the most principled, decent men I have \n     ever know,'' Bush wrote. ``He would be the last to condone \n     the kind of illegal behavior your ugly letter charges. The \n     same is true for the FBI's able Director Louis Freeh. I \n     appointed Mr. Freeh to the federal bench. His integrity and \n     honor are beyond question.''\n       The letter concluded, ``You have not repudiated Mr. \n     LaPierre's unwarranted attack. Therefore, I resign as a life \n     member of NRA, said resignation to be effective upon your \n     receipt of this letter. Please remove my name from your \n     membership list. Sincerely, George Bush.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/11/senate-section/article/S6494-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6494-S6497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         GATT AND GENERIC DRUGS\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, when we in Congress voted on the GATT \ntreaty recently, we all knew that we were breaking down trade barriers \nand leveling the playing field in international trade.\n  Make no mistake, I believe that Americans will benefit from this \nagreement when it is implemented in June. But never, Mr. President, in \nour wildest dreams or imagination, would we have ever thought we were \nvoting to give special treatment and a $6 billion windfall to the \nprescription drug industry on one hand and higher drug prices to \nAmerican consumers on the other. Yet that is exactly what is happening.\n  Mr. President, here is what has happened to bring us to this point \ntoday. Last year, the United States agreed under GATT to a new patent \nlaw, good for 20 years from filing. Our old patents were for 17 years, \nthe effective date from their date of issue.\n  We also agreed under GATT to give existing patents the longer of the \ntwo patent terms. This extension applies to all industries.\n  At the same time, we knew that generic companies of all kinds all \nover America had already made significant investments based upon old \npatent expiration dates. These companies were prepared to introduce \ntheir competitively priced drug products just as the brand-name \nmonopolies end.\n  We did not want to jeopardize the jobs and the factories which were \nat stake. So we decided under GATT to adopt a formula under which these \ngeneric companies could proceed with the introduction of their products \nif they paid the patent holders ``equitable remuneration'' for the \nperiod of time left on their patents.\n  Mr. President, here is where this story really begins. It just so \nhappens that over 100 prescription drugs now protected by patents will \nbe getting extra patent life under GATT.\n  For example, Glaxo's patent for the world's best selling drug, \nZantac, would have run out December 5, 1995, but will now last until \n1997. Generic drug companies have already spent millions of dollars to \nprepare to market lower cost, equivalent drugs on that date, giving \nconsumers of America a tremendous price break.\n  But a small handful of brand-name pharmaceutical companies have \nobjected. They are saying, ``Thank you for the extra patent life. We \nreally appreciate that part of GATT. But you should know there is an \nobscure provision in U.S. drug law which we think protects us from the \nrest of the GATT treaty. We are sorry our generic competitors have \ninvested heavily in their business, but they do not deserve the \nprotections that are rightfully theirs under GATT. So we guess we will \nnot have any competition for quite some time.''\n  [[Page S6495]] This is what they have told the Food and Drug \nAdministration. The pharmaceutical manufacturers have even threatened \nlitigation against the Food and Drug Administration.\n  I am deeply concerned, Mr. President, because if they get their way \nat this time, they gain a multibillion dollar windfall--alone among the \ndozens of other industries and thousands of other companies complying \nrigidly with the GATT treaty.\n  Even worse, consumers now are going to have to pay double for these \ndrugs. They will have to pay twice, Mr. President, as consumers and as \ntaxpayers. The Federal Government and the State governments are going \nto pay an extra $1.25 billion for prescription drugs for older \nAmericans under Medicare, veterans, low-income families and children, \nas well as the active duty military.\n  That will come out of our tax dollars. The American taxpayers will \nthus be paying more taxes so that a few brand-name drug companies can \nmake more profits and block competition in the marketplace--\n forcing the American consumer to continue paying the highest drug \nprices in the world today.\n\n  Most important, I think, will be the effect on older Americans, \nAmericans on fixed incomes, and Americans without adequate health \ninsurance. They will feel the hurt of these soaring drug prices even \nmore.\n  Mr. President, this chart is fascinating because it demonstrates very \nclearly that two of our best-selling drugs on the market are about to \nrun out of patent protection, and should have generic competition by \nthe end of this year.\n  Zantac, for example, is the leading drug for ulcers. It is \nmanufactured by Glaxo. For a typical 2-month supply, the brand-name is \n$180. For a generic supply of 2 months, the cost is about $90. What we \nare going to see is, under GATT, an unintended consequence. Glaxo is \ngoing to receive a 19-month extension on their patent. This drug's \nprice is not going to go down. There will be no generic competition \nwith Zantac. We will see Zantac continue to soar in price. In fact, \nGlaxo is anticipating over a $1 billion windfall, because of this \nunintended consequence in GATT.\n  Do you think this brand-name drug, Zantac, is going to go down in \nprice? Last year, Zantac's price grew 1\\1/2\\ times faster than \ninflation. The price for Zantac since 1989, only 6 short years ago, has \nincreased 40 percent. What do you suppose is going to happen to that \nprice if Zantac gains more than a year and a half of additional \nuncontested market exclusivity?\n  Mr. President, the intent of GATT, of course, was not to harm \nAmerican consumers. The goal was to improve their standing in the world \neconomy. The prescription drug marketplace today is one area where the \nAmerican consumer has been particularly exploited as we have \nhistorically paid the highest price for drugs while subsidizing lower \ndrug prices for consumers around the world.\n  This is why five of my colleagues and I have written to the Food and \nDrug Administration, asking the Food and Drug Administration to make \nthe right decision--and that right decision is to allow generic drugs \nto come to the marketplace, offering competition to brand-named drugs \nwhich are about to receive an enormous unexpected and undeserved \nwindfall.\n  This is a textbook case of a loophole resulting in an unwarranted \nwindfall. No single industry deserves special treatment under GATT and \ntoday the pharmaceutical manufacturers of brand-name products are \ngetting that special treatment at the expense of the American consumer. \nShould the Food and Drug Administration fail to provide the proper \nsolution to this problem, I will immediately proceed with legislation \nto remedy this economic and this moral wrong. And I am hopeful my \ncolleagues will join me.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article appearing in \nBusiness Week magazine dated May 15, 1995, be printed in the Record, as \nwell as letters to Dr. David Kessler, Commissioner of the Food and Drug \nAdministration, from consumer, patient, health care, and trade groups \nsupporting our concerns. These groups include the National Organization \nfor Rare Disorders; Families USA and the Gray Panthers; AmeriNet, of \nSt. Louis, MO, and Premier Health Alliance, of Westchester, IL; the \nNational Association of Chain Drug Stores and the National \nPharmaceutical Alliance.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Business Week, May 15, 1995]\n\n A Patient Medicine Called GATT--For Makers of Branded Drugs, it Could \n                         Prove a Powerful Tonic\n\n                            (By John Carey)\n\n       It wouldn't be surprising if Robert J. Gunter took a dose \n     of his own medicine. President of generic drugmaker Novopharm \n     USA Inc., he has spent five years gearing up to produce a \n     generic version of Glaxo Holdings PLC's blockbuster ulcer \n     drug, Zantac. He even invested $40 million in a plant in \n     Wilson, NC., built to pump out the low-cost version as soon \n     as Glaxo's first patent expired in December.\n       Now, Gunter finds himself in the middle of stomach-churning \n     patent battle. Glaxo and other brand name pharmaceutical \n     giants are claiming that the General Agreement on Tariffs & \n     Trade (GATT), signed by President Clinton in December, \n     extends many of their patents, Zantac's among them. More \n     important, they argue, the extended patent term gives them \n     extra months--even years--of protection from competing \n     generics.\n       While the case relies on complicated legal arguments, it \n     boils down to whether provisions in GATT supersede a 1984 law \n     that prevents the Food & Drug Administration from approving \n     generics until the patent on a name brand expires. If the \n     arguments prevail, more than 100 brand-name products will win \n     an average of 12 months each of extra patent protection \n     (table). A new study from the University of Minnesota \n     estimates that the extra protection could give the drugmakers \n     a windfall of $6 billion over the next 20 years. ``That's \n     obscene,'' fumes Senator David H. Pryor (D-Ark.). ``American \n     consumers are going to pay the bill.''\n                           ``eureka'' moment\n\n       Pryor, a handful of other lawmakers, and the generics \n     companies are fighting back. On Apr. 27, Pryor and five other \n     senators asked the FDA to reject the brand-name companies' \n     interpretation of GATT. Vows Novopharm's Gunter: ``If the \n     pharmaceutical industry thinks generics will roll over and \n     play dead on this, they have another think coming.'' The \n     FDA's decision is expected within weeks, but the wrangling \n     won't end then. FDA officials and executives on both sides \n     predict that whatever the FDA decision, the loser will take \n     the issue to court.\n       The high-stakes controversy wasn't anticipated when GATT \n     was approved late last year. The agreement harmonized U.S. \n     law with the rest of the world's by changing patent terms to \n     20 years from the initial filing instead of 17 years after \n     being granted. Most companies thought the change applied only \n     to new patents, but soon after passage, Glaxo's lawyers had a \n     ``eureka'' moment. Poring over the legislation, ``we realized \n     that for many of our existing products, patent life would be \n     extended,'' says associate general counsel Marc Shapiro.\n       As a result, any patent that took under three years to win \n     approval would have longer protection. Since the U.S. Patent \n     Office took only 17 months to grant the first of two key \n     patents on Zantac, the change would give the company an \n     additional 19 months of protection for its top-selling drug.\n       But even as GATT changed patent terms, Congress tried to \n     prevent harm to rivals that had been counting on the original \n     expiration dates. Lawmakers inserted a clause permitting a \n     company to introduce a competing product on the original \n     patent expiration date if the company had made significant \n     prior investments and if it paid the patent holder a royalty \n     or some other form of ``equitable remuneration.'' While \n     Jeremiah McIntyre, counsel for generic drugmaker Geneva \n     Pharmaceuticals Inc., calls that ``a fair balance,'' on the \n     theory that it's better to pay a royalty than not be allowed \n     into the market at all, the provision would squeeze generic \n     drugmakers' already thin profit margins.\n                               oversight?\n\n       Meanwhile, Glaxo, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., and other \n     brand-name companies are arguing that this escape clause \n     shouldn't even apply to the drug industry. The reason, they \n     say, is that it clashes with provisions in a 1984 U.S. \n     generic-drug law that prevents the FDA from approving a \n     generic drug until the brand-name patent expires. Unlike \n     other instances where Congress amended existing laws to \n     conform with GATT, it failed to resolve this conflict--\n     implying an intent to keep existing law intact, says Glaxo's \n     Shapiro. Pryor and others plead simple oversight. But the big \n     drugmakers insist on claiming what they see as theirs.\n       In the coming fight, generic drugmakers face an uphill \n     struggle. ``We have to be better organized, and spend more \n     money to get our message across,'' says Bruce Downey, CEO of \n     Barr Laboratories Inc., a generic drugmaker in Pomona, N.Y. \n     As policymakers focus once again on rising health-care costs, \n     the generic companies do have one potent message: If the \n     brand-name companies win, Americans will pay billions more \n     for drugs. Faced with the prospect of dramatically higher \n     costs, ``I can't believe the [FDA] won't make the right \n     choice,'' says Lewis A. Engman, president of the Generic \n     Pharmaceutical Industry Assn. Robert Gunter can only hope \n     he's right.\n                [[Page S6496]] a windfall in the making\n\n       Pharmaceutical makers are seeking an average of 12 months' \n     extra protection from generic competitors for more than 100 \n     drugs.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         Potential extra\n                                            Months of   revenues because\n             Drug Company/Use                 added        of lack of   \n                                            protection       generic    \n                                                           alternative  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nZANTAC--Glaxo/ulcers.....................           19            $1,000\nMEVACOR--Merck/cholesterol-lowering......           19               448\nDIFLUCAN--Pfizer/antifungal agent........           20               410\nPRILOSEC--Merck/ulcers...................           17               586\nCAPOTEN--Bristol-Myers Squibb/                                          \n hypertension............................            6               101\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nData: Prime Institute, University of Minnesota.                         \n\n                                         National Organization for\n\n\n                                         Rare Disorders, Inc.,\n\n                                New Fairfield, CT, April 13, 1995.\n     Hon. David Kessler,\n     Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, MD.\n       Dear Dr. Kessler: The National Organization for Rare \n     Disorders, Inc. (NORD) is deeply concerned with the FDA's \n     pending interpretation of the General Agreements on Tariffs \n     and Trade (GATT) implementing legislation as it applies to \n     pharmaceutical drug patents.\n       The branded pharmaceutical industry (represented by PhRMA) \n     is seeking an extension of patents solely based on their \n     desire to maximize profits. If these companies succeed in \n     their attempt to limit consumer access to more affordable \n     ``generic'' products, then millions of Americans will have no \n     choice but to pay more for already over-priced drugs. NORD \n     believes that Congress never intended to force American \n     consumers to pay even higher prices for their prescription \n     drugs.\n       While such patent extensions would significantly increase \n     the cost of our Medicaid program, please consider the even \n     greater burden this would place upon the millions of \n     Americans who are refused health insurance--and in turn \n     prescription drug coverage--because they are afflicted with a \n     rare ``orphan'' disease.\n       GATT was intended to improve the welfare of American \n     consumers through international trade--including the needs of \n     patients who desperately rely on access to more affordable \n     drugs. GATT was never intended to provide special treatment \n     to any segment of the pharmaceutical industry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Abbey S. Meyers,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                      Families USA Foundation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 10, 1995.\n     Dear Senator/Representative:\n       We understand that the FDA is currently reviewing its \n     position on GATT language as it applies to the extension \n     period on drug patents. If GATT rules are retrospectively \n     applied to previously filed or issued patents, the average \n     patent extension for currently marketed drugs would be more \n     than 12 months. The FDA is considering regulations that would \n     withhold approval of generic drugs covered by ``GATT-\n     extended'' patents until the extension period has ended. This \n     would force the American public to pay higher prescription \n     drug prices.\n       Families USA recently studied price increases in the top-\n     selling drugs used by Americans. In our report, Worthless \n     Promises: Drug Companies Keep Boosting Price, we found that \n     the prices consumers pay for the most commonly purchased \n     drugs continue to increase faster than general inflation. \n     Drug price increases are particularly harmful to senior \n     citizens who have the greatest needs for drugs and are most \n     likely to pay for them out of pocket.\n       Several of the brand-name drugs that could receive patent \n     extensions are among the top-selling drugs used by Americans. \n     Among the drugs whose patents would be extended are: Zantac, \n     the top-selling drug used by Americans, which increased in \n     price 38% from 1989 to 1994; Capoten, a blood pressure \n     medicine which increased in price 65.3% from 1989 to 1994 and \n     4.9% last year; Pepcid, an ulcer medicine that increased in \n     price 31.3% from 1989 to 1994; Mevacor, a cholesterol \n     medicine which increased in price 27.8% from 1989 to 1994; \n     and Prilosec, an ulcer medicine that increased in price 4.2% \n     last year, and increased in price 7.5% (2.4 times as fast as \n     inflation) in the year 1991 to 1992.\n       Generic drug products typically enter the market at prices \n     25% less than patented brand, and their prices are even less \n     compared to the brand-name drug as generics further penetrate \n     the market. Consumers desperately need relief from high drug \n     prices.\n       A recent study by PRIME institute found that the extension \n     would cost Medicaid about $1 billion. Federal and state \n     governments will face more than $1.25 billion in added costs \n     without generic drugs entering the marketplace.\n       We ask you to examine this issue and encourage the FDA to \n     delay any ruling until the problem is fully investigated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Judith G. Waxman,\n     Director, Government Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                   Gray Panthers Project Fund,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 1995.\n     Hon. David Kessler,\n     Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, MD.\n       Dear Dr. Kessler: I am writing to you because we understand \n     the FDA is reviewing its position on the language in GATT as \n     it applied to extension periods on prescription drug patents. \n     We understand that FDA is considering regulations that would \n     prohibit the entry of generic drugs in the marketplace during \n     this GATT extension period.\n       It is our position that this action would force the \n     American public to pay higher prices for prescription drugs. \n     It also seems to us, that the primary purpose of GATT is to \n     create level playing fields and the best product at the \n     lowest price to consumers. This action is contrary to that \n     principle.\n       Many of the brand-name drugs that could receive extended \n     patent protection are some of the most widely prescribed \n     drugs used by Americans--especially the senior population. \n     And these drugs continue to cost more and more each year. In \n     a recent study by PRIME Institute of the University of \n     Minnesota found that Medicare alone would incur about 1 \n     billion added costs without the availability of generic \n     drugs.\n       A generic prescription drug usually enters the marketplace \n     at up to 25 percent less than the branded drug. To those \n     individuals living on fixed incomes who already faced with \n     rising health costs, the option to choose generic is very \n     important.\n       Dr. Kessler, I trust that you will further investigate this \n     issue and seriously consider the negative impact that \n     prohibiting the availability of generic drugs on the American \n     consumer.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Dixie Horning,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                     AmeriVet,\n\n                                    St. Louis, MO, April 25, 1995.\n     Hon. David Kessler,\n     Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, MD.\n       Dear Dr. Kessler: The FDA is currently deliberating on an \n     important issue that could force the American public to pay \n     millions of dollars in higher prescription drug costs. The \n     debate is over the interpretation of GATT legislation \n     language as it pertains to patents on prescription drugs. \n     This language extends the life of patents on a number of the \n     country's most widely prescribed drugs, potentially \n     generating a windfall to pharmaceutical companies at the \n     expense of the American public.\n       As a group purchasing organization, the economic impact of \n     the GATT patent extension and the projected cost to consumers \n     is of great concern to us. We strongly urge you to do all you \n     can to make available to consumers the generic drugs that may \n     be delayed in reaching the market if the patents on brand-\n     name drugs are extended.\n       As you realize, if a provider has a generic equivalent to \n     substitute, the patient receives a cost savings over the \n     brand-name drug. The cost to consumers for the currently \n     marketed brand-name drugs is substantial, projected to be as \n     high as $6,000,000, over potential generic equivalents. The \n     cost will be incurred by the American public as well as \n     Medicare, federal and state governments, employers, private \n     insurers, and managed care firms.\n       We request that you seriously consider the enormous \n     financial burden to the American public that would result \n     from legislature preventing generic drugs from entering the \n     marketplace during the GATT extension. We fully support your \n     efforts in persuading the FDA to make lower-cost generic \n     drugs available to consumers upon existing brand patent \n     expiration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Joseph W. Mulroy,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                Premier Health Alliance, Inc.,\n\n                                  Westchester, IL, April 14, 1995.\n     Hon. David Kessler,\n     Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, MD.\n     Re GATT Extension Period and Drug Patents\n       Dear Honorable Kessler: It has been brought to my attention \n     that certain language in the recently approved GATT \n     legislation may have a negative impact on the price Americans \n     will pay for prescription drugs in the near future. It is \n     also my understanding that the branded pharmaceutical \n     industry is currently pressuring FDA to make a ruling that \n     would prevent generic drugs from entering the marketplace \n     during this extension period--a decision that would place an \n     enormous financial burden on the American health care system \n     and public through higher priced drugs.\n       It is my firm belief that Congress did not intend for brand \n     name pharmaceutical companies to be the recipient of a $6 \n     billion financial windfall during this GATT extension period \n     to be subsidized by health care providers and the American \n     public.\n       This ``unintended consequence'' of the GATT language should \n     not be passed on to hospitals and physicians that already are \n     aggressively seeking ways to reduce healthcare costs, as well \n     as private citizens.\n       I am personally asking you to seriously consider the \n     negative implications that would result from legislation \n     preventing generic drugs from entering the marketplace during \n     the GATT extension. The access to generic drugs is vital to \n     those Americans who need them the most and I trust you will \n     [[Page S6497]] delay any ruling until further investigation \n     into this matter has been made.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                    Bill Magruder,\n     Vice President, Pharmacy Program.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                            Chain Drug Stores,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, April 26, 1995.\n     Hon. David Kessler,\n     Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, MD.\n       Dear Dr. Kessler: On behalf of the National Association of \n     Chain Drug Stores (NACDS), I am writing to strongly urge that \n     the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognize pre-GATT \n     patent expiration dates for pharmaceuticals, and allow the \n     approval of ANDAs for generic prescription pharmaceutical \n     preparations where the sponsor of such application has made a \n     ``substantial investment'' in the product prior to June 8, \n     1995, the date of implementation of the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade (GATT). We understand that the FDA is \n     currently considering whether GATT's implementing legislation \n     provides such statutory authority. NACDS believes that it \n     does.\n       NACDS represents America's chain drug store industry, and \n     includes more than 160 chain companies in an industry that \n     operates 30,000 retail community pharmacies. Chain pharmacy \n     is the largest component of retail pharmacy practice, \n     providing practice settings for more than 66,000 pharmacists. \n     Our membership base fills over 60 percent of the more than \n     two billion prescriptions dispensed annually in the United \n     States.\n       We understand and support the importance of having generic \n     prescription drugs available to consumers as soon as \n     possible. Everyday, the availability of generic drugs enables \n     the pharmacists who practice in our stores to help reduce \n     overall prescription medication costs for populations that do \n     not have prescription drug insurance. Among those who benefit \n     from access to generic drugs are millions of older Americans \n     and working poor, publicly-funded prescription drug programs \n     such as Medicaid, and other third party prescription drug \n     plans.\n       The impact that a misapplication of the GATT implementing \n     legislation could have on the American public is significant. \n     A recent study by the PRIME Institute at the University of \n     Minnesota found that GATT provisions could result in an \n     additional $6 billion in prescription drug expenditures in \n     the United States because of the additional patent \n     protections granted to brand name products, and the relative \n     unavailability of lower-cost generic versions.\n       In summary, NACDS believes that the GATT agreement should \n     not preclude the manufacturers of generic prescription drugs \n     from bringing their products to market during the period of \n     extended patent protection provided by GATT for brand name \n     prescription drug products.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ronald L. Ziegler,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                             National Pharmaceutical Alliance,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, April 26, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: The National Pharmaceutical Alliance \n     (NPA) is an association of over 165 manufacturers and \n     distributors of pharmaceutical preparations for human and \n     veterinary use. Our members are dedicated to providing safe \n     and affordable alternatives to the American public whenever \n     health needs dictate the use of pharmaceutical products.\n       In December of last year, the congress ratified the Uruguay \n     Round Agreements Act [P.L. 103-465] (URAA) of the General \n     Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). This agreement created \n     some fundamental changes to be made in U.S. patent law. The \n     new law provides for patents to be in force 20 years from the \n     date of application as opposed to the historical law of the \n     United States which provided for patents to be in force for \n     17 years from date of approval. Congress, realizing that such \n     a change would cause a financial hardship on companies that \n     expected to enter the marketplace at the expiration of the \n     old patent date, provided a remedy to allow competing \n     products on the market.\n       Under H.R. 5110, the implementing language of GATT, \n     companies that could show that a substantial investment had \n     been made in a product could enter the marketplace at the \n     pre-GATT expiry date. The respective companies then would \n     work out an ``equitable remuneration'' during the life of the \n     patent extension. This remedy will work for every industry \n     except the generic pharmaceutical industry due to its \n     regulation by the Food and Drug Administration. Since \n     approvals for Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) are \n     governed by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \n     Restoration Act of 1984, known as Hatch/Waxman, failure to \n     change its provisions could prevent the FDA from granting \n     approvals until after the patent extension has expired. We do \n     not believe that Congress intended to treat the drug industry \n     differently that other industries.\n       If the 109 generic pharmaceutical products inversely \n     affected by GATT are kept off the market, the result could be \n     an increased cost to the American consumer of over $6 billion \n     and a cost of over $1.2 billion to Federal and State \n     governments in higher Medicare and Medicaid costs. In 1995 \n     alone, drugs such as alclometrasone dipr. (Alclovate), \n     captopril (Capoten), and ranitidine HC1 (Zantac) could be \n     unavailable to consumers in a generic version. Zantac alone \n     could represent an additional cost to the consumers in excess \n     of $1 billion during the time of the patent extension. At a \n     time when both healthcare costs and government budgets are \n     strained to the limit, it makes no sense for government to \n     take any action that would fuel the growth in these \n     expenditures.\n       In the ten years since its passage, the Hatch/Waxman \n     legislation has done remarkably well at balancing the \n     interests of proprietary drug companies and the generic drug \n     industry. The public also has come to not only expect, but to \n     rely upon, timely access to high quality, low cost \n     alternatives to monopolistic priced name brand drugs.\n       NPA is pleased to see that members of Congress, such as \n     yourself, are taking steps to correct this inequity in the \n     law. Your actions are to be applauded and your decision to \n     stand up for the American consumer is appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Christine Sizemore,\n                                               Executive Director.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/11/senate-section/article/S6494-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE ACT\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, our friend from Arkansas has brought to our \nattention the fact that former President Bush has decided to resign \nfrom the National Rifle Association because of its refusal to repudiate \nsome statements which were made by a vice president of NRA in a \nfundraising letter. I join Senator Pryor in commending former President \nBush for his action. I am sure it is a difficult one for the President, \nas a decades-long member of the NRA and as someone who believes in so \nmany of its programs and efforts to protect rights under the second \namendment.\n  But what President Bush reacted to is what I think most Americans who \nhave read this letter reacted to, which is a statement by Mr. LaPierre, \namong others, that the Clinton administration has authorized law \nenforcement personnel to murder law-abiding citizens.\n  Those are the words in the letter. It is an outrageous allegation \nabout any American President or any American administration. I do not \nthink 1 percent of the members of the NRA believe that the Clinton \nadministration has authorized its agents, its Treasury agents, its FBI \nagents, its law enforcement agents, to murder law-abiding citizens. I \nwrote a letter to Tom Washington, whom I know. He is a resident of \nMichigan who was president of the National Rifle Association, urging \nhim to retract that statement and some other allegations in that letter \nwhich are, I think, equally offensive, but at least that statement.\n  In his response to me, which I put in the Record yesterday or the day \nbefore yesterday, he really did not respond to the request. He simply \nacknowledged that sometimes fundraising letters have exaggerated \nrhetoric. But this is not a case of just exaggerated rhetoric. This is \nan allegation by one of the Nation's largest organizations that this \nadministration has given the go-ahead to law enforcement personnel to \nmurder--I am using the word murder because that is exactly the word \nthat they used; indeed the letter underlines it, italicizes it, \nemphasizes it--to murder law-abiding citizens.\n  I do not think, again, anybody on this floor would think there is \ntruth to that statement. I do not think 1 percent of the members, as I \nsaid, of the NRA believes there is truth to that statement. It is that \nkind of a statement, of a wild statement, of an irresponsible statement \nby a major organization, which is creating an unacceptable climate in \nthis country, I believe. Is it the only statement? Of course not. \nOthers have made outrageous statements, too. Do they have a right to \nmake that statement under the first amendment? They do. I will defend \nit.\n  [[Page S6498]] They may have a right to make that statement, but that \ndoes not make it right to make that kind of a statement. It should be \nretracted.\n  I commend President Bush and I hope other members of the NRA, in one \nway or another, would let their leadership know that kind of rhetoric \nis unacceptable about an American administration. Like any other \nadministration, it, I am sure, has agents who make mistakes from time \nto time. There is a place to rectify them. It is called a court. But to \nmake that allegation from an organization the size of the NRA I think \nis unacceptable, it is irresponsible, and it still should be retracted.\n  I thank my friend from Arkansas for his continuing effort to try to \nbring some kind of calmer normalcy into the general climate in this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President I just want to observe that the managers of \nthe pending legislation I understand are working on some agreements \nhopefully that will make it possible to wrap up this legislation before \nthe day is out.

Mr. President, 26 years ago, the Senate provided its \nadvice and consent to ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty [NPT]. In considering the treaty, Chairman Fulbright prevailed \non the Members of the Senate to ratify the NPT, because without it, the \nworld would face a wide array of potential nuclear horrors--such as \ndeveloping nations acquiring nuclear weapons to elevate their status or \nnational power; regional powers resorting to the use of nuclear weapons \nto settle their differences; or ethnic or religious differences being \nsettled with nuclear weapons. He foresaw a world where major powers \nlike the United States might be held hostage by small, poor countries \nwho possess a few nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them, or, \nbecome drawn into a nuclear confrontation brought about by these small \nnations through a miscalculation or an accident.\n  At the time the NPT was negotiated there were relatively few \ncountries who had tested or possessed nuclear weapons. Those countries \nwere the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, France, and China. \nThey became known as the nuclear weapons states. All other states who \ndid not possess or had not tested nuclear weapons became known as non-\nnuclear weapons states.\n  Back in 1969, when the Senate voted to provide its advice and consent \nto ratification of the NPT, I was one of the 15 members who voted \nagainst ratification of the treaty. I voted against it because I had \ngrave reservations about the treaty's goals and whether they could be \nachieved. I was concerned that if the United States ratified the NPT, \nit would be unable to fulfill its NATO responsibilities and \ncommitments. I feared that the NPT would also foreclose the ability of \nNATO members to participate fully in the operations of the Alliance. \nLastly, I was concerned that the nuclear weapons states, and in \nparticular, the United States, would bear the huge costs of \ntransferring nuclear technology for peaceful uses to the non-nuclear \nweapons states.\n  Mr. President, the overall goal and purpose of the NPT is to stop the \nspread of nuclear weapons, and to prohibit the transfer, or acquisition \nand manufacture of nuclear weapons by non-nuclear weapons states. \nHowever, there are no enforcement mechanisms to prevent a non-nuclear \nweapons state from becoming a nuclear weapons state in the NPT. There \nare no sanctions for violations of the treaty. While the NPT requires \nthe parties to pursue negotiations to end the\n nuclear arms race and bring about nuclear disarmament, the NPT cannot \nforce an end to the race for nuclear weapons, nor can it force the \ndestruction of all nuclear weapons.\n\n  For that matter, the NPT cannot ensure that parties to the Treaty, \nwhether nuclear weapons states or non-nuclear weapons states, do not \nwithdraw from the Treaty if they decide they wish to acquire or develop \na nuclear arsenal for their own national security reasons. In fact, the \nNPT has a withdrawal clause.\n  The NPT only covers countries that have ratified the Treaty. For \nexample, take the so-called threshold states which have developed \nnuclear weapons, \n[[Page S6499]] or nuclear weapons technology. These countries, India, \nPakistan, and Israel, are not parties to the Treaty. Even if these \ncountries signed the NPT as non-nuclear weapons states, there is no way \nto ensure that these countries will ever stop development of, or \ndestroy, their nuclear arsenals.\n  Mr. President, in the 26 years of its existence, the NPT did not free \nthe world from the threat of nuclear weapons, and it will not do so in \nthe future. It did, however, establish a global norm for nations to \nlimit the proliferation of nuclear weapons and it has enjoyed the \nwidest adherence of any arms control agreement. It is for this reason, \nthat I rise today in support of extending the NPT. Let me qualify my \nstatement of support of the Treaty by saying that I take no position on \nwhether the Treaty should be indefinitely extended, or, extended only \nfor a fixed period of time. I am concerned that the United States did \nnot make any efforts to improve the NPT and make it a more viable \nagreement by strengthening its enforcement and inspection mechanisms.\n  I went back and reviewed the Senate floor debate on the ratification \nof the NPT. Mr. President, despite wide adherence to the NPT, the world \nstill faces the potential horrors of a nuclear exchange between \nregional states. The risk of the use of nuclear weapons by countries to \nsuppress governmental factions, or settle old ethnic and religious \ndisputes still exists today, as it did 26 years ago.\n  Representatives of the international community have been gathered in \nNew York City at the United Nations for the past month to determine the \nfuture of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Clinton \nadministration supports indefinite and unconditional extension of the \nTreaty, while representatives from the non-aligned member states, led \nby Indonesia, Iran and Egypt, oppose indefinite extension.\n  On March 16, a majority of Members of the Senate expressed\n   their support for the administration's position of indefinite and \nunconditional extension of the NPT. They also expressed concerns that \nthe NPT would be seriously undercut if it is not indefinitely extended, \ndealing a major below to global nuclear nonproliferation regimes. Mr. \nPresident, the treaty can be undermined at any time regardless of its \nduration because there are no enforcement mechanisms or automatic \nsanctions.\n\n  I remind my colleagues that as a non-nuclear weapons state to the NPT \nand member in good standing, Iraq, developed an illegal nuclear weapons \nprogram under the guise of a peaceful nuclear program, and it has been \ndetermined that Iran, under the guise of peaceful use of nuclear \ntechnology is pursuing an illegal nuclear weapons program. Likewise, \nNorth Korea, a non-nuclear weapons state to the NPT was determined to \nhave violated the NPT. Of course, it was never determined to be a \nmember in good standing of the treaty. Lastly, even though not members \nof the NPT, India, Pakistan, and Israel, were able to secretly develop \nnuclear weapons programs.\n  Representatives and leaders of a number of developing countries, or \nnonaligned member states, do not support indefinite and unconditional \nextension of the treaty. They cite as reasons for their lack of support \nfor the U.S. position, the lack of progress in concluding a \ncomprehensive test ban. They claim that the nuclear weapons states have \nnot fulfilled their nuclear disarmament obligations. They believe that \nthe Treaty is discriminatory and that it sanctions the five nuclear \npowers' rights to hold on to their nuclear weapons and keep the non-\nnuclear weapon states as nuclear weapons ``have-nots''.\n  Mr. President, I reject the rationale offered by the non-aligned \nstates for not supporting extension of the Treaty. For the past decade, \nthe United States and Russia have made unprecedented reductions in \ntheir nuclear forces--beginning in 1985 with the Intermediate Range \nNuclear Forces Treaty and more recently reducing strategic forces under \nSTART. Both President Clinton and President Yeltsin have agreed to \ndiscuss even further reductions to their nuclear weapons programs once \nSTART II is implemented. Prior to START entering into force, President \nBush and President Gorbachev implemented unilateral reductions of \nUnited States and Russian tactical weapons. Since 1992, a testing \nmoratorium has been in place in the United States, and the United \nStates along with the other nuclear weapons states and members of the \nConference on Disarmament have been negotiating a comprehensive test \nban treaty.\n  Last month, the United States and the other four nuclear weapons \nstates restated their support of negative security assurances in the \nUnited Nations. Additionally, negotiations will begin soon on a global \nban on the production of fissile material for military purposes in the \nConference on Disarmament. If these steps do not indicate a good faith \neffort on the part of the United States and other nuclear weapons \nstates toward nuclear disarmament, I am not sure what else can be done.\n  Representatives of the non-nuclear weapons states who want to poke \nthe United States in the eye by not supporting indefinite extension of \nthe Treaty, because they believe we have not reduced our nuclear \narsenals to zero, or completed the negotiations on a comprehensive test \nban, would do well to focus attention on their own efforts at reducing \nthe threat posed by nuclear weapons. How have they worked with their \nneighbors, and other countries, to build more positive relationships \nand confidence so that threat of attack and annihilation are reduced \nand countries do not feel compelled to acquire nuclear weapons for \nprotection?\n  The Clinton administration and other NPT signatories should stop \nwringing their hands over the period of time for which the Treaty \nshould be extended. Instead they should be focused on using this month-\nlong conference to enhance the viability of the NPT by making it a \nliving document which enables and ensures multilateral enforcement of \nthe Treaty's provisions. Parties to the NPT should have confidence that \nits members will comply with the provisions of the Treaty, be \nsupportive of its goals and that the proliferation of nuclear weapons \nand nuclear technology is eliminated. And, when a determination of a \nviolation has been made by the international monitoring agency through \nits inspections and the United Nations Security Council has been \nnotified, meaningful and appropriate actions or sanctions should be \nundertaken immediately.\n  Mr President, once again, I rise to say that I support extension of \nthe NPT. I only regret that the administration did not believe the NPT \nwas important enough to strengthen it to make it a more viable and \neffective arms control agreement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, a vote has been scheduled at 6 o'clock by \nthe managers on an amendment which has been offered by Senator Craig, \nSenator Grassley, Senator Brown, Senator Kempthorne, and myself which \nwould establish a sense of the Senate that hearings should be held on \nRuby Ridge, ID, and Waco, TX, on or before June 30.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to set a date where there may be an \ninquiry by the full Judiciary Committee on those events because of the \nwidespread reports of public unrest as to what occurred there.\n  I have attempted to get a hearing on the Waco incident since mid-\n1993. The incident there happened on April 19, 1993. It has always \nseemed to me that it is not sufficient to have the executive branch \ninvestigate itself when there is so much concern as to the propriety of \nthe action which was taken there, with the assaults and with the rush \nand with the gases which were used.\n  There have been numerous reports and there is very substantial \nevidence of public unrest on what has happened there. It is speculative \nto an extent, or it may not be speculative, as to a connection between \nthe Oklahoma City \n[[Page S6500]] bombing on April 19, which is 2 years to the day after \nthe events at Waco, TX. The subcommittee has held a series of hearings \nand had planned to have an inquiry scheduled for April 18, and the full \ncommittee did convene on the first date which was set back on April 26. \nAnd I think it is entirely appropriate for the full committee to handle \nthe matter as opposed to the terrorism subcommittee.\n  But after having a series of hearings--we had our third hearing \ntoday--I am more convinced than ever that there is real public tension \nas to the events in Waco, TX, and Ruby Ridge, ID. I think it is just \ninappropriate for the Senate to wait an indefinite period of time.\n  Senator Hatch has proposed that there be hearings in the near future, \nas he categorizes it, and has further articulated the near future to \nmean sometime in the current session, which would be at the end of the \nyear. If there is unrest, and if there is a causal connection, or if \nthere is any connection, however slight or however tenuous, between the \nincident at Waco and the Oklahoma City bombing, I suggest it is our \nduty to proceed to clear the air to the maximum extent possible and to \ndemonstrate that ranking public officials at whatever level will be \nheld accountable. It seems to me this is something which is very \nimportant to do.\n  In establishing the date of June 30, I would be prepared to be \nflexible until the August recess, to extend the time for another period \nuntil August 4, which would be acceptable from my point of view. There \nhas been an issue raised as to the completion of the FBI investigation, \nand that certainly could be done by August 4.\n  Mr. President, I think I will relax the language and ask unanimous \nconsent that the amendment be modified so that the date August 4 would \nbe inserted in place of the date June 30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 754), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) There has been enormous public concern, worry and fear \n     in the U.S. over international terrorism for many years;\n       (2) There has been enormous public concern, worry and fear \n     in the U.S. over the threat of domestic terrorism after the \n     bombing of the New York World Trade Center on February 26, \n     1993;\n       (3) There is even more public concern, worry and fear since \n     the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in \n     Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995;\n       (4) Public concern, worry and fear has been aggravated by \n     the fact that it appears that the terrorist bombing at the \n     Federal building in Oklahoma City was perpetrated by \n     Americans;\n       (5) The United States Senate should take all action within \n     its power to understand and respond in all possible ways to \n     threats of domestic as well as international terrorism;\n       (6) Serious questions of public concern have been raised \n     about the actions of federal law enforcement officials \n     including agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and \n     the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms relating to the \n     arrest of Mr. Randy Weaver and others in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, \n     in August, 1992 and Mr. David Koresh and others associated \n     with the Branch Davidian sect in Waco, Texas, between \n     February 28, 1993, and April 19, 1993;\n       (7) Inquiries by the Executive Branch have left serious \n     unanswered questions on these incidents;\n       (8) The United States Senate has not conducted any hearings \n     on these incidents;\n       (9) There is public concern about allowing federal agencies \n     to investigate allegations of impropriety within their own \n     ranks without congressional oversight to assure \n     accountability at the highest levels of government;\n       (10) Notwithstanding an official censure of FBI Agent Larry \n     Potts on January 6, 1994, relating to his participation in \n     the Idaho incident, the Attorney General of the United States \n     on May 2, 1995, appointed Agent Potts to be Deputy Director \n     of the FBI;\n       (11) It is universally acknowledged that there can be no \n     possible justification for the Oklahoma City bombing \n     regardless of what happened at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, or Waco, \n     Texas;\n       (12) Ranking federal officials have supported hearings by \n     the U.S. Senate to dispel public rumors that the Oklahoma \n     City bombing was planned and carried out by federal law \n     enforcement officials;\n       (13) It has been represented, or at least widely rumored, \n     that the motivation for the Oklahoma City bombing may have \n     been related to the Waco incident, the dates falling exactly \n     two years apart; and\n       (14) A U.S. Senate hearing, or at least setting the date \n     for such a hearing, on Waco and Ruby Ridge would help to \n     restore public confidence that there will be full disclosure \n     of what happened, appropriate congressional oversight and \n     accountability at the highest levels of the federal \n     government.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that hearings should be held before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee on countering domestic terrorism in all possible \n     ways with a hearing on or before August 4, 1995, on actions \n     taken by federal law enforcement agencies in Ruby Ridge, \n     Idaho, and Waco, Texas.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do that, Mr. President, so that there may be a little \nmore lead time as to the completion of the investigation by the FBI. I \nmake that modification because of my discussion with the FBI Director \nthat, as he put it, 8 to 10 weeks would give ample latitude for that to \nbe completed. So I am prepared to move at that time. I think that it is \nimportant that a specific date be set so that there is an \nacknowledgement by the Senate that we do plan to move forward on a date \nand the date has been established.\n  I understand we are to vote at 6 o'clock, Mr. President. I yield the \nfloor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment, which is the Jeffords amendment, be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 754\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to table the Specter amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 754, offered by the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Specter]. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato], \nthe Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole], and the Senator from Virginia [Mr. \nWarner] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  [[Page S6501]] Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I just want to inform all my \ncolleagues--I do not need to take much time on this bill, but just a \nfew minutes--that I called for hearings last year. I have only been \nchairman for a little over 4 months.\n  Every Member knows the Judiciary Committee has had a lot on its \nplate, and we have a lot more on our plate. However, there are very few \nthings that I feel more deeply about than what happened at Waco and at \nRuby Ridge.\n  These are people in States that I admire and love. Many of the people \nI know--at least in Idaho. I admire and love them. I have said that we \nwill hold hearings on these important issues, and I will do so as \nexpeditiously as I can.\n  Everybody does know that to do it properly, we are going to have to \nspend some time investigating this. We are already in the process of \nthat. Recently, I lost my chief investigator who moved to another \noffice.\n  We will do this as expeditiously as we can. We will do it in the best \ninterests of the Senate. I want to tell my dear friend from \nPennsylvania that his desires here are not going to go ignored. It is \njust that I want to do it the right way. I want to make sure that all \nof the issues are aired and that they are aired fairly and in front of \nthe full committee, because no hearings could be held unless they are \nDepartment of Justice oversight hearings. That is what they will have \nto be.\n  I certainly committed the other day, and I will again reaffirm my \ncommitment that these hearings will be held. Therefore, there was no \nreason to have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I understand the \nsincerity of my colleagues. I hope that they will not feel badly with \nthis vote.\n  I also want to say that I am very concerned about making sure that \nevery available agent, every available leader of the FBI, every person \nin law enforcement that we can bring to bear on the Oklahoma situation, \nis out there doing that, rather than up here testifying on Capitol \nHill.\n  We want to get that solved, and I want it solved. I speak almost \ndaily with members of the Justice Department, including the FBI. We are \non top of this. We will do what has to be done here. I want to reaffirm \nthat to the Senate.\n  I think when we do it, it will be done right, and I think people will \nbe pleased with it in the end. I hope my colleague from Pennsylvania \nwill be particularly pleased with it and, as a distinguished member of \nthe committee, will have every opportunity to participate. And I expect \nhim to do so. In fact, I invite him to do so and will work with him to \nsee what we can do to bring this to a fruition that is satisfactory to \neverybody.\n  Having said that, I can say more. There are some things that have \nbeen very irritating to some of us with regard to what has gone on \nhere, but we will forget all that and just go forward and make the \ncommitment to do this as expeditiously as we can, in good faith and in \na good manner that hopefully will please everybody.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had, frankly, hoped to avoid the \nnecessity of a rollcall vote to spare my colleagues a vote on the \nmatter. But I felt, and continue to feel very, very strongly, that it \nis incumbent upon the U.S. Senate and the Congress to have oversight \nhearings in order to show the American people--a lot of people think \nthere has been a coverup on Ruby Ridge, ID, and Waco, TX--and to show \nthose people we are willing to air all of the matters, let the chips \nfall where they may, and demonstrate that people at the highest ranks \nof Government will be held accountable.\n  No one is second to Arlen Specter in concern that the FBI have a full \nopportunity to complete its investigation. I talked to Director Freeh, \nwho said if he had 8 to 10 weeks more there would be ample time and the \nFBI would be in a position to cooperate. And this is more than the 8 to \n10 weeks that Director Freeh asked for when the amendment was modified \nbeyond the June 30 date, to provide for a date of August 4.\n  I believe that the potential for violence is enormous. We have had a \nnumber of wake-up calls. And it is no coincidence that the Oklahoma \nCity bombing occurred on April 19, 2 years to the day after the \nincident at Waco, TX. If anything happens in the interim, if we have \nnot had the ventilation, the safety valve, then there is a real issue \nas to whether the U.S. Senate is doing its job.\n  We have a lot of hearings in the Judiciary Committee. We have a lot \nof hearings in other committees. And there is not a single hearing \nbeing held which is more important than to air the public concern about \nWaco and about Ruby Ridge. I have been conducting hearings in the \nSubcommittee on Terrorism; I finished the third one today. It is an \noverwhelming problem.\n  The first hearing which was scheduled became a full committee \nhearing, which I thought was entirely appropriate, to allow more \nSenators to participate. But what I intend to do is to continue my own \ninquiry and my own speaking out on the facts as to what happened. I \ntalked at length with Director Louis Freeh, and I have talked at length \nwith Mr. Spencer, who is the attorney for the Weavers, and I intend to \ntalk to the Weavers and I intend to review all the facts and to make \nperiodic reports to the American people about what I find. Because I \nthink it is totally inadequate to have an inquiry--a hearing sometime \nin the near future.\n  I felt strongly enough about it to bring the matter to the floor and \nI respect the conclusion of my fellow colleagues. But I intend to carry \non this inquiry myself and to make these periodic reports.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, while the Senator from Pennsylvania is on \nthe floor I want my colleagues to know that in the good old days, when \nI was chairman of the committee and the Democrats were in charge, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania shared the same view. I want the record to \nshow that this is nothing new the Senator from Pennsylvania is \nsuggesting. I have read some accounts that suggest that because the \nSenator from Pennsylvania may have other aspirations, this is \npropelling his interests. I want to vouch for the fact that I know that \nnot to be true.\n  The fact of the matter is that when Waco occurred, shortly after \nWaco, the Senator did repeatedly talk to me about it and thought that, \nalthough I believe that we did have oversight hearings and everybody \nhad an opportunity to ask about Waco--and a few did--that the Senator \nthought then, thinks now, and is totally consistent, whether he is \nseeking another office or not, in his view that this issue should be \nventilated.\n  For those of us on this side of the aisle, this has been a little \nlike watching a family quarrel. Both the Senators are my friends but I \ndo not think I have a closer friend in the Senate than the Senator from \nPennsylvania, and because a number of press people have come to me, and \nmy colleagues have come to me, to ask me about issues relating to \nmotivation--I can assert with absolute certainty, without any \nequivocation, that there has been absolutely no change in the intensity \nof the interest of the Senator from the time the matter occurred when I \nwas chairman of that committee to the time I am the ranking member of \nthat committee.\n  I just want that to be made clear, notwithstanding the fact I voted \nthe other way. I voted to table the Specter amendment because of my \nconsistent view as to how this should be handled.\n  The Senator may be right in terms of the value of the ventilation and \nwhen, and sooner than later. I have a slight disagreement with him on \nwhen. But I do not have any--any--any doubt, and I can confirm for my \ncolleagues and anyone who is listening, that there is an absolute, \ntotal, unequivocal consistency to his position on this from the moment \nthe tragedy in Waco occurred through this day.\n  I just want the record to reflect that. Not that anyone in particular \nhas suggested otherwise, but I get a number of inquiries because people \nare looking to make press outside this institution. I just want the \nrecord to reflect it.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  [[Page S6502]] Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I just want to bring this to \na head. I would like to put into the Record, just so everybody \nunderstands, a letter we received today from Louis J. Freeh, Director \nof the FBI, to me.\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your inquiry concerning my \n     views about congressional hearings on Waco and Ruby Ridge. I \n     have no hesitancy about testifying on the issue.\n\n  And that is the position he has always taken with me.\n\n       I have often stated that a full and open hearing will \n     provide an excellent forum for the Department of Justice and \n     the FBI to bring all the facts before the American public. It \n     undoubtedly would serve to debunk some of the ``conspiracy'' \n     theories being discussed and provide the FBI with an \n     opportunity to explain and distinguish our role in these \n     incidents as well as provide our views concerning the proper \n     role of federal law enforcement.\n       It is Congress' prerogative as to timing. It would be \n     helpful, however, to remove any hearing from such close \n     proximity to the Oklahoma bombing. All of our attention is \n     focused on this heinous crime as we continue to investigate \n     and prepare for prosecution. While I am looking forward to \n     the opportunity, I believe to schedule the hearing in the \n     immediate future will distract from our Oklahoma efforts and \n     could preclude us from discussion of issues relevant both to \n     Oklahoma and Waco.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Louis J. Freeh,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  I just want to put that in the Record because that is one of the \nthings that has caused me great concern. We will hold hearings and we \nwill do it in an expeditious and good way and hopefully to the \nsatisfaction of all concerned, including my friend from Pennsylvania.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your inquiry concerning my \n     views about congressional hearings on Waco and Ruby Ridge. I \n     have no hesitancy about testifying on the issue.\n       I have often stated that a full and open hearing will \n     provide an excellent forum for the Department of Justice and \n     the FBI to bring all the facts before the American public. It \n     undoubtedly would serve to debunk some of the ``conspiracy'' \n     theories being discussed and provide the FBI with an \n     opportunity to explain and distinguish our role in these \n     incidents as well as provide our views concerning the proper \n     role of federal law enforcement.\n       It is Congress' prerogative as to timing. It would be \n     helpful, however, to remove any hearing from such close \n     proximity to the Oklahoma bombing. All of our attention is \n     focused on this heinous crime as we continue to investigate \n     and prepare for prosecution. While I am looking forward to \n     the opportunity, I believe to schedule the hearing in the \n     immediate future will distract from our Oklahoma efforts and \n     could preclude us from discussion of issues relevant both to \n     Oklahoma and Waco.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Louis J. Freeh,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, just a word or two. The letter which \nSenator Hatch has just read is entirely consistent with the \nrepresentation I made earlier that I had talked to Director Louis Freeh \nthis afternoon, who told me, as I said earlier, that if he had 8 to 10 \nweeks that would be ample time. And that is why, as I had said earlier, \nI modified the amendment from the date of June 30 to August 4, which \nwould give more than the 8 to 10 weeks.\n  So, when Senator Hatch cites a letter about the immediate future, the \n8 to 10 weeks was accorded to the Director and the hearings could have \nbeen held within the timeframe of the resolution as framed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, for my colleagues I will just outline what \nin my judgment will take place this evening.\n  We will have a vote on the Jeffords amendment and I do not know how \nlong that will take. If the Senator could give us some indication, that \nwill be helpful.\n  But following the Jeffords amendment there will be no more rollcall \nvotes. However, tomorrow it is my belief we will have a series of \nrollcall votes. There will be a cloture vote at 10 o'clock and there \nwill be some other votes after that.\n  I would very much hope we could finish this bill tomorrow. I hope, \nwith the negotiations that take place tonight, we will be able to do \nso. But there will be no votes after the Jeffords vote.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 867, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have a modification of my amendment at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment.\n  The amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 867), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 64, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(f) State Solid Waste District Authority.--A solid waste \n     district or a political subdivision of a State may exercise \n     flow control authority for municipal solid waste and for \n     recyclable material voluntarily relinquished by the owner or \n     generator of the material that is generated within its \n     jurisdiction if--\n       ``(1) the solid waste district political subdivision or \n     municipality within said district is currently required to \n     initiate a recyclable materials recycling program in order to \n     meet a municipal solid waste reduction goal of at least 30 \n     percent by the year 2005, and uses revenues generated by the \n     exercise of flow control authority strictly to implement \n     programs to manage municipal solid waste, other than \n     development of incineration; and\n       ``(2) prior to May 15, 1994, the solid waste district \n     political subdivision or municipality within said district--\n       ``(A) was responsible under State law for the management \n     and regulation of the storage, collection, processing, and \n     disposal of solid wastes within its jurisdiction;\n       ``(B) was authorized by State statute (enacted prior to \n     January 1, 1992) to exercise flow control authority, and \n     subsequently adopted or sought to exercise the authority \n     through a law, ordinance, regulation, regulatory proceeding, \n     contract, franchise, or other legally binding provision; and\n       ``(C) was required by State statute (enacted prior to \n     January 1, 1992) to develop and implement a solid waste \n     management plan consistent with the State solid waste \n     management plan, and the district solid waste management plan \n     was approved by the appropriate State agency prior to \n     September 15, 1994.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if we could enter into a time agreement?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I had several people who asked to speak. I do not see \nthem present, but I think we could finish in 15 minutes on our side.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Would the Senator be willing to agree to 10 minutes on \nthat side and no more than 10 minutes on this side?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is agreeable to me.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Is there any objection to that agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I hope this amendment will not take very \nlong. I think it is a very sensible one. I will explain to my \ncolleagues what the amendment does, and I believe they will find it \nacceptable.\n  I understand the position of the chairman of the committee, who is \nreluctant to grant any exceptions to the bill because there would be \ntwo other exceptions. But to my knowledge the exceptions are that the \nState of Vermont and some municipalities in two other States have a \nsituation which I think this body would agree deserves an exception. \nLet me review very briefly what we are talking about here.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court handed down a decision which said the States \nthemselves had no right to be able to control the flow of solid waste, \nthat this has to be approved by the Federal Government because it was \nan interference with interstate commerce. That decision by the Supreme \nCourt created a serious problem for the State of Vermont and some \npolitical subdivisions in West Virginia and Michigan.\n  The purpose, and what we are trying to accomplish in this Nation with \nrespect to solid waste, is to do three things, basically. First of all, \nwe are trying to reduce the amount of solid waste that we have. Second, \nwe are trying to improve the ability to recycle and to build a system \nin this Nation which will recycle and, therefore, reduce the demand on \nresources and reduce costs. Third, to find an equitable way to do it \nlooking toward those that \n[[Page S6503]] create the problem to have to pay for it; that is, those \nwho create the trash ought to pay for it.\n  So Vermont, in view of these national purposes--and I was a member of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, and I know we were trying \nvery desperately to set standards for recycling to try to get this \ncountry to move up gradually. Vermont, in pursuant of that, passed a \nplan and program statewide that sets up districts for solid waste. In \nthese districts, the system is set up which allows for haulers to get a \ntipping fee in order to take care of the additional costs of recycling \nthe materials that were delivered to them. The only way it will work is \nif we have that ability. There is no other way they can do it other \nthan to require the State of Vermont to provide the tipping fees and to \ntake care of those people that are in those districts, and not others. \nAnd it would be very cumbersome. There are districts in West Virginia \nand Michigan that have a similar problem.\n  So all we are trying to do here is to make sure that this national \ngoal, which everyone agrees ought to be reached, can be reached by the \nState of Vermont, which is leading the way in this. Right now we have a \nsystem which is recycling 25 percent of our waste. This amendment is \nlimited and says that we might continue forward in pursuance of that \ngoal, and we may continue with our present system, and, if we reach the \ngoal, that we be permitted to do so. We have established a goal of 30 \npercent, which was the national goal which was in RCRA which was never \npassed.\n  Why should a State be penalized which has done what everyone in the \nNation believes should be done, and then to turn around in an amendment \nby the committee to try to help those who have made investments but \nlimit it to those on a temporary basis? In Vermont there are only two \nareas which qualify when the whole State is doing it. It makes no sense \nat all. I can understand the committee saying, if we give you an \nexception, then somebody else is going to come in for an exception.\n  I say if other communities have an exception like we do and like we \nare talking about which furthers the national goal, reduces waste, \ntakes care and improves recycling, then sure, maybe they ought to have \nthat. However, I do not know of any in that category.\n  So I would like to say that I hope the body will recognize that \npeople who are trying to do what is right in this country should not be \nforced to buy onto a bill which is attempting to help in this area but \njust by the nature of things makes it impossible for those who are \nreally leading out front doing what is in the national interest, and \nwho would be foreclosed, destroys their system, and makes it impossible \nfor the States to continue to pursue those goals.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to commend the Senators from \nVermont for the amendment that they have offered and to suggest, just \nas the junior Senator from Vermont has said, that this is an example of \nfederalism at its best. Vermont has some special concerns. It is a \nState with a very high level of environmental consciousness. It wants \nto be able to meet those needs in a manner that is appropriate to the \nspecific circumstances of that beautiful State.\n  Yesterday, I spoke at some length about some of the special concerns \nthat we have in our State of Florida, which are quite different from \nVermont. Vermont is a mountainous State. We are a State where anything \nabove 20 or 30 feet is considered to be a mountain. We have the very \nserious problem of our ground water supply and its vulnerability to \ncontamination and have used the mechanisms which require flow control \nin order to be able to support effective and appropriate landfills and \nother technologies to dispose of our solid waste while also diverting a \nsubstantial amount of our solid waste into a recycling stream.\n  My basic concern with this legislation is that it goes beyond what is \nrequired to meet the Supreme Court's directive. The Supreme Court, as \nquoted on page 8 of the committee report, in the words of Justice \nO'Connor, who stated:\n\n       It is within Congress' power to authorize local imposition \n     of flow control. Should Congress revisit this area and enact \n     legislation providing a clear indication that it intends * * \n     * States and localities to implement flow control, we will, \n     of course, defer to that legislative judgment.\n\n  So, clearly, the decision is within our hands. It reminds me of the \nold story of the callow youth who held a bird behind his back and asked \nthe wise, older man, ``Is the bird dead or alive?'' The wise man, with \nsolemn wisdom, opined, ``It is in your control.'' That is, the young \nman had the ability to open his hand and allow the bird to fly free or \nto crush the bird.\n  Well, we are somewhat in that same situation with the opinion of the \nSupreme Court. It is in our control to do, allowing States to have a \nwide range of options as to how to deal with this issue, or to narrowly \nconstrain.\n  This is particularly focused on the question of whether there should \nbe prospective operations for States. Should States be allowed in the \nfuture to utilize this important technique as a means of achieving the \nbroader end result of public health and environmental sensitivity as \nthat State and its local communities find to be most appropriate for \ntheir particular set of circumstances?\n  In an era in which we are applauding federalism, or seriously \nconsidering reversing a half century of the consolidation of power by \nallowing States and local communities to have more control over issues \nsuch as health care financing, welfare, child care programs, it seems \npeculiar and strange in an area that has been as historically local as \nany in our Nation's history, the disposition of garbage, that we would \nnow be nationalizing that issue.\n  So I join the Senator from Vermont. I applaud his creativity in \ncrafting this amendment and hope that we will be wise enough to allow \nVermont to take this initiative for the protection of that beautiful \nState and as a statement of our own sensitivity to the tremendous \ndiversity in America and its desire to let the creativity of the local \ncommunities operate to the benefit of their local citizens.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, why are we here? We are here because of a \nSupreme Court decision a year ago, just a year ago, in the so-called \nCarbone case. So currently, the law of the land is that there cannot be \nthese restrictive agreements that limit the delivery of municipal solid \nwaste to one specific point. In other words, there cannot be what is \nknown as flow control.\n  Now in our committee, we recognized that many communities across the \nStates had made very, very substantial financial contributions or \ncommitments to incinerators and to landfills, and they would be placed \nin a very difficult position if so-called flow control did not exist, \nif they were not able to tie up the entire waste from the community to \ngo to a central point.\n  But we said we are going to limit this. We are going to limit it to \nthe situations where they have problems arising from debt commitment, \nfrom bonded indebtedness, or that they already had flow control on \ntheir books and were used to functioning in that fashion.\n  In the Vermont situation, we have taken care of those communities \nwhere there is a commitment into a solid waste facility or--and they do \nnot have incinerators for Vermont--to a landfill. They are taken care \nof.\n  But the Senator is stressing that, absent us giving an exception to \nthe situation that exists in Vermont, Vermont will not be able to \ncontinue the excellent record it has had in connection with recycling. \nBut, Mr. President, I do not think that necessarily follows. Who knows \nthat recycling will fail because they do not have flow control?\n  Indeed, here is a report from the Office of Solid Waste in the EPA. \nThe report is dated March 1995, 2 months ago. This is what the report \nsays. There was a question.\n\n       Identify the impact of flow control on the development of \n     State and local waste management capacity and on the \n     achievement of State and local goals for source reduction, \n     reuse, and recycling.\n\n  In other words, what flow control does for recycling. We are all for \nrecycling. The conclusion is as follows, on page ES-5.\n\n       [[Page S6504]] There is no data showing that flow controls \n     are essential either for the development of new solid waste \n     capacity or for the long term achievement of State and local \n     goals for source reduction, reuse and recycling.\n\n  So the Senator's point, it seems to me from the study that has taken \nplace here, just is not valid. He may feel strongly about it, and they \nhave had considerable success in Vermont--although I suspect there are \nother communities across the Nation in States that have done extremely \nwell likewise--but, at least from the data we have here, there is not a \nconnection between having flow control and having a better recycling \nrecord.\n  But then we get back to the other point. Why did the Supreme Court \ndecide the way it did? The Supreme Court decided the way it did because \nof the commerce clause.\n  And what does the commerce clause do? It says that it is good for the \nNation to have competition, to permit commerce to flow. And that is \nexactly what flow control does not do.\n  Now, you might say, well, I argued earlier today for a situation \nwhere we had flow control. That is right. We did it, as I say, in those \ninstances where a community made a commitment and was still involved \nwith that commitment. But the overall thrust of this legislation is to \ntake care of those specific situations that arose where the communities \nwere harmed, financially harmed, as a result of the Carbone decision.\n  But we said, enough is enough. No matter how long the indebtedness \nis, no matter what the particular situation as far as bonded \nindebtedness, at the end of 30 years this privilege that we have given \nthese communities to go against the commerce clause ends.\n  And so, Mr. President, for that reason, I strongly believe that the \nproposition from the State of Vermont, as advanced so ably by the \njunior Senator, is not valid in this particular situation\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, let me answer the arguments that have \nbeen put forth by my good friend from Rhode Island. I think if you \nexamine our situation, it does not in any way fly in the face or raise \nany concerns.\n  The question is: Is our system working? It is. It is reducing waste, \nit is bringing about recycling, and most importantly, it does allow \ncompetition. There is competition among the haulers. The only thing is, \nevery hauler has to pay the tipping fee. But there is no problem. We \nhave haulers that are bidding on it. We have put contracts out for bid. \nThere is no problem with any interference with competition.\n  Now, what the Supreme Court said was that the Federal Government can \nallow this, they just have to do it because a State cannot do it under \nthe commerce clause without the authority of the Federal Government.\n  All we are asking for is a simple exception for a system that is \nworking well. And there is no way it will work in rural areas unless \nyou can have tipping fees; that is, getting the people in the areas \nsharing the cost of this to have a way to participate, in other words, \nin order to get the haulers to come in.\n  So I think this is a perfect example of what happens when Congress \ngets to look at a problem and gets carried away with some study done by \nEPA which is irrelevant to the situation and tramples on States rights \nto do what is right for the Nation and right for Vermont.\n  I understand--and this is the basic problem--that my colleagues are \nafraid of opening this bill up for exceptions. Well, if anybody can \ncome with an exception as we have, fine. But I do not think you will \nfind anybody.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am happy to yield to my good friend from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I just ask for a moment to associate myself with the remarks of the \nSenator from Vermont, as well as the other Senator from Vermont, \nSenator Leahy.\n  Obviously, Vermont has had a very good experience with flow control. \nIt has been able to promote programs for recycling and disposal of \nhousehold hazardous waste. This amendment recognizes that fact and \naddress the issue of flow control as it pertains to these Vermont \nprograms. It recognizes that Vermont may be unique in this regard and \ngives that state the opportunity to continue to make those programs \nwork.\n  That is all we are saying with this amendment. Let us give Vermont a \nlittle more flexibility. Let us defer to that State with regard to flow \ncontrol, if it is going to be able to respond to this issue \neffectively.\n  So I applaud the Senator's amendment. I certainly hope that our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will support it.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield to the Senator whatever time I have remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I encourage Senators to not support this \namendment, very simply because the committee has worked long and hard \nto try to find a balance here, to balance out interests of those \ncommunities on the one hand that want to have the right to control the \nflow of trash, garbage, dedicated facilities in their communities, and, \non the other hand, the rights of companies, entrepreneurs, to ship \ntrash to whatever location seems to make the most sense to let the free \nmarket work. It is a classic battle between those who want to control \nby statute and law in the market on the one hand, and those, on the \nother hand, who want total free market.\n  As is always the case, the right answer is somewhere in between. The \nsolution crafted by the committee, we think, is a good solution in \nbetween.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, if the amendment offered by the Senator from \nVermont were to pass, I believe we are going to start to find this \ncompromise begin to unravel, and it would, therefore, very strongly \njeopardize this bill.\n  If this bill does not pass, then we are not going to be able to have \nany kind of flow control because of the Carbone decision. At the same \ntime, States will not be able to limit out-of-State trash coming into \ntheir State because of another Supreme Court decision.\n  So I urge Senators to vote against the Jeffords amendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, is the Senator ready to conclude debate on \nthis?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Senator Leahy wishes to speak.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will support the \nJeffords-Leahy amendment. If you defeat this amendment, you help nobody \nin the country, but you hurt one State, the State of Vermont. This \nsimply says that Vermont, provided we want to operate beyond what may \nbe required under Federal laws, would be allowed to do so; that if we \nwant to set up a procedure that fulfills everything that the Federal \nlaw might require but does even better but fits our small very special \nState, that we be allowed to do so.\n  Basically, we are saying to every Member of the Senate who has given \nspeeches over the last year that States can design programs better, we \nagree and let us do that. We are making sure that we violate no Federal \nlaw, that we have followed every Federal rule, but we be allowed to \ndesign something that fits our State.\n  Every single Senator, I am willing to wager, Mr. President, in this \nbody, has given a speech saying, ``If we can do it better, allow us to \ndo it, allow us to design it.''\n  Basically what the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] and I are \nsaying is that is what we want to do. So let us adopt this. This is no \ndifferent than taking care of a unique situation for Alabama yesterday \nin the product liability bill. This takes care of Vermont. It hurts \nnobody, but it helps us.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Vermont. Let me \nadvise the Senator, time has expired.\n  [[Page S6505]] Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I have some time remaining; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, the Senator has 3 minutes 7 \nseconds.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will just use a couple minutes of that.\n  Mr. President, there are a couple of points I briefly want to make. \nThe present situation is that it is against the Constitution of the \nUnited States to do what Vermont is suggesting. So what we have done is \nwe have crafted an amendment which will help Vermont and all the other \nStates in the Nation that have made these financial commitments, but it \nstill says when all is said and done, that they cannot go against the \nConstitution in these other areas.\n  It is not correct to say that this is just a little something for \nVermont. If this is adopted, there is no way in the world that we could \nkeep flow control from being adopted universally across the Nation, \nbecause the Vermont case is what you might call a weak case.\n  So, Mr. President, if this amendment is adopted, then, I suspect, the \nwhole effort to deal with this goes down the tube and then there will \nbe no exceptions to the Constitution as provided.\n  So I am going to move to table the amendment, and I very much hope my \ncolleagues will join with me.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and move to \ntable the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 867, as modified. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, President Clinton is now in Ukraine. I \nsupport his decision to visit Kiev. Economic and political reform in \nUkraine are proceeding very well. There is strong bipartisan support \nfor United States assistance to Ukraine. It is in the American national \ninterest to strengthen our relations with Ukraine. I hope the President \nhas a successful and productive summit with President Kuchman.\n  The report cards are now being filed on the Moscow Summit. As I said \nyesterday, I was disappointed at the lack of progress on the two key \nsummit issues: Nuclear sales to Iran and the conflict in Chechnya. It \nseems pretty clear the American agenda at this summit did not fare \nwell. My staff spoke to State Department and National Security Council \nofficials yesterday afternoon. The White House provided my office with \ncopies of all the joint statements from the Moscow Summit. To conclude \nthat the summit made little progress in advancing American interests is \nnot politics, and it is not partisan. It is simply a review of the \nfacts.\n  On Iran, Russia did not agree to cancel its sale of nuclear reactors \nto Iran. If President Yeltsin cannot make the decision to stop the \nsale, I do not have great confidence that it will be made later at a \nlower level. With respect to the much-publicized concession on not \nselling advanced gas centrifuge technology, it seems clear this was \nfloated as a bargaining chip. As recently as last Friday, I note the \nWashington Post headline: ``Russia denies plan to sell gas centrifuge \nto Iran.'' It seems this was a plan designed to be a concession from \nthe start.\n  Just last week, when asked if a halt in the gas centrifuge sale would \nbe enough, Secretary of State Christopher said, ``not at all. We would \nnot be satisfied with that''. I agree with the Secretary's assessment. \nWe should not be satisfied. The bottom line is Russia still intends to \nproceed with a sale of nuclear technology to the outlaw regime in \nTehran. This flies in the face of the summit's joint statement on \nproliferation which pledges ``To work together closely to promote broad \nnon-proliferation goals.''\n  On Chechnya, President Yeltsin rejected any effort to address the \nlegitimate concerns of the international community over human rights \nviolations. In President Yeltsin's statement about Chechnya, there is \nan unfortunate ring of former soviet leaders rejecting western concerns \nover human rights as meddling. And whatever the political leaders were \nsaying in Moscow, the Russian army kept attacking. Literally within \nminutes of yesterday's press conference, Russian helicopters attacked \nChechen civilian targets.\n  The situation in Chechnya also raises the issue of the flank limits \nin the Conventional Forces in Europe\n [CFE] Treaty. In the fall, if Russian forces are still in Chechnya, \nthe Russian Government will be in violation of these flank limits. The \nMoscow summit did not result in any assurances of Russian compliance \nwith the CFE limits.\n\n  On missile defenses, the administration continued down the same path \nof seeking Russian permission on the deployment of theater missile \ndefenses--despite the fact that Russian insistence on providing nuclear \ntechnology to Iran increases the proliferation threat. The fact is that \ntheater missile defenses are not prohibited by the cold-war era ABM \nTreaty. Moreover, the United States must not allow Russia to have a \nveto over matters of national security.\n  The summit also failed in what was not on the agenda--namely, Bosnia. \nAs the two Presidents were meeting, Sarajevo was being heavily shelled. \nThere was no U.N. response, no NATO response, and no summit response.\n  [[Page S6506]] It is true that Russia agreed to join the partnership \nfor peace at this summit--as they previously agreed to do last year, \nbefore abruptly changing their minds at the OSCE summit in Budapest. At \nthis summit, Russia continued to express strong opposition to the \nexpansion of NATO.\n  Mr. President, summit diplomacy has a long and distinguished history. \nHistorically, summits have succeeded when the parties had clear \nagendas, pursued their interests consistently, and were ready, willing, \nand able to meet each others' concerns. And if agreement is not \nreached, history shows it is better to state the disagreements clearly \nrather than paper them over. In the case of the Moscow summit, it is \nclear that President Yeltsin was not in a position to address our \nconcerns. We should admit that forthrightly and respond appropriately. \nCongress will respond by looking closely at all forms of aid to \nRussia--especially aid to the government. Certain types of aid such as \ndemocracy support, or Nunn-Lugar funding for nuclear clean up still \npromote important American interests. Other aid programs may not, and \nmay be halted.\n  The United States must remain engaged with Russia. It was and is our \nhope that democracy and free market reforms will prosper. We hope that \nthe Russian elections planned for this year and next year proceed on \ntime--and that they are free and fair. But Russia is not our only \nstrategic relationship--we have other interests in other areas. That is \nwhy I support the President's decision to visit Ukraine. That is why \nNATO expansion should not be subject to a Russian veto. And that is why \nwe cannot allow Iran to become a nuclear weapons state.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/11/senate-section/article/S6505-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

This outrageous debt (which will become the debt of \nour children and grandchildren) averages out to $18,436.37 on a per \ncapita basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/11/senate-section/article/S6506-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PRESERVING MEDICARE FOR OUR SENIORS\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Medicare \nProgram and the need to protect it from drastic cuts. The Republicans \nhave announced their plans to cut the Medicare budget by over $250 \nbillion in order to fund tax cuts for the rich.\n  Let me start by saying that I want to make sure that we keep the care \nin Medicare. I believe that the basic values of honoring your father \nand your mother should be the anchors of our public policy.\n  I do not believe our seniors should have to pay almost $900 more in \nout of pocket health care costs each year. I do not believe that the \ntypical Medicare beneficiary should have to see 40 to 50 percent of his \nor her Social Security cost-of-living adjustment eaten up by increases \nin Medicare cost sharing and premiums.\n  We cannot let this happen. We owe it to our mothers and fathers, and \nto our family members.\n  Last week I spoke at the White House Conference on Aging. It was an \nimpressive gathering of 2,500 seniors and senior advocates from all \nover this Nation. Many of the delegates were current or former doctors, \nlawyers, administrators, business owners, nurses, social workers, \ngerontologists, and senior service providers.\n  The delegates were charged with coming up with a navigational chart \nto meet the needs of our seniors today and to take us into the 21st \ncentury.\n  The White House Conference on Aging came at a very crucial time in \nour history. We all know that our senior population is growing and \ngrowing rapidly. Demography is destiny. We must anticipate the future \nand what their needs are and what they will be.\n  At the end of the conference, the delegates voted on priorities. \nEnsuring the future of the Medicare Program was one of the top five\n priorities. More specifically, the conference stated that the United \nStates should:\n\n       . . . reaffirm the covenant that it established with the \n     American people 30 years ago with the enactment of Medicare \n     and act to maintain and strengthen the program's structure \n     and purpose, its fiscal solvency, and widespread public \n     support.\n       . . . continue to protect older Americans and disabled \n     Americans, especially those on low and fixed incomes with \n     respect to health care affordability and access, giving \n     special consideration to the burdens imposed by co-payments, \n     deductibles, and premiums.\n       . . . ensure that programmatic changes safeguard the \n     viability of the Medicare trust funds.\n       . . . ensure that any changes to Medicare provide access to \n     a standard package of benefits which includes affordable long \n     term care, strengthens the program's financial well-being, \n     preserves the social insurance nature of Medicare, enhances \n     the quality of care and improves the program for \n     beneficiaries within the broad context of health care reform\n\n  There is much talk about another contract with America, but I believe \nthe real contracts we must honor are Medicare and Social Security. We \nmust preserve the covenant that we established with our seniors and \ntheir families to provide them with health insurance for their old age. \nSeniors have worked hard all their lives, paid their dues, paid into \nthe system.\n  We must remember who are seniors are. On May 8, we commemorated \nvictory in Europe and the beginning of the end of World War II. Our \nseniors were part of the generation that saved Europe from tyranny and \nchanged the course of history. We must never forget that.\n  We cannot forget them and we cannot forget who will be the next \ngeneration of seniors. They will be many of us. And the next generation \nafter that. They will be our children and grandchildren. We must \ncontinue to ensure that all seniors now and into the next century have \nthe resources they need for their health care. Without such resources I \nfear they will become impoverished, their children may become \nimpoverished, and we as a country will become impoverished.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/11/senate-section/article/S6506-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6506-S6507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   THE 45TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE ON CIVIL RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, in recognition of the 45th anniversary of \nthe Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, I believe it is appropriate \nto reflect upon this country's history on the issue of civil rights and \nexpress some thoughts about the direction the country is heading today.\n  In 1950, when the Leadership Conference was first formed, we \nessentially had a system of racial apartheid in many parts of the \ncountry. It was illegal for black and white children to attend school \ntogether, it was illegal for black and white adults to marry. Black \nAmericans were shut out of the political system--they were not \npermitted to serve on juries, run for office, or, in many cases, cast a \nballot. There was no meaningful equal protection of the laws, \nespecially the criminal laws. Blacks who dared to assert their \npolitical rights or buck the mores of the racial caste system, were \nbeaten or lynched. The police and formal legal system always looked the \nother way. Blacks could not receive a fair trial in a court of law as \nracial prejudice clouded the normal American presumption that justice \nis blind.\n  Through Federal court litigation, and eventually legislative action \nby the U.S. Congress, many of these barriers were cast aside, the \nchains of Jim Crow were unlocked, and the Constitution's promise of \nequal opportunity began to become a reality. As the decades passed and \nprogress was made on many fronts, other groups of American citizens--\nwomen, racial minorities, religious groups, and the physically \ndisabled, to name a few--rose to assert the rights that accrue with \nAmerican citizenship. Their claims have been simple, clear, and \npowerful: treat us \n[[Page S6507]] like everyone else in society is treated, give us the \nopportunities to succeed that other Americans are given as a matter of \nbirthright, let us participate in the mainstream of American life.\n  So we have made progress. When in the past Jackie Robinson was spit \nupon and received death threats over the phone, today Michael Jordan \ncan give genuine happiness to millions of Americans, of all creeds and \ncolors, merely by deciding to trade in his baseball cleats for a pair \nof sneakers. When one of our country's greatest institutions, the U.S. \nArmy, once had to be desegregated by Presidential decree, in modern \ntimes Colin Powell rose to lead that institution and now is one of our \nmost popular public figures. When minorities were once threatened and \nintimidated from exercising the franchise, now hundreds of minorities \nhold public office throughout the country and dozens of minority \nlegislators sit here in the U.S. Congress.\n  The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights has been at the forefront \nof this march of progress. The principles of equality, inclusion, and \ntolerance that it promotes are reflected in the structure of the \norganization, as it is comprised of 180 different groups representing \npeople from all walks of life, all shades of skin color, and all \ndenominations and ethnicities. The legislative achievements of the \nconference are monumental--not only for the importance of the bills on \nAmerican life, but for the bipartisan support that they achieved. The \nVoting Rights Act Amendments of 1982, the Americans With Disabilities \nAct, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act are but a few of the \nconference's noteworthy achievements.\n  But one cannot look back fondly at successes without also thinking \nabout our past shortcomings as well. Here we stand, a generation after \nthe civil rights revolution, and we must ask how history will judge us. \nHave we done all we could to make our society more just, opportunities \nmore available, tolerance and understanding more pervasive, violence \nless prevalent? Have poverty, intolerance, and ignorance been \nmarginalized or have our actions or omissions led to the \nmarginalizations of the poor, the uneducated, and others occupying the \nbottom rung of society?\n  Any honest appraisal must conclude that our record is mixed. Progress \nhas been made in many areas, but we are going backward in others. Our \nproblems were once simple and clear issues of equal justice that could \nbe solved merely by changing the law. Our current problems now bear on \ncomplex social conditions that few can explain and even fewer know how \nto solve.\n  There is also new unrest in the country that is manifesting itself in \nugly ways. Extremists seek to place at odds peoples and communities \nthat have been traditional and genuine allies. The ethos of tolerance, \ndialog, and reconciliation are being subverted by those who, appealing \nto baser instincts, seek to balkanize America. And remarkably, there \nare those who now want to move to a color-blind society, based on the \nmake-believe view that racism and intolerance are things of the past \nand that our centuries of overt discrimination have had absolutely no \nbearing on the current condition of the least fortunate members of \nsociety. It is as if many believe that the Emancipation Proclamation \nand Civil Rights Acts were written at the time of the Magna Carta and \nthe beating of Rodney King happened centuries, not just years, ago.\n  But rather than be discouraged in the face of our failures, and \nlament about the difficult challenges ahead, we must find hope in the \nprogress that has been made and summon the resolve to redouble our \nefforts to remake our society to bring us closer to the ideals we hold \ndear. The work of the Leadership Conference is not done. We are a \nbetter society as a result of its 45 years of dedication to equality \nand we will be a better society due to its work in the future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/11/senate-section/article/S6506-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6507-S6508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF V-E DAY\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, on August 19, 1944, Parisians rose up in \ndefiance of their German occupiers as Hitler ordered his army to \ndestroy the city. His generals, however, delayed the order, and \nAmerican and Free French Forces liberated Paris on August 25. \nMeanwhile, General Patton was racing eastward toward the German border \nand Rhine River. To the north, British Forces led by Field Marshall \nMontgomery swept into Belgium and captured Antwerp on September 4. On \nSeptember 17, about 20,000 paratroopers dropped behind German lines to \nseize bridges in the Netherlands. But bad weather and other problems \nhampered the operation.\n  Adolf Hitler pulled his failing resources together for another \nassault. On December 16, 1944, German troops surprised and overwhelmed \nthe Americans in Belgium and Luxembourg, but they lacked the troops and \nfuel to turn their thrust into a breakthrough. Within 2 weeks, the \nAmericans stopped the German advance near Belgium's Meuse River. This \noffensive in the Ardennes Forest of Belgium and Luxembourg became known \nas the ``Battle of the Bulge,'' because of the bulging shape of the \nbattleground as it appeared on a map. It was to be among the war's most \nbloody battles. Although Hitler's men knew they were beaten, it became \nclear that complete victory over Germany would have to wait until 1945.\n  Soviet Forces entered Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria in January 1945. \nThe Germans had pulled out of Greece and Yugoslavia in the fall of \n1944, But held out in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, until February \n1945. Vienna fell to Soviet troops in April. By then, Soviet troops \noccupied nearly all of Eastern Europe, a sign of victory then, but, in \nretrospect, also an ominous harbinger of the nature of the post-World \nWar II world.\n  The Allies began their final assault on Germany in early 1945. Soviet \nsoldiers reached the Oder River, about 40 miles from Berlin, in \nJanuary. Forces in the West occupied positions along the Rhine by early \nMarch. British and Canadian Forces cleared the Germans out of the \nNetherlands and swept into northern Germany as the Americans and French \nraced toward the Elbe River in central Germany. Hitler ordered his \nsoldiers to fight to the death, but large numbers surrendered each day.\n  The capture of Berlin was left to the Soviets. By April 25, 1945, \nthey had surrounded the city. From a bunker deep underground, Hitler \nordered German soldiers to fight on. On April 30, he committed suicide. \nHe remained convinced that his cause had been right, but that the \nGerman people had ultimately proven weak and unworthy of his rule.\n  Grand Adm. Karl Doenitz briefly succeeded Hitler as the leader of \nGermany, almost immediately arranging for Germany's surrender. On May \n7, 1945, Col. Gen. Alfred Jodl, Chief of Staff of the German Armed \nForces, signed a statement of unconditional surrender at General \nEisenhower's headquarters in France. World War II in Europe had, at \nlast, come to an end. Fifty years ago, the Allies declared May 8 ``V-E \nDay''--Victory in Europe Day. America could now concentrate all of its \nstrength toward the battle still being waged in the Pacific, which \nwould last for 3 more months.\n  Today, the world celebrates a victory that represented the triumph of \ngood over unspeakable evil, and the promise of a peaceful future for a \nEurope battered and torn by the bloodiest war in its history. May 8 is \nparticularly special this year, since it marks the 50th anniversary of \nthe end of the European chapter of World War II.\n  As the Allies had advanced in Europe, they discovered the horrifying \nremnants of the Nazis' ``final solution.'' Hitler had ordered the \nimprisonment of Jews and members of other minority groups in \nconcentration camps. The starving survivors of the death camps gave \nproof of the terrible suffering of those who had already died.\n  Today, we are familiar with those faces and pictures of death and \ndestruction, but that familiarity has not led to understanding in many \ncases. We have the Holocaust Memorial Museum as a reminder of the past \nand as a warning to future generations of the grave dangers that are \nthe ultimate fruits of hate, division, depravity. Victory in Europe \nDay, then, is also a time to reflect and to ask ourselves how such \nbrutality could have been inflicted on the human race, and how it can \nbe prevented from ever occurring again.\n  Hitler's rise to power was based upon a message of hate, of pitting \none class \n[[Page S6508]] against another, of demonizing Jews and others. His was \na message of division, of blaming others for one's problems. During the \nearly 1930's, Hitler instituted a policy of elimination of political \nopponents, of ``enemies of the state.'' According to the statutes of \nthe security police, Jews, politically active churches, Freemasons, \npolitically dissatisfied people, members of the Black Front, and \neconomic manipulators, among others, were singled out for persecution.\n  Hitler set down his political goals in his notorious book, ``Mein \nKampf.'' His foreign policy plans revolved around the central aim of \nexterminating the Jews as the mortal enemy of the Aryan race. During \nthe first stage, following the seizure of power, the ``cancerous \ndemocracy,'' as he called it, was to be abolished, and Jews, \nBolsheviks, and Marxists were to be banished from the national \ncommunity. Following the internal consolidation of the\n Reich, the German position in central Europe was to be secured step by \nstep and then strengthened into world dominance.\n\n  While Hitler had fought the existing government aggressively prior to \nhis imprisonment for high treason, during which he wrote ``Mein \nKampf,'' he adopted a new tactic after his early release from jail. \nPower was to be won slowly and legally as he systematically and \nmethodically built up the Nazi empire. He used the Reichstag fire of \nFebruary 27, 1933, as an opportunity to replace the constitutional laws \nof the Weimar Republic by passing an emergency decree ``to protect the \npeople and the state.'' This marked the beginning of the hounding and \narresting of political opponents, especially those on the left. The \npublic was subjected to propaganda on a grand scale, instructed ``to \nthink nothing but German, to feel German, and to behave German.'' \nGermans were also placed under heavy surveillance by the police and \nsecret agents.\n  Hitler was able to create the Nazi state by fanning the flames of \nparanoia, distrust, and fear. By making the Jews and others ``faceless \nrats'' devoid of humanity, he was able to make his henchmen commit acts \nwhich shock and offend our sensibilities as human beings. He was \nsuccessful in making these groups scapegoats responsible for all of \nGermany's economic and social ills. Just as some today try to divide, \ndemonize, and scapegoat, Hitler managed to unite his people through \ntheir hatred of common enemies.\n  Too often today, the solution to our problems seems to be to blame \nsomeone else--the poor, minorities, immigrants, and bureaucrats. The \npolitics of blame is a basic tactic of those who preach intolerance and \ndivision, whether on the left or right. Hitler was perhaps history's \nmost terrible and tragic example of what can result when the politics \nof blame and hate are allowed to fester and grow. Too often, people \nattempt to glorify themselves by tearing down those with whom they \ndisagree and by pitting one group against another. We need a return to \nmoderation, tolerance, responsibility, and compassion so that nothing \napproaching the Holocaust and the hatred which fostered it will ever be \nallowed to again scar humanity in such a way.\n  It is appropriate to take the time to not only celebrate V-E Day and \nreflect upon the roots of what led to World War II, but to also \nremember the selfless heroism of the 15 million Americans and the \nmillions of other Allied servicemen who fought valiantly to preserve \nthe democratic ideals that we so cherish. All risked their lives, and, \nsadly, some 407,000 Americans gave their lives to defend those ideals \nand the individual freedom and human rights upon which they are based.\n  Fifty years after V-E Day, the light of history has shone brightly on \nthe complex and harrowing events of World War II. Much of what has been \nrevealed makes us shudder, and we would just as soon it not be \nilluminated. But only by looking can we learn, and as each year passes, \nwe realize more fully just how much we owe our veterans for their \npatriotism, bravery, and sacrifice in serving on the battlefields of \nEurope during World War II.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/11/senate-section/article/S6507-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    JENA BAND OF THE CHOCTAW INDIANS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, over 90 years ago, a small poverty \nridden community of Choctaw Indians who lived in the area around Jena, \nLA, walked for 9 months from their homes to Muskogee, OK, to testify \nbefore the Dawes Commission. Although that commission determined that \nthe Jena Band were full-blooded native American Indians, entitled to \nland and services, lands were not yet ready for allotment. \nConsequently, the Jena Band returned to Louisiana empty-handed. Soon \nthereafter they were told by letter that they could claim such lands \nand benefits--but only if they returned to Oklahoma within 4\\1/2\\ \nmonths. This was impossible for them, they did not return, and \ntherefore received no land or benefits to which they were rightfully \nentitled.\n  This story of promised benefits, land, and services has been repeated \nthroughout the last 90 years. Each time the Jena Band has come close to \nreceiving the recognition they deserve, some additional obstacle has \nbeen thrown in their way. Yet, despite this long history of broken \npromises and neglect the Jena have maintained their identity, their \ndignity, and their hope that the Federal Government will at long last \nlive up to the commitments made to them so long ago in Muskogee.\n  On May 18, 1995, the Jena Band will finally celebrate the arrival of \njustice as the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs at the Department \nof the Interior, Ada Deer, signs the documents establishing a \ngovernment-to-government relationship between the United States of \nAmerica and the Jena Band of the Choctaw.\n  Mr. President, I have known the Jena through their chief, Jerry \nJackson, as we have struggled together for many years to gain their \nrightful recognition. The Jena are proud of there heritage and of their \ncommunity. I look forward to seeing the strengthening of their tribe \nand their cooperation with the surrounding communities in the years to \ncome, and I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating this long-\nawaited event.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/11/senate-section/article/S6508-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6508-S6509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            CARE ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, during this year 1995 we are commemorating \nmany anniversaries of the last days of World War II--of terrible \nbattles, of the liberation of concentration camps with their \nunspeakable crimes against humanity, and of the final victories--but I \nrise today to congratulate one of the great humanitarian organizations \nthat was born in the ashes of that great war.\n  CARE begins the celebration of its 50th year today, on the \nanniversary of the day when the first CARE package arrived in France. A \ncoalition of organizations and individual Americans founded CARE--the \nCooperative for American Remittances to Europe--on November 27, 1945, \nand the first CARE package was received in France on the following May \n11. They set out to create a large and efficient distribution network, \nbecause they knew the huge scope of the needs in a Europe devastated by \na long and destructive war.\n  That package was the beginning of the largest person-to-person relief \neffort of this century--perhaps of any century. Millions of Americans \nsent more than 100 million CARE packages of food, clothing, medicine, \nand other relief supplies to war survivors in desperate need. CARE \npackages provided the first food some Holocaust victims received after \nbeing released from the camps. Later, CARE packages brought West \nBerliners their first food after the 1949 blockade.\n  CARE was a unique American phenomenon--highly individual, extremely \ngenerous, idealistic and--against all odds--tremendously successful. \nGermans, Italians, and Japanese remember how stunned they were to \nreceive gifts from people with whom they had been at war only a few \nmonths before. CARE packages not only eased the suffering of survivors \ntrying to rebuild their lives and their countries, but helped to build \nthe bridges between former enemies that made possible a more lasting \npeace.\n  Every single American President has been involved in the relief \neffort since President Harry Truman who sent the first 100 CARE \npackages to the bombed-out town of Le Havre, France. American cities \nand towns had CARE package drives, businesses put up displays \nencouraging people to send CARE packages, Hollywood stars, including \nBob Hope, Gregory Peck, Marlene Deitrich, Lauren Bacall, and Ingrid \nBergman, joined in the effort that \n[[Page S6509]] would make the CARE package a part of our language and \nhistory.\n  As Europe and Asia recovered from World War II, CARE adopted a new \nname--the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief\n Everywhere--and a new mission: to help the poorest of the world's \npoor.\n\n  Today CARE helps 30 million people in more than 60 developing \ncountries each year to improve their lives through comprehensive \ndisaster relief programs as well as assistance for long-term, \nsustainable development projects in agriculture, the environment, \nhealth, nutrition, population, and small business. In the years since \nthat first package, CARE packages have helped more than 1 billion \npeople in 121 countries around the world, sending more than $7 billion \nworth of assistance. The countries Americans helped 50 years ago have \nbecome our political and economic partners and many are now partners as \nwell in providing CARE packages to others in need. CARE has 11 \ninternational offices in Europe and Japan, and has twice been nominated \nfor a Nobel Prize.\n  The plain brown boxes stamped CARE have been a symbol of the best \nAmerican spirit of generosity and hope to a hurting world for half a \ncentury. I am proud that CARE now is headquartered in Atlanta, GA, and \nproud of the wonderful work it has done throughout the world.

A bill to provide for the modification or elimination of \nFederal reporting requirements; read the first time.\n\n\n               FEDERAL REPORTS ELIMINATION AND SUNSET ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Levin and myself, I'm \npleased to introduce the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of \n1995. This legislation would terminate or modify the statutory \nrequirement for over 200 mandatory reports to Congress, and sunset most \nother mandatory reports after 4 years. This legislation would also \nrequire the President to identify which reports he feels are \nunnecessary or wasteful in his next budget submission of Congress, \nwhich will hopefully spur Congress to swiftly dispose of those specific \nreports.\n  This legislation is a combination of two separate bills that Senator \nLevin and I have previously introduced, both of which were passed by \nthe Senate as amendments to S. 244, The Paperwork Reduction Act. The \nintent of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act is to end the \nneedless expense of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars each year \non many Federal reports that are of minor value to the Congress and our \nconstituents.\n  Mr. President, by passing this legislation the Senate can help bring \nto an end one of Congress' most unessential and burdensome practices. \nEach year members of Congress add layer upon layer of onerous paperwork \nrequirements upon Executive Branch agencies by mandating various \nreports. This problem has a very real and substantive cost to taxpayers \nin terms of wasting hundreds of millions of dollars, in addition to \ntaking up untold numbers of work-hours by federal employees, and untold \namounts of other agency resources that could be far better utilized in \nmore worthy endeavors.\n  It is astounding that in 1993 the Congress required the Office of the \nPresident and Executive branch agencies to prepare over 5,300 reports! \nThis is a problem that is reaching truly epic proportions of \nunnecessary and wasteful paper shuffling! This practice has been \ncriticized by both Vice President Gore in his ``National Performance \nReview,'' and the Senate's members of the Joint Committee on the \nOrganization of Congress. The Joint Committee stated that:\n\n       These reports should not continue in perpetuity without \n     some clear evidence that the report serves a useful policy \n     purpose. The proliferation of mandatory agency reports has \n     been a matter of wide concern in the Congress and in the \n     Executive Branch.\n\n  Furthermore, in 1992 the GAO found that:\n  In the 101st Congress, a single House committee received over 800 \nreports from Federal agencies in response to mandates from the \nCongress;\n  Another 600 reports were sent to the same committee in the 102d \nCongress;\n  The Office of Management and Budget had to submit 38 reports to a \nsingle House committee just to comply with the 1990 Budget \nReconciliation Act;\n  Are these reports necessary? Does Congress really need to force every \nFederal agency to keep a small army of bureaucrats on the payroll \nsolely to satisfy its insatiable appetite for reports? I think the \nanswer is clearly no, and I'm confident most people sincerely \ninterested in reducing the size and cost of Government will agree.\n  While I firmly believe we should sunset most annual or semi-annual \nmandatory reporting requirements, I in no way wish to contend that \nthere are not many reports required by Congress that are vitally \nimportant. The recurring flow of timely and accurate information from \nthe executive branch to the Congress is essential to our oversight \nresponsibilities as Members, and as a legislative body. However, I will \nstrongly contend that the cumulative weight and cost of the reporting \nmandates we've enacted year after year has gotten totally out of hand.\n  [[Page S6514]] The problem of foisting massive reporting requirements \non Federal agencies is not only very real, it's extremely expensive. \nThe Department of Agriculture alone spent over $40 million in taxpayers \nmoney in 1993 to produce the 280 reports it was required to submit to \nthe Congress. That is astounding, Mr. President--$40 million in \ntaxpayer dollars spent by a single department last year on reports \nmandated by the Congress. The\n Department of Agriculture isn't even the leader in this respect, \nhowever, because the Department of Defense has estimated that it must \nprepare 600 reports each year for Congress! At a time when our country \nis struggling to alleviate the burdens of the middle class and also \naddress the urgent needs of our citizenry, this is an especially \negregious waste of money.\n\n  Let's consider this startling cost of reports at the USDA in another \ncontext: the money the Congress forced the Department of Agriculture to \nfritter away on reporting mandates last year could have provided \nservices to an additional 100,000 low-income women and children under \nthe USDA's WIC program. Think about that, Mr. President; an additional \n100,000 women and children could have been provided vital nutritional \nand health services with the funds the USDA had to spend researching \nand preparing hundreds of reports! That same $40 million could have \nenrolled another 10,000 disadvantaged children in Head Start, as well! \nImagine what the cost to taxpayers was to produce the more than 5,300 \nreports that the Congress required of Federal agencies in 1993!\n  Furthermore, this problem is getting worse and worse with each \npassing year. The GAO stated that in 1970, the Congress mandated only \n750 recurring reports from Federal agencies. Now we have spiralled well \npast 5,300, and the GAO determined that ``Congress imposes about 300 \nnew requirements on Federal agencies each year!'' Clearly, Mr. \nPresident, the wasteful blizzard of paperwork that Vice President Gore \ncriticized is becoming an avalanche, and it's time for the Senate to \ntake decisive action to remedy it.\n  This legislation would terminate the statutory requirement for all \nannual or recurring congressionally-mandated reports four years after \nit is signed into law, with two specific exceptions. The reports to be \nexempted are those required under the Inspector Generals Act of 1978 \nand the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. The Inspector Generals \nAct requires the Congress to be advised of activities regarding \ninvestigations into waste, fraud, and abuse in Federal agencies; and \nthe CFO Act requires agencies to provide financial information about \ntheir short and long-term management of agency resources.\n  I believe the reports required by these two laws are very important \nand merit continuation, and I also recognize that there are many other \nreports that my colleagues feel have great value because of the \ninformation they provide to Congress. Such reports can simply be \nreauthorized at any time in the 4 years before this legislation would \nsunset them.\n  I want to commend my colleague, Senator Levin, for his considerable \ncontribution to this legislation. Senator Levin and his staff worked \nfor months in developing a list of over 200 mandatory reports that \nshould either be promptly eliminated or modified in order to lessen the \nburdens and costs that the Congress has placed on Federal agencies. The \nprovisions of this bill that he developed will terminate the production \nof some of the most dubious examples of unnecessary paperwork shuffling \nby Federal agencies, and I thank him for his valuable work in this \narea. The combined impact of the legislation we are introducing today \nwill certainly help remove the millstone of unnecessary and costly \npaperwork that Congress has hung around the neck of the Federal \nGovernment for too long.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that the chairman and ranking member \nof the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Roth and Senator Glenn, \nrespectively, are cosponsors of this legislation. I further want to \nthank both Senator Roth and Senator Glenn for clearing this bill to be \nplaced directly on the Senate Calendar upon introduction, so that no \nfurther action by the committee is necessary. I hope it will be passed \nby the full Senate in the near future.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce along with \nSenators McCain, Roth, Glenn, and Cohen the Federal Reports Elimination \nand Sunset Act of 1995, which eliminates and modifies over 200 outdated \nor unnecessary congressionally mandated reporting requirements and also \nplaces a sunset on those reports with an annual, semi-annual, or other \nregular periodic reporting requirement 4 years after the bill's \nenactment. The legislation is designed to improve the efficiency of \nagency operations by eliminating paperwork generated and staff time \nspent in producing unnecessary reports to Congress.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today is similar to the bill \nSenator Cohen and I introduced last year, and is the product of a \nthorough effort to identify those congressionally-mandated agency \nreporting requirements that have outlived their usefulness and now \nserve only as an unnecessary drain on agency resources--resources that \ncould be devoted to more important program use. The Congressional \nBudget Office estimates that enactment of this legislation could result \nin savings of up to $5 to $10 million without even factoring in the \nsavings from the sunset provision.\n  In 1985, when a previous Reports Elimination Act was passed, there \nwere approximately 3,300 reporting requirements. The 1985 act affected \nonly 23 of these reports. Today, there are over 5,300 reporting \nrequirements. Some estimates of the annual cost of meeting these \nreporting requirements are as high as $240 million a year, and the GAO \nreports that Congress imposes close to 300 new requirements every year.\n  This bill is the product of an extensive process that started with \nrecommendations from executive and independent agencies. Senator Cohen \nand I wrote to all 89 executive and independent agencies and asked that \nthey identify reports required by law that they believe are no longer \nnecessary or useful and, therefore, that could be eliminated or \nmodified. We stressed the importance of a clear and substantiated \njustification for each recommendation made. We received responses from \nabout 80 percent of the agencies. For the most part, the agencies made \na serious effort to review and recommend a respectable number of \nreporting requirements for elimination.\n  We then went to the chairman and ranking member of each of the \nrelevant Senate committees--for their review and comment--the \nrecommendations made by the agencies under their respective \njurisdictions. We also asked that the committees provide us with any \nadditional recommendations for eliminations or modifications that they \nmight have.\n  Many of the committees responded to the request. Those responses were \ngenerally supportive of the subcommittee's efforts and most contained \nonly a few changes to the agency recommendations. Those changes were \nprimarily requests by committees to retain reports under their \njurisdiction because the information contained in the report is of use \nto the committee or, in some cases, of use to outside organizations.\n  After this extensive review and comment period, Senator Cohen and I \nintroduced S. 2156, the Federal Reports Elimination and Modification \nAct, on May 25, 1994. As introduced, the bill contained nearly 300 \nrecommendations for eliminations or modifications. Senators Glenn, \nRoth, Stevens, and McCain cosponsored that bill. Shortly after the \nintroduction of S. 2156, Senator Cohen and I again wrote to all the \ncommittees and asked for comments on the bill as introduced.\n  S. 2156 was unanimously approved by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee on August 2, 1994. Unfortunately, the Senate was unable to \nact on S. 2156 before the end of the 103d Congress. But I am more \nhopeful that both Houses of Congress will pass this very timely piece \nof legislation this year. In fact, in March 1995, the Senate agreed to \ninclude the language of this bill in the form of two separate \namendments to the 1995 Paperwork Reduction Act, S. 244.\n  The amendments, however, were struck in conference. The chairman of \nthe House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight agreed, however, \n\n[[Page S6515]] to support similar legislation in a free-standing bill.\n  Under this bill, 157 reports will be eliminated and 61 will be \nmodified. The legislation also includes a modified version of Senator \nMcCain's sunset provision which will facilitate Congress's review of \nthese reports. Rather than undergoing the same lengthy process of \nassessing the usefulness of each and every reporting requirement on a \nperiodic basis, the sunset provision will eliminate those reports with \na annual, semi-annual, or regular periodic reporting requirement 4 \nyears after the bill's enactment, while allowing Members of Congress to \nre-authorize those reports it deems necessary in carrying out effective \ncongressional oversight. The sunset provision does not apply to any \nreports required under the Inspector General Act of 1978 or the Chief \nFinancial Officers Act of 1990.\n  Because the Senate had already passed similar legislation earlier \nthis year, we will be seeking to place the bill directly on the \ncalendar for the Senate's immediate consideration.\n  The enactment of this legislation is long overdue. Congressional \nstaffers are being inundated with reports that are never read and are \nsimply dropped into file cabinets or wastebaskets, never to be seen \nagain. We are introducing this bipartisan legislation in the hopes that \nCongress will act quickly to plug this drain on needed resources caused \nby unnecessary and extraneous reporting requirements.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of \nS. 790, the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995, \nlegislation to eliminate or modify over 200 statutory reporting \nrequirements that have outlived their usefulness and sunset many \nothers.\n  Senators Levin, McCain, and I offered the text of this bill as two \nseparate amendments, which were accepted by the Senate, during the \ndebate on the Paperwork Reduction Act earlier this year. Because of the \nconcerns of House conferees that the House Committees had not had \nadequate time to review the various reports targeted for elimination or \nsunset, the amendments were dropped in conference. The House conferees \nassured us, however, that the House would act quickly to take up \nseparate legislation combining the two amendments.\n  The issue of eliminating unnecessary government reporting \nrequirements is an area that Senator Levin and I have worked on for a \nnumber of years in our capacity as chairman and ranking minority member \nof the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement. The text of the amendment that Senator Levin and I offered \nto the Paperwork Reduction Act was based on legislation we introduced \nlast Congress which CBO estimated would reduce agencies' reporting \ncosts by $5 million to $10 million annually. The legislation was the \nproduct of more than a year's worth of discussions with Government \nagencies and congressional committees.\n  An example of the type of report this legislation will eliminate is \nan annual Department of Energy report on naval petroleum and oil shale \nreserves production. The same data in this report is included in the \nNaval Petroleum Reserves Annual Report. Other provisions of the bill \nwill consolidate information to reduce the number of reports required. \nFor example, the Department of Labor's annual report will be modified \nto include the Department's audited financial statements and, thereby, \neliminate the need for a separate annual report for all money received \nand disbursed by the Department. Finally, the bill will also eliminate \nreports that are simply no longer necessary--reports that were useful \nat the time they were required but stopped serving a useful purpose and \nwere kept on the books because no one was looking closely enough at \nthem.\n  The bill also sunsets in 4 years reports made on a regular basis. \nUnder the bill, the sunset will not apply to reports triggered by \nspecific events such as a report to Congress required under the War \nPowers Act as a result of certain actions. The sunset will also not \napply to reporting requirements required by the Inspector General Act \nor the Chief Financial Officers Act. The sunset provision will force \nCongress to periodically review mandated reporting requirements and \nreauthorize those that are still serving a valid purpose. The sunset is \nbased on legislation introduced by Senator McCain and will save \nadditional taxpayers' dollars.\n  In closing, I believe this legislation is a reasonable approach to \neliminating unnecessary reporting requirements and it is consistent \nwith efforts by the Congress to reinvent Government and make it more \nefficient. The legislation is intended to reduce the paperwork burdens \nplaced on Federal agencies, streamline the information that flows from \nthese agencies to the Congress, and save millions of taxpayers' \ndollars. I hope the congress will act expeditiously to pass this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself and Mr. Lott):\n  s. 791. A bill to provide that certain civil defense employees and \nemployees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency may be eligible \nfor certain public safety officers death benefits, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n             public safety officers benefits act extension\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto extend coverage under the Public Safety Officers Benefits Act to \nemployees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] and \nemployees of State and local emergency management and civil defense \nagencies who are killed or disabled in the line of duty.\n  The Public Safety Officers Benefits Act provides benefits to eligible \nsurvivors of a public safety officer whose death is the direct result \nof a traumatic injury sustained in the line of duty. The act also \nprovides benefits to those officers who are permanently and totally \ndisabled as the direct result of a catastrophic personal injury \nsustained in the line of duty.\n  The act now covers State and local law enforcement officers and fire \nfighters, Federal law enforcement officers and fire fighters, and \nFederal, State, and local rescue squads and ambulance crews. However, \nan employee of a State or local emergency management, or civil defense \nagency, or an employee of FEMA, who is killed or permanently disabled \nperforming his or her duty in responding to a disaster is not covered \nunder the act.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will remedy this situation by \nextending the act to those employees. This will ensure that the \nsurvivors and family members of an employee killed in the line of duty \nwill receive benefits and that an employee permanently and totally \ndisabled as a result of injury sustained in the line of duty will also \nreceive the benefits of the act.\n  During his confirmation hearing in the last Congress, FEMA Director \nJames Lee Witt said that emergency management and civil defense \nemployees put their lives on the line almost every time they respond to \nan event. Enactment of this legislation will provide them with some \nassurance that, should death or disabling injury result from the \nperformance of their duty, their families will receive survivor \nbenefits or they will receive disability benefits.\n  I hope my colleagues will carefully consider this legislation and \njoin me in support of its enactment.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN (for herself, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 792. A bill to recognize the National Education Technology Funding \nCorporation as a nonprofit corporation operating under the laws of the \nDistrict of Columbia, to provide authority for Federal departments and \nagencies to provide assistance to such corporation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n       the national education technology funding corporation act\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I introduce the National Education \nTechnology Funding Corporation Act, legislation designed to connect \npublic schools and public libraries to the information superhighway.\n\n\n                            public education\n\n  Mr. President, if there is any objective that should command complete \nAmerican consensus, it is to ensure that every American has a chance to \nsucceed. That is the core concept of the American dream--the chance to \nachieve as much and to go as far as \n[[Page S6516]] your ability and talent will take you. Public education \nhas always been a part of that core concept. In this country, the \nchance to be educated has always gone hand in hand with the chance to \nsucceed.\n  Yet, as I have stated time and time again, education is more than a \nprivate benefit, it is also a public good. My experiences as a \nlegislator have shown me that the quality of public education affects \nthe entire community. Education prepares our work force to compete in \nthe emerging global economy. It increases our productivity and \ncompetitive advantages in world markets. It also promotes our economy \nand the standard and quality of living for our people.\n\n\n                               technology\n\n  Nonetheless, I am convinced that it will be difficult if not \nimpossible for us to prepare our children to compete in the emerging \nglobal economy unless we change the current educational system. If \nAmerican students are to compete successfully with their foreign \ncounterparts, systemic school reform must occur. And that means taking \ninto account and addressing all aspects of the educational system.\n  Mr. President, the increased competition created by the emerging \nglobal economy requires teachers and students to transform their \ntraditional roles in many ways. It requires teachers to act as \nfacilitators in the classroom, guiding student learning rather than \nprescribing it. It also requires students to construct their own \nknowledge, based on information and data they manipulate themselves.\n  Technology can help teachers and students play the new roles that are \nbeing required of them. Technology can help teachers report and chart \nstudent progress on a more individualized basis. It can also allow them \nto use resources from across the globe or across the street to create \ndifferent learning environment for their students without ever leaving \nthe classroom. On the other hand, technology can allow students to \naccess the vast array of material available electronically and to \nengage in the analysis of real world problems and questions.\n\n\n                            first gao report\n\n  A recent report released by the General Accounting Office concluded \nthat our Nation's education technology infrastructure is not designed \nor sufficiently equipped to allow our children to take advantage of the \nbenefits technology offers.\n  Last year, I asked the General Accounting Office [GAO] to conduct a \ncomprehensive, nationwide study of the condition of our Nation's public \nschools. In responding to my request, the General Accounting Office \nsurveyed a random sample of our Nation's 15,000 school districts and \n80,000 public schools from April to December 1994. Based on responses \nfrom 78 percent of the schools sampled, GAO began preparing five \nseparate reports on the condition of our Nation's public schools.\n  The first GAO report, which was released on February 1, 1995, \nexamined the education infrastructure needs for our Nation's public \nelementary and secondary schools. As expected, this report made clear \nwhat most of us already knew; that our schools are deteriorating and we \nneed to fix them. More specifically, the GAO report concluded that our \nNation's public schools need $112\n billion to restore their facilities to good overall condition.\n\n\n                           SECOND GAO REPORT\n\n  The most recent GAO report, which was released on April 4, 1995, \nconcluded that more than half of our Nation's public schools lack six \nor more of the technology elements necessary to reform the way teachers \nteach and students learn including: computers, printers, modems, cable \nTV, laser disc players, VCR's, and TV's.\n  In fact, the GAO report found that more of our Nation's schools do \nnot have the education technology infrastructure necessary to support \nthese important audio, video, and data systems. For example, their \nreport states that: 86.8 percent of all public schools lack fiber-optic \ncable; 46.1 percent lack sufficient electrical wiring; 34.6 percent \nlack sufficient electrical power for computers; 51.8 percent lack \nsufficient computer networks; 60.6 percent lack sufficient conduits and \nraceways; 61.2 percent lack sufficient phonelines for instructional \nuse; and 55.5 percent lack sufficient phonelines for modems.\n\n\n                          local property taxes\n\n  Mr. President, these results are simply unacceptable. There is \nabsolutely no reason why, in 1995, all of our Nation's children should \nnot have access to the best education technology resources in the \nworld.\n  The most recent GAO report did find that students in some schools are \ntaking advantage of the benefits associated with education technology. \nFor example, advanced chemistry students at Centennial High School in \nChampaign, IL, are developing experiments that allow them to move parts \nof molecules on their computer screens in response to their own \ncomputer commands. In one simulation, students watch the orbitals of \nelectrons in reaction to imposed actions. Another simulation \ndemonstrates the ionization of atoms--how the size of atoms changes \nwhen ions are added or subtracted.\n  The bottom line, however, is that we are still failing to provide all \nof our Nation's children with education technology resources like those \nbeing provided at Centennial High School because the American system of \npublic education has forced local school districts to maintain our \nNation's education infrastructure primarily with local property taxes.\n  For a long time, local school districts were able to meet that \nresponsibility. Local property taxes, however, are now all too often an \ninadequate source of funding for public education. What is even worse \nis that this financing mechanism makes the quality of public education \nall too dependent on local property value.\n  As a result, the second GAO report found that, on average, only 8 \npercent of local school bond proceeds were spent on computers and \ntelecommunications equipment. That is, for the average $6.5 million \nbond issue, only $155,600, or 2 percent was provided for the purchase \nof computers and only $381,100, or 6 percent for the purchase of \ntelecommunications equipment.\n  Yet, most States continue to force local school districts to rely \nincreasingly on local property taxes for public education, in general, \nand for education technology, in particular. In Illinois, for example, \nthe local share of public education funding increased from 48 percent \nduring the 1980-81 school year to 58 percent during the 1992-93 school \nyear, while the State share fell from 43 to 34 percent during this same \nperiod.\n  The Federal Government must also accept a share of the blame for \nfailing to provide our Nation's children with environments conducive to \nlearning. The Federal Government's share of public education funding \nhas fallen from 9.1 percent during the 1980-81 school\n year to 5.6 percent during the 1993-94 school year.\n\n\n                               goals 2000\n\n  Mr. President, Congress passed the goals 2000: Educate America Act \nwhich President Clinton signed into law on March 31, 1994. I support \nthis legislation because it promises to create a coherent, national \nframework for education reform founded on the national education goals. \nNonetheless, I firmly believe that it is inherently unfair to expect \nour children to meet national performance standards if they do not have \nan equal opportunity to learn.\n\n\n                      education infrastructure act\n\n  That is why I introduced the Education Infrastructure Act last year. \nThis legislation addresses the needs highlighted in the first GAO \nreport by helping local school districts ensure the health and safety \nof students through the repair, renovation, alteration, and \nconstruction of school facilities. More specifically, this legislation \nauthorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants to local school \ndistricts with at least a 15 percent child poverty rate and urgent \nrepair, renovation, alteration, or construction needs.\n\n\n                        information superhighway\n\n  Mr. President, President Clinton and Vice President Gore have taken \nleadership roles in addressing the needs highlighted in the most recent \nGAO report. On September 15, 1993, the information infrastructure task \nforce created by the Vice President released its report--``National \nInformation Infrastructure: Agenda for Action.'' This report urges the \nFederal Government to support the development of the information \nsuperhighway--the metaphor used to describe the evolving technology \ninfrastructure that will link homes, businesses, schools, hospitals, \nand libraries \n[[Page S6517]] to each other and to a vast array of electronic \ninformation resources.\n  On this same day, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12864 \nwhich created the National Information Infrastructure Advisory Council \nto facilitate private sector input in this area.\n  Mr. President, a substantial portion of the information superhighway \nalready exists. Approximately 94 percent of American households have \ntelephone service, 60 percent have cable, 30 percent have computers, \nand almost 100 percent have radio and television. Local and long-\ndistance telephone companies are currently investing heavily in fiber-\noptic cables that will carry greater amounts of information; cable \ncompanies are increasing their capacity to provide new services; and \nnew wireless personal communications systems are under development. One \nprototype, the Internet, connects approximately 15-20 million people \nworldwide.\n\n\n                            federal support\n\n  Nonetheless, the results of the second GAO report suggest to me that \nthe Federal Government must do more to help build the education portion \nof the national information infrastructure. Federal support for the \nacquisition and use of technology in elementary and secondary schools \nis currently fragmented, coming from a diverse group of programs and \ndepartments. Although the full extent to which the Federal Government \ncurrently supports investments in education technology at the \nprecollegiate level is not known, the Office of Technology Assessment \nestimated in its report--``Power On!''--that the programs administered \nby the Department of Education provided $208 million for education \ntechnology in 1988.\n\n\n                           cost of technology\n\n  There is little doubt that substantial costs will accompany efforts \nto bring education technologies into public schools in any \ncomprehensive fashion. In his written testimony before the House \nTelecommunications and Finance Subcommittee on September 30, 1994, \nSecretary of Education, Richard Riley, estimated that it will cost \nanywhere from $3 to $8 billion annually to build the education portion \nof the national information infrastructure. The Office of Technology \nAssessment has also estimated that the cost of bringing the students to \ncomputer ratio down to 3-to-1 would cost $4.2 billion a year for 6 \nyears.\n           NATIONAL EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY FUNDING CORPORATION\n\n  Mr. President, three leaders in the areas of education and finance \ncame together recently to help public schools and public libraries meet \nthese costs. On April 4, John Danforth, former U.S. Senator from \nMissouri, Jim Murray, past President of Fannie Mae, and Dr. Mary \nHatwood Futrell, past President of the National Education Association, \ncreated the National Education Technology Funding Corporation.\n  As outlined in its articles of incorporation, the National Education \nTechnology Funding Corporation will stimulate public and private \ninvestment in our Nation's education technology infrastructure by \nproviding loans, loan guarantees, grants, and other forms of assistance \nto States and local school districts.\n\n\n                              Legislation\n\n  I am introducing the National Education Technology Funding \nCorporation Act today to help provide the seed money necessary to get \nthis exciting, new private sector initiative off the ground. Rather \nthan promoting our Nation's education technology infrastructure by \ncreating another Federal program, this legislation would simply \nauthorize Federal departments and agencies to make grants to the NETFC.\n  The National Education Technology Funding Corporation Act would not \ncreate the NETFC or recognize it as an agency or establishment of the \nU.S. Government; it would only recognize its incorporation as a \nprivate, nonprofit organization by private citizens. However, since \nNETFC would be using public funds to connect public schools and public \nlibraries to the information Superhighway, my legislation would require \nNETFC to submit itself and its grantees to appropriate congressional \noversight procedures and annual audits.\n  This legislation will not infringe upon local control over public \neducation in any way. Rather, it will supplement, augment, and assist \nlocal efforts to support education technology in the least intrusive \nway possible by helping local school districts build their own on-ramps \nto the Information Superhighway.\n  Senator Burns and Senator Robb has endorsed this bill, and it has \nbeen endorsed by the National Education Association, the National \nSchool Boards Association, the American Library Association, the \nCouncil for Education Development and Research, and Organizations \nConcerned About Rural Education [OCRE].\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks by urging my \ncolleagues to help connect public schools and public libraries to the \nInformation Superhighway by quickly enacting the National Education \nTechnology Funding Corporation Act into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 792\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the legislation \nintroduced by my colleague from Illinois. I applaud her for her vision \nand persistence in looking out for our Nation's most precious \nresource--our children, and I am pleased to join Senator Mosely-Braun \nas an original cosponsor of the National Education Technology Funding \nCorporation Act.\n  During committee consideration of the telecommunications bill last \nyear, I offered related legislation to ensure that every school and \nclassroom in the United States has access to telecommunications and \ninformation technologies. I proposed an educational telecommunications \nand technology fund to support elementary and secondary school access \nto the information superhighway. Regrettably, last year's \ntelecommunications bill was not taken up by the full Senate before \nadjournment.\n  The new telecommunications bill that recently passed the Commerce \nCommittee has a provision, introduced by Senators Snowe, Rockefeller, \nand Bob Kerrey, to make advanced telecommunications more affordable for \nschools. Specifically, the provision allows elementary and secondary \nschools, as well as libraries, to receive telecommunications services \nat affordable monthly rates. Currently, schools all over the country, \nincluding those in my own State of Virginia, are forced to pay business \nrates for access to the information superhighway. That means that \nschools are subsidizing residential customers.\n  Even with affordable monthly rates, many schools have limited or no \ntechnological infrastructure. They lack modern electrical wiring, a \nsufficient number of plugs, and access to wired or wireless technology \nthat would allow them internal networking capabilities or connections \nto the Internet. The absence of this infrastructure leaves these \nschools without a technological on-ramp to the information \nsuperhighway. As a result, American children are left by the wayside.\n  This is where the National Education Technology Funding Corporation \ncan play a critical role. We need a single efficient, expert entity \nthat State and local authorities can approach for funding so they can \njoin the Internet, participate in distance learning, investigate \ninteractive computer learning, or explore other innovative \ntechnologies.\n  A private non-profit is a logical link between the public and \ncommercial \n[[Page S6519]] sectors. It is often difficult for schools to identify \nwhere to go to request Federal funding for new technologies, or where \nto go simply to learn more about technology applications for schools. \nAlso, there is much more than can be done to promote the use of \ntechnologies in schools and to encourage private investments and \nstandards. I can think of no better way to meet all of these needs than \na private corporation run by a board that includes representatives from \nStates, from public schools and libraries, and from the private sector.\n  Many opponents of Federal efforts to improve educational technologies \nclaim that the private stock will have adequate incentives to assist \nschools with educational technologies. Just leave it to the private \nsector, they argue. This is a very shortsighted viewpoint.\n  There is no question that the private sector is doing great things \nfor America's schools--and libraries--in the area of educational \ntechnologies. Computers and software are frequently donated by private \nfirms. Internet access is provided in some areas. Several weeks ago I \nvisited Arlington County Central Library, just a few miles from here, \nwhich MCI had made a generous grant to the library to install public \nInternet workstations. As a result, this library will be one of the \nfirst public locations in northern Virginia to offer Internet access. \nMore recently, my staff visited Chantilly High School in Fairfax County \nto witness a state-of-the-art Internet lab made possible by assistance \nfrom the cable company, Media General. These are important private \nsector initiatives that will hopefully be duplicated time and time \nagain across the nation.\n  But there are problems with a let the free market reign approach. \nFirst, wealthier schools will receive a disproportionate benefit. \nWealthier schools can afford advanced educational technologies. \nCorporations are more likely to provide equipment and internet access \nto schools that have already invested in related technologies. \nCorporations are more likely to offer\n services in urban or suburban areas that have good telecommunications \ninfrastructures. Yet the rural schools gain the most from internet \naccess, distance-learning, and a host of other educational \ntechnologies. It is rural schools that are in danger of rapidly losing \nground to those schools with access to the new technologies. We have to \nput an end to the ever-growing bifurcation of our educational system. \nAs set forth in this bill, the corporation would encourage equitable \ntechnology funding to all elementary and secondary schools.\n\n  The second problem is commonality. Although we don't want to \nconstrain educational technology development by mandating Government \nstandards, we don't want to create a smorgasbord of technologies that \ncan't communicate with each other and can't be shared across school \nsystems. The proposed corporation could play an invaluable role in \nmaking sure school technology efforts nationwide are not wasteful, \nincompatible, or duplicative.\n  The third problem is time. The technologies are here today. It is a \nrelatively straightforward process to make an internet connection or to \nestablish a video link or to learn the highly effective software now \navailable for education. We shouldn't rely solely on the timetables of \nthe private sector to field the technologies that exist today for \npreparing our children for the next century. The Educational Technology \nCorporation would play a key role in promoting the use of technologies \nin education, and could significantly accelerate their introduction \ninto America's schools.\n  For those of our colleagues that have any doubts about the value of \nnew educational technologies, I challenge them to sit down on a \ncomputer with internet access, and surf. They'll be visiting the \nlargest, most up-to-date, and fastest-growing library in the world. You \ncan chat with experts from across the globe. You can set up a video \nlink with teachers at distant schools, using a small camera costing as \nlittle as $100. You can share data or results in a joint research \neffort spanning continents. You can take an electronic tour of the \nWhite House, or visit the so-called webb-site of a Member of Congress. \nYou can even see images or molecules or galaxies. The possibilities are \nendless.\n  In discussions with school administrators, it becomes clear that \nstudents are fascinated by the internet and other educational \ntechnologies. Students that might otherwise be indifferent are eagerly \npursuing new subjects and sharing their new-found knowledge with the \nglobal community of students. Simply put, the child with access will be \nat a distinct advantage and better prepared for future employment. We \nsimply cannot afford to let our school systems slip behind those of our \nleading competitors when the technology is at our fingertips--a \ntechnology pioneered here in the United States. Mr. President, I urge \nmy colleagues to support the most cost-effective education we can offer \nour Nation's children. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the National \nEducation Technology Funding Corporation Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMPSON (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 793. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan exemption from income tax for certain common investment funds; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                        common fund legislation\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friends, \nSenator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Senator Jon Kyl, in introducing a \nbill to permit private and community foundations to pool investment \nassets into a ``common fund'' or cooperative organization. This \nlegislation was twice passed by the Senate in 1992 as part of the \ncomprehensive tax legislation ultimately vetoed by the President.\n  This bill would extend to foundations the same ``common fund'' model \nwhich has proven so successful for colleges and universities. The \nuniversity common fund now manages over $10 billion--with more than 900 \neducational institutions participating.\n  Once established, a common fund for foundations would allow smaller \nfoundations to increase their total return on investment and \nsignificantly reduce investment management fees by taking advantage of \neconomies of scale. Both results have the same bottom line: Increased \nassets and income will then be available for private and community \nfoundation grants to charitable groups.\n  Studies disclose that total investment returns earned by smaller \nfoundations lag substantially behind those of many larger foundations. \nOne major reason for this difference is that many of the best \nprofessional investment manages demand that new accounts to meet \ncertain minimum size requirements. Smaller foundations often do not \nmeet the minimum size.\n  Second, since management investment fees are based on percentages \nthat decline as the size of the account increases, smaller foundations \nare less able to take advantage of economies of scale and cannot \nbenefit from lower fee levels.\n  This bill would permit foundations to ``band together'' for \ninvestment purposes by providing tax-exempt status to common funds \nhandling foundation investments. This would thus give foundation common \nfunds the same tax treatment as educational institution common funds.\n  I feel this is a most appropriate response to a vexing problem. I \nurge your support.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Craig, \n        Mr. Cohen, Mr. Mack, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Burns, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \n        Graham, Mr. Coats, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Packwood, Mr. Campbell, Mr. \n        Dorgan, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Dole, Mr. Jeffords, \n        Mr. Helms, Mr. Bond, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. \n        Hollings, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Abraham, Mrs. Murray, \n        Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Nickles, Mr. \n        Hatfield, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Specter, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Pryor, \n        Mr. Daschle, Mr. Heflin, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Lott, and Mr. \n        Conrad):\n  S. 794. A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act to facilitate the minor use of a pesticide, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n        [[Page S6520]] the minor use crop protection act of 1995\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nMinor Use Crop Protection Act of 1995 to help ensure the availability \nof minor use pesticides for farmers and an abundant and varied food \nsupply for our Nation.\n  This legislation has gained broad bipartisan support as evidenced by \nthe 41 Senators who have joined as original cosponsors. This strong \nshow of support will help us move swiftly toward enactment of this \nbill.\n  Minor use pesticides are generally used on relatively small acreage \nor for regional pest or disease problems. Manufacturers incur a \nsignificant cost to develop scientific data to register or reregister \nthese products and yet face a limited market potential once the \npesticide is approved for use. Therefore, Minor use pesticides are not \nbeing supported or are being voluntarily canceled for economic, not \nsafety reasons.\n  This situation has been exacerbated by the Environmental Protection \nAgency's pesticide reregistration requirements. A law enacted in 1988 \nrequired that all pesticides, and their uses, registered before \nNovember 1984, be reregistered.\n  Loss of minor use pesticides could cause substantial production \nproblems for many fruit, vegetable, and ornamental crops. Farmers also \nfear that loss of minor use pesticides will put them at a competitive \ndisadvantage with foreign producers who would still have access to the \npesticides.\n  While this is an important industry, fruits and vegetables have also \ntaken on a more important role in the diet of Americans. Health experts \nrecommend increased consumption of fruits and vegetables. A reduction \nin the availability of these foods or an increased cost due to less \nproduction would have a disproportionate impact on the health of low \nincome Americans, who spend a greater amount of their disposable income \non food.\n  The bill offers several incentives for manufacturers to maintain and \ndevelop new safe and effective pesticides for minor uses without \ncompromising food safety or adversely affecting the environment.\n  Here are some examples where this bill would have a positive impact. \nLast year fire blight posed a serious threat to apple and pear \nproduction in Washington State. This bill would help to encourage \nregistration of new products to control fire blight. Exports are also \nimpacted by this pest. Japan restricts the entry of apples from areas \nnear those where fire blight occurs. Last year half of the acreage in \nthe State initially eligible for exports was later denied due to fire \nblight.\n  In my home State of Indiana, alternatives are needed for Dimethenamid \nused for weed control for strawberries. The manufacturer has not \nreregistered this product for this use due to economic reasons. \nObviously, Indiana is not a large strawberry producing State. However, \nstrawberry growers there still do need products to control \nLambsquarters and Johnsongrass which can lower yields and in some cases \nreduce quality.\n  In California, sodium orthophenolphenate [OPP] has been used for \ndecay control in citrus packinghouses. OPP is used in very small \namounts and the manufacturers will not be supporting this use since the \ncosts of reregistration outweigh the annual sales volume. This bill \ncould help provide funding for additional studies required for \nreregistration if growers wanted to band together to continue this use \nand would also help encourage the development of additional alternative \nminor use products.\n  This is an important issue for our Nation's farmers and consumers. I \npledge timely consideration of this bill within the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsorship and support \nof this needed legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a summary be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 794\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The use of a pesticide \n     on an animal, or on a commercial agricultural crop or site, \n     or for the protection of public health could qualify as a \n     minor use if the total acreage of the crop is less than \n     300,000 acres or if the use does not provide sufficient \n     economic incentive to the manufacturer to support its \n     registration and it meets one of four ``public interest'' \n     criteria. The four public interest criteria are that there \n     are insufficient efficacious alternatives available for the \n     use, or the alternatives pose a greater risk to the \n     environment or human health, or the pesticide can help manage \n     pest resistance problems or the pesticide would be part of an \n     integrated pest management program.\n       The current 10 year exclusive use protection for \n     registrants of new chemicals could be extended one year for \n     each three minor uses which a manufacturer registers, up to a \n     maximum of three additional years for nine or more minor uses \n     registered by EPA. In order to receive the extension, new \n     minor uses must be approved before the end of the original \n     exclusive use period. One of the above four ``public \n     interest'' criteria must also be met. Exclusive use is \n     subject to review by EPA to ensure that new minor uses are \n     being marketed.\n       The time necessary for the development of residue chemistry \n     data for a minor use could be extended until the final study \n     due date for data necessary to support the other registered \n     uses being maintained by the registrant.\n       EPA may waive minor use data requirements in certain \n     circumstances where EPA can otherwise determine the risk \n     presented by the minor use and such risk is not unreasonable.\n       EPA is to review and act on minor use registration \n     applications within 1 year if the active ingredient is to be \n     registered solely for a minor use, or if there are three or \n     more minor uses proposed for every non-minor use, or if the \n     minor use would serve as a replacement for any use that has \n     been canceled within 5 years of the application or if the \n     approval of the minor use would avoid the reissuance of an \n     emergency exemption.\n       If a minor use waiver of data requirements is submitted to \n     EPA and subsequently denied, the registrant would be given \n     the full time period for supplying the data to EPA.\n       As a transition measure, the effective date of the \n     voluntary cancellation of minor uses by a registrant could \n     coincide with the due date of the final study required in the \n     reregistration process for those uses being supported by the \n     registrant.\n       EPA can consider data from a pesticide which has been \n     voluntarily canceled in support of another minor use \n     registration that is identical or similar and for a similar \n     use. The new registration must be submitted before the \n     voluntary cancellation occurs. Any additional data needed \n     would have to be supplied by the new applicant.\n       A minor use program within EPA's Office of Pesticide \n     Programs would be established.\n       A minor use program within USDA would be established. This \n     would include a minor use matching fund for the development \n     of scientific data to support minor uses.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Ashcroft):\n  S. 796. A bill to provide for the protection of wild horses within \nthe Ozark National Scenic Riverways, Missouri, and prohibit the removal \nof such horses, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n                    OZARK WILD HORSE PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator Ashcroft in \nintroducing the Ozark Wild Horse Protection Act. Since 1990, the \ncitizens in southeast Missouri have been engaged in a struggle with the \nDepartment of the Interior's National Park Service [NPS] to prevent a \ngroup of about 30 feral horses from being rounded up by the Government \nand relocated or slaughtered. On behalf of these Missouri citizens who \nhave fought to protect these horses, Congressman Bill Emerson has \ntirelessly led the fight to stop this action.\n  This legislation I introduce today is companion legislation to H.R. \n238, introduced in the House by Congressman Emerson on January 4, 1995. \nIt prohibits the removal or assistance in the removal of, any free-\nroaming horses from the Ozark National Scenic Riverways [ONSR], except \nin the case of medical emergency or natural disaster.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, this is yet another case where the \nbureaucrats think they know best and have blatantly disregarded the \nperspective, suggestions, and views of the local citizens. St. Louis, \nMO, conservationist and landowner Leo Drey noted that these horses were \nin the park long before the NPS and ``The horses probably spend more \ntime loafing on our land than they do on the riverways. There's only a \nfew of them and they don't congregate to the extent they do any serious \ntrampling or damage.''\n  A Missouri citizen's group called the Missouri Wild Horse League, \nwhich is based in Eminence, MO, was created several years ago to \nprotect the horses from the National Park Service. This group has \nroughly 3,000 members. Mr. President, that membership is more than six \ntimes the number of citizens who live in the league's headquarters city \nof Eminence, MO.\n  It has been the contention of the NPS that the 30 horses that roam \nthe 71,000-acre site should be removed because their presence is in \nconflict with the management policies of the NPS and their activities \nthreaten plant communities. We are talking about a site almost two \ntimes the size of the District of Columbia where the 30 horses roam. I \nsuggest that the NPS would be hard pressed to even find the horses on \nroundup day.\n  In 1990, to prevent removal of a part of this area's heritage that \nthe National Park Service is charged to preserve, 1,000 local citizens \nsigned a petition to keep the wild horses in the ONSR. That same year, \nthe Missouri Senate unanimously passed a resolution objecting to the \nremoval of the horses. Still, the NPS ignored the importance of this \nlocal treasure to the people in this area.\n  Subsequently, citizens in Missouri filed suit and, in June of 1990, \nU.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh issued an injunction. The NPS \nwould still not yield, appealing the ruling. They would not concede in \ntheir fight to impose the Federal Government's will on the public, \nnotwithstanding the views of the local citizens, notwithstanding the \nviews of the Missouri Senate, notwithstanding the views of Missouri \nrepresentatives in Congress, and notwithstanding the decision of a U.S. \ndistrict court judge. The NPS prevailed in the higher courts. That is \nwhy it is urgently needed for the Congress to intervene and prevent \nthis Government-managed horse rustling.\n  At the request of Congressman Emerson, former ONSR Superintendent \nSullivan agreed to delay any roundup until there is opportunity to \naddress this issue in the 104th Congress. While I appreciate this one \nconcession on the part of the former superintendent, I find it \ninconceivable that the intransigence of former Superintendent Sullivan \nhas brought this issue before the Secretary of the Interior, the U.S. \nSupreme Court, and now before the U.S. Congress. It is rare to find \nFederal field personnel as out of touch and acting with total disregard \nfor local sentiment--that is typically reserved for their bosses in \nWashington.\n  [[Page S6523]] Unfortunately, it is this form of raw arrogance that \nhas the Federal Government in such low standing with the American \ncitizens--the notion that it is the olympians on the hill who know \nwhat's best for the peasants in the valley. At this juncture, I believe \nCongress has no other alternative but to pursue this matter as \nexpeditiously as possible. The National Parks Subcommittee of the House \nCommittee on Resources is scheduled to hold a hearing on May 18 to \nconsider H.R. 238.\n  I congratulate Congressman Emerson for keeping up the heat on this \nissue. Had he not, I expect the horses would already be gone. And, I \nfear that if we cannot expedite action on this bill, they will be gone.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 797. A bill to provide assistance to States and local communities \nto improve adult education and family literacy, to help achieve the \nnational education goals for all citizens, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n             adult education and family literacy reform act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am introducing, on behalf of the \nClinton administration, the Adult Education and Family Literacy Reform \nAct of 1995. This measure will reform and improve literacy services for \nadults and families.\n  As the 1993 National Adult Literacy Survey showed, 20 percent of \nadults perform at or below the fifth-grade level in reading and math--\nfar below the level needed for effective participation in the work \nforce. And because parents' educational level is a strong predictor of \nchildren's academic success, the problem seriously affects children as \nwell as adults.\n  Despite the clear need for better literacy services for adults, the \ncurrent Federal program serves only a small percentage of those who \nneed assistance. While many adults benefit from participation in the \nprogram, many others leave before they achieve any significant \nimprovement in literacy.\n  Current adult education and family literacy programs are too diffuse. \nThey divert human and financial resources from what should be the focus \nof all Federal literacy efforts--the provision of high-quality, \nresults-oriented services.\n  The problem of illiteracy presents the country with a number of \nserious challenges ranging from the way men and women function in the \nworkplace to whether parents are able to participate effectively in \ntheir children's education. The Adult Education and Family Literacy \nReform Act uses a single stream of funding to States and localities to \ncreate a partnership designed around five broad principles--\nstreamlining, flexibility, quality, targeting, and consumer choice.\n  The single funding stream recognizes the need to eliminate \nduplication and overlap in current programs. The bill is a 10-year \nauthorization to encourage States to engage in long-range planning. It \nconsolidates 12 existing programs which now have separate line items in \nthe Federal budget\n  First, the Library Literacy Program, which provides small competitive \ngrants supporting literacy programs in public libraries,\n  Second, Workplace Literacy Partnerships, which support partnerships \nof education agencies and employers that help employees develop basic \nskills,\n  Third, the Literacy Training for Homeless Adults, which funds \nprojects for homeless adults in all States,\n  Fourth, the Literacy Program for Prisoners, a nationally competitive \ngrant awarded to correctional education agencies,\n  Fifth, Even Start, which provides literacy training to parents of \npublic schoolchildren,\n  Sixth, adult education State grants, which provide funds to State \neducation agencies to support programs that assist educationally \ndisadvantaged adults in developing basic skills,\n  Seventh, gateway grants, which fund at least one adult education \nproject in a public housing authority in each State,\n  Eighth, State literacy resource centers, which support Statewide \ncoordination and training,\n  Ninth, Literacy for Institutionalized Adults, which supports literacy \nprojects for adults in State hospitals and correctional institutions,\n  Tenth, the set-aside for education coordination in title II of the \nJob Training Partnership Act, which serves eligible adults who have \nbasic education needs,\n  Eleventh, the National Institute for Literacy, as interagency \ninstitute which provides Federal leadership in coordinating and \nimproving literacy services, and\n  Twelfth, evaluation and technical assistance, which provides Federal \naid for research and technical assistance.\n  The fiscal year 1995 appropriation for these programs is $488 \nmillion. The bill recommends a $490 million authorization for the \nconsolidated programs for fiscal year 1996, and such sums as may be \nnecessary in future years.\n  While consolidating many categorical programs, the proposal requires \nStates to ensure that the needs of at-risk populations are met. Under \nthe bill, States can continue to use libraries and the workplace as \nsites for literacy services. It requires States to assess the adult \neducation and family literacy needs of hard-to-serve and most-in-need \nindividuals, and to describe how the program will meet those needs. \nTargeting provisions of the bill also will ensure that local areas with \nhigh concentrations of individuals in poverty or low levels of \nliteracy, or both, receive priority for Federal funds.\n  This legislation responds to the well-documented literacy problem in \nthis country. I look forward to working closely with other Senators to \nachieve the bipartisan support we need in order to assist the large \nnumber of adults in this country who are ready, willing, and able to \nbecome more productive citizens and better parents. What they need now \nis a helping hand, and this message will give it to them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of transmittal, the text of \nthe bill, and a section-by-section analysis of the bill may be included \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 797\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this \n     Act may be cited as the ``Adult Education and Family Literacy \n     Reform Act of 1995.''\n\n        TITLE I--AMENDMENT TO THE ADULT EDUCATION ACT AMENDMENT\n\n       Section 1.

Adults with \n     very low levels of literacy are ten times as likely to be \n     poor as those with high levels of literacy.\n       ``(6) Studies, including the National Adult Literacy \n     Survey, have found that more than one-fifth of American \n     adults demonstrate very low literacy skills that make it \n     difficult for them to enter high-skill, high-wage jobs, to \n     assist effectively in their children's education, or to carry \n     out their responsibilities as citizens.\n       ``(7) National studies have also shown that existing \n     federally supported adult education programs have assisted \n     many adults in acquiring basic literacy skills, learning \n     English, or acquiring a high school diploma (or its \n     equivalent), and family literacy programs have shown great \n     potential for breaking the intergenerational cycle of low \n     literacy and having a positive effect on later school \n     performance and high school completion, especially for \n     children from low-income families.\n       ``(8) Current adult education programs, however, are often \n     narrowly focused on specific populations or methods of \n     service delivery, have conflicting or overlapping \n     requirements, and are not administered in an integrated \n     manner, thus inhibiting the capacity of State and local \n     officials to implement programs that meet the needs of \n     individual States and localities.\n       ``(9) The President's GI Bill for America's Workers, of \n     which this Act is a key component, will help strengthen the \n     capacity of States, educational institutions, and businesses, \n     working together, to upgrade the skills and literacy levels \n     of youth and adults.\n       ``(10) The Federal Government can, through a performance \n     partnership with States and localities based on clear State-\n     developed goals and indicators, increased State and local \n     flexibility, improved accountability and incentives for \n     performance, and enhanced consumer choice and information, \n     assist States and localities with the improvement and \n     expansion of their adult education and family literacy \n     programs.\n       ``(11) The Federal Government can also assist States and \n     localities by carrying out research, development, \n     demonstration, dissemination, evaluation, capacity-building, \n     data collection, professional development, and technical \n     assistance activities that support State and local efforts to \n     implement successfully services and activities that are \n     funded under this Act, as well as adult education and family \n     literacy activities supported with non-Federal resources.\n       ``(b) Purpose.--(1) It is the purpose of this Act to create \n     a performance partnership with States and localities for the \n     provision of adult education and family literacy services so \n     that, as called for in the National Education Goals, all \n     adults who need such services will, as appropriate, be able \n     to--\n       ``(A) become literate and obtain the knowledge and skills \n     needed to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights \n     and responsibilities of citizenship;\n       ``(B) complete a high school education;\n       ``(c) become and remain actively involved in their \n     children's education in order to ensure their children's \n     readiness for, and success in, school.\n       ``(2) This purpose shall be pursued through--\n       ``(A) building on State and local education reforms \n     supported by the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and other \n     Federal and State legislation;\n       ``(B) consolidating numerous Federal adult education and \n     literacy programs into a single, flexible grant;\n       ``(C) tying local programs to challenging State-developed \n     performance goals that are consistent with the purpose of \n     this Act;\n       ``(D) holding States and localities accountable for \n     achieving such goals;\n       ``(E) building program quality though such measures as \n     encouraging greater use of new technologies in adult \n     education and family literacy programs and better \n     professional development of educators working in those \n     programs;\n       ``(F) integrating adult education and family literacy \n     programs with States' school-to-work opportunities systems, \n     career preparation education services and activities, job \n     training programs, early childhood and elementary school \n     programs, and other related activities; and\n       ``(G) supporting the improvement of State and local \n     activities through nationally significant efforts in \n     research, development, demonstration, dissemination, \n     evaluation, capacity-building, data collection, professional \n     development, and technical assistance.\n\n\n                   ``authorization of appropriations\n\n       ``Sec. 3.

Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed for consideration of the \n     Congress is the ``Adult Education and Family Literacy Reform \n     Act of 1995,'' the Administration's plan to create a \n     comprehensive strategy for meeting our Nation's adult \n     education and family literacy needs. Also enclosed is a \n     section-by-section analysis summarizing the contents of the \n     bill. I am sending an identical letter to the Speaker of the \n     House.\n       As part of the G.I. Bill for America's Workers, the \n     Administration is consolidating and restructuring nearly 70 \n     separate programs into a streamlined system to empower youth \n     and adults to acquire the education and skills they need for \n     new and better jobs. The Adult Education and Family Literacy \n     Reform Act is central to this goal.\n       Results from the 1993 National Adult Literacy Survey reveal \n     a literacy crisis in this country. More than 20 percent of \n     adults performed at or below a 5th-grade level in reading and \n     math--far below the level needed for effective participation \n     in the workforce. And because parents' educational level is a \n     strong predictor of children's academic success, the effects \n     of this crisis extend beyond adults to their children. \n     Despite the obvious need for literacy services among our \n     Nation's adults, the recent National Evaluation of Adult \n     Education Programs found that the current Adult Education \n     program serves only small percentage of adults in need of \n     services and that, while many adults benefit from \n     participation in the program, many leave before they achieve \n     any literacy gains. Overall, the current configuration of \n     adult education and family literacy programs is too diffuse \n     and diverts human and financial resources from what should be \n     the focus of all Federal literacy efforts: the provision of \n     high-quality, results-oriented services.\n       The Administration recognizes that adults who need to \n     improve their educational skills will be hindered in the \n     workplace, and in promoting their children's progress in \n     school, if they do not have access to adult education and \n     family literacy programs that meet their needs. In response, \n     the enclosed bill creates a performance partnership designed \n     around give broad principles--streamlining, flexibility, \n     quality, targeting, and consumer choice--described in detail \n     below.\n       First, our strategy would streamline a dozen existing adult \n     education and family literacy programs into a single State \n     grant that has a clear purpose and is aimed at high \n     standards. In addition, the enclosed bill would cut in half \n     the number of State planning requirements. These changes \n     would save States time and money and allow them to focus more \n     attention on improving the quality of their programs.\n       Our second principle is flexibility. To place decision-\n     making in the hands of the States, the bill would eliminate \n     several restrictions on the use of funds, such as the current \n     mandatory set-aside for services to institutionalized \n     individuals, the requirement that States make ``Gateway \n     Grants'' to public housing authorities, and the cap on State \n     expenditures for adult secondary education. States could use \n     Federal funds to support a range of services in the mix that \n     they--not the Federal Government--determine would best meet \n     the needs of adults in their States. These services would \n     include parenting education, basic skills education, high \n     school equivalency instruction, early childhood education, \n     and English classes for adults who speak other languages.\n       Because the Even Start Family Literacy Program has shown \n     exceptional promise as a family literacy model, the bill \n     would set aside 25 percent of the funds available for \n     subgrants for Even Start Family Literacy Programs. However, \n     if a State is already meeting the family literacy needs of \n     its residents through a program of comparable quality, the \n     Secretary could modify or waive this requirement.\n       We have also built in other flexibility provisions. For \n     example, a new waiver authority would permit States to \n     request, for themselves or for the local service providers, \n     waivers of statutory or regulatory provisions of related \n     Federal programs, such as Part A of Title I of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the School-to-Work \n     Opportunities Act of 1994, the Job Training Partnership Act, \n     and the proposed Carl D. Perkins Career Preparation Education \n     Act, in order to facilitate more effective implementation of \n     adult education and family literacy programs.\n       Third, the Administration believes that strong \n     accountability provisions must go hand-in-hand with increased \n     flexibility and that, combined, these elements improve the \n     overall quality of education programs. To this end, the bill \n     would build on current accountability provisions in Adult \n     Education and Even Start by requiring States to develop or \n     modify their own performances goals and indicators and \n     describe them in their State plans. States would use these \n     goals and indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of local \n     programs. The Department would assist States in developing \n     their performance goals and indicators by providing technical \n     assistance. If, after a reasonable period of time, and the \n     opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary determines\n      that a State is not making sufficient progress toward its \n     performance goals, the bill would authorize the Secretary \n     to withhold Federal funds.\n       Solid evaluation requirements are also key to building \n     better programs. While the Adult Education Act requires \n     States to evaluate annually 20 percent of their grant \n     recipients, it neither requires nor encourages subgrantees to \n     evaluate themselves. Our bill would require a biennial local \n     evaluation, whose results local providers would describe in \n     their applications for subgrants. States would then consider \n     those results in awarding funds to applicants seeking to \n     provide services in various localities.\n       The bill also includes incentives for exceptional State and \n     local performance. The new Act would authorize the Secretary \n     to use up to five percent of the appropriation to make \n     National Excellence Awards to States with exemplary adult \n     education and family literacy programs. States could also \n     reward exemplary local programs by using up to five percent \n     of their allotments for financial incentive awards.\n       The bill includes additional quality-enhancing provisions. \n     A reservation of up to ten percent of State funds for \n     leadership activities, including professional development and \n     training, and the development, acquisition, and promotion of \n     advanced technologies, would encourage program improvement. \n     Research and development, evaluation, and demonstration of \n     model and innovative programs would take place at the Federal \n     level through the National Leadership authority. Such \n     activities would expand our understanding of what works in \n     adult education programs, thereby helping States to improve \n     the effectiveness of their programs. The bill would also \n     authorize the National Institute for Literacy to continue in \n     its current role as a national resource on literacy issues.\n       Fourth, our bill would target funds to States and local \n     areas with the greatest need \n     [[Page S6530]] for adult education and family literacy \n     services. A new funding formula would distribute 50 percent \n     of the funds based on the adult education population \n     (excluding in-school students) and 50 percent based on adults \n     living in poverty. In making determinations regarding local \n     applications, States would be required to give preference for \n     funding to those applicants that serve local areas with the \n     highest concentrations of individuals in poverty or with low \n     levels of literacy, or both.\n       Our final principle is consumer choice. In addition to \n     allowing States flexibility to choose the services they \n     offer, the enclosed bill would also expand adult learners' \n     choices. By encouraging States to establish strong links with \n     one-stop career centers, job-training programs, and social \n     service agencies, the Administration's bill would facilitate \n     the dissemination of information about the availability, \n     services, and student outcomes of adult education and \n     literacy programs. As learners make more informed choices \n     about the programs they enter, the likelihood of their \n     success in adult education and family literacy programs \n     should improve.\n       I encourage Congress to act swiftly on our bill. By \n     creating a single funding stream to States, the bill responds \n     to concerns regarding the potential duplication of adult \n     education and literacy programs. In doing so, the bill \n     consolidates separate discretionary programs for library \n     literacy, workplace literacy, and literacy programs for \n     prisoners and the homeless. Although the Administration's \n     bill would eliminate many narrow, categorical programs, we \n     have taken steps to ensure that needy populations and \n     promising practices are emphasized in our proposal. The bill \n     permits States to continue to use libraries and the workplace \n     as sites for the provision of services. It also requires \n     States to assess the adult education and family literacy \n     needs of hard-to-serve and most-in-need individuals, such as \n     the homeless and the incarcerated, and describe programs' \n     capacity to meet those needs. Targeting provisions of the \n     bill also would ensure that local areas with high \n     concentrations of individuals in poverty or low levels of \n     literacy, or both, receive priority for Federal funds.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this proposal to Congress \n     and that its adoption would be in accord with the program of \n     the President.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                 Richard W. Riley,\n     The Secretary.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Adult Education and Family Literacy Reform Act of 1995--Section-by-\n                            Section Analysis\n\n\n       title i of the bill--amendments to the adult education act\n\n       Section 101. Amendment. Section 101 of the bill would amend \n     the Adult Education Act (``current law'') in its entirety, as \n     described below.\n       In general, this amendment would consolidate the current \n     Adult Education programs, eliminating the many separate and \n     prescriptive categorical programs, and the Even Start program \n     under Title I, Part B of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 into a simplified, flexible, \n     comprehensive, performance partnership between Federal and \n     State and local providers of adult education and family \n     literacy services. States would build on their \n     accomplishments under current law and establish their own \n     performance goals and indicators. The Federal Government \n     would support State and local efforts with national \n     leadership and evaluation activities, national performance \n     awards to States, and waivers from specific statutory and \n     regulatory rules.\n\n         Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (the ``Act'')\n\n       Section 1. Short title; table of contents. Section 1 of the \n     Act would propose that the amended Adult Education Act be \n     cited as the ``Adult Education and Family Literacy Act'' \n     (``the Act''). This section would also set forth a table of \n     contents for the Act.\n       Section 2. Declaration of policy, findings, and purpose. \n     Section 2 of the Act would set forth the findings and purpose \n     of the Act.\n       Subsection (a) would set forth congressional findings.\n       Subsection (b) would state that the purpose of the Act is \n     to create a performance partnership with States and \n     localities for the provision of adult education and family \n     literacy services so that, as called for in the National \n     Education Goals, all adults who need such services will, as \n     appropriate, be able to: (1) become literate and obtain the \n     knowledge and skills needed to compete in a global economy \n     and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship; \n     (2) complete a high school education; (3) become and remain \n     actively involved in their children's education in order to \n     ensure their children's readiness for, and success in, \n     school. This purpose would be pursued through: (1) building \n     on State and and local education reforms supported by Goals \n     2000: Educate America Act and other Federal and State \n     legislation; (2) consolidating numerous Federal adult \n     education and literacy programs into a single, flexible \n     grant; (3) tying local programs to challenging State-\n     developed performance goals that are consistent with the \n     purpose of this Act; (4) holding States and localities \n     accountable for achieving such goals; (5) building program \n     quality though such measures as encouraging greater use of \n     technologies in adult education and family literacy programs \n     and better professional development of educators working in \n     those programs; (6) integrating adult education and family \n     literacy programs with States' school-to-work opportunities \n     systems, career preparation education services and \n     activities, job training programs, early childhood and \n     elementary school programs, and other related activities; and \n     (7) supporting the improvement of State and local activities \n     through nationally significant efforts in research, \n     development, demonstration, dissemination, evaluation, \n     capacity-building, data collection, professional development, \n     and technical assistance.\n       Section 3. Authorization of appropriations. Section 3 of \n     the Act would establish a ten-year authorization of \n     appropriations for State and national programs. A ten-year \n     authorization would facilitate stable growth and reform of \n     the program.\n       Subsection (a) would authorize $490,487,000 for fiscal year \n     1996 and such sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal \n     years 1997 through 20005 to carry out the Act. Subsection (b) \n     would, from the amount appropriated in any fiscal year, \n     authorize the Secretary to reserve not more than 3 percent to \n     carry out sections 201 (national leadership activities) and \n     203 (National Institute for Literacy) of the Act, and not \n     more than $5,000,000 for Even Start family literacy programs \n     for migratory and Indian families under section 104(c) of the \n     Act. Beginning in fiscal year 1998, the Secretary would also \n     be authorized to reserve not more than 5 percent of section \n     202 (national performance awards).\n\n\n        Title i of the Act--Adult Education and Family Literacy\n\n       Section 101. Priorities. Section 101 of the Act would \n     require that, in order to prepare adults for family, work, \n     citizenship, and job training, and adults and their children \n     for success in future learning, funds under this title must \n     be used to support the development, implementation, and \n     improvement of adult education and family literacy programs \n     at the State and local levels.\n       In using funds under the title, States and local recipients \n     would be required to give priority to: (1) services and \n     activities designed to ensure that all adults have the \n     opportunity to achieve to challenging State performance \n     standards for literacy proficiency, including basic literacy, \n     English language proficiency, and completion of high school \n     or its equivalent; (2) services and activities designed to \n     enable parents to prepare their children for school, enhance \n     their children's language and cognitive abilities, and \n     promote their own career advancement;\n      and (3) adult education and family literacy programs that \n     are built on a strong foundation of research and effective \n     educational practices; effectively employ advances in \n     technology, as well as learning in the context of family, \n     work, and the community; are staffed by well-trained \n     instructors, counselors and administrators; are of \n     sufficient intensity and duration for participants to \n     achieve substantial learning gains; establish strong links \n     with elementary and secondary schools, postsecondary \n     institutions, one-stop career centers, job-training \n     programs, and social service agencies; and offer flexible \n     schedules and, when necessary, support services to enable \n     people to attend and complete programs.\n       Section 102. State grants for adult education and family \n     literacy. Section 102(a) of the Act would require the \n     Secretary, from funds available for State grants under \n     section 3 for each fiscal year and in accordance with section \n     111 of the Act, to make a grant to each State that has an \n     approved State plan under section 106 of the Act, to assist \n     that State in developing, implementing, and improving adult \n     education and family literacy programs within the State.\n       Section 102(b) of the Act would authorize a State, from the \n     amount awarded to it for any fiscal year under subsection \n     (a), to use: (1) up to 5 percent, or $80,000, whichever is \n     greater, for the cost of administering its program under this \n     title; (2) up to 10 percent for leadership activities under \n     section 103 of the Act; and (3) beginning in fiscal year \n     1998, 5 percent for financial incentives or awards to one or \n     more eligible recipients in recognition of exemplary quality \n     or innovation in adult education or family literacy services \n     and activities, or exemplary services and activities for \n     individuals who are most in need of such services and \n     activities, or are hardest to serve, or both. Such incentives \n     or awards would be determined by the State through a peer \n     review process, using the performance goals and indicators \n     described in section 108 and, if appropriate, other criteria.\n       Section 102(b) would also require that the remainder of the \n     State's funds be used for subgrants to eligible applicants \n     under section 107, except that at least 25 percent of such \n     remainder would be required to be used for Even Start family \n     literacy programs under section 104 of the Act, unless the \n     State demonstrates in its State plan under section 106 of the \n     Act, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that it will \n     otherwise meet the needs of individuals in the State for \n     family literacy programs in a manner that is consistent with \n     the purpose of this Act.\n       Section 102(c) of the Act would require that the Federal \n     share of expenditures to carry out a State plan under section \n     106 of the Act be paid from the State's grant under \n     subsection (a). However, such Federal share could be no \n     greater than 75 percent of the cost of carrying out the State \n     plan for each fiscal year, except that with respect to \n     [[Page S6531]] Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and \n     the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federal share could be 100 \n     percent. Section 102(c) of the Act would permit the State's \n     share of expenditures in carrying out its State plan to be in \n     cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including only non-Federal \n     funds that are used for adult education and family literacy \n     activities in a manner that is consistent with the purpose of \n     this Act.\n       Section 102(d) of the Act would require State-level \n     maintenance of effort. Under subsection (d)(1), a State would \n     be permitted to receive funds under the title for any fiscal \n     year only if the Secretary finds that the aggregate \n     expenditures of the State for adult education and family \n     literacy by such State for the preceding fiscal year were not \n     less than 90 percent of such aggregate expenditures for the \n     second preceding fiscal year. The Secretary would be required \n     to reduce the amount of the allocation of funds to a State, \n     under section 102(a), for any fiscal year in the exact \n     proportion to which a State falls below 90 percent of the \n     aggregate expenditures for the second preceding fiscal year. \n     Subsection (d)(3) would permit the Secretary to waive the \n     maintenance-of-effort requirements if the Secretary \n     determines that such a waiver would be equitable due to \n     exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a \n     natural disaster or a precipitous decline in the financial \n     resource of the State. Subsection (d)(4) would state that no \n     lesser amount of State expenditures under paragraphs (2) and \n     (3) could be used for computing the effort required under \n     subsection (d)(1) for subsequent years.\n       Section 103. State leaderships activities. Section 103 of \n     the Act would require States to use their State leadership \n     funds to conduct activities of Statewide significance that \n     develop, implement, or improve programs of adult education \n     and family literacy, consistent with the State plan under \n     section 106. Such activities would include one or more of the \n     following: (1) professional development and training; (2) \n     disseminating curricula for adult education and family \n     literacy programs; (3) monitoring and evaluating the quality \n     of, and improvement in, services and activities conducted \n     with assistance under this title, including establishing \n     performance goals and indicators under section 109(a) of the \n     Act, in order to assess program quality and improvement; (4) \n     establishing State content standards for adult education and \n     family literacy programs; (5) establishing challenging State \n     performance standards for literacy proficiency; (6) promoting \n     the integration of literacy instruction and occupational \n     skill training, and linkages with employers; (7) promoting \n     the use of and acquiring instructional and management \n     software and technology; (8) establishing or operating State \n     or regional adult literacy resource centers; (9) developing \n     and\n      participating in networks and consortia of States that seek \n     to establish and implement adult education and family \n     literacy programs that have significance to the State or \n     region, and may have national significance; and (10) other \n     activities of Statewide significance that promote the \n     purposes of the Act.\n       Section 104. Even Start Family Literacy Programs. Section \n     104 of the Act would require each State that receives a grant \n     under section 102(a) of the Act for any fiscal year to use \n     the funds reserved under section 102(b)(4) of the Act (unless \n     the State demonstrates to the Secretary that it will \n     otherwise meet the needs of individuals in the State for \n     family literacy programs) to award Even Start family literacy \n     subgrants to partnerships composed of one or more local \n     educational agencies and one or more community-based \n     organizations, institutions of higher education, private non-\n     profit organizations, or public agencies (other than local \n     educational agencies). Such Even Start family literacy \n     programs must: (1) provide opportunities (including home-\n     based instructional services) for joint participation by \n     parents or guardians (including parents or guardians who are \n     within the State's compulsory school attendance age range, so \n     long as a local educational agency provides, or ensures the \n     availability of, their basic education), other family \n     members, and children; (2) provide developmentally \n     appropriate childhood education for children from birth \n     through age seven; (3) identify and recruit families that are \n     most in need of family literacy services, as indicated by low \n     levels of income and adult literacy (including limited \n     English proficiency), and such other need-related indicators \n     as may be appropriate; and (4) enable participants to succeed \n     through services and activities designed to meet their needs, \n     such as support services and flexible class schedules.\n       From funds reserved under section 3(b)(1)(C) of the Act for \n     any fiscal year, the Secretary would be required, under such \n     terms and conditions as he or she establishes, to support \n     Even Start family literacy programs through grants to, or \n     cooperative agreements with, eligible applicants under \n     section 107(b) of the Act for migratory families and with \n     Indian tribes and tribal organizations for Indian families. \n     Assistance to Indian tribes and tribal organizations for \n     Indian families under this Act could be integrated with other \n     programs under the Indian Employment Training and Related \n     Services Demonstration Act of 1992.\n       Section 105. State Administration. Section 105 of the Act \n     would require a State desiring to receive a grant under \n     section 102(a) of the Act to designate, consistent with State \n     law, an education agency or agencies that shall be \n     responsible for the administration of services and activities \n     under this title, including the development, submission, and \n     implementation of the State plan; consultation with other \n     appropriate agencies, groups, and individuals that are \n     involved in, or interested in, the development and \n     implementation of programs assisted under this title; and \n     coordination with other State and Federal education and \n     training programs.\n       Section 105(b) of the Act would require that whenever a \n     State imposes any rule or policy relating to the \n     administration and operation of programs funded by this \n     title, it must identify the rule or policy as a State-imposed \n     requirement.\n       Section 106. State Plan. Section 106(a) of the Act would \n     require, except as provided in subsection (f), each State \n     desiring to receive a grant under this title for any fiscal \n     year to submit to, or have on file with, the Secretary a \n     five-year State plan that is approved by the designated State \n     agency or agencies under section 105(a) of the Act. A State \n     may submit its State plan as part of a comprehensive plan \n     that includes State plan provisions under one or more of the \n     following statutes: section 14302 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965; the Carl D. Perkins Career \n     Preparation Education Act of 1995; the Goals 2000: Educate \n     America Act; the Job Training Partnership Act; and the \n     School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994.\n       Section 106(b) of the Act would require the State, in \n     developing its State plan, and any revisions to the plan, to \n     base its plan or revisions on a recent, objective assessment \n     of: (1) the needs of individuals in the State for adult \n     education and family literacy programs, including individuals \n     most in need or hardest to serve; and (2) the capacity of \n     programs and providers to meet those needs, taking into \n     account the priorities under section 101 of the Act and the \n     State's performance goals under section 109(a) of the Act.\n       Section 106(c) of the Act would require the State, in \n     developing its State plan, and any revisions to the plan, to \n     consult widely with individuals, agencies, organizations, and \n     institutions in the State that have an interest in the \n     provision and quality of adult education and family literacy.\n       Section 106(d) of the Act would require the State plan to \n     be in such form and contain such information and assurances \n     as the Secretary may require, and include: (1) a summary of \n     the methods used to conduct the assessment under subsection \n     (b) and the findings of that assessment; (2) a description of \n     how, in addressing the needs identified in the State's \n     assessment, funds under this title will be used to establish \n     adult education and family literacy programs, or improve or \n     expand current programs, that will lead to high-quality \n     learning outcomes, including measurable learning gains, for \n     individuals in such programs; (3) a statement of the State's \n     performance goals and indicators established under section \n     109, or in the first such plan a description of how the State \n     will establish such performance\n      goals and indicators; (4) a description of the criteria the \n     State will use to award funds under this title to eligible \n     applicants under section 107, including a description of \n     how the State will ensure that its selection of applicants \n     to operate programs assisted under this title will reflect \n     the findings of program evaluations carried out under \n     section 110(a); (5) a description of how the State will \n     integrate services and activities under this Act, \n     including planning and coordination of programs, with \n     those of other agencies, institutions, and organizations \n     involved in adult education and family literacy in order \n     to ensure effective use of funds and to avoid duplication \n     of services; (6) a description of the leadership \n     activities the State will carry out under section 103; and \n     (7) any comments the Governor may have on the State plan. \n     Section 106(d) of the Act would also require the State \n     plan to provide assurances that: (1) the State will comply \n     with the requirements of this Act and the provisions of \n     the State plan; (2) the State will use such fiscal control \n     and accounting procedures as are necessary for the proper \n     and efficient administration of this title; and (3) \n     programs funded under this title will be of such size, \n     scope, and quality as to give realistic promise of \n     furthering the purpose of this Act.\n       Section 106(e) of the Act would require the designated \n     State agency or agencies, when changes in conditions or other \n     factors require substantial modifications to an approved \n     State plan, to submit a revision to the plan to the \n     Secretary. Such a revision would have to be approved by the \n     designated State agency or agencies.\n       Section 106(f) of the Act would authorize a State, for \n     fiscal year 1996 only, to submit a one year State plan to the \n     Secretary that either satisfies the specific requirements of \n     this section or describes how the State will complete the \n     development of its State plan with respect to those specific \n     requirements within the following year. A State may use funds \n     reserved under section 102(b)(2) to complete the development \n     of its State plan. A one year State plan under this \n     subsection would have to be developed in accordance with \n     subsection (c); and contain the assurances described in \n     subsection (d)(8). In order to receive a grant under section \n     102(a) for fiscal year 1997, a State that submits a one year \n     State plan under this subsection would have to submit a four \n     year State plan that covers fiscal year 1997 and the three \n     succeeding fiscal years.\n       [[Page S6532]] Section 106(g) of the Act would require the \n     designated State agency or agencies to submit the State plan, \n     and any revisions to the State plan, to the Governor for \n     review and comment; and ensure that any comments the Governor \n     may have are included with the State plan, or revision, when \n     the State plan, or revision, is submitted to the Secretary.\n       Section 106(h) of the Act would require the Secretary to \n     approve a State plan, or a revision to an approved State \n     plan, if it meets the requirements of this section and is of \n     sufficient quality to meet the purpose of this Act. The \n     subsection would also prohibit the Secretary from finally \n     disapproving a State plan, or a revision to an approved State \n     plan, except after giving the State reasonable notice and an \n     opportunity for a hearing. The Secretary would be required to \n     establish a peer review process to make recommendations \n     regarding approval of State plans and revisions to the State \n     plans.\n       Section 107. Subgrants to eligible applicants. Section \n     107(a) of the Act would require States, from funds available \n     under section 102(b)(4) of the Act, to make subgrants to \n     eligible applicants to develop, implement, and improve adult \n     education and family literacy programs within the State. To \n     the extent practicable, States would make multi-year \n     subgrants.\n       Under section 107(b), except for subgrants for Even Start \n     family literacy programs under section 104, entities eligible \n     to apply to the State for a subgrant would be: (1) local \n     educational agencies; (2) community-based organizations; (3) \n     institutions of higher education; (4) public and private \n     nonprofit agencies (including State and local welfare \n     agencies, corrections agencies, public libraries, and public \n     housing authorities); and (5) consortia of such agencies, \n     organizations, institutions, or partnerships, including \n     consortia that include one or more for-profit agencies, \n     organizations, or institutions, if such agencies, \n     organizations, or institutions can make a significant \n     contribution to attaining the objectives of the Act. Each \n     State receiving funds under title I would be required to \n     ensure that all the above-mentioned eligible applicants \n     receive equitable consideration for subgrants under this \n     section.\n       Section 108. Applications from eligible applicants. Section \n     108 of the Act would require any eligible applicant under \n     sections 104(a) (Even Start partnerships) or 107(b)(1) (other \n     eligible applicants) that desires a subgrant under title I to \n     submit an application to the State containing such \n     information and assurances as the State may reasonably \n     require. Such information must include: (1) a description of \n     the applicant's current adult education and family literacy \n     programs, if any; (2) a description of how funds awarded \n     under this title will be spent; (3) a description of how the \n     applicant's program will help the State address the needs \n     identified in the State's assessment under section 106(b)(1); \n     (4) the projected goals of the applicant with respect to \n     participant recruitment, retention, and educational \n     achievement, and how the applicant will measure and report to \n     the State regarding the information required in section \n     110(a); and (5) any cooperative arrangements the applicant \n     has with others (including arrangements with social service \n     agencies, one-stop career centers, business, industry, and \n     volunteer\n      literacy organizations) that have been made to deliver adult \n     education and family literacy programs.\n       In determining which applicants receive funds under this \n     title, section 108(b) of the Act would require the State to \n     give preference to those applicants that serve local areas \n     with the high concentrations of individuals in poverty, or \n     with low levels of literacy (including English language \n     proficiency), or both, and to consider the results of the \n     evaluations required under section 110(a), if any, and the \n     degree to which the applicant will coordinate with and \n     utilize other literacy and social services available in the \n     community.\n       Section 109. State performance goals and indicators. \n     Section 109(a) of the Act would require any State desiring to \n     receive a grant under section 102(a) of the Act, in \n     consultation with individuals, agencies, organizations, and \n     institutions described in section 106(c), to: (1) identify \n     performance goals that define the level of student \n     achievement to be attained in adult education and family \n     literacy programs funded under title I, and express such \n     goals in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable form; and \n     (2) identify performance indicators that State and local \n     recipients will use in measuring or assessing progress toward \n     achieving such goals. By July 1, 1997, such performance \n     indicators must include, at least: (1) achievement in \n     linguistic skills, including English language skills; (2) \n     receipt of a high school diploma or its equivalent; (3) entry \n     into a postsecondary school, job training program, \n     employment, or career advancement; and (4) successful \n     transition of children to school.\n       Section 109(b) of the Act would authorize a State, except \n     as provided in subsection (a)(3), to continue to use the \n     indicators of program quality that it developed under section \n     331(a)(2) of current law, to the extent they are consistent \n     with the State's performance goals.\n       Section 109(c) of the Act would require the Secretary to \n     provide technical assistance to States regarding the \n     development of such performance goals and indicators and \n     authorize the Secretary to use funds reserved under section \n     3(b)(1)(B) of the Act to provide such technical assistance.\n       Section 110. Evaluation, improvement, and accountability. \n     Section 110(a) of the Act would require each recipient of a \n     subgrant under title I of the Act to evaluate biennially, \n     using the performance goals and indicators established under \n     section 109(a) of the Act, the programs supported under title \n     I and report to the State regarding the effectiveness of its \n     programs in addressing the priorities under section 101 and \n     the needs identified in the State assessment under section \n     106(b)(1).\n       Section 110(b) of the Act would provide that if a State \n     determines, based on the applicable performance goals and \n     indicators and the evaluations under subsection (a), that a \n     subgrant recipient is not making substantial progress in \n     achieving the purpose of this Act, the State may, but is not \n     required to, work jointly with the local recipient to develop \n     an improvement plan. If, after not more than two years of \n     implementation of the improvement plan, the State determines \n     that the recipient is not making substantial progress, the \n     State must take whatever corrective action it deems \n     necessary, which may include termination of funding or the \n     implementation of alternative service arrangements, \n     consistent with the State law. The State could take such \n     corrective action only after it provided technical assistance \n     to the recipient and ensured that corrective action allowed \n     for continued services and activities to the recipient's \n     students. The State would have to report biennially to the \n     Secretary on the quality and effectiveness of the adult \n     education and family literacy programs funded through its \n     subgrants under title I, based on the performance goals and \n     indicators under section 109(a) and the needs identified in \n     the State assessment under section 106(b)(1).\n       Section 110(d) of the Act would require that if the \n     Secretary determines that the State is not properly \n     implementing its responsibilities under subsection (b), or is \n     not making substantial progress in meeting the purpose of \n     this Act based on its goals and indicators under section 109, \n     he or she must work with the State to implement improvement \n     activities. If, after a reasonable time, but not earlier than \n     one year after the State implements such activities, the \n     Secretary determines that the State is not making sufficient \n     progress, based on its performance goals and indicators, the \n     Secretary would be required, after notice and opportunity for \n     a hearing, to withhold from the State all, or a portion, of \n     the State's allotment under this title. The Secretary would \n     be given the authority to use funds withheld to provide, \n     through alternative arrangements, services and activities \n     within the State that meet the purposes of this Act.\n       Section 111. Allotments; reallocation. Section 111(a) of \n     the Act would, subject to the hold-harmless provisions in \n     subsection (b), from the funds available under section 102(a) \n     for each fiscal year, require the Secretary to allot to each \n     State: (1) a sum that bears the same ratio to one-half that \n     amount as the number of individuals in the State who are 16 \n     years of age or older and not enrolled, or required to be \n     enrolled, in secondary school and who do not possess a high \n     school diploma or its equivalent bears to the number of such \n     individuals in all the States; and (2) a sum that bears the \n     same ratio to one-half that amount as the number of \n     individuals in the State who are 18 years of age or older and \n     who are living at or below poverty bears to the number of \n     such individuals in all the States. The Secretary would be \n     required to allot to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico an \n     amount equal to 2.95 percent of the funds available under \n     section 102(a) for each fiscal year. For the purpose of \n     subsection (a), the term `State' would be deemed to exclude \n     the Puerto Rico. The numbers of individuals specified in \n     paragraph (1) would be determined by the Secretary on the \n     basis of the latest estimates available to the Department \n     that are satisfactory to the Secretary.\n       Section 111(b)(1) of the Act would provide that, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law and subject to \n     paragraph (2): (1) for fiscal year 1996, no State shall \n     receive under title I of this Act less than 90 percent of the \n     sum of the payments made to the State for the fiscal year \n     1995 for programs authorized by the section 313 of the Adult \n     Education Act, section 1202 (Even Start) of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and sections \n     202(c)(1)(C) and 262(c)(1)(C) of the Job Training Partnership \n     Act, as those statutes were in effect prior to the enactment \n     of this bill; and (2) for fiscal year 1997, no State shall \n     receive under Title I of this Act less than 90 percent of the \n     amount it received under Title I for fiscal year 1996. \n     Section 111(b)(2) of the Act would provide that, if for any \n     fiscal year the amount available for allotment under this \n     section is insufficient to satisfy the provisions of \n     subsection (b)(1), the Secretary is to ratably reduce the \n     payments to all States for such services and activities as \n     necessary.\n       Section 111(c) of the Act would provide for reallotment of \n     any unneeded portion of a State's allotment under subsection \n     (a) for any fiscal year.\n       Section 111(d) of the Act would require the Secretary, by \n     September 30, 2000, to conduct a study to determine the \n     availability and reliability of statistical data on the \n     number of immigrant and limited English proficient \n     individuals in each State, and report to the Congress on the \n     feasibility and advisability of including such population as \n     a factor in the formula under subsection (a)(1).\n\n\n                Title II of the Act--National Leadership\n\n       Section 201. National Leadership Activities. Section 201 of \n     the Act would authorize \n     [[Page S6533]] the Secretary, from the amount reserved under \n     section 3(b)(1)(B) of the Act for any fiscal year, to \n     establish a program of national leadership and evaluation \n     activities to enhance the quality of adult education and \n     family literacy nationwide. The Secretary would be authorized \n     to carry out such activities directly or through grants, \n     contracts, and cooperative agreements. Funds under this \n     section could be used for: (1) research and development; (2) \n     demonstration of model and innovative programs; (3) \n     dissemination; (4) evaluations and assessments, including \n     independent assessments of services and activities assisted \n     under this Act and of the condition and progress of literacy \n     of the United States; (5) capacity building at the State and \n     local levels; (6) data collection; (7) professional \n     development; (8) technical assistance; and (9) other \n     activities designed to enhance the quality of adult education \n     and family literacy nationwide.\n       Section 202. Awards for National Excellence, Section 202 of \n     the Act would authorize the Secretary, from the amount \n     reserved under section 3(b)(1)(A) of the Act for any fiscal \n     year after fiscal year 1997, and through a peer review \n     process, to make performance awards to one or more States \n     that have: (1) exceeded in an out-standing manner their \n     performance goals established under section 109(a) the Act; \n     (2) made exemplary progress in developing, implementing, or \n     improving their adult education and family literacy programs \n     in accordance with the priorities described in section 101 of \n     the Act; or (3) provided exemplary services and activities \n     for those individuals within the State who are most in need \n     of adult education and family literacy services, or are \n     hardest to serve.\n       Section 203. National Institute for Literacy. Section 203 \n     of the Act would reauthorize the National Institute for \n     Literacy (the ``Institute'').\n       Subsection (a) would clarify the purpose of the Institute \n     by requiring it to: (1) provide national leadership; (2) \n     coordinate literacy services; and (3) be a national resource \n     for adult education and family literacy, by providing the \n     best and most current information available and supporting \n     the creation of new ways to offer improved services.\n       Subsection (b) would establish the Institute, to be \n     administered by the terms of an interagency agreement entered \n     into by the Secretaries of Education, Labor, and Health and \n     Human Services (the ``Interagency Group''). The Secretary \n     could include in the Institute any research and development \n     center, institute, or clearinghouse established within the \n     Department of Education whose purpose is determined by the \n     Secretary to be related to the purpose of the Institute.\n       Under subsection (b), the Interagency Group would consider \n     the recommendations of the National Institute for Literacy \n     Advisory Board in planning the goals of the Institute and in \n     implementing any programs to achieve such goals.

Waivers. Section 301 of the Act sets forth \n     waiver provisions, in order to provide the flexibility States \n     need to carry out adult education and family literacy \n     programs.\n       Subsection (a)(1) provides that any State may request a \n     waiver by the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of the \n     Interior, or the Secretary of Labor, as appropriate, of one \n     or more statutory or regulatory provisions in order to carry \n     out adult education and family literacy programs under title \n     I more effectively. Subsection (a) (2) provides that an \n     Indian tribe or tribal organization may request a waiver by a \n     Secretary described in subsection (a) (1), as appropriate, of \n     one or more statutory or regulatory provisions described in \n     subsection (c) in order to carry out an Even Start family \n     literacy program under section 104(c) more effectively.\n       Subsection (b) would, with some exceptions, authorize a \n     Secretary described in subsection (a) (1) to waive any \n     requirement of any statute listed in subsection (c), or of \n     the regulations issued under that statute. In both cases, the \n     Secretary would be authorized to grant a waiver to a State \n     that requests one: (1) if, and only to the extent that, the \n     Secretary determines that the requirement impedes the State's \n     or subgrant recipient's ability to carry out adult education \n     and family literacy programs or activities in an effective \n     manner; (2) if the State waives, or agrees to waive, any \n     similar requirements of State law; (3) if, in the case of a \n     statewide waiver, the State has provided all subgrant \n     recipients of assistance under title I in the State with \n     notice of, and an opportunity to comment on, the State's \n     proposal to request a waiver and has submitted these comments \n     to the Secretary; and (4) if the State provides such \n     information as the Secretary reasonably requires in order to \n     make such determinations.\n       Subsection (b) would require a Secretary to act promptly on \n     any waiver request. This subsection would also provide that \n     each waiver shall be for no longer than five years. However, \n     a Secretary may extend the period if the Secretary determines \n     that the waiver has been effective in enabling the State to \n     carry out the purpose of the Act.\n       Subsection (c)(1) would list the following statutes as \n     subject to waiver by the Secretary of Education: (1) this \n     Act; (2) part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (authorizing programs \n     [[Page S6534]] and activities to help disadvantaged children \n     meet high standards); (3) part B of title II of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower Professional Development program); (4) title VI of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     (Innovative Education Program Strategies); (5) part C of \n     title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (Emergency Immigrant Education program); (6) the School-\n     to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994, but only with the \n     concurrence of the Secretary of Labor; and (7) the Carl D. \n     Perkins Career Preparation Education Act of 1995.\n       Subsection (c) (2) would authorize the Secretary of the \n     Interior to waive the provisions of part B of the Education \n     Amendments of 1978.\n       Subsection (c) (3) would list the following statutes as \n     subject to waiver by the Secretary of Labor: (1) the Job \n     Training Partnership Act; and (2) the School-to-Work \n     Opportunities Act of 1994, but only with the concurrence of \n     the Secretary of Education.\n       It is not necessary to include Head Start programs in the \n     waiver authority section of this bill, because there already \n     exists sufficient authority in Head Start legislation for a \n     wide range of collaborative and coordination efforts with \n     adult education and family literacy programs.\n       Subsection (d) would prohibit the Secretary from waiving \n     any statutory or regulatory requirement of the programs \n     listed in subsection (c) that relate to: (1) the basic \n     purposes or goals of the affected programs; (2) maintenance \n     of effort; (3) comparability of services; (4) the equitable \n     participation of students attending private schools; (5) \n     parental participation and involvement; (6) the distribution \n     of funds to States or to local recipients; (7) the \n     eligibility of an individual for participation in the \n     affected programs; (8) public health or safety, labor \n     standards, civil rights, occupational safety and health, or \n     environmental protection; or (9) prohibitions or restrictions \n     relating to the construction of buildings or facilities.\n       Subsection (e) would require a Secretary to review \n     periodically the performance of any State or local recipient \n     for which the Secretary has granted a waiver and to terminate \n     the waiver, if the Secretary determines that the performance \n     of the State affected by the waiver or the State fails to \n     waive similar requirements of State law.\n       Section 302. Definitions. Section 302 would define the \n     terms ``adult,'' ``adult education,'' ``community-based \n     organization,'' ``family literacy,'' ``Indian tribes'' and \n     ``tribal organizations,'' ``individual of limited English \n     proficiency,'' ``institution of higher education,'' \n     ``literacy,'' ``local educational agency,'' ``migratory \n     family,'' ``public housing authority,'' ``Secretary,'' and \n     ``State'' for the purpose of the Act.\n           title ii of the bill--effective dates; transition\n\n       Section 201. Effective date. Section 201 of the bill would \n     provide that the Adult Education and Family Literacy Reform \n     Act of 1995 would take effect on July 1, 1996.\n       Section 202. Transition. Section 202 of the bill would \n     provide that, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, \n     upon enactment of this bill, a State or local recipient of \n     funds under the Adult Education Act, the Even Start Family \n     Literacy Programs of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965, and sections 202(c)(1)(C) and 262(c)(1)(C) of \n     the Job Training Partnership Act, as they were in effect \n     prior to the enactment of this bill, could use any unexpended \n     funds to carry out services and activities that were \n     authorized in by those statutes or by the Adult Education and \n     Family Literacy Act. A State or local recipient of funds \n     under this Act for fiscal year 1996 could use those funds to \n     carry out services and activities that are authorized by \n     either this Act or the Adult Education Act, the Even Start \n     Family Literacy Programs of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965, and sections 202(c)(1)(C) and \n     262(c)(1)(C) of the Job Training Partnership Act, as they \n     were in effect prior to the enactment of this bill.\n\n\n              title iii of the bill--repeal of other acts\n\n       Section 301. Repeals. Section 301 of the bill would repeal \n     Part B (Even Start) of title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965, the National Literacy Act of \n     1991, and Part E (Grants to States for Workplace and \n     Community Transition Training for Incarcerated Youth \n     Offenders) of title X of the Higher Education Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Bradley, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 798. A bill to amend title XVI of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the provisions of supplemental security income benefits, and \nfor the purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               the children's ssi eligibility reform act\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Children's \nSSI Eligibility Reform Act.\n  As my colleagues know, the welfare reform bill passed by the House of \nRepresentatives attempted to address criticisms that have been leveled \nagainst the SSI program. But the House went too far.\n  SSI is the program of last resort for 850,000 children with severe \ndisabilities who live in low income families. The cash assistance \nprovided to these children's families enables them to meet the added \ncosts the disability imposes on the family--whether those costs result \nfrom necessary modifications to the home; day care for siblings while \nthe child in question receives therapy; basic necessities like food, \nshelter, clothing and utilities; transportation expenses in making \nfrequent trips to a therapist or hospital; or the cost of foregoing one \nparent's income in order to care for a child with a disability. SSI \nalso provides for the basic necessities of low income families, in \norder to maximize the likelihood that a child with a disability can \nremain at home.\n  But the SSI program is not without its faults. SSI as it relates to \nchildren has been poorly defined since its inception. There is concern \nthat children who are not sufficiently disabled to merit assistance are \nmaking their way onto the SSI rolls. There have been allegations that \nsome parents have coached their children to feign a disability in order \nto obtain benefits. And there is concern that SSI does nothing to \npromote the improvement of those children with disabilities who could \nimprove with proper assistance.\n  Because of these issues and my concern that the House enacted an ill-\nconceived, sweeping proposal with insufficient data on its impact, I \nconvened a series of psychiatric and disability experts to help me \ndevelop the Children's SSI Eligibility Reform Act. And I am extremely \npleased that Senators Chafee, Jeffords and Bradley have joined me in \nthis effort.\n  This is a bipartisan issue. Republicans and Democrats alike want to \ndo the right thing when it comes to severely disabled children. That's \nwhy we should make every effort to repair the defects in the SSI \nprogram, but do so in a way that protects children with severe \ndisabilities.\n  The House of Representatives, out of frustration with repeated \nreports of abuse under the program, went too far. The House wiped out \nthe Individualized Functional Assessment that was developed to protect \nchildren with disabilities after the Supreme Court's Zebley decision. \nAnd as a result, the vast majority of\n the 250,000 children who currently receive SSI by virtue of the \nassessment would lose all benefits--both SSI cash benefits and \nMedicaid.\n\n  The proposal Senator Chafee, Senator Jeffords, Senator Bradley and I \nare introducing, on the other hand, takes a surgical approach to \nimproving SSI. It targets the problems, not the kids.\n  But none of us can pretend that SSI reform will not eliminate some \nchildren from the rolls. Obviously, it will. Given that fact, our goal \nshould be to remove those who should not be on the program in the first \nplace.\n  In order to accomplish this, our proposal takes several approaches. \nFirst, it clarifies the purpose of the program, which critics argue was \nnever sufficiently defined. It ensures that the purpose of SSI is not \nonly covering the additional costs of caring for children with \ndisabilities and maintaining them at home, but also providing basic \nnecessities and enhancing the opportunity for these children to develop \ninto independent adults.\n  Second, our proposal modifies SSI's medical listings and \nIndividualized Functional Assessment to ensure that only children with \nsevere disabilities are drawing SSI benefits.\n  This is not a modification I take lightly. Members of Congress, for \nthe most part, must acknowledge our ignorance in making clinical \ndiagnoses relating to mental illness and other disabilities. Any \nmodifications we make to the diagnostic tools of clinicians should \nrespect both what we know and do not know, so we do not harm innocent \nchildren.\n  Therefore, while our proposal modifies the medical listings and \nincreases the level of severity required under the Individualized \nFunctional Assessment, it also requires an evaluation of these changes \nby the Social Security Administration.\n  Mr. Chairman, much attention has been paid in this debate to children \nwith mental disorders, and the degree to which they should be eligible \nfor SSI.\n  I think we need to be very careful to avoid denying eligibility to \nsomeone who doesn't look disabled. And as much as we must reform this \nprogram \n[[Page S6535]] to insure its integrity, we must also avoid making \ndecisions based only on anecdotal evidence. A child who may not \n``look'' disabled to the average person may suffer from a severe \ndisability that is just as costly for the family as a physically \ndisabled child.\n  Let me give you an example from North Dakota. The mother of a 6-year-\nold child named Garrett recently visited my office.\n  When Garrett was 4, he was diagnosed with attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder--ADHD. A medication was prescribed for him after \nhe experienced a series of seizures. But the medication caused brain \ndamage which has deprived Garrett of the ability to control his \nnegative emotions.\n  Because Garrett has no neurological control, he is incapable of \nexercising choice in his actions and requires constant supervision. \nGarrett's aggressive disorders have resulted in harm to himself, the \nmembers of his family, and their home.\n  SSI not only has enabled the family to make household repairs when \nGarrett has damaged the house, but also to pay for day care for their \nyounger daughter when Garrett's mother has had to take him to therapy. \nThere is no day care for a youngster like Garrett.\n  Garrett is just one example of the kind of child who should not be \nremoved from SSI. I am hopeful that this Congress will see fit to take \na balanced approach to this issue to ensure that we clean up this \nprogram in a way that is tough, honest and fair.\n  Mr. President, in addition to making the changes to SSI that I have \nalready mentioned, our proposal also:\n  Increases the use of standardized tests to make it virtually \nimpossible for anyone to feign a disability;\n  Expands and better targets SSI continuing disability reviews;\n  Expands civil penalties for those who coach children to act \ninappropriately in order to receive benefits;\n  Graduates the level of benefits that families receive when they have \nmore than one child on SSI;\n  Changes the SSI policy regarding retroactive lump sum benefits;\n  Requires parents to demonstrate that they have sought appropriate \ntreatment to alleviate their child's disability; and several other \nimportant provisions.\n  Mr. President, while a great deal of time and effort has gone into \ndeveloping this legislation, I would be the first to acknowledge that \nthere may be room for improvement. For example, the Slattery Commission \non Childhood Disability appears ready to recommend that Medicaid \ncoverage continue for children who leave SSI because their condition \nimproves, but need continued medical assistance to ensure their \ncondition does not worsen. Although this provision is not in our bill, \nI believe it is one the Congress should consider.\n  I also want to call to my colleagues' attention a new report by the \nNational Academy of Social Insurance entitled ``Restructuring the SSI \nDisability Program for Children and Adolescents.'' The Academy's study, \nconducted by a nonpartisan group of national experts, is an extremely \nthoughtful and comprehensive analysis of the approach Congress should \ntake to reform SSI. And it contains many parallels to the legislation \nwe are introducing today. The report recommends strengthening \neligibility criteria, preserving the cash benefit, graduating the \namount of benefits families receive when they have more than one child \non SSI, encouraging measures to foster independence among those \nyoungsters who can become independent, and several other items.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From National Academy of Social Insurance, May 8, 1995]\n\n  Expert Group Recommends Steps to Restructure Supplemental Security \n              Disability Program for Children, Adolescents\n\n       Washington, DC.--A nonpartisan group of national experts, \n     responding to a study request from the House Ways and Means \n     Committee in the 102nd Congress, said today that ``there is a \n     strong rationale for the payment of cash benefits to families \n     with disabled children, while suggesting specific steps to \n     restructure the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability \n     program whose future is currently being debated in the \n     Congress.\n       The Committee on Childhood Disability of the National \n     Academy of Social Insurance released its findings in a study \n     entitled ``Restructuring the SSI Disability Program for \n     Children and Adolescents.'' The study, one year in the \n     making, also considered the views of 12 additional experts in \n     government, academia, and the private sector who contribute \n     to the Academy's Disability Policy Panel.\n       The population of children with disabilities is small, but \n     significant, and varies depending on the definition of \n     ``disability.'' The National Health Interview Survey \n     estimates in 1991 that children who had a ``limitation in \n     their major activity''--which means attending school for \n     children age 5-17, or playing for younger children--numbered \n     2.7 million or 4.2 percent of children under 18. In December \n     of 1994, there were 837,000 low-income children under 18 \n     receiving SSI due to their disabilities.\n       Jerry Mashaw, the Panel chair and Sterling Professor of Law \n     at Yale University, explained that ``cash payments must be \n     seen in the context of needs for family support. There are \n     myriad special burdens placed on families of children with \n     severe disabilities. Cash support can ease those burdens, \n     even if it cannot remove them. Low-income families, already \n     at the margin, face particular difficulties meeting the added \n     costs associated with their child's disability.''\n       The Committee, though clearly in support of cash benefits \n     for disabled children, said that these benefits should be \n     made ``only in appropriate cases'' and that they should not \n     be excessive in the modest number of cases where families \n     have more than one disabled child. Most importantly, they \n     argued, ``the approach to the support of disabled children \n     through the SSI program should be reoriented toward an \n     emphasis on the medical recovery, physical and mental \n     development and job readiness of children with \n     disabilities.''\n       The rapid growth in SSI childhood disability awards between \n     1989 and 1993 has leveled off and actually declined in 1994. \n     According to Mashaw, the growth appears to be a ``wave'' \n     rather than a long term trend. The ``wave'' was attributed to \n     four factors: updates of the listing of disabling childhood \n     mental impairments in late 1990; implementation of a 1990 \n     Supreme Court decision that expanded SSI eligibility criteria \n     for children; legislatively mandated outreach activities by \n     the Social Security Administration as well as efforts by \n     States and private organizations to enroll eligible children \n     in the SSI program; and an economic recession in 1990-91 that \n     caused more families with disabled children to meet the \n     program's low-income criteria.\n       The report also makes clear that allegations of widespread \n     abuse have not been substantiated in any of the studies that \n     have been done. The data show that children who receive SSI \n     have very significant disabilities, and that those who are \n     suspected of ``gaming the system'' are denied benefits. \n     Further, the Social Security Administration has put in place \n     rigorous new systems to investigate all such allegations and \n     assure that benefits are not improperly paid.\n       The Academy's expert group identified five themes that \n     define sound disability policy for children and adolescents:\n       Family preservation. ``The basic purpose of cash benefits \n     is to support and preserve the capacity of families to care \n     for their disabled children in their own homes.'' This can be \n     done by providing for some of the additional, non-medical, \n     but disability-related, costs of raising a disabled child; by \n     compensating for some of the income lost because of the \n     everyday necessities of caring for a disabled child; and by \n     meeting the child's basic needs for food, clothing, and \n     shelter.\n       ``Without these supports,'' they argue, ``disabled children \n     would be at a much greater risk of losing both a secure home \n     environment and the opportunity for integration into \n     community life, including the world of work.''\n       Strengthened eligibility criteria. The Committee urged that \n     ``maladaptive behavior'' be eliminated as a separate \n     ``functional domain'' for evaluating childhood mental \n     disorders that qualify one for SSI. Further, they called for \n     increased use of standardized tests to assess functioning for \n     children with mental disorders. And, they called for \n     revamping the ``individualized functional assessment'' \n     required by the Supreme Court to make it a more accurate \n     barometer of both physical and mental disabilities, that is \n     not so closely tied to mental disorders.\n       The Committee said that ``new regulations should be \n     developed expeditiously to strengthen the childhood \n     eligibility criteria. At the same time, care should be taken \n     not to repeat the tumult of the early 1980s, when radical \n     retrenchment in Federal disability policy brought widespread \n     individual hardship and judicial challenges. States were at \n     first reluctant, and then refused, to implement the harsh \n     policies because it left them with the burden of care for \n     vulnerable populations whose Federal benefits were denied or \n     terminated.\n       Limiting family benefits when there is more than one \n     eligible child in the household. With appropriate exceptions \n     for children who need round-the-clock nursing care or foster \n     care, and for adopted special-needs children, SSI benefits \n     for families with more than one disabled child should be \n     limited to 1.5 times the individual benefit for two children \n     and two times the benefit for three or more children, \n     according to the Committee's recommendations. No disabled \n     child should \n     [[Page S6536]] lose Medicaid eligibility because of this \n     limit on cash benefits.\n       Encourage a work track for teens with disabilities. At age \n     14, teenagers on SSI, together with their parents and special \n     education advisors, should begin setting career goals and \n     developing transition plans out of SSI and into financial \n     independence whenever possible, according to the study group. \n     While these children are pursuing their goals for work or \n     further education after high school, they would have \n     assurance of SSI benefits until they reached age 18, even if \n     they began to demonstrate work skills.\n       Encourage energetic measures by States, localities, and the \n     private sector to limit the period when cash support is \n     needed for infants and young children with disabilities. \n     Children's progress should be tracked and periodically \n     reviewed to ensure that those who recover do not remain on \n     the SSI disability rolls, and that those whose disabilities \n     persist are linked to services appropriate to their changing \n     needs as they grow older.\n       The Disability Policy Panel will issue a report providing a \n     fundamental review of the Social Security Disability programs \n     for adults later this fall. Today's report on children and \n     the SSI disability program is available from the National \n     Academy of Social Insurance. The Academy is a nonprofit, \n     nonpartisan organization devoted to furthering knowledge and \n     understanding of Social Security and related public and \n     private social programs. The Disability Project is supported \n     by The Pew Charitable Trusts, The Robert Wood Johnson \n     Foundation, and corporate members of the Health Insurance \n     Association of America that offer long-term disability \n     insurance.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                     May 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: The undersigned national organizations \n     are writing to express our full support for the bill you, \n     Senator Chafee, Senator Jeffords and Senator Bradley are \n     sponsoring, to make sensible reforms to the Supplemental \n     Security Income (SSI) program for children with disabilities.\n       The SSI program is a lifeline for families who have \n     children with disabilities. Over 900,000 children with severe \n     impairments living in low-income families now receive cash \n     benefits to meet their basic needs (which often cost more for \n     children with disabilities), compensate for their \n     extraordinary expenses, and offset loss of income because a \n     parent must remain unemployed or underemployed to care for \n     their child.\n       The SSI program for children has been maligned by \n     allegations that parents are ``coaching'' their children to \n     appear disabled and that SSA is qualifying children with mild \n     impairments. The program has been intensively examined by the \n     Social Security Administration, the HHS Office of Inspector \n     General and the General Accounting Office. While they \n     criticized some aspects of the program, they could not \n     substantiate the allegations of widespread fraud or \n     maladministration. Nevertheless, the House enacted \n     legislation, H.R. 4, which throws 170,000 children off the \n     program immediately, denies benefits to 400,000 others over \n     the next five years, and replaces cash benefits to future \n     eligible children with a vague set of services administered \n     by the states. The House bill cuts by 35% estimated SSI \n     spending for the children over the next five years.\n       Your bill represents sensible reform. It addresses the \n     issues raised by the program's critics without decimating the \n     program. It clarifies and raises the SSI eligibility \n     standards, expands the definition of fraud to include \n     ``coaching'' children to pass disability tests, requires \n     periodic reviews to assure that children who are no longer \n     disabled are removed from the program and improves incentives \n     to encourage children to move toward independence.\n       We are happy to support your legislation and look forward \n     to working with you to assure its passage in the Senate and \n     ultimate enactment into law.\n           Sincerely,\n         Joseph Manes; Rhoda Schulzinger, Bazelon Center Mental \n           Health Law; Martha Ford, The Arc; Al Guida, National \n           Mental Health Association; on behalf of: American \n           Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry; American \n           Association of Children's Residential Centers; American \n           Association on Mental Retardation; American Association \n           for Partial Hospitalization; American Association of \n           Pastoral Counselors; American Association of Private \n           Practice Psychiatrists; American Association of \n           Psychiatric Services for Children; American Board of \n           Examiners in Clinical Social Work; American Counseling \n           Association; American Counseling Association; American \n           Family Foundation; American Occupational Therapy \n           Association; Orthopsychiatric Association; American \n           Psychoanalytic Association; American Psychological \n           Association; American Rehabilitation Association; \n           Anxiety Disorders Association of America, Association \n           of Mental Health Administrators; Bazelon Center for \n           Mental Health Law; Corporation for the Advancement of \n           Psychiatry; Cult Awareness Network; Epilepsy Foundation \n           of America; Family Service America; Federation of \n           Families for Children's Mental Health; International \n           Association of Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services; \n           Legal Action Center; National Association of Protection \n           and Advisory Systems; National Association of \n           Psychiatric Health Systems; National Association of \n           Psychiatric Treatment for Children; National \n           Association of School Psychologists; National \n           Association of Social Workers; National Association of \n           State Directors of Development Disabilities Services, \n           Inc.; National Association of State Mental Health \n           Program Directors; National Community Mental Healthcare \n           Council; National Depressive and Manic Depressive \n           Association; National Easter Seal Society; National \n           Federation of Societies for Clinical Social Work; \n           National Head Injury Foundation; National Mental Health \n           Association; National Organization of State \n           Associations for Children; National Organization for \n           Rare Disorders; The Arc; United Cerebral Palsy \n           Association; World Association of Psychosocial \n           Rehabilitation.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senator Conrad \nin introducing the Childhood SSI Eligibility Act. This legislation \nmakes important reforms to the children's SSI program without \ncompletely dismantling this critical cash assistance program for low- \nincome families with disabled children.\n  It is important to point out from the outset that, contrary to the \nmany sensational stories we have seen in the press, 80 percent of \nchildren receiving SSI payments are severely disabled. They suffer from \nsevere physical disabilities such as cystic fibrosis and cerebral \npalsy, or from significant developmental retardation. The other 20 \npercent have other mental impairments such as childhood autism or \nschizophrenia.\n  The families of such children need cash assistance in addition to \nmedical services. In many of these cases, one parent must remain home \nwith the child; in this case, the program serves as income replacement \nfor a parent who must quit working. If these families were to lose \ntheir SSI cash benefits, many would not have the resources to care for \ntheir children at home resulting in a significant increase in \ninstitutionalization. Mr. President, if there is one thing we can all \nagree on it is that, whenever possible, children should remain at home \nwith their families and in the community instead of in institutions. \nThis legislation continues to make that possible.\n  The cash is also used for other critical supports, such as specially \ntrained child care providers, specially equipped vehicles to transport \nchildren who use wheelchairs, home modifications and adaptations, \nspecial telecommunication services, and family support services.\n  Having said that, I also recognize that there are some problems with \nthe children's SSI program, and that is why we are introducing \nlegislation today. There has been rapid growth in the SSI program for \nchildren over the last 5 years. In 1989 the program was providing cash \nassistance to\n 300,000 children; by 1994 it was serving 890,000 children. During this \nsame period the cost of the children's SSI program grew from $1.2 \nbillion to $4.5 billion.\n\n  The growth in the program has now leveled out, but clearly, we need \nto ask ourselves why the program suddenly exploded and how we can \nprevent this from happening in the future. There are a couple of \nreasons for the sudden growth. First, the recession in the early 1990's \nresulted in many people falling into poverty, precipitating an \nincreased need for government assistance. Second, in 1989 the Congress \ndirected the Social Security Administration [SSA] to conduct outreach \nfor the first time to potentially eligible families with children who \nhave severe disabilities. Third, there was a change made to the mental \nimpairment listings. And, finally, the 1990 Supreme Court decision, the \nso-called Zebley decision required SSA to change its childhood \ndisability determination process to evaluate the child's level of \nfunctioning in addition to his or her medical condition. It was \nestimated at that time that 1 million additional children will meet the \nnew criteria under Zebley.\n  We have all heard and read about the stories of parents gaming the \nsystem and coaching their children to act disabled in some fashion to \nqualify for SSI. And I do not question that some of this occurs. But is \nit rampant? The GAO finds no solid evidence of parents coaching their \nchildren, although it \n[[Page S6537]] does recommend that we take a serious look at certain \naspects of the eligibility determination process. And that is what our \nlegislation does.\n  First, the legislation tightens eligibility to ensure that only \nchildren with severe and persistent impairments, which substantially \nlimit their ability to function, receive benefits. Second, it increases \nand better targets continuing disability reviews to ensure that only \nthose who remain eligible actually continue to receive benefits. Third, \nit expands penalties for coaching children to act inappropriately in \norder to receive benefits. Finally, it imposes graduated payments for \nadditional children, like other cash assistance programs such as AFDC.\n  Mr. President, I think this legislation is a fair and balanced \napproach. It acknowledges and corrects abuses in the system while \nreinforcing the\n purpose of the program: to enable children with disabilities to remain \nat home or in another appropriate and cost-effective setting and to \ncover the additional costs of caring for and raising such a child.\n\n  Who is this money serving? Children like Juan, a 9-year-old youngster \nin my home State of Rhode Island. Juan has been on SSI since birth, \nconfined to a wheelchair and dependent on medical technology to \nsurvive. Without the cash assistance he receives under SSI, Juan's \nmother would be forced to put him into a residential facility at a cost \nof almost $200,000 per year. Compare this to the maximum SSI benefit of \n$438 a month. It seems to me that we are getting a pretty good deal, \nand that families like Juan's deserve every nickel they get.\n  The Finance Committee will be taking up this issue in the coming \nweeks as part of welfare reform. Many of my colleagues are familiar \nwith the provision in the House-passed welfare reform bill which would \neliminate cash assistance for all children unless they would be \notherwise institutionalized. In my view, this should be rejected. I \nsincerely hope that my colleagues on the Finance Committee will \nconsider the legislation we are introducing today as an alternative \nwhich provides effective reforms without removing disabled children \nfrom the rolls who are truly in need.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nConrad's Childhood Supplemental Security Income [SSI] Eligibility \nReform Act. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this bill. I \nwould like to begin by acknowledging and thanking my colleague Senator \nConrad for his hard work and dedication on drafting this bill to cure \nthe problems in the children's SSI program. I am hopeful for this \nbill's quick consideration and adoption.\n  In the welfare reform bill passed earlier this year by our colleagues \nin the House, substantial changes were made in the children's SSI \nprogram. However, I believe that the House version of this bill fails \nto address the criticisms leveled towards this program while at the \nsame time ensuring that the children and families that rely on and need \nthese benefits receive them.\n  For example, a family I know of in Vermont has two young children \nwith cystic fibrosis. They live in a very rural area of Vermont about 2 \nhours away from the specialty clinic and hospital they go to. This \ndistance creates a constant expense of travel to this clinic and \nhospital. In addition, the medication costs for the two children are \nvery high. The infant had growth problems related to malabsorption \nwhich required special formula. The older child had severe \nmalabsorption that required surgery and requires subsequent close \nfollow-up of his nutritional status.\n  The father of these children works full time, but has to take time \noff to attend the clinics with the children and to transport and visit \nthem in the hospital. Some of the time off is unpaid because he has \nlimited vacation time.\n  The children's mother had intended to return to work after they were \nborn but cannot find a day care provider who is comfortable with the \nchildren's medical care needs. She undoubtedly would also have \ndifficulty finding an employer who would allow her the necessary time \noff for appointments, hospitalizations, and so forth.\n  Mr. President, this family has a clear need for the Medicaid coverage \nand extra income that SSI provides. It is difficult to imagine how they \ncould continue to provide the medical care that their children need \nwithout these benefits. They are a hard-working and tax-paying couple \nwho struggle to do the best that they can for their children. The \neffect of the House bill on this family would be devastating, while our \nbill would ensure that this family that needs to receive these benefits \nwould still receive them.\n  I believe that the bill being introduced today will meet both of \nthese goals: preserve the essential parts of the children's SSI \nprogram, while, at the same time, addressing the concerns raised by its \ncritics. I would now like to address the valid criticisms of the SSI \nprogram, and our specific solutions in the bill to these criticisms.\n  First, our bill will address the issue that SSI's purpose for \nchildren with disabilities was never sufficiently defined. By defining \nthe program as maintaining children with disabilities in the most \nappropriate and cost effective setting, and enhancing such children's \nopportunities to develop into independent adults, our bill will combat \nthe old once-disabled-always-disabled way of thinking.\n  This bill will also combat the current problem that children who are \nnot severely disabled are drawing benefits. By tightening the SSI \neligiibility requirements, our bill will ensure that children and \nfamilies that truly need these benefits will be receiving them.\n  In addition, by increasing penalties to parents and guardians that \nknowingly and willfully coach children to act in ways that render them \neligible for SSI, and requiring greater use of standardized testing, \nour bill will stem the practice of children who should be ineligible \nfor benefits being found to be eligible for SSI.\n  Further, our bill will graduate payments to families for each \nadditional child in the family receiving SSI benefits. This provision \nwill ensure that families with multiple kids receiving SSI benefits \nwill not be receiving the maximum benefit for each child.\n  Finally, our bill will help children receiving SSI benefits move \ntoward self-sufficiency. I, for one, find this to be one of the most \nimportant provisions of the bill. By ensuring that we move people \ntoward self-sufficiency, we are helping reduce the number of children \nreceiving SSI benefits, while increasing the possibility that these \nindividuals will not require future governmental support.\n  Mr. President, I believe that our bill changes what is wrong with the \nSSI program while maintaining legitimate benefits that children and \ntheir families rely on. We don't want to go back to a much more costly \nsystem that institutionalizes children rather than affording them an \nopportunity for productive and self-sufficient lives. Thus, I feel \nconfident in stating that this bill will ensure that continued support \nof SSI benefits to families, like the one from Vermont I described \nearlier, while solving some of the problems currently plaguing the \nchildren's SSI system.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``National Beverage \n     Container Reuse and Recycling Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The failure to reuse and recycle empty beverage \n     containers represents a significant and unnecessary waste of \n     important national energy and material resources.\n       (2) The littering of empty beverage containers constitutes \n     a public nuisance, safety hazard, and aesthetic blight and \n     imposes upon public agencies, private businesses, farmers, \n     and landowners unnecessary costs for the collection and \n     removal of the containers.\n       (3) Solid waste resulting from the empty beverage \n     containers constitutes a significant and rapidly growing \n     proportion of municipal solid waste and increases the cost \n     and problems of effectively managing the disposal of the \n     waste.\n       (4) It is difficult for local communities to raise the \n     necessary capital to initiate comprehensive recycling \n     programs.\n       (5) The reuse and recycling of empty beverage containers \n     would help eliminate unnecessary burdens on individuals, \n     local governments, and the environment.\n       (6) Several States have previously enacted and implemented \n     State laws designed to protect the environment, conserve \n     energy and material resources, and promote resource recovery \n     of waste by requiring a refund value on the sale of all \n     beverage containers.\n       (7) The laws referred to in paragraph (6) have proven \n     inexpensive to administer and effective at reducing financial \n     burdens on communities by internalizing the cost of recycling \n     and litter control to the producers and consumers of \n     beverages.\n       (8) A national system for requiring a refund value on the \n     sale of all beverage containers would act as a positive \n     incentive to individuals to clean up the environment and \n     would--\n       (A) result in a high level of reuse and recycling of the \n     containers; and\n       (B) help reduce the costs associated with solid waste \n     management.\n       (9) A national system for requiring a refund value on the \n     sale of all beverage containers would result in significant \n     energy conservation and resource recovery.\n       (10) The reuse and recycling of empty beverage containers \n     would eliminate unnecessary burdens on the Federal \n     Government, local and State governments, and the environment.\n       (11) The collection of unclaimed refunds from a national \n     system of beverage container recycling would provide the \n     resources necessary to assist comprehensive reuse and \n     recycling programs throughout the United States.\n       (12) A national system of beverage container recycling is \n     consistent with the intent of the Resource Conservation and \n     Recovery Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.).\n       (13) The provisions of this title are consistent with the \n     goals established by the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency in January 1988. The goals include a \n     national goal of 25 percent source reduction and recycling by \n     1992, coupled with a substantial slowing of the projected \n     rate of increase in waste generation by the year 2000.\n\n     SEC. ____03.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Iran's Violations of Human Rights.--The Congress makes \n     the following findings with respect to Iran's violations of \n     human rights:\n       (1) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n     Representative on Human Rights, Amnesty International, and \n     the United States Department of State, the Government of Iran \n     has conducted assassinations outside of Iran, such as that of \n     former Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar for which the \n     Government of France issued arrest warrants for several \n     Iranian governmental officials.\n       (2) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n     Representative on Human Rights and by Amnesty International, \n     the Government of Iran has conducted revolutionary trials \n     which do not meet internationally recognized standards of \n     fairness or justice. These trials have included such \n     violations as a lack of procedural safeguards, trial times of \n     5 minutes or less, limited access to defense counsel, forced \n     confessions, and summary executions.\n       (3) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n     Representative on Human Rights, the Government of Iran \n     systematically represses its Baha'i population. Persecutions \n     of this small religious community include assassinations, \n     arbitrary arrests, electoral prohibitions, and denial of \n     applications for documents such as passports.\n       (4) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n     Representative on Human Rights, the Government of Iran \n     suppresses opposition to its government. Political \n     organizations such as the Freedom Movement are banned from \n     parliamentary elections, have their telephones tapped and \n     their mail opened, and are systematically harassed and \n     intimidated.\n       (5) As cited by the 1991 United Nations Special \n     Representative on Human Rights and Amnesty International, the \n     Government of Iran has failed to recognize the importance of \n     international human rights. This includes suppression of \n     Iranian human rights movements such as the Freedom Movement, \n     lack of cooperation with international human rights \n     organizations such as the International Red Cross, and an \n     overall apathy toward human rights in general. This lack of \n     concern prompted the Special Representative to state in his \n     report that Iran had made ``no appreciable progress towards \n     improved compliance with human rights in accordance with the \n     current international instruments''.\n       (6) As cited by Amnesty International, the Government of \n     Iran continues to torture its political prisoners. Torture \n     methods include burns, arbitrary blows, severe beatings, and \n     positions inducing pain.\n       (b) Iran's Acts of International Terrorism.--The Congress \n     makes the following findings, based on the records of the \n     Department \n     [[Page S6546]] of State, with respect to Iran's acts of \n     international terrorism:\n       (1) As cited by the Department of State, the Government of \n     Iran was the greatest supporter of state terrorism in 1992, \n     supporting over 20 terrorist acts, including the bombing of \n     the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires that killed 29 people.\n       (2) As cited by the Department of State, the Government of \n     Iran is a sponsor of radical religious groups that have used \n     terrorism as a tool.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ncareer of Mr. Lee Todd, who is working hard to make Lexington, KY, a \nmajor stop on the information highway. Lee is president and CEO of \nDataBeam, one of the State's few high-technology companies.\n  Lee grew up in Earlington, KY, where at age 14 he became the best \npool shooter in town. Lee credits his early years in the western \nKentucky town with helping make him who he is today. In a recent \narticle in Blugrass magazine, Lee says ``I think every kid needs \nsomething to feel good about, to develop self esteem. For some kids it \nwas athletics. For me, it was pool.''\n  After graduating from high school, Lee attended Murray State \nUniversity, but after 2 years he transferred to the University of \nKentucky. After receiving his diploma, Lee moved to Boston and attended \nM.I.T., where he earned his M.S. and Ph.D in electrical engineering. It \nwas also in Boston that he met his wife, Patsy.\n  The Todds returned home to the Bluegrass State after graduation. They \nsettled in Lexington, and Lee got a job in the Electrical Engineering \nDepartment at the University of Kentucky. He taught at U.K. for 9 \nyears, and during that time he was honored with several teaching \nawards, including the coveted U.K. Alumni Association Great Teacher \nAward.\n  Lee caught ``entrepreneur fever'' at M.I.T, where he was awarded with \nsix patents for advancements in picture tube technology. These patents \nhelped lead to the development of DataBeam. In 1993, DataBeam \nintroduced FarSite, the first software-driven computer conference room \nsystem. This high-technology allows a document to be viewed at the same \ntime on different computer screens at different locations throughout \nthe country.\n  DataBeam, which was given the Outstanding Small Business Award in \n1988, is currently focusing on partnerships. The company recently added \nsoftware giant Microsoft to its list of partners, which already \nincludes AT, MCI, and Motorola.\n  Lee believes that by improving education and by helping to create a \nhigh-technology industry, Kentucky will have a brighter future. He \nfounded and chairs the Kentucky Science, and Technology Counsel, which \ndeveloped a hands-on learning package for elementary schoolchildren. \nThis program is now used in about 60 percent of the elementary schools \nacross the State.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this \noutstanding Kentuckian for his many accomplishments. I am confident \nthat Mr. Todd will continue to invest in the future of Kentucky, as he \nhas done so graciously in the past.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/11/senate-section/article/S6554-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6554-S6559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     POLITICAL TRANSITION IN CHINA\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on March 23, the Congressional \nEconomic Leadership Institute, in conjunction with the Congressional \nCompetitiveness Caucus, held a discussion of China as that nation \nbegins a political transition.\n  The meeting was led by three China experts: former United States \nAmbassador to China, Jim Lilley; Nigel Holloway, Washington \ncorrespondent of the Far Eastern Economic Review; and Drew Liu, \nexecutive director of the China Institute.\n  Called ``China After Deng,'' this vigorous discussion highlighted \nsome of the outstanding issues in Chinese internal affairs and the \nUnited States-China relationship. I commend it to my colleagues who \nwish to gain a deeper understanding of these issues.\n  The panelists agreed, in the words of Drew Liu, that ``China is \nperhaps entering the most crucial period of transition.''\n  Mr. Holloway expressed another theme by urging ``constructive \nengagement,'' since the United States and the West generally ``need to \nkeep drawing China out, into the wider world, and help to prevent its \nbecoming a merchantilist military state.''\n  Ambassador Lilley put these points in context by noting that basic \nlong-term economic and political trends \n[[Page S6555]] within China are positive and leading toward a more \neconomically and militarily powerful nation, and that the range of \nUnited States interests in the relationship with China is very broad.\n  I want to compliment the institute for organizing this useful \ndiscussion, and I ask that the transcript be printed in the Record.\n  The transcript follows:\n\n                            China After Deng\n\n\n                               panelists\n\n       Ambassador James R. Lilley, Director of Asian Studies, \n     American Enterprise Institute.\n       Nigel Holloway, Washington Correspondent, Far Eastern \n     Economic Review.\n       Drew Liu, Executive Director, China Institute.\n\n\n                               moderators\n\n       U.S. Senator Max Baucus.\n       Congressman Jim Kolbe.\n\n       Rep. Jim Kolbe. We're here to look at a very timely topic \n     and one in which there is a great deal of interest in the \n     United States--the subject of China in the era after Deng \n     Xiaoping.\n       It's my pleasure this morning to introduce my Senate \n     colleague and good friend, Max Baucus. Senator Baucus has \n     been involved with the Competitiveness Forum for a long \n     time--in fact, since it was begun in 1987. He is a member of \n     the Trade Subcommittee of the Senate Finance Committee; he's \n     also ranking member of the Senate Environment Committee. As I \n     think many of you know, he has taken a very strong and \n     personal interest in the subject of China over the years. \n     Please join me in welcoming, to introduce our panel this \n     morning, the senior Senator from Montana, Max Baucus. Max:\n       Sen. Max Baucus. Thank you, Jim. Thank you all for coming \n     out this morning. We have three very distinguished guests \n     this morning to help us discuss the future of China as that \n     nation enters an era of political transition. In politics and \n     security, China is critical to every major Asian security \n     issue--from the conflict between India and Pakistan, to the \n     Spratly Islands, to the Korean peninsula and on up north to \n     the Russian Far East. It holds a permanent seat with a veto \n     in the United Nations Security Council and, of course, China \n     is a nation of 1.2 billion people with one of the world's \n     largest armies.\n       In commerce, China is already one of the world's largest \n     economies and international traders. Its trading power will \n     increase even more after 1997. While China is our fastest \n     growing export market, its issues--copyrights and patents; \n     market-access for Montana wheat-producers; World Trade \n     Organization membership; and trade deficits--show that China \n     is also one of our most difficult trade policy challenges.\n       In environmental policy, China will very soon become the \n     largest contributor to global warming. Its rapid coastal \n     development, growing fishing fleet, and reliance on coal for \n     power generation, all pose immensely difficult questions. \n     And, of course, since Tiananmen Square in 1989, almost no \n     foreign-policy issue has been as controversial or as divisive \n     here in the United States as has human rights in China.\n       Internally, China faces high inflation, widespread \n     corruption, and a declining standard-of-living in rural and \n     inland regions relative to urban and coastal areas. At the \n     National People's Congress last week, people as diverse as \n     Prime Minister Li Peng and dissident petitioners identified \n     these as problems threatening the stability of the country.\n       And what should we, the United States, expect in the next \n     few years? What policies are likely to get results? \n     Conversely, what actions will create a backlash? Difficult \n     questions--and we have had heated debates over them since \n     1989. But I think everyone will agree the U.S. would benefit \n     from a deeper understanding of trends and possible future \n     developments in China. The CELI has brought together a panel \n     of three long-time observers who can help us arrive at that \n     understanding. They are:\n       The Honorable Jim Lilley. Jim is one of our country's most \n     accomplished diplomats and Chinese scholars. He, of course, \n     was the Ambassador of China during the Bush Administration \n     and previously served as Ambassador to Korea. An \n     internationally respected commentator on Chinese Affairs and \n     U.S. China policy, he is now a Scholar-in-residence at the \n     American Enterprise Institute.\n       Nigel Holloway, a long time observer of Chinese and Asian \n     affairs. Mr. Holloway is the Washington correspondent for the \n     Far Eastern Economic Review, which for decades has been the \n     most respected Journal of East Asian business and politics.\n       And Drew Liu, Executive Director of the China Institute. \n     The China Institute, established here in Washington by Wong \n     Jung Tao on his release from prison last year, links China's \n     most respectable intellectual dissidents on research on \n     political and economic trends in China.\n       Each panelist will speak for a few minutes on what he sees \n     as a major trend in China's economic and political \n     development as we enter this transition era. Then we'll take \n     questions. Thank you all for coming. Let's give a big warm \n     welcome to our guest. [Applause.] Jim, I think you're first.\n       Ambassador Jim Lilley. Well, that's quite a challenge. Let \n     me just anecdote the first. I asked three people about the \n     future of China--not romantics or visionaries, but people \n     that basically do business there. One was a Korean fat cat \n     who has invested probably three-quarters of a billion dollars \n     in China and is investing more. And I said Chairman, how do \n     you see China? He looked at me and he went like this \n     [gesturing]--he said headaches, terrible headaches. But also, \n     he said, long-term good.\n       Secondly, I talked to a Hong Kong businessman, just last \n     night. And I said, where do you see it? He said, ``I have \n     just bought one-quarter of a billion dollars of property in \n     Hong Kong and I see a long-term rise because I am in the \n     business of making money. The one thing I avoid is having \n     anything to do with princely, high-cadre kids, economically. \n     Socially they're fine--but don't touch them any other way.'' \n     But he said, ``I'm putting my money where my mouth is--\n     investing in the future of Hong Kong.''\n       The third person was a Department of Commerce \n     representative who speaks beautiful Chinese. He said Commerce \n     is quadrupling its staff in Shanghai, hiring 22 new locals; \n     it's going to become the base of operations, almost \n     paralleling our operation in Beijing. In other words, the \n     United States Government is putting its people where it's \n     mouth is, and they are going to build a center in Shanghai. \n     This on a bet on the future of China's economy. I'm not \n     saying the U.S. Government is always right. But I'm saying \n     this is where they are going to make their action.\n       Let's move into the situation of China. Just briefly, I'll \n     touch on three zones which are the obvious ones--political, \n     military, economic.\n       First, militarily: Senator Baucus has touched on the places \n     in Asia where China is an indispensable player. On the Korean \n     peninsula, the stakes are very high; we are in a game of \n     chicken and brinkmanship this very weekend. Strategically, \n     the Chinese are basically with us. But they play a different \n     game, one with Chinese characteristics. They don't want to \n     see Kim Joy Il with nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. \n     Nor do they want to see instability on the peninsula. \n     Probably better than anybody, the Chinese know what a really \n     weird, strange regime Kim Joy Il runs. They're done good work \n     in the past; they've also been ambiguous in certain areas. \n     But, to get a solution, the Chinese have to be a player, and \n     we have to play with them. Because when we work with China, \n     North Korea tends to give; when we split with China, they \n     take advantage of it.\n       Second, the South China Sea. Perhaps you saw the piece in \n     the Outlook section of the Washington Post this weekend? \n     China is playing a long-term game of taking over the South \n     China Sea--no question about that. It's going to happen, not \n     in this century perhaps, but in the next century. It is not \n     going to be necessarily large or violent, but more of a \n     creeping takeover. This is spelled out in their internal \n     documents. They are modernizing their military with this \n     objective in mind. Jiang Zemin mentioned this in effect at \n     the National People's Congress. So you shouldn't be confused.\n       What you have a genuine argument over is: Can they do it? \n     Are they able to do it? With economic growth, will China \n     spend its money on unproductive military activity that puts \n     them in confrontation with the rest of Asia and possibly with \n     the world's most powerful instrument, the United States \n     Seventh Fleet? They've got to calculate very carefully and \n     intelligently--which is precisely what they are doing. But \n     they have ambitions, there's little question.\n       The third area, of course, is the Taiwan Straits. There's a \n     great deal of gong-banging, stage-acting and posturing: Both \n     sides trying to use the Americans against the other side--a \n     very old game. Please don't get sucked in. The Chinese and \n     Taiwanese are working very, very closely to straighten things \n     out--when they really put their mind to it. But it's much \n     more fun for each one to use the Americans to bash the other \n     side. So be careful here. We hope it isn't next year's issue. \n     This year, the issue is intellectual-property rights; last \n     year, it was MFN and human rights. Next year, is it going to \n     be Taiwan? Let's not make it Taiwan. Let's work ourselves out \n     of this one--and we can if we don't let the Chinese use us.\n       Finally, the economic situation--obviously a mixed bag. \n     China has an excellent growth record. Reserves are up a \n     hundred percent. The trade balance has gone from 12 billion \n     negative last year to five billion plus this year. But China \n     also has 150 million surplus laborers, along with real \n     problems in getting some sort of a financial code--a taxation \n     code that functions. You see progress, but it's shaky. So \n     apply the same business judgment you would in any such \n     country: Know your partner, know the local market situation, \n     get a good contract, deal with the people in power to get \n     things done. This all applies to China. There is no quick \n     fix.\n       The good news I see coming out of the National People's \n     Congress that just finished is--don't get me wrong on this \n     one, don't caricature my position, but--a slow movement \n     towards the rule of law. There are differences in the Chinese \n     system about how this should be done, and how fast. But the \n     arguments they are having are arguments we, as Americans, can \n     comprehend: Subsidies to state-owned enterprises. Subsidies \n     to agriculture. How you manage the distribution of money \n     internally--how much you put into the state sector and how \n     much you keep out in the free-market sector. Arguments about \n     the rules governing property, bankruptcy, \n     [[Page S6556]] and central banking. And I see progress on \n     most of these fronts.\n       But the most encouraging sign is a degree of autonomy \n     coming out of the Chinese themselves. You find one-third of \n     the people voting against a candidate for Vice-Premier. You \n     certainly have people showing their displeasure at Li Peng's \n     work report--very few, but they show it. You, see across-the-\n     board, the Chinese representative bodies, usually \n     overstaffed, beginning to move in the direction of some kind \n     of an independent posture--where they can exercise a function \n     over the party people. What I think it boils down to, over \n     the long haul, is the rule of law versus the rule of man. A \n     very deep issue in Chinese history, it is not easily solved--\n     but the issue emerged in this National People's Congress. And \n     I think that probably is the most promising sign in China \n     today. Thank you. [Applause.]\n       Nigel Holloway. Thank you very much. I'd like to thank the \n     Institute very much for inviting me to this pulpit. First of \n     all, I want to say that this is the first time that I've \n     actually spoken about China's future in this way. I'm a \n     journalist, probably as many of you are--so, we have \n     something in common. But I maybe can see things in a slightly \n     different way from the specialist. I have obviously traveled \n     in China several times. I lived in Hong Kong for three-and-a-\n     half years. And I've written about Asia as a whole since \n     1982.\n       I want to start by emphasizing the magnitude of what's \n     happening in China today. Living standards have been doubling \n     every five years or so--something that has never happened in \n     a country larger than 100 million people. What an \n     extraordinary change taking place with one-fifth of the \n     world's population. (Of course, India is starting to go \n     through the same transition--but it's different in India.)\n       Second point: In China, we have a Marxist superstructure, \n     superimposed on a capitalist substructure. This is a recipe \n     for tension, dislocation and conflict in the long term. You \n     tend to compare it with Russia, where political opening \n     preceded economic reform--and we can see where Russia is \n     today. The Chinese transition, running the opposite way, is \n     almost as difficult. China's leadership is ``riding the \n     capitalist tiger'' like the capitalist governments in eastern \n     Europe after the second world war were riding the communist \n     tiger--and they were swallowed up. (The only country that \n     succeeded in pulling it off was Singapore, in the late 1950s, \n     where Lee Kuan Yew managed to stifle the communist tiger.)\n       In China's case today the tiger, of course, is the \n     capitalist system. Deng and his cohorts know they have to \n     delivery the goods. But the goods contain the seeds of their \n     own destruction, namely the destruction of the communist \n     system. The stock market, its shareholders, these are people \n     with stakes in an economic system antagonistic to the \n     political superstructure. This could be resolved gradually \n     without major conflicts. It could also, of course, lead to \n     another revolution.\n       The third factor is the leadership transition itself. We \n     are going through another unprecedented situation for China, \n     with nobody of a similar stature or credentials to replace \n     Deng--so we are heading into an open country with no real \n     road map. The first stages of the transition has already \n     taken place: Deng has fully retired. I don't think he has \n     been a factor for about a year now since the military \n     appointments, made about a year ago. He is not playing a role \n     like Lee Kuan Yew, still a major factor in Singapore \n     politics.\n       What precedents do we have for the situation in China under \n     a collective leadership? We have the inauspicious one, of \n     course, of Yugoslavia after Tito--obviously there are major \n     differences between the situation of Yugoslavia and that in \n     China. Perhaps a better precedent is Vietnam: Since the death \n     of Ho Chi Minh, there has been a fairly stable collective \n     leadership. But Vietnam, of course, faces the same structural \n     problems that China does long-term.\n       Nobody knows of course, what will happen in China, just as \n     nobody knows who's going to win next year's presidential \n     election here. But it's even harder to predict where China \n     will be next year because it's so opaque. Talking to \n     specialists, which is basically what I do, I get most of this \n     second-hand. But the consensus is that China will move to a \n     sort of authoritarian-capitalist model. That I think is what \n     it's aiming for--rather like Singapore, a prospect the United \n     States and the west can perhaps deal with. Singapore is a \n     free-trading nation firmly in the Western camp but also with \n     significant political differences. But Singapore is a very \n     small island nation and China is a completely different \n     kettle of fish. Could we live with a Singapore-style China?\n       Another question: Will China break up after the demise of \n     Deng Xiaoping. Again, the consensus among specialists is that \n     this is very unlikely. But one of the points they make is how \n     the interest groups--the interest-group politics really \n     running China now--is like the woven weft of a textile. Pull \n     out one strand, and the textile will not fragment--because \n     there are so many overlapping interests. For example, the \n     military regions China is divided into do not exactly match \n     the economic territory--they overlap. Another example is how \n     the regional military command is rotated on a regular basis \n     so they can't build local systems. At any rate, the consensus \n     is China is unlikely to break up in the next 10 years.\n       What should American policy be towards China? Constructive \n     engagement is certainly the right objective. The United \n     States and the west need to keep drawing China out, into the \n     wider world, and help to prevent its becoming a mercantilist \n     military state. This is absolutely the right objective. Also, \n     because the United States has such a wide array of interests \n     in dealing with China, it should lay those out, and take a \n     very hard look at where its priorities lie, rather than \n     veering in one direction or another.\n       So I think the changes that are obviously taking place in \n     U.S.-China policy over the last year have been in the right \n     direction. This is absolutely the right way to go. The U.S. \n     cannot bottle up China, nor should it. If it can help \n     integrate China fully into world affairs, this will be one of \n     the greatest achievements of the 21st Century. This requires \n     an extremely deft handling to avoid the confusion we had a \n     month ago when, in short order, we had conflict over \n     intellectual-property rights, a dramatic reduction in MFN \n     tariffs to China, and questions over the U.S. stance on \n     China's application to the WTO. In the midst of all of this, \n     we also had Hazel O'Leary in Beijing touting the contracts. \n     It was confusing for China--and confusing for Americans too. \n     I mean, what is American policy towards China? So it requires \n     a very careful explanation: ``We have this array of differing \n     interests--but these are the ones that are important.''\n       The shift in the U.S. stance towards China's WTO membership \n     application is right--the U.S. is right to call for the \n     toughest possible terms on China's application. China will \n     probably become a member of the WTO by the end of the year, \n     and that's the very best development. But I think it will be \n     largely on the west terms rather than on China's.\n       If you look at all different aspects of China's \n     relationships with the world and what Jim Lilley was saying \n     about the rule of law, I sense a subtheme: China has to play \n     by western rules if it wants to be a global player--whether \n     it's arm sales, trade, and so on. And I think that the U.S. \n     is right to stress that in all international forums.\n       I'd also like to make a plea that the U.S. should at every \n     appropriate opportunity stress its strongest possible \n     commitment to Hong Kong's long-term autonomy. As we've seen \n     over the last few years, there's been a significant erosion \n     in both the Chinese and, I must confess, the British attitude \n     towards what was agreed on paper in the joint declaration. \n     This is a source of serious concern. And the United States \n     should stress during said meetings with Lu Ping, the senior \n     representative of Beijing on Hong Kong affairs, that the U.S. \n     has a strong interest in Hong Kong's economic and political \n     autonomy.\n       I'd also like to agree with Jim Lilley that the U.S. must \n     avoid pushing the Taiwan card too far. This has obviously \n     been the major danger, I think, since the Republican \n     victories in the election last year, and needs to be watched \n     very carefully. That's my final point. Thank you.\n       Drew Liu. Thank you, Senator Baucus. Thank you, Congressman \n     Kolbe. And I would like to thank also the Institute for this \n     opportunity.\n       China is perhaps entering the most crucial period of \n     transition, and many of the changes have taken place over \n     last dozen years or so. Those changes are fundamental and \n     from bottom-up. And so China has entered the threshold of \n     fundamental change. What is the background, the nature of the \n     forces, behind this change?\n       First, I would like to emphasize the crisis China is \n     facing. In the political area, as everybody is aware, China \n     is facing a crisis of transition, with a crack on the top \n     echelon. And it's reflected especially in this People's \n     Congress Session: Complaints and grievances from the lower \n     echelon, and from local officials, are aimed against the \n     center. And, in both political and economic areas--a linking \n     point--you have this corruption issue. It is economical as \n     well as political. The Chinese system is unable to contain \n     corruption, which is very much hated by the Chinese populace.\n       In economics, the problem of the system is more fundamental \n     than at first glance. The whole structure of communist state \n     ownership has been very much undermined. But the new system \n     has not been established during this transition. The \n     transition is from the one kind of a planning system to the \n     market system--and you have this plundering of the public \n     funds, and public property, by officials. There is no law--\n     it's a jungle. You [in America] talk about Ivan Boesky; in \n     China today, everybody is Ivan Boesky. The Chinese people \n     perceive this as very unfair, [a profound] injustice. \n     Certainly in the social arena, you have hundreds of millions \n     of people migrating from the rural area, from the inner \n     provinces, to the southeast provinces. And these are the sign \n     posts, in the Chinese history of big trouble, confirming a \n     dynasty's end. The Ching dynasty was very much ended in that \n     way--migration was part of the reason.\n       So there are three major scenarios. First is the \n     continuation of dictatorship, the single-party model, maybe. \n     Second is the opening of a political system and gradual \n     transformation into democracy. The third one we could see is \n     social unrest. The [inaudible word] of the Chinese society \n     and maybe the breaking-up of China.\n       I would think the first scenario is growing less likely \n     because of the lack of a strong man to hold China together--a \n     Deng Xiaoping, a figure like that. With the power base in \n     both military and party, and the state's bureaucratic system \n     and in the Chinese political culture, the demand is for \n     [[Page S6557]] some kind of strong man to hold it together. \n     It's like a reverse pyramid: One man at the bottom, \n     everything is on top. The bottom goes away, and then you have \n     the collapse. The current leadership of Jiang Zemin is less \n     capable of playing the same kind of integrating role as Deng \n     Xiaoping. And [Chinese society lacks] the tradition of \n     politics. Once in transition, divisions multiply. So \n     continuation of the dictatorship is also unlikely. In all \n     systems, the social forces formed during the reform process \n     have been unable to be controlled.\n       The second scenario is the deep social unrest. But we think \n     the biggest opportunity [occurring with this scenario would \n     be] the gradual transition to a constitutional democracy. And \n     let me say how I envision this could happen. At the China \n     Institute, we do studies, mainly in the integrated area of \n     theory in the practice. And we try to combine the vision \n     blueprinting with actual process of change. What we find is \n     that China's change in progress, towards political openness \n     and the signs towards democratization, is always the result \n     of a muddling through. It's not designed. it's not planned. \n     It's not in anybody's mind.\n       As a result, many consequences are unintended. The \n     different interest groups need to reposition themselves--but \n     they don't have commonly accepted rules of the game. The \n     process of democracy could be introduced into this \n     situation--even though people may not be aware of the \n     consequences. For instance, the mechanism of free elections, \n     the mechanism of checks and balances, and the mechanism of \n     [an impartial] monitoring device--all could be gradually \n     introduced into the process.\n       Now secondly, it's not a moral process, like [in America]. \n     Here, it's the ideal--you know the Founding Fathers, you know \n     about universal rights. In China, it's not like that; it's \n     really a process of people. ``See, this is we have to do. \n     This [set of democratic mechanisms] is a way we can \n     compromise without going total chaos [and risking] civil \n     war.''\n       So, in this [potential] process, what is the position and \n     role of the western world? How is this important process \n     linked to the western world in general and the U.S. in \n     particular? Shift the angle a little bit to say the \n     importance of the U.S./China relation in the immediate \n     future. It's very paradoxical and, I mean--there's no China \n     policy. Perhaps it shouldn't be a ``China policy''--because \n     of the two fundamental paradoxes in dealing with China. One \n     is to deal with China on an international level--where you \n     treat China as a society, as a state, as a collective. The \n     other is the China of individuals.\n       Let me offer an example: On intellectual-property rights, \n     we have monitored events, the process, very closely. Then we \n     receive responses from different sectors among the Chinese--\n     and I was surprised. Because, from our point of view, it is \n     fair for China to abide by international standards. But I \n     draw your attention to the internal Chinese response to this \n     whole issue--to demonstrate why U.S. policy has to deal not \n     only with China as a state and a collective, but also reach \n     beyond that level, to the more individual level.\n       The Chinese look at intellectual-property rights, as the \n     government crack down, and many Chinese businessmen think \n     it's unfair--even though, from outside, we look at it as \n     fair. Why is it unfair? Because in China there are more \n     pressing issues--like fake medicine. Hundreds of people die \n     as a result of fake medicine. One report in the Chinese media\n      about hundreds dying--from fake wine made from industrial \n     alcohol. People drink it and go blind. Things like that \n     are more pressing issues than intellectual property. \n     [America wants the Chinese] government to, you know, \n     select intellectual-property rights and push them very \n     hard. What the Chinese populace see is the government \n     caving in to the interest of the foreigners--without \n     taking care of the serious domestic issues.\n       One more thing about pressing China. When we look at an \n     event, the nationalism is always in the back of mind. Some of \n     the same complaints of national because of this disparity \n     between the two systems. So what do you perceive the fair--\n     ``justice'' in the global and international perspective, we \n     perceive as injustice and defeat into some other forces that \n     may not be productive. I'm trying to add perspective; I'm not \n     saying specifically do this or do that. I offer an angle on \n     China's present position in the system--incompatible with the \n     democratic and market system on one hand; and, on the other \n     hand, wanting to enter into the world community.\n       So the political transformation, the liberalization, \n     democratization are really the key to the future of the U.S./\n     China relations in the long-term may not, you know like a \n     very pressing issue, tomorrow in the media. But it's like the \n     under current that we will carry the problems or your \n     [inaudible word] into a specific problem into U.S./China \n     relations. If China is not going democratic, and that is very \n     unlikely I would say. THe Chinese will observe the law of \n     the, observe the general international accepted standards \n     only by the doing system to be compatible, and then you can \n     have a more better and more productive relationship. Thank \n     you very much.\n       Sen. Baucus. I'll take the liberty of asking the first \n     questions. A lot of discussion so far has been about the \n     United States relationship to China. I would just like to \n     turn the tables and ask our panelists: How the Chinese see \n     us? I mean, do they see us as being fair or unfair? You \n     mentioned that we're pushing intellectual property \n     protection, for example, to the local people. Say, gee that's \n     not according to our priorities in China. But do the \n     businessmen in China or the Chinese leadership recognize or \n     don't know the United States has a legitimate beef after all. \n     And perhaps they should follow the United States in trying to \n     protect intellectual property. Or, on the other hand, are \n     they just using local conditions as a cover to not do what \n     they know they should do? My basic point is: What's the \n     Chinese leadership perception of the United States? For \n     example, is this nation seen as relevant around the world \n     these days? And, if we're relevant, where are we relevant to \n     how they see their future? Jim, I'll give you that one.\n       Jim Lilley. I think the main fear in China with regard to \n     U.S. attitude is that the U.S. looking for a boogie man or \n     looking for an enemy, after Russia, to settle on China and \n     will adopt the sort of containment policy which ever way you \n     would like to put it that was adopted towards the Soviet \n     Union. And so that's, I think, one of the major reason why \n     the constructive-engagement policy is the right one to draw \n     China out to avoid the impression that United States is \n     trying to encircle China and contain it.\n       Jim Kolbe. Well I listened last night at a dinner to the \n     Minister for, Director of, Administrator for Hong Kong \n     affairs in China described the commitment that China has to \n     maintaining the rules of law as he puts it and the agreement \n     that was reached with Britain over the transition of Hong \n     Kong to China. And I'm wondering if any of our speakers, this \n     morning's panelist would comment on the issue of how \n     important is the transition to Chinese rule in Hong Kong. \n     What will the rest of the world be watching in this \n     transition and what do you think we can expect as this \n     transition takes place?\n       Drew Liu. Hong Kong issue is a very touchy issue in the \n     sentiment of the Chinese mentality because it would cause the \n     Chinese a humiliating defeat. But Hong Kong is also a very \n     hot--like what we say in Chinese, a hot potato: You hold it, \n     you want to eat it, but it's hot. And there is paradox, of \n     course: Hong Kong is resources for the foreign currency and, \n     on the other hand, Hong Kong is the stronghold of liberal \n     ideas, and may help to spread political instability. In \n     reacting to that, how will the Chinese government deal with \n     Hong Kong?\n       I see several possibilities. I think the most likely \n     response is to contain Hong Kong. Right now, there's easier \n     traffic form Hong Kong to China and then, if Chinese \n     government step in, it most probably would maintain Hong \n     Kong's current system: Let Hong Kong still play the role it \n     has been playing. On the other hand, in order to prevent Hong \n     Kong's penetration, especially in the media, China would make \n     it more difficult for people to travel from Hong Kong to \n     China and from China to Hong Kong. And I think that seeing \n     this as one possible solution shows the mentality of the \n     Chinese leadership.\n       So what we are suggesting is, Hong Kong is really \n     constructing, of course, opening wider China's market, \n     marketization and giving China the stimulus to go further in \n     marketing reform, abolishing the kind of state-controlled \n     ownership structure. And on the other hand, it can gradually \n     bring, you know alternatives, some models, examples of how to \n     live and operate in a more democratic, more efficient \n     society.\n       So we propose that the following institutions, especially \n     cultural institutions, may go into Hong Kong right now and \n     then enlarge their activities--especially with regard to the \n     linkages inside China. For instance, educational projects. \n     You know, many cultural things may not be political--\n     nonpolitical, I would say. You know, purely educational, but \n     by doing this, by joint venture, joint project, then Hong \n     Kong and China can be linked. If they try to cut off Hong \n     Kong from China after 1997 in administrative ways, then \n     China's internal education would also suffer loss and damage. \n     This is a very crucial time in Hong Kong, definitely, it is \n     very, very important for the future of China. Thank you.\n       Jim Lilley [inaudible words] is basically allow free market \n     forces to go and strangle the political process in the \n     cradle. And they have a lot of sympathy from Chinese in Hong \n     Kong who think this western bourgeois democracy is really not \n     applicable. So I think you've got somewhat of an economy \n     there in terms. Bob, you know the formula very well: Let the \n     free-market process work in Hong Kong. Keep it the goose \n     laying the golden eggs. Have commercial rule of law in Hong \n     Kong. Persist it for 50 years--but do not allow the political \n     process to work and to contaminate China. That is the formula \n     they have--yes, their formula. I'm talking about how the \n     Chinese view Hong Kong.\n       The question came up last night, as the Congressman knows. \n     Somebody asked our distinguished visitor why he didn't deal \n     with the democratic party in Hong Kong, the dissenters. And \n     what he said in his very cogent and very frank way is this: \n     The basic law of Hong Kong calls for freedom of press, \n     freedom of assembly, freedom of da-da, da-da, da-da--he \n     sounded like Jefferson. Of course, everybody knows that isn't \n     what happens. And if, the basic law says very clearly, we're \n     going to have a fully elected, [inaudible word] in Hong Kong. \n     So what are you worried about?\n       The fact is, course, that most people say the Hong Kong \n     process works just fine, but scattered angry people keep \n     pushing a ``bourgeois democracy'' that doesn't really make \n     much sense. ``They are all trained in England. They talk \n     English better than we do. They don't really represent the \n     grassroots.'' \n     [[Page S6558]] Fact is, these people keep getting most of the \n     votes. There is a feeling out in Hong Kong that they really \n     do deserve democracy. And there are people voting for Martin \n     Lee and Company. [Inaudible words.] They're voting for them. \n     It's a rather positive sign.\n       Moderator: Okay.\n       Sen. Bingaman. I wanted to ask about our trade, growing \n     trade imbalance with China. As I see it, the first year of \n     the Bush administration, we had about a $3 million trade \n     deficit with China. This year, this last year, we had about a \n     $28 billion trade deficit with China. And China has only \n     began to export: As a share of their gross national product, \n     China is not near, doesn't devote near as much of their \n     economy to export manufacture as do other industrial \n     countries. So the potential for increased manufacture for \n     export is great. I see this growing geometrically over the \n     next five to 10 years and, in the next century, a greater \n     U.S. trade deficit with China than we have with Japan today--\n     with no way to turn that around. This will hamper our ability \n     to produce or maintain manufacturing jobs in this country. I \n     would be interested as to whether I am right or wrong in that \n     prediction, and if there is some solution other than \n     continued hand-wringing and teeth-gnashing.\n       Jim Lilley. I'll take a crack at it. That is what Mickey \n     Kantor's trips were all about. I don't think Mickey is \n     sitting in a corner gnashing his teeth--he's going to the \n     Chinese and saying: Open your market. I think this is all \n     about China getting into GATT and WTO. This is why they want \n     to come in as a developing nation. Fifteen percent, 22 \n     percent tariffs, developed nation, fifteen percent. Three \n     thousand items are put on the block. They've got to protect \n     inefficient dinosaurs in the state-owned enterprise sector. \n     They are frightened of what GATT and WTO will do to them. So \n     we can face up to this problem the way we faced it in other \n     areas where it has worked--Taiwan and Korea. It hasn't worked \n     in Japan, unfortunately, because of their closed system. But \n     we have been able to close some of these trade gaps by \n     persistently demanding they pay royalties on intellectual \n     properties--our strong suit, where we can export a great \n     deal.\n       As Jack Valenti said, our exports in the entertainment \n     industry are one of our largest exports. In some sectors of \n     China we are comparatively effective. So you go after those. \n     I'm talking about power. I'm talking about aircraft. I'm \n     talking about automobiles. I'm talking about electronics. The \n     Americans have to get in there and compete as strong as any \n     nation in the world. We aren't going to win the China market \n     by getting quotas or trying to force them into some sort of \n     managed-trade arrangement. You get the Chinese to come across \n     and change their trade surplus with us by opening their \n     market. I think this is what Kantor is trying to do, and we \n     should support it 100 percent. We are beginning to make some \n     progress on this. But it's going to be a long hard road.\n       Male Voice. The question that has come to my mind is the \n     degree to which the other countries--let's say Europe, Japan \n     and others--are using our MFN position really [inaudible \n     words], and are saying to China: No WTO membership until you \n     open up and so forth. I agree that Japan\n      and the others are taking advantage of us by working with \n     the Chinese leadership.\n       Jim Lilley. I think, Senator, you make a very good point. \n     The Europeans and Japanese love to hold our coats while we go \n     in and slug it out with the Chinese. We finally get the \n     agreement, then they all follow to take advantage of it. Let \n     me make a contrast. On human rights, it was totally \n     bilateral. Nobody else had anything to do with our position. \n     And this is what undercut us, or it's one big reason. The \n     business community did not support us. No nation in the world \n     supported us. They said, ``What a bunch of goofballs. We're \n     going to pick up the pieces of the American effort.'' But, on \n     GATT and WTO, we got a lot of support; on IPR, we got a lot \n     of support. They aren't as aggressive as we are, the don't \n     have their Mickey Kantors--but they did come in. And they are \n     going to support us to a degree on this. Of course, most of \n     them are intellectual-property right violators too! So, \n     there's all sort of hypocrisy mixed into this arrangement.\n       But it seems to me that in WTO and IPR, we are on solid \n     ground with our friends, but as usual, Senator, the Americans \n     have to take the lead.\n       Male Voice. [Inaudible words.]\n       Male Voice. Pardon.\n       Male Voice. [Inaudible word.]\n       Jim Lilley. Well, I supposed what we try to do, at least we \n     tried to do this when I was in GATT, is arrange tougher \n     conditions on the Chinese. We would working with EC. And one \n     of the, rather, I suppose I'm talking too much again. Through \n     the EC and directly, we used to say to the Chinese: ``You \n     know, Taiwan's an applicant too. And they are meeting all of \n     the standards of GATT, WTO. If you drag your feet, it could \n     be possible that Taiwan would get it first.'' This was a very \n     sobering influence, I think. It works about once or twice--\n     that's all. And then you've got to get better tactics to work \n     on it.\n       But the more usual argument, and you get European support \n     on this, is if you don't shape up, you aren't going to get \n     the technology you want. An the do lust for technology, they \n     want the best--that's all you hear from the Chinese. So this \n     is where you put the brakes on. We don't have COCOM anymore, \n     but some sort of an arrangement with our allies. The Chinese \n     are very dependent upon Europe and Japan to get some sort of \n     common policy for when they violate too much by ``going their \n     own way,'' as people say, you can bring to bear collective \n     pressure.\n       This approach worked very well in 1990 when I was in China. \n     We worked very closely with Japan, the Europeans, Canadians, \n     Australians, New Zealanders--to exert leverage. Because in \n     the international bank, let me just make one point, China is \n     very dependent on higher [inaudible word] loans. They are the \n     biggest recipients in the world. It's two to three billion \n     dollars a year. It may not sound like much. But it is crucial \n     when matched with a third yen loan package from Japan, and \n     most every nation from the United States. Don't use it as a \n     club publicly, but quietly and effectively, through \n     diplomatic channels.\n       Nigel Holloway. I just want to say that the trade imbalance \n     within the U.S. and China is really quite extraordinary. U.S. \n     exports to China are less than $10 billion and China's \n     exports here approach $40 billion. A lot of it has to do with \n     the restructuring that is going on. The question then is, is \n     Chin going to become another Japan, the capitalist but closed \n     market. My hunch is it will not--because the corporate \n     structure in China is evolving very different from that in \n     Japan. Japan has these [inaudible word] networks of companies \n     that basically collude through long-term equity arrangements. \n     But the Chinese don't do business that way. I think that's \n     something to bear in mind.\n       What we really have, as Jim says, is a market-access \n     question. China is starting to open its market. If you look \n     at the market within China, there are enormous barriers for \n     one province trying to trade with another. They basically \n     compete with each other, and stumble over each other, and try \n     and prevent goods from one province going into another. And \n     this is the area where the World Bank is especially keen to \n     see major changes. And I think it's also one the U.S. should \n     focus increasingly on: If it can pry open China's market, \n     this will be the biggest factor in increasing democratization \n     in China.\n       Sen. Baucus. Stand up please. Thank you.\n       Question. [Inaudible.]\n       Jim Lilley. I'm glad you asked for clarification, because \n     there may be some misunderstanding. I'm not saying the United \n     States will stay out of this thing. We are involved up to \n     here. We have something called the Taiwan Relations Act, \n     which is the law of the land. We also have an increasingly \n     strong relationship with China. What I resent very much is \n     lobbying groups and foreign ministry tantrums towards the \n     United States to try to get us to become their point man on \n     beating up on the other side. That's what I don't like. We've \n     got a lot of leverage in this deal and I think we should use \n     it--because both of them really need us in this one.\n       But don't get trapped into a Chinese ``tong war'' on it. \n     Keep you powder dry. Keep managing it carefully. Don't make a \n     great big announcement of a Taiwan policy review and beat the \n     gong saying this\n      some sort of a big deal, when it turns out to be a big fat \n     zero and everybody knows it--the Chinese become furious at \n     the policy review and the Taiwanese are disappointed. Much \n     better to keep your mouth shut and work a little bit \n     quietly on this thing as it is run by all of the other \n     administrations.\n       By the same token, you have to be careful in terms of \n     Chinese sensitivities on this. You also have to be careful in \n     the Taiwan process, but as I was saying to Bob Kupp earlier, \n     we have been pushing democracy in China for about 35 years. I \n     used to beat upon the Taiwan government regularly about \n     getting the dissidents out and letting the Taiwanese back in, \n     letting the political process work. We succeeded. And now \n     you've got a flourishing democracy, a chaotic democracy, and \n     even fist-fighting in the legislative halls.\n       Jim Lilley. On the other hand, for the United States to \n     begin stumbling around in the thicket of Taiwan domestic \n     policies, watch your step. The responsible businessmen and \n     politicians in Taiwan know the limits of what they can do. \n     And they know that breaking with China is not in their \n     interest. But this doesn't stop demagogues and others from \n     raising hell on the basis of political strategy. On the other \n     side, on China's side, if I hear ``sacred sovereignty'' one \n     more time, I think I'll vomit. I've gotten into a lot of \n     trouble by noting how it sounds like Gunboat Diplomacy from \n     the 19th century. ``It's what you Chinese hate the worst. \n     Don't talk about [engaging in] it yourself; don't start \n     practicing it. Don't start flexing your muscles and saying if \n     we don't get what we want, we're going to use force. This \n     doesn't make any sense.''\n       The irony is that China and Taiwan are getting along \n     extremely well--solving problem after problem. Taiwan just \n     hosted the highest-ranking Chinese delegation in history and \n     many, many leading figures in the political, economic and \n     cultural realms deal with their Chinese friends. You have \n     Taiwan businessmen going over there to spend four hours with \n     Jiang Zemin giving him advice on how to make a new central \n     bank. You've got people from Taiwan going over there and \n     reorganizing all of their deep ports--a major priority in \n     China. You got them keeping the whole economy bustling. Of \n     course, there's speculation, a few nasty little elements of \n     it, but it increases the growth rate.\n       [[Page S6559]] So all I can say to America is: Be careful \n     you don't, somehow or another in the next year or so, get \n     trapped into this ugly little war or this ugly little fracas \n     they are trying to create. It's not in our interest to do so.\n       Sen. Baucus. Any questions?\n       Voice. [Inaudible words.]\n       Nigel Holloway. Yeah. Let me just give you three principles \n     of what's happening in China right now. You have three \n     things. You have what we call persistent feudalism, which is \n     Confucianism--no, chaos collectively. This feudalism is part \n     of the Chinese structure. This mixes in with decaying \n     socialism. And this is socialism's ingrown privilege, a party \n     privilege. Third, you have rapid capitalism. You have \n     corruption, nepotism and growth. They all jam together in \n     today's China.\n       If you have this growth and if you have feudalism, and if \n     you have this decaying socialism, what results is great \n     disparties of wealth between provinces, et cetera. And the \n     millions of people begin to move towards the productive \n     areas. It's very hard to control because these people live in \n     camps. They have three and four children. They pay no \n     attention to birth control or the national policy. It drives \n     the Chinese wild--who, of course, have some rather draconian \n     methods to keep things down. Basically, I think they have \n     been very successful in keeping control of the population--\n     but it's not very pretty to look at. They think it's crucial \n     to the control of the situation.\n       What they are trying to do now in a very, very concerted \n     effort is beginning to move investment capitalism into the \n     hinterlands, but they've got to make it competitively \n     attractive, and that's hard to do. They recognize the \n     problem; they recognize it's very serious. It's right at the \n     heart of how you reform state-owned enterprises. Because the \n     conservatives are saying, keep the money flowing. Others say \n     let them go bankrupt and take care of this thing through \n     other means. And it ends up as gridlock in many cases. But, \n     at least, I think they are acutely aware of the problem and \n     are trying to deal with it.\n       Sen. Baucus. You have time for one more question.\n       Question. [Inaudible words.]\n       Drew Liu. We touch on the topic of the trade imbalance as \n     China opens up its market. And I would like to say something \n     more about the fundamental problem, the system problem, the \n     structural problem. One of the things is transparency of the \n     legal system. And if you don't have transparency--when the \n     local government, you know, the sector cannot break their own \n     laws--this instantly creates barriers. For instance, on the \n     WTO: The center wants to enter the WTO. The local, some of \n     the local wants to enter the center also, but not without \n     some incentive. But there's some problem in it. That is how \n     to guarantee the Chinese abide by these laws and the \n     standards. And, there are loopholes, you know, that are \n     unpredictable. Our future in China comes without a well \n     established legal system, without transparency and due \n     process.\n       And the second thing is the political system. For instance, \n     entering the WTO, whether China can do it or not politically, \n     is a question. If, in entering the WTO, the center enforces \n     the regulations--you know, opening its market--then maybe \n     thirty percent of the state-owned workers will be unemployed. \n     A great political problem and a great risk to the Chinese \n     leadership. But are you going to take the risk or not take \n     the risk? And what if the risk becomes threatening and then \n     it [the new policy] reverses in some way. Much uncertainty \n     links to the internal process of the Chinese system.\n       Jim Lilley. Okay. I just want to make one comment on \n     agriculture. A terrible problem for China is that \n     agricultural land is shrinking; the harvest is not good. They \n     are going to import more and more grain. It's going to be a \n     big problem and so I would say your agriculture-export \n     possibilities are considerable. Some estimates have China \n     importing as much as 100 million tons of grain by the next \n     century; they have made some bad converting mistakes in terms \n     of agricultural land, industrial land. The solution, people \n     say, is what they call village- and township-enterprises: \n     Basically capitalistic, they are put into the countryside, \n     are use surplus agriculture labor to create small consumer \n     items. But they've gone about increasing agriculture \n     production by importing chemical fertilizers, by developing \n     their own plants. It's really very, very difficult for them. \n     And I see a big market for agricultural products.\n       Sen. Baucus. Okay. We have no more time! Let's give a great \n     round of applause to our panelists: Drew Liu, Nigel Holloway \n     and Jim Lilley. Bob mentioned a packet of information which I \n     think will be very interesting for everyone. I encourage you \n     to go pick up a copy as you leave. I want to thank CELI very \n     much for hosting this event--I want another soon.

DEUTCH, OF MASSACHUSETTS, TO BE DIRECTOR OF \n                          CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank my gallant friend from \nNebraska. I rise in support of the position he has taken and also that \nof the distinguished chairman of the committee, the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  In the 103d Congress and then the 104th, I offered legislation that \nwould basically break up the existing Central Intelligence Agency and \nreturn its component parts to the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of State. This in the manner that the Office of Strategic \nServices was divided and parceled out at the end of World War II.\n  I had hoped to encourage a debate on the role of intelligence and of \nsecrecy in American society. That debate has taken place. Some of the \nresults, I think, can be seen in the nomination of a distinguished \nscientist and public servant, John Deutch, to this position.\n  This could not have been more clear in his testimony. He made a \npoint, self-evident we would suppose, but not frequently to be \nencountered in a pronouncement of a potential DCI. He said:\n\n       Espionage does not rest comfortably in a democracy. \n     Secrecy, which is essential to protect sources and methods, \n     is not welcome in an open society. If our democracy is to \n     support intelligence activities, the people must be confident \n     that our law and rules will be respected.\n\n  It may have come as a surprise--although it ought not to have--in \nrecent months and weeks, to find how many persons there are in this \ncountry who do not have confidence that our laws and rules will be \nrespected; who see the Government in conspiratorial modes, directed \nagainst the people in ways that could be of huge consequence to \nAmericans.\n  Richard Hofstadter referred to this disposition when he spoke of \n``The Paranoid Style in American Politics.'' Thus, for example, the \nwidespread belief that the CIA was somehow involved in the \nassassination of President Kennedy.\n  It is important to understand how deep this disposition is in our \nsociety. In 1956, even before Hofstadter spoke of it, Edward A. Shils \nof the University of Chicago--a great, great, social scientist, who has \njust passed away--published his book, ``The Torment of Secrecy,'' in \nwhich he wrote:\n\n       The exfoliation and intertwinement of the various patterns \n     of belief that the world is dominated by unseen circles of \n     conspirators, operating behind our backs, is one of the \n     characteristic features of modern society.\n\n  Such a belief was very much a feature of the Bolshevik regime that \ntook shape in Russia in 1917 and 1918. Hence the decision to help found \nand fund in the United States a Communist Party, part of which would be \nclandestine. The recent discovery in the archives in Moscow that John \nReed received a payment of 1,008,000 rubles in 1920. As soft money, \nthat would be a very considerable sum today.\n  It is said that organizations in conflict become like one other. \nThere is a degree to which we have emulated the Soviet model in our own \nintelligence services. A very powerful essay on this matter has just \nbeen written by Jefferson Morley in the Washington Post under the \nheadline ``Understanding Oklahoma'' in an article entitled ``Department \nof Secrecy: The Invisible Bureaucracy That Unites Alienated America in \nSuspicion.''\n  I would refer also to Douglas Turner this weekend in the Buffalo \nNews. I spoke of these concerns in an earlier statement on the Senate \nfloor entitled ``The Paranoid Style in American Politics,'' which I ask \nunanimous consent be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, what we have today is so much at \nvariance with what was thought we would get. Allen Dulles was very much \npart of the foundation of postwar intelligence, having been in the OSS, \nserving with great distinction in Switzerland during World War II. \nPeter Grose, in his new biography, ``Gentleman Spy: The Life of Allen \nDulles,'' recounts the testimony Dulles gave before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee on April 25, 1947, as we were about to enact the \nNational Security Act of 1947 which created a small coordinating body, \nthe Central Intelligence Agency.\n\n\n[[Page S6561]]\n\n       Personnel for a central intelligence agency, he argued, \n     ``need not be very numerous * * *. The operation of the \n     service must be neither flamboyant nor overshrouded with the \n     mystery and abracadabra which the amateur detective likes to \n     assume.'' In a lecturing tone, he tried to tell the Senators \n     how intelligence is actually assembled.\n       ``Because of its glamour and mystery, overemphasis is \n     generally placed on what is called secret intelligence, \n     namely the intelligence that is obtained by secret means and \n     by secret agents. * * * In time of peace the bulk of \n     intelligence can be obtained through overt channels, through \n     our diplomatic and consular missions, and our military, naval \n     and air attaches in the normal and proper course of their \n     work. It can also be obtained through the world press, the \n     radio, and through the many thousands of Americans, business \n     and professional men and American residents of foreign \n     countries, who are naturally and normally brought in touch \n     with what is going on in those countries.\n       ``A proper analysis of the intelligence obtainable by these \n     overt, normal, and aboveboard means would supply us with over \n     80 percent, I should estimate, of the information required \n     for the guidance of our national policy.''\n\n  Mr. President, that did not happen. Instead, we entered upon a five-\ndecade mode of secret analysis, analysis withheld from public scrutiny, \nwhich is the only way we can verify the truth of a hypothesis in \nnatural science or in the social sciences.\n  The result was massive miscalculation. Nicholas Eberstadt in his \nwonderful new book, ``The Tyranny of Numbers,'' writes ``It is probably \nsafe to say that the U.S. Government's attempt to describe the Soviet \neconomy has been the largest single project in social science research \never undertaken.'' He said this in 1990, in testimony before the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations. ``The largest single project in social \nscience research ever undertaken,'' It was a calamity.\n  No one has been more forthright in this regard than Adm. Stansfield \nTurner in an article in Foreign Affairs at about that time. He said \nwhen it came to predicting the collapse of the Soviet Union, the \ncorporate view of the intelligence community missed by a mile.\n  I can remember in the first years of the Kennedy administration \nmeeting with Walt Rostow, chairman of the policy planning staff in the \nDepartment of State. As regards the Soviet Union, he said he was not \none of those ``6 percent\n forever people.'' But there it was, locked into our analysis. That is \nwhat the President knew.\n\n  In Richard Reeves' remarkable biography of John F. Kennedy, he \nrecords that the Agency told the President that by the year 2000 the \nGNP of the Soviet Union would be three times that of the United States. \nAgain, that is what the President knew. Any number of economists might \nhave disagreed. The great conservative theorists, Friedman, Hayek, \nStigler, would never have thought any such thing. Important work done \nby Frank Holzman, at Tufts, and the Russian Research Center at Harvard \ndisputed what little was public. But to no avail. The President knew \notherwise, and others did not know what it was he knew.\n  The consequence was an extraordinary failure to foresee the central \ngeo political event of our time. A vast overdependence on military and \nsimilar outlays that leave us perilously close to economic instability \nourselves.\n  I would like to close with a letter written me in 1991 by Dale W. \nJorgenson, professor of economics at the Kennedy School of Government, \nin which he said:\n\n       I believe that the importance of economic intelligence is \n     increasing greatly with the much-discussed globalization of \n     the U.S. economy. However, the cloak-and-dagger model is even \n     more inappropriate to our new economic situation than it was \n     to the successful prosecution of the Cold War that has just \n     concluded. The lessons for the future seem to me to be rather \n     transparent. The U.S. Government needs to invest a lot more \n     in international economic assessments. * * * (I)t should \n     reject the CIA monopoly model and try to create the kind of \n     intellectual competition that now prevails between CBO and \n     OMB on domestic policy, aided by Brookings, AEI [American \n     Enterprise Institute], the Urban Institute, the Kennedy \n     School, and many others.\n\n  That is wise counsel. I have the confidence that John Deutch, as a \nscientist, will understand it. I am concerned, however, that the \nadministration will not.\n  Mancur Olson, in his great book, ``The Rise and Decline of Nations'', \nasked: Why has it come about that the two nations whose institutions \nwere destroyed in World War II, Germany and Japan, have had the most \neconomic success since? Whereas Britain, not really much success at \nall; the United States--yes, but. He came up with a simple answer. \nDefeat wiped out all those choke points, all those rents, all those \nsharing agreements, all those veto structures that enable institutions \nto prevent things from happening. And we are seeing it in this our own \nGovernment today, 5 years after the Berlin wall came down. Nothing \nchanges, or little changes.\n  Recall that 3 years before the wall came down the CIA reported that \nper capita GDP was higher in East Germany than in West Germany. I hope \nI take no liberty that I mentioned this once to Dr. Deutch and added, \n``Any taxi driver in Berlin could have told you that was not so.'' Dr. \nDeutch replied, ``Any taxi driver in Washington.'' A most reassuring \nresponse.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her graciousness \nfor allowing me to speak when in fact in alternation it would have been \nher turn.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Congressional Record, Apr. 25, 1995]\n\n                The Paranoid Style in American Politics\n\n       Mr. Moynihan. Mr. President, as we think and, indeed, pray \n     our way through the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, \n     asking how such a horror might have come about, and how \n     others might be prevented, Senators could do well to step \n     outside the chamber and look down the mall at the Washington \n     Monument. It honors the Revolutionary general who once \n     victorious, turned his army over to the Continental Congress \n     and retired to his estates. Later, recalled to the highest \n     office in the land, he served dutifully one term, then a \n     second but then on principle not a day longer. Thus was \n     founded the first republic, the first democracy since the age \n     of Greece and Rome.\n       There is not a more serene, confident, untroubled symbol of \n     the nation in all the capital. Yet a brief glance will show \n     that the color of the marble blocks of which the monument is \n     constructed changes about a quarter of the way up. Thereby \n     hangs a tale of another troubled time; not our first, just \n     as, surely, this will not be our last.\n       As befitted a republic, the monument was started by a \n     private charitable group, as we would now say, the Washington \n     National Monument Society. Contributions came in cash, but \n     also in blocks of marble, many with interior inscriptions \n     which visitors willing to climb the steps can see to this \n     day. A quarter of the way up, that is. For in 1852, Pope Pius \n     IX donated a block of marble from the temple of Concord in \n     Rome. Instantly, the American Party, or the Know-Nothings \n     (``I know nothing,'' was their standard reply to queries \n     about their platform) divined a Papist Plot. An installation \n     of the Pope's block of marble would signal the Catholic \n     Uprising. A fevered agitation began. As recorded by Ray Allen \n     Billington in The Protest Crusade, 1800-1860:\n       ``One pamphlet, The Pope's Strategem: ``Rome to America!'' \n     An Address to the Protestants of the United States, against \n     placing the Pope's block of Marble in the Washington Monument \n     (1852), urged Protestants to hold indignation meetings and \n     contribute another block to be placed next to the Pope's \n     `bearing an inscription by which all men may see that we are \n     awake to the hypocrisy and schemes of that designing, crafty, \n     subtle, far seeing and far reaching Power, which is ever \n     grasping after the whole World, to sway its iron scepter, \n     with bloodstained hands, over the millions of its \n     inhabitants.'''\n       One night early in March, 1854, a group of Know-Nothings \n     broke into the storage sheds on the monument grounds and \n     dragged the Pope's marble off towards the Potomac. Save for \n     the occasional ``sighting'', as we have come to call such \n     phenomena, it has never to be located since.\n       Work on the monument stopped. Years later, in 1876, \n     Congress appropriated funds to complete the job, which the \n     Corps of Engineers, under the leadership of Lieutenant \n     Colonel Thomas I. Casey did with great flourish in time for \n     the centennial observances of 1888.\n       Dread of Catholicism ran its course, if slowly. (Edward M. \n     Stanton, then Secretary of War was convinced the \n     assassination of President Lincoln was the result of a \n     Catholic plot.) Other manias followed, all brilliantly \n     describe in Richard Hofstadter's revelatory lecture ``the \n     Paranoid Style in American Politics'' which he delivered as \n     the Herbert Spencer Lecture at Oxford University within days \n     of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Which to this day \n     remains a fertile source of conspiracy mongering. George Will \n     cited Hofstadter's essay this past weekend on the television \n     program ``This Week with David Brinkley.'' He deals with the \n     same subject matter in a superb column in this morning's \n     Washington Post which has this bracing conclusion.\n       ``It is reassuring to remember that paranoiacs have always \n     been with us, but have never defined us.''\n       I hope, Mr. President, as we proceed to consider \n     legislation, if that is necessary, in \n     [[Page S6562]] response to the bombing, we would be mindful \n     of a history in which we have often overreached, to our cost, \n     and try to avoid such an overreaction.\n       We have seen superb performance of the FBI. What more any \n     nation could ask of an internal security group I cannot \n     conceive. We have seen the effectiveness of our State \n     troopers, of our local police forces, fire departments, \n     instant nationwide cooperation which should reassure us \n     rather than frighten us.\n       I would note in closing, Mr. President, that Pope John Paul \n     II will be visiting the United States this coming October.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/11/senate-section/article/S6560-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               NATIVE AMERICAN PROGRAMS AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, \nthe Convention on Nuclear Safety done at Vienna on September 20, 1994. \nThis Convention was adopted by a Diplomatic Conference convened by the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in June 1994 and was opened \nfor signature in Vienna on September 20, 1994, during the IAEA General \nConference. Secretary of Energy O'Leary signed the Convention for the \nUnited States on that date. Also transmitted for the information of the \nSenate is the report of the Department of State concerning the \nConvention.\n  At the September 1991 General Conference of the IAEA, a resolution \nwas adopted, with U.S. support, calling for the IAEA secretariat to \ndevelop elements for a possible International Convention on Nuclear \nSafety. From 1992 to 1994, the IAEA convened seven expert working group \nmeetings, in which the United States participated. The IAEA Board of \nGovernors approved a draft text at its meeting in February 1994, after \nwhich the IAEA convened a Diplomatic Conference attended by \nrepresentatives of more than 80 countries in June 1994. The final text \nof the Convention resulted from that Conference.\n  The Convention establishes a legal obligation on the part of Parties \nto apply certain general safety principles to the construction, \noperation, and regulation of land-based civilian nuclear power plants \nunder their jurisdiction. Parties to the Convention also agree to \nsubmit periodic reports on the steps they are taking to implement the \nobligations of the Convention. These reports will be reviewed and \ndiscussed at review meetings of the Parties, at \n[[Page S6563]] which each Party will have an opportunity to discuss and \nseek clarification of reports submitted by other Parties.\n  The United States has initiated many steps to deal with nuclear \nsafety, and has supported the effort to develop this Convention. With \nits obligatory reporting and review procedures, requiring Parties to \ndemonstrate in international meetings how they are complying with \nsafety principles, the Convention should encourage countries to improve \nnuclear safety domestically and thus result in an increase in nuclear \nsafety worldwide. I urge the Senate to act expeditiously in giving its \nadvice and consent to ratification.\n                                                  William J.

That might be a little hard to do, call them up and vote on \nthem or move to table.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I hope that they will be brought up.\n  As I say, the situation has changed since this last vote. If we had \nprevailed on this last vote, I would have thought we would be able to \nfinish tomorrow by 2 o'clock, something like that. Now, the situation \nhas changed, so it is a little difficult to say. All I can say is we \nwill move these amendments along as fast as we can.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand there might be some Senators leaving at an \nearly hour tomorrow and it might not be appropriate to have these votes \nwhen they would miss so many.\n  I wonder if, after cloture, we may have one or two and that might end \nit for the day, but I see the heads are shaking, so you do not want me \nto know that tonight.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is not a question of not wanting the Senator to know. \nIf we told him something, it would be from ignorance, I am afraid.\n  In any event, it would be my hope that we could finish tomorrow at a \ndecent hour, but I am not so sure based on that last vote we had.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/11/senate-section/article/S6563-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6563-S6565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nresume the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 534) to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to \n     provide authority for States to limit the interstate \n     transportation of municipal solid waste, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to seek the chairman's \nclarification of the relationship between the flow-control provisions \nof S. 534 and existing State law. Section 4012(i)(2) of the bill before \nthe Senate states that ``[n]othing in the section shall be construed to \nauthorize a political subdivision of a State to exercise flow control \nauthority granted by this section in a manner that is inconsistent with \nState law.''\n  Am I correct that this language would restrict a local government \nfrom exercising flow control if an existing State statute does not \ngrant such authority to a local government, such as section 15.1-28.01 \nof the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended?\n  Mr. ROBB. I share the concerns of my senior colleague. In Virginia, \nlocal governments and private industry have worked over the years to \ndevelop a fair compromise to provide for an effective integrated waste \nmanagement system. It is not our intention to have this legislation \ninterfere with that balance.\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senators from Virginia are correct. This legislation \nis not intended to expand a local government's flow-control authority \nbeyond that permitted under existing State law.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have a series of amendments that have \nbeen agreed to. I will send them to the desk successively.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 861\n\n  (Purpose: To allow exemption from certain requirements of units in \n                     small, remote Alaska villages)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The first is an amendment by Senator Murkowski. I send \nthe amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

So on behalf of \nmyself and of the occupant of the chair, the distinguished chairman of \nthe subcommittee, I thank the ranking member for all of his support in \nmaking this possible.\n  I, too, hope that tomorrow we can finish what we have here. It may be \nthat we can. Certainly, we are going to try.\n  We are going to come in at 9:30, and there is a vote on cloture at \n10. Regardless of the outcome of that vote, I hope we can continue \nworking to see if we cannot finish all of this.

But it is my goal, and I know it \nis the goal of the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member, \nto finish this bill quickly. There is always the threat that if we do \nnot get it through, the leader will pull it down, as he has other \nbusiness we have to attend to.\n  So I thank the ranking member for all of his support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/11/senate-section/article/S6565-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
