Mr. President, this morning, leader time has been reserved, \nand the Senate will begin consideration of S. 1061, the gift ban \nlegislation, for the purposes of debate only. At 11 a.m., the Senate \nwill resume consideration of S. 1060, the lobbying bill, at which time \nSenator Lautenberg will be recognized to offer an amendment under a 60-\nminute time limitation.

Senator McConnell and Senator Levin did yeomen work. They \nreached a compromise that made it possible for us to finish all of our \nwork on lobbying reform, except the one pending Lautenberg amendment \nand a managers' amendment, and we will have final passage then at 12 \nnoon. I think that is a very positive accomplishment, and I commend all \nSenators who were involved in that effort for their work. I hope we can \ndo the same today on gift rule reform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10583-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10583-S10585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRESSIONAL GIFT REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Campbell]. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to consideration of S. 1061, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1061) to provide for congressional gift reform.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank my friend from \nMississippi for the work he did yesterday in helping to expedite the \nbipartisan conclusion to the lobbying disclosure effort, even though we \nhave not technically yet concluded because we still have to vote on \nfinal passage. I think it is quite clear that after we consider the \nLautenberg amendment that we will then finally pass a very strong \nlobbying disclosure reform measure.\n  This effort has been going on now literally for five decades. When \nthat bill was originally passed in 1946, not more than 2 years had \npassed before President Truman noted that it was not working. It just \nsimply had so many loopholes in it that even then it was not doing the \njob that was intended. He urged that there be some reform to try to \nclose those loopholes.\n  There have been efforts made in every decade since. We have made \nefforts in the past few years, and while we do not have a law yet on \nthe books, we at least have acted and we have done so in a bipartisan \nmanner and a very forthright and very forceful manner.\n  There are a lot of people who have been involved in this effort who \nappropriately deserve credit. I do want to thank the majority whip for \nhis efforts yesterday in helping to bring us to where we are this \nmorning.\n  Lobbying disclosure, which we will finally pass later on this \nmorning, is one of the three pillars of reform. The other two are gift \nban and campaign finance reform. It is the gift ban, the so-called gift \nreform bill, S. 1061, which is \n\n[[Page S 10584]]\nnow before us. This bill has been introduced by myself, Mr. Cohen, Mr. \nGlenn, Mr. McCain, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. \nBaucus.\n  I want to first say just how important the work of Messrs. Wellstone, \nLautenberg, and Feingold have been in this effort. They have exerted \nvery strong leadership on gift ban and on gift reform, and their \nefforts are reflected in this version of the bill. This bill reflects \nthe work of many people, but nobody more than the efforts of Senator \nWellstone, along with Senator Feingold and Senator Lautenberg, who have \nput so much time in forcing the Senate's attention to this bill.\n  S. 1061 is now the freestanding bill that is before us. It is that \nbill that we begin debate on this morning.\n  Our bill will put an end to business as usual when it comes to gifts. \nIt will end the so-called recreational trips for Members who go to play \nin charitable golf, tennis, and skiing tournaments. It will put an end \nto the unlimited meals that are paid for by lobbyists and others. It \nwill put an end to tickets to sporting events, concerts, and theater.\n  It is hard to see how we can say that we have made the Congress \naccountable and how we have politically reformed the way in which we \noperate in Washington if we continue to allow special interests to pay \nfor free recreational travel, free golf tournaments, free meals, free \nfootball, basketball, and concert tickets. We just simply can no longer \nsay that we are changing the way we operate if we continue to allow \nthose kinds of gifts.\n  Under the current congressional gift rules, Members and staff are \nfree to accept gifts of up to $250 from anybody, including lobbyists. \nGifts of under $100 do not even count. We are free to accept an \nunlimited number of gifts of less than $100 in value. That could be \nfootball tickets, theater tickets--anything you can think of. If it is \nworth less than $100, we can take it, we do not need to disclose it, \nand we can take an unlimited number of them. There is no limit at all \non meals. It does not matter who pays for it, how much the tab is, we \ncan take it.\n  Congressional travel is also virtually unlimited under the current \nrules. Members and staff are free to travel to recreational events, \nsuch as golf and ski tournaments, even at the expense of lobbyists or \ntrade groups. That is business as usual, and it just simply is not \nacceptable anymore. If we are going to restore and enhance the respect \nfor Congress, we are going to have to tighten our gift rules.\n  Last year when this bill was on the floor, we heard a lot of talk \nabout how strict limits, if we adopted them, would shut down the \nKennedy Center or put restaurant employees out of work throughout the \nWashington area. What an indictment of Congress that would be if it \nwere true. Can it really be that we accept so many free meals and \ntickets that entire industries in the Washington area are dependent on \nus continuing to take these gifts? It seems inconceivable that that is \nwhat some people said about the measure which we voted on last year.\n  The basic premise of our bill is that we should start living under \nthe same rules as other Americans. Average citizens do not have trade \ngroups offering them free trips to resorts; average citizens do not \nhave lobbyists treating them to dinners and lunches at fancy \nrestaurants; average citizens do not have special interests providing \nthem with free tickets to concerts, theater and sporting events; and \neven if some average citizens did--and I am sure there are a few who do \nget such gifts--we have a higher responsibility. We have the \nresponsibility to increase public confidence in this institution, and \nwe are the only ones really who can do it. Nobody else can do this for \nus. Nobody else can change the rules under which we operate. But what \nthe American people are telling us is that they want us to change the \nway we operate here in many ways.\n  They want lobbying that is done by paid professional lobbyists to be \nmore open. They want to know who is being paid, how much, and by whom, \nto lobby Congress.\n  Under the Senate bill that we will vote on later this morning, they \nwill get it. They want to restrict the gifts which come to Members of \nCongress, be they tickets to sporting events, meals, or be it the free \nrecreational travel available to Members and to our families paid for \nby special interests. They want that done with. I hope when we pass \nthis bill, they will get it.\n  They want Members to change the way we finance campaigns. They want \nto reduce the amount of money which is raised and the time that is \nspent to raise it. They want to reduce the length of campaigns, and \nthey want to try to put some limit on how much money is spent in those \ncampaigns. I hope that they will get that, some day soon, as well.\n  These are tough, political reform issues. We all know it. If they \nwere not difficult, we would have done this a long time ago. These \nmeasures, these three pillars of reform, address the fundamental \nrelationship between Congress and the people.\n  Mr. President, the Members of this body will no doubt remember, as \nthe public remembers, just how close we were to resolving this issue in \nthe last Congress, when right up to the last minute we thought that we \nhad reformed both gifts and lobby disclosure.\n  When the lobby reform and gift issues were debated last October, the \nopponents of the conference report raised some substantive concerns \nrelative to lobby reform, which we have now successfully addressed.\n  The opponents of the bill last year repeatedly said, and strongly \nsaid, that they had no objection whatever to the gift provisions of the \nbill. Those are the provisions which come before the Senate today.\n  The majority leader himself said last October:\n\n       I support the gift ban provisions. No lobbyist lunches, no \n     entertainment, no travel, no contribution into defense funds, \n     no fruit baskets, no nothing. That is fine with this Senator. \n     I doubt many Senators partake in that in any event.\n\n  Other Senators made similar statements of their commitment for quick \nenactment of these gift rules. On October 6 of last year, 38 Republican \nSenators cosponsored a resolution, S. 247, to adopt tough new gift \nrules that were included in the conference report that was before this \nbody. The Senate Republican leadership at that time stated that \nRepublicans were prepared to enact these rules without delay.\n  Now, the bill before the Senate contains those same rule changes that \nthe vast majority of Members voted for less than a year ago, or about a \nyear ago, in May of 1994. I think all Members stated--perhaps a few \nexceptions--that we still supported them last October.\n  So now we are put to the test. Did we really mean what we said last \nMay and last October? If we are going to improve public confidence in \nthis institution, we are just simply going to have to change the way we \ndo business in this town.\n  Mr. President, the issue today is not whether we can go out to \ndinner. It is not whether we can even go out to dinner with lobbyists. \nThe question is: Who is paying for the dinner? Who is paying for the \ntickets? Who is paying for the ski trips?\n  Now, that is what the issue is and that is what the public sees. They \nsee stories like the one on the TV show ``Inside Edition,'' which ran \nas follows:\n\n       Imagine you and your family spending 3 days and nights at a \n     charming, world class ski resort, top-of-the-line lodging, \n     and cozy chalets with a wonderful mountain of skiing at your \n     doorstep and absolutely no worries about the cost of \n     anything. You will never waste a moment waiting in line for a \n     lift to the top, because, like the people you are about to \n     meet, you are the king of the hill, and this is the sweetest \n     deal on the slopes.\n\n  Now, that is what the public sees. That is what they read, and they \nhave had enough. The restrictions in the bill before the Senate are not \nsomething that we dreamed up. These restrictions, with some modest \nmodifications, are taken from the rules that are already applicable to \nexecutive branch officials. Cabinet Secretaries live with these rules. \nSo can we. If these rules are understandable to the executive branch \nand they follow them, so can we. It is time to put an end to the double \nstandard, where the executive branch officials are covered by strict \ngift rules--live with them and understand them--but legislative branch \nofficials are not covered by strict gift rules.\n  The image of this Congress has taken a battering as a result of those \nfree meals and those free tickets and those \n\n[[Page S 10585]]\nfree recreational trips. We do not need them. It is time to put an end \nto them. If we are going to increase public trust in this institution--\nand it is our sacred obligation to do so--we have to end business as \nusual when it comes to these kinds of gifts.\n  Mr. President, this issue has been thoroughly debated. It was debated \nat great length last year and in the years before. We came close last \nyear. These are difficult issues. Again, if they were not difficult, \nthey would have been resolved a long time ago.\n  Now is the time that we can resolve these issues. If we address these \nissues in the spirit in which we run for office, if we address these \nissues with the same thoughts in our mind and in our heart as we have \nwhen we address the people of the United States seeking to reach this \nplace, we will adopt tough gift rules, we will enhance public respect \nfor this institution, and we will carry out what I believe is an \nobligation to ourselves and to the Constitution that we are sworn to \nuphold.\n  When the public believes--public opinion polls show that the public \nbelieves--that lobbyists have the power in this town and that Congress \nand the President come second and third, when public confidence has \nreached that low, we must act. One of the things we must do is to adopt \nstrong gift reform. We must have a gift ban which affects all gifts \nexcept for certain, obviously excluded categories, which are set forth \nin this bill.\n  We have to end the free meals, the free tickets, the free \nrecreational trips. I believe it is our obligation. If we address this \nagain in the same spirit with which we came here and with which we \nsought to sit here, we can successfully address this in a way which I \nbelieve the American people will applaud and finally say that Congress \nis acting in the area of political reform the way the people want \nCongress to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10583-5", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NUCLEAR WASTE REPOSITORY AT \n                             YUCCA MOUNTAIN\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue of \ngreat national concern--this country's nuclear waste policy. In 1982, \nCongress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which directed the \nDepartment of Energy to develop a permanent repository for highly \nradioactive waste from nuclear power plants and defense facilities. \nCongress passed amendments to that act in 1987, which limited DOE's \nrepository development activities to a single site at Yucca Mountain, \nNV. Since 1983, electric consumers have contributed $11 billion to \nfinance the development of a permanent storage site. Despite DOE's \nobligation to take title to spent nuclear fuel in 1998, a permanent \nrepository at Yucca Mountain will not be ready to accept this waste \nuntil the year 2010, at the earliest.\n  Mr. President, the House of Representatives recently passed the \nenergy and water development appropriations bill for 1996. This bill \nrecommends that $425 million be made available for DOE's spent fuel \ndisposal program, $200 million below the level needed to continue \ndeveloping a permanent site. Furthermore, the committee report to this \nbill directs DOE to ``concentrate available resources on the \ndevelopment and implementation of a national interim storage program,'' \nand to ``downgrade, suspend or terminate its activities at Yucca \nMountain.''\n  Mr. President, I am greatly concerned by the action of the House. We \nhave already spent 12 years and $4.2 billion to find a permanent \nrepository site and conduct development activities at Yucca Mountain. \nNo other viable site for permanent storage has been considered since \n1987. If we terminate or suspend activities at Yucca Mountain now, we \nwill be wasting the time and money invested since 1982 toward finding a \nsuitable location. As I have already stated, the electric consumers of \nthis Nation have contributed $11 billion, and we are still behind \nschedule. How can we, in good conscience, discontinue our efforts at \nYucca Mountain when so much time and money has been invested there. To \ndo so would eradicate the progress we have made and abolish any hope of \ndeveloping a permanent site in the near future. It is our obligation to \nthe American people to develop a permanent repository as quickly as \npossible and, therefore, we must persist with the efforts at Yucca \nMountain. It is our only alternative.\n  Mr. President, I realize that continuing development of the permanent \nsite at Yucca Mountain will not completely solve the spent fuel \nproblem. In 1998, 23 nuclear reactors will run out of space to store \nspent fuel. At that time, storage will become DOE's responsibility. \nTherefore, we need to designate an interim storage site to use until \nthe permanent facility at Yucca Mountain is available. The most logical \nlocation for an interim site is Yucca Mountain. Transportation of spent \nnuclear fuel is a delicate undertaking, so it is sensible to locate an \ninterim facility as near to the permanent facility as is possible. \nLikewise, the proximity of an interim site to the permanent site would \nsave money on transportation costs between the two sites. Comprehensive \nlegislation has been introduced in both the Senate and House that \noffers a solution to the spent fuel problem, including the construction \nof an interim facility at Yucca Mountain.\n  Building a central interim storage facility at Yucca Mountain by 1998 \nand continuing to develop a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain by \n2010 is our most reasonable course of action. Too much time and money \nhas been invested to change directions now. As my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee consider funding for the project at Yucca \nMountain, I urge them to remember the commitment we have made to the \ncitizens of this Nation. Any efforts to abandon this program will \ndeprive this country of a long-term solution to our nuclear waste \nstorage dilemma.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10585-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10585-S10594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 CONGRESSIONAL GIFT REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President we are now, I take it, back on the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are now considering S. 1061.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  First of all, let me thank my colleagues for their real fine work on \nthis legislation. Senator Levin has done such fine work with Senator \nCohen on the lobbying reform, and Senator Feingold, and Senator \nLautenberg, Senator Baucus, Senator McCain, and others.\n  I was listening to my colleague from Michigan. Let me, at the \nbeginning, emphasize some of the points he made. This has been a really \nlong journey in the Senate. I say to the Chair, who is a friend, that \nactually back in Minnesota, when I talk to people in cafes, they do not \neven understand what the debate is about. To them, it is kind of not \neven a debatable proposition. Lobbyists and others do not come up to \ncitizens in Colorado and Minnesota and say, ``Look, we would like to \ntake you out to dinner. We would be willing to pay for a trip you might \ntake to Vail.'' Not to pick on Colorado; it could be Florida, or \nanywhere. ``And bring your spouse.'' And so on and so forth.\n  Most people do not have people coming up to them and making these \nkinds of offers. I think the citizens in our country just think it is \ninappropriate for us to be on the receiving end of these gifts. And \nthey are right. We should just let this go.\n  For me, this journey started in May 1993, over 2 years ago, with an \namendment I had on lobbying disclosure where lobbyists would have to \ndisclose the gifts they were giving to individual Senators. That \namendment was agreed to. Then we went on to this kind of broader debate \nabout the gift ban.\n  It has been a real struggle. I have never quite understood the \nresistance of all too many of my colleagues. Although, in the last \nanalysis, on each vote, I want to make it clear, we have had very \nstrong support. Actually, S. 1061--88 current Members of the Senate \nhave essentially already voted for precisely the comprehensive gift ban \nlegislation that we have before the Senate today. So I expect it will \nengender the \n\n[[Page S 10586]]\nsame strong support on the floor of the Senate as we go forward.\n  Mr. President, Senators Feingold and Lautenberg and I in the last \nCongress had to threaten to attach gift ban to another piece of \nlegislation to finally get a consent agreement to have it eventually \nbrought up; finally we had it on the floor. This has been a much \nscrutinized, much debated piece of legislation. Ultimately, as Senator \nLevin stated, at the very end we had lobbying reform and gift ban \nreform in the form of a conference report that came over here that was \nfilibustered at the end of the last Congress.\n  Then we started off this Congress. At the very beginning, again, I \nthink Senators Feingold, Lautenberg, and myself, we had an amendment on \nthe Congressional Accountability Act. It was our feeling this was very \nmuch about accountability. That was defeated. We wanted to include gift \nban reform. That was defeated on the Congressional Accountability Act. \nThe majority leader said we would take it up later; I think by the end \nof May. I came out with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, essentially \nrepeating what the majority leader had said, that we take it up by the \nend of May. That was defeated. I could never understand the ``no'' vote \non that.\n  Now, here we are at the end of July. This legislation has garnered \nthe support of a broad range of reform minded groups: United We Stand, \nCommon Cause, Public Citizens, and others. I think the reason for this \nis that people in the country really want to see some changes in the \nway we conduct our business here in the Nation's capital. People in the \ncountry, I have said this before on the floor of the Senate, want to \nbelieve in our political process. And people in the country are, I \nthink, far more serious about reform than some of us are.\n  As I observed several weeks ago on this floor, some of my majority \ncolleagues, frozen like deer in the headlights, have refused to move \nforward on the gift ban. There has just been unbelievable resistance to \na very simple proposition. And the only way in which we have been able \nto do it is through a tremendous amount of pressure.\n  I ask this question, and I am going to ask this question over and \nover again for as long as this debate takes. Why are too many of my \ncolleagues enthusiastic about slashing free or reduced-price lunches \nfor children but at the same time they wither when it comes to \neliminating free lunches for Members of the Congress?\n  Let me repeat that. Why are so many of my colleagues, or hopefully \njust a few of my colleagues, who are leading this effort at resistance, \nso willing to cut or slash free or reduced-price school lunches for \nchildren but they wither when it comes to eliminating the free lunches \nfor Members of Congress? I think this represents truly some distorted \npriorities.\n  Let me just read from some editorials in some of the newspapers about \nthis piece of legislation, what is called the McConnell-Dole \nalternative, to give you and colleagues and people in the country some \nsense about how this issue is being discussed in the country.\n  The New York Times wrote that the McConnell proposal would, \n``perpetuate much of the old system under the guise of reform.''\n  The Washington Post said that the McConnell proposal ``would be \nsubstantially more permissive about those charity trips and expensive \nfree meals. Without an aggregate limit, a lobbyist could theoretically \ntake a Senator out for $75 dinners, night after night, and not be \nsubject to any limits at all. You might as well not pretend to have a \ngift ban.''\n  I am, of course, referring to a substitute that is going to be laid \ndown which, in the guise of reform, really represents the opposite of \nreform.\n  The Kansas City Star wrote that ``the gravy train would stay on the \ntrack under a ploy of Senator Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican. \nMcConnell would limit a meal or gift to $100 but the long-time foe of \ngift bans conveniently neglects to restrict the numbers of gifts. That \nmeans spending would go on and on. Senator McConnell's legislation \nwould appear to be sound. They are not''--these are not my words--``his \nphony, bogus gift ban would have no appreciable impact on the current \ncorrupt system.''\n  Mr. President, there are just some titles: ``Good and Bad Lobbying.''\n  ``Capitol Still Sports `For Sale' Sign. Senators Showing True Colors. \nRepublican Gift Fraud.''\n  ``Stop the Freeloads.''\n  ``Beware of Mischief in Senate Ethics Bill.''\n  ``Airtight Ban Needed.''\n  ``Don't Weaken the Gift Ban.''\n  And, from the Pioneer Press, St. Paul Pioneer Press, in Minnesota, \n``Prove It's Not For Sale.''\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt that these kinds of gifts, and other \nfavors from lobbyists, have contributed to American's deepening \ndistrust of Government.\n  They give the appearance of special access influence and influence, \nand they erode public confidence in Congress as an institution and in \neach Member individually as a representative of his or her \nconstituents. That I think is the issue. This giving of gifts by \nlobbyists and special interests, this receiving of gifts by Senators, \nerodes public confidence in this institution and public confidence in \neach of us as representatives of the people back home in our States. We \nshould let go of it.\n  Mr. President, we have seen delay after delay after delay. Now, the \nquestion I ask my colleagues is whether or not they are going to \nessentially embrace some hollow reforms as substitutes for the real \nthing. Are we going to have colleagues talking about reform out of one \nside of their mouth while on the other side they oppose it? Will we \nhave colleagues who will support hollow reform as a substitute for the \nreal thing?\n  For example, do my colleagues again intend, as some did last year, to \ntry to gut the provisions on charitable vacation travel to golf and \ntennis hot spots like Vail, Aspen, Florida, or the Bahamas where \nMembers and their families are wined and dined at the expense of \nlobbyists and major contributors? Are we going to keep that provision \nand then say we passed reform? I hope not. But I expect that such an \nattempt will be made on the floor. We fought that fight last year and \nwe won. And I certainly hope that we will win again.\n  Mr. President, are we going to see a measure that purports to be \nreform which says--the Senator from Wisconsin and I have discussed \nthis--that actually we can take gifts up to $100 from anybody, \nlobbyists included, actually not even per day but per occasion with no \naggregate limit with no disclosure? So breakfast, lunch and dinner? We \ncould be receiving free lunches, free breakfasts, free dinners, tickets \nto--I do not call them the Redskins game--the Washington team game, or \nto the Orioles game or to concerts or trips? Anything that is under \n$100 we could receive in perpetuity from a lobbyist with no aggregate \nlimit and no disclosure requirement.\n  I say to my colleague. What, again, does that add up to, if you were \ndoing $100 a day?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I hope I am right. Mr. President, in answer to the \nSenator's question, I think it adds up to $36,500 per lobbyist per \nMember of Congress every year. And it could not even exclude the \nlobbyist. So the potential is truly unlimited. But I think the minimum \nfigure is $36,500 from one lobbyist and one Member of Congress.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes, $36,500 from one lobbyist a year. That is the \nconservative definition; it could be much more. There might even be \nefforts to cut that by half. Then it would only be $18,000 from one \nlobbyist per year, although, if you add in the number of occasions \nwhere that lobbyist can give us a gift during the day, it could be \ndouble that or triple that; no aggregate limit. And that is called gift \nreform?\n  Mr. President, the gift ban legislation has in a way taken on a life \nof its own. It has become a symbol of incumbents' stubborn resistance \nto changing the way lobbyists operate in Washington. I cannot believe \nit has taken over 2 years. I have been involved in this from almost the \nvery beginning. I think this resistance and these alternative proposals \nin the guise of reform, which do not pass any credibility test at all, \nwhich are going to infuriate people if Senators end up voting for this \nand claim that they have made significant changes--this is a symbol of \nincumbents' stubborn resistance to changing the way Washington \noperates. \n\n[[Page S 10587]]\n\n  Mr. President, is it going to be business as usual? Do opponents \nintend to try to change the gift ban to allow Members of Congress to \ncontinue to establish foundations or other similar entities to which \nlobbyists will be allowed to contribute in order to curry their favor? \nThat is in the McConnell alternative. So we have no limit on gifts, up \nto $100 in perpetuity, with no disclosure, $36,500 a year, but actually \nit can be much more for one lobbyist. And, in addition, charitable \ntravel is included. If you are for a charity and you believe in that \ncharity, then we should all go but we should pay our own way. It is \njust not appropriate to have a lobbyist or other special interest \npaying our way to wherever for ourselves and our spouse for golf or \ntennis, for a nice vacation trip over a long weekend. It is not \nappropriate. We should just let go of this.\n  Then there is a provision in this alternative, the McConnell-Dole \nalternative, that purports to be reform that says we can continue to \nestablish our own foundations, our own entities and then ask lobbyists \nto contribute to those foundations that we control to possibly curry \nour favor. That is hollow reform. That is not real reform. Or will we \ncontinue to allow lobbyists to contribute to legal defense funds with \nall of the accompanying conflict problems that this raises? That is not \nreform. That is hollow reform. That is in the McConnell-Dole \nalternative. Or will we allow Members of Congress to continue to direct \nlobbyists to make charitable contributions to their favorite charity, \nthe same lobbyists who are asking them for access for legislative \nfavors for themselves or clients? I hope not. That is in the McConnell-\nDole alternative. That is not reform. That is hollow reform.\n  Mr. President, I really do think that this piece of legislation puts \nall of us to the test. It puts all of us to the test. It puts all of us \nto the test in several fundamental ways. The No. 1 priority, by golly, \nif Senators are willing to vote to reduce free lunches for children in \nthis country, Senators ought to think about their priorities and, by \ngolly, we ought to end all free lunches for Senators. Actually, what we \nshould do is end the free lunches for Senators and Representatives and \ncertainly not end the free lunches for children who need that \nnutrition.\n  Second of all, it would be better not to pass any piece of \nlegislation than to pass a piece of legislation which purports to be \nreform with enough loopholes for the largest trucks in America to drive \nright through, many of which I have identified.\n  Third of all, since we have been at this for 2 years, I think gift \nban does have a life of its own. And this McConnell-Dole alternative \nrepresents the same resistance by Washington to the kind of change that \npeople in this country are really demanding. The Contract With America \nhad nothing about any of these reform measures.\n  Mr. President, it is time. We will pass today the lobbying reform, \nand this week we are going to pass a strong gift ban reform. Then \neventually we are going to move on to campaign finance reform. When we \ndo that, I think we will have passed some measures that we can be proud \nof and people in the country can be proud of. But, Mr. President, the \nalternative or substitute, the McConnell-Dole, which is going to be \nlaid down later on does not represent a step forward but it represents \na great leap backward. We need to move forward.\n  This piece of legislation that we have introduced today, S. 1061, \nrepresents a strong, tight, comprehensive gift ban reform. And that is \nwhat the Senate ought to pass. We owe people in this country, we owe it \nto the people we represent, to do no less.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin, and \nSenator McCain, who has been very engaged in this, Senator Lautenberg, \nand Senator Levin from the word go, and Senator Cohen. I also know that \nSenator Baucus has joined in this effort. I think we will have \nRepublicans and Democrats alike involved in this. But we will have a \nvery sharp debate, and we will identify what it means to move forward \nwith a reform effort that we can be proud of which is credible, which \nmeets the standards that I think people in the country want us to live \nup to as opposed to some alternative that has the word ``reform'' and \nthat is sort of made for politicians where you use the word ``reform'' \nand you claim you are moving forward while all at the same time you are \ncleverly designing a piece of legislation that essentially maintains \nand perpetuates the very practice the people in this country want us to \neliminate. That we cannot let happen--today, tomorrow, the next day or \nthis week. We have to pass tight, comprehensive, tough gift ban reform. \nThat is what people expect.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, and especially the \nSenator from Minnesota, in supporting a tough, meaningful and loophole-\nfree gift ban bill. That is what S. 1061 is all about. I urge the \nSenate to reject the empty reform proposal put forward by the junior \nSenator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell.\n  We have been at this issue for some time, Mr. President. You think \nyou have said it every way you can. And it is obvious that we ought to \ndeal with this and get rid of it. But the Senator from Minnesota just \ncame up with what I would have to say is just about the best \nformulation of what is going on here which I have heard.\n  Those are the very same people who feel comfortable going after \nschool lunches, who feel very comfortable going after many of the \nthings that are important for low-income people in this society, the \nsame people who will go to the wall to protect these lavish lunches and \ndinners that have become part of the Washington culture. I cannot think \nof a better formulation, and yes, I say to the Senator, I wish I would \nhave thought of it myself.\n  That says it all. That is what it appears, Mr. President, this 104th \nCongress is becoming all about--choices but very bad choices, blocking \nreal reform and saying that things like school lunches have to be \neliminated in the name of deficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, to review again, because the Senator from Minnesota \nand I need to keep pointing out to people that this is not something we \nthought up yesterday, this has been a long, hard struggle about \nsomething that should have been dealt with in about 5 minutes it is so \nclear; that Members of Congress should be paid their salary and that is \nall they should get. They should not get all kinds of freebies on the \nside.\n  I will tell you, back home it is a real simple concept. It has \nnothing to do with party. There is no Republican coming up to me in \nWisconsin and saying, ``Hey, Russ, you really got to preserve that gift \nthing. It is an important part of the way Washington works.''\n  Nobody has said that to me in Wisconsin in the last 2\\1/2\\ years. And \nit has been just over a year since the Senate, Mr. President, passed a \ntough gift ban bill by a margin of 95 to 4. What is wrong? Almost every \nMember of this body has already voted for the bill the Senator from \nMinnesota was just talking about. You would think that when a bill \npasses by such a large margin, it would not be all that difficult for \nthat bill to become a law.\n  After experiencing this for a couple of years, I am not naive enough \nto believe that proposed legislation which will have such a profound \neffect on the manner in which this institution operates with such a \nrestraining effect on the special interests would sail through Congress \nwith little or no trouble.\n  What I find particularly regrettable is that when this process began \nI did not think the practice was as widespread as I do think now. The \nresistance makes me wonder, makes me think that it is just not a \nquestion of perception but there may be more reality to it; otherwise, \nwhy would people fight so hard to prevent what was already a 95-to-4 \nvote to be redone in the 104th Congress. It makes me wonder. It makes \nme wonder just how much of this is really going on. And there is no way \nfor me to quantify it, but it certainly makes me wonder.\n  The fact is this body has gone on record repeatedly over the past \nyear in favor of gift reforms proposed by myself, the Senator from \nMinnesota, and the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg].\n  Last May, this body soundly rejected a gift proposal--I will not call \nit a gift ban because it was not--a gift proposal \n\n[[Page S 10588]]\nsimilar to the one currently offered by the junior Senator from \nKentucky. So everybody, Mr. President, must be wondering why are we \nhaving this debate now. In May of last year, as I said, we had a 95-to-\n4 vote in the Senate on this legislation. In the fall, 36 Republican \nSenators, led by the Senator who is now the distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Dole, cosponsored, actually cosponsored, Mr. President, \na resolution containing the exact gift provisions put forth in the \nWellstone-Feingold-Lautenberg proposal. Mr. President, the exact same \nprovisions, not the McConnell proposal but the exact same provisions of \nthe Wellstone proposal, were cosponsored by 36 Republican Senators, yet \nfor some reason there are some Members of this body who feel we need to \nrepeat the debate we had last spring when an alternative gift proposal \nwas put forth that is remarkably similar to the proposal before us \ntoday.\n  The proposal last year, the so-called McConnell-Johnston proposal, \nwas soundly defeated. The McConnell-Johnston proposal was defeated 59 \nto 39, and yet here we are today having the same debate all over again.\n  One of the clear messages that came out of last year's election to \nme, Mr. President, is that the public is tired of the way business is \ndone in Washington. And everybody says that, but I think that is true. \nThey have to define exactly what aspects of what goes on in Washington \npeople do not like, but it is not terribly difficult to figure it out, \nyet real reform, like campaign finance reform or gift ban legislation, \nseems to constantly be put on the back burner.\n  I am absolutely confident that campaign finance reform and gift ban \nare among the things almost every American would describe as what is \nneeded for reform. So if November 8 was about reform, and I think it \nwas, these should be on the front burner, not constantly being blocked \nprocedurally.\n  Some say that the very first bill we passed this Congress in the \nSenate, a bill which forced Congress to live under the laws it passes, \nwas an important reform bill, and I agree with the premise of that \nbill, and I voted for it. We should have to abide by the rules we make \nfor everybody else, but in no way should we pretend that the American \npeople have somehow had their faith restored in this institution \nbecause of that one rather minor, although worthwhile, piece of \nlegislation.\n  Other people say we have reformed Congress by pointing to the \nreduction and elimination of many of the public perks available to \nMembers of Congress. And they say we have cleaned up Washington; we do \nnot need the gift ban. Fortunately, there has been progress in that \narea--no more free haircuts or free stationery or no more free \ngymnasium. People come up to me and say, ``When are you going to get \nrid of that free gym and the free haircuts?'' And I say, ``Well, it has \nbeen done.'' It should have been done a long time ago. But what they \nknow and what really disappoints people, they constantly are \ndisappointed to find that lobbyists can still send Members of Congress \non free vacation trips to the Bahamas.\n  Last year, I had the chance to say that I think free gifts really is \nthe mother of all perks. It is the big one. Those free trips to the \nBahamas are an awful lot more in value than the free haircuts which we \nhave eliminated. The lobbyists can still treat Members to expensive \nmeals at some of Washington's finest restaurants, and the lobbyists can \nstill send the flatbed carts loaded with gifts and goodies all around \nCapitol Hill, and they are continuing to do it.\n  So what I have noticed--it is an interesting distinction--is that \nthere seems to be a great deal of interest in going after public perks. \nMembers of both parties are willing to go after public perks, things \nlike the haircuts and the free stationery, the congressional pensions, \nhealth care--these are things that certainly can be described as perks, \nand that are provided by public dollars, taxpayers' dollars. But the \nsame people who are in the front row to attack these public perks have \nwhat I can only describe as a steadfast apprehension to deal with the \nprivate perks, the hidden private interest, special interest perks that \ncome from the lobbyists and the special interest community. Those we do \nnot touch. Those are not even mentioned in the Republican Contract With \nAmerica, as the distinguished Senator from Minnesota has pointed out.\n  In other words, the perks that are essentially provided by the \nGovernment and the American people are bad, but the attitude is that \nthe perks provided by the special interests are somehow benign, not a \nproblem, just the way things are done in Washington. That is the \nmessage coming from Congress if we do not deal with the gift ban and if \nwe do not deal with the really big issue, as the Senator from Minnesota \nhas pointed out, which would be next, and that is campaign financing.\n  It is distressing to open up the newspaper or turn on the TV and see \nrepeated stories of the cozy relationship between the lobbyists and the \nlegislators. The level of special access that the lobbyists are \nreceiving continues to undermine the confidence of the American people \nin their Government. It really does further the belief of the average \nworking American that that person has little or no voice in Washington, \nDC.\n  Let me mention, for example, just one item that appeared in a \nnational journal publication. It appeared on May 5, 1995. This column \nbriefly describes a retreat hosted by the American Bankers Association \nfor congressional staffers and their spouses at a West Virginia resort. \nThis retreat occurred on the weekend before the House Banking Committee \nwas to vote on legislation backed by the American Bankers Association. \nThe article notes that during the weekend retreat there would be \nmorning discussions about bank modernization issues but the afternoons \nwould be open for the staffers to ``indulge in golf, horseback riding, \nswimming, and other recreational activities that the posh Homestead \noffered.''\n  Now, when our constituents vote for us, and vote for us knowing what \nthe salary is, they do not know about these fringe benefits that are \nprovided. And here, Mr. President, just a few days before a \ncongressional committee is to vote on a particular bill, the staff \nmembers from that committee are invited to an all-expense paid resort \nweekend by the lobbying association backing that particular bill. This \nis a disturbing practice. It sends a clear and strong message to the \nAmerican people that this institution is at least perceived to be under \nthe control of those who have the money and access to influence the \npolitical process. So to me it is clear that we have a very serious \nproblem here. The issue before us today then is how we can best solve \nthat problem and address the very cynical and skeptical feelings the \nAmerican people sometimes hold for this institution.\n  I think we are all familiar with the gift ban approach embodied in S. \n101. The sponsors of that legislation, including myself and the Senator \nfrom Minnesota and the Senator from Michigan, believe in a gift ban--a \ngift ban. No gifts from lobbyists period. No more free meals from \nlobbyists at fancy restaurants, no more free vacations paid for by \nlobbyists at sun spots around the world. This is not a gift ban we are \ntrying to put in place. The McConnell proposal is a lesson in how best \nto dodge this issue. It ducks; it weaves; it does everything but ban \ngifts. In fact, Mr. President, what I think it does, if we have the \nwrong vote out here today or tomorrow, is enshrine gift giving in \nWashington and forever say that it is perfectly acceptable for Members \nof Congress to accept an unlimited number of gifts from lobbyists.\n  Let me repeat that. Under the McConnell proposal, lobbyists could \ngive legislators as many gifts as they can possibly afford. How can \nanyone come out on the Senate floor and suggest that allowing an \nunlimited number of gifts--and it is unlimited--can be accurately \nportrayed as a gift ban or can accurately be portrayed as reform?\n  It is the polar opposite of reform. It is a total giving in to the \ncurrent system.\n  Last year, Mr. President, when our gift ban and lobbying reform \nlegislation was defeated only by a filibuster from the other side, we \nactually could hear the lobbyists gathered outside the Senate Chamber \ncheering in victory. But that is nothing, because if the McConnell \nproposal goes through, I think we are going to hear the sound of \nchampagne corks popping outside this \n\n[[Page S 10589]]\nChamber, because it will be a permanent enshrining of the gift-giving \npractice. That is, because under the McConnell proposal, the following \ncould still happen.\n  Just one example, the Senator from Minnesota was pointing out the \ntotal dollar value of what one lobbyist can do in 1 year for a Member \nof the Senate. We came up with the $36,500 figure. Let me give an \nexample of how a lobbyist's week might go if he or she wanted to show a \nlegislator a good time before a key vote.\n  They could take a Senator out for Chateaubriand and good wine on \nMonday. They could take him or her down to the Orioles game on Tuesday \nwith box seats. Then on Wednesday a good concert, maybe over at the \nKennedy Center. Then Thursday, a nice bottle of cognac could arrive at \nthe Senator's office from the same lobbyist. And then to top it off, on \nthe weekend, just before the vote the following Tuesday, a little trip \nto the Virgin Islands for the whole family, and that is all legal under \nthe McConnell reform proposal, totally legal.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield? After listening to him lay out \nthis week, is the Senator sure he wants to stay with his position? It \nsounds pretty good.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I do want to stay with my position. I am used to it. I \nthink that is the whole point. The public perks that have been \neliminated, things like haircuts and the free gym, those things sound \npretty good. But when you lay out what we are talking about--which is \nnot just theoretical, this does happen, as I gave the example of the \nAmerican Bankers Association--it sounds real good. When you are talking \nabout people who already receive $133,000 in salary a year, which a lot \nof Americans think is pretty high----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Then you are really talking about an exceptional \npractice. I yield to the Senator from Michigan for a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Actually, the McConnell substitute is even weaker, believe \nit or not, than my friend from Wisconsin says, because it is not $100 \nper day, it is $100 a gift.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The Senator is correct. What the Senator from Minnesota \nand I have been doing, because we are so staggered as to how much can \nbe done in a day, we are giving the minimum interpretation. I think the \nSenator is right, it is not a minimum interpretation; it could be \nseveral instances in a day. I have to sort of do the higher math. I \nguess what we are talking about, if you can do it for breakfast, lunch, \nand dinner, I guess what we are talking about is $100,000 a year.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I guess there is probably no way to give the total \ncalculation, because it is $100 per gift. Presumably you could have \nlunch, dinner, and tickets. If you really want to calculate it, one \nwould have to figure out how many gifts of $99 might be realistically \npossible in a day.\n  It is even a weaker approach, if that is possible, than the one that \nhas been described, because that $100 gift, which does not count, does \nnot even count toward the maximum, is a limit per gift which does not \ncount and not a daily amount. I know the Senator knows that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I do, and I appreciate the Senator from Michigan making \nthe point. What he is telling us is the ability to give meals and wine \nin one given day probably outstrips the ability to consume of any \nMember of Congress. They could not possibly consume in one day the \npotential amount that is allowed under the so-called McConnell \namendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if the Senator from Wisconsin will yield for \na question.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield to the Senator from Minnesota and then the \nSenator from Alaska for questions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Just to be clear, I know the Senator wants to go on \nwith other features. Just so we can clarify this point, going to what \nthe Senator from Michigan asked the Senator from Wisconsin, the \nproblem, as I understand it, is that--we are just talking about one \nprovision in the McConnell-Dole substitute --is that Senators can \nreceive from lobbyists up to $100, not per day, but per gift. There is \nno aggregate limit. So this is in perpetuity; correct?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. So the minimum from one lobbyist per year could be \n35----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. $36,500.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes, $36,500; but that is a conservative estimate. \nPlaying this out----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If I may interrupt the Senator from Minnesota, I think \nit is clear the Senator from Michigan is right, that is not even a \nconservative estimate. It is just a way to try to explain it, because \nit clearly allows, based on the reading of the way it is drafted right \nnow, more than one time a day.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. One other question I have is, there is no disclosure \nand there is not even any disclosure requirement, is my understanding.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I ask the Senator from Michigan, is that \ncorrect? The other question I had was, above and beyond it is not per \nday but per gift, my understanding is there is not any disclosure \nrequirement either.\n  Mr. LEVIN. For gifts under $100, that is my understanding.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. There is no aggregate limit, and there is no \ndisclosure requirement?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct, as far as I know.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Michigan. I just want to \npoint that out in terms of what we might call hollow reform versus real \nreform.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I said I would yield to the Senator from \nAlaska for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Kyl]. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I intend to speak at the appropriate \ntime when my friend from Wisconsin has completed his statement, with \nthe Chair's permission. But I would like to ask a question. I have been \nsitting here for the last 15 minutes or so, and I heard time and time \nagain about this free haircut business.\n  The Senator from Alaska has been in this body for 15 years. I am not \naware of what the procedure was prior to 15 years ago. I would \nappreciate it if the Senator from Wisconsin could enlighten me on just \nwhere those free haircuts allegedly have occurred over the last 15 \nyears, because this Senator is certainly not knowledgeable. I go down \nand pay $17 for a haircut about every 2\\1/2\\ to 3 weeks. Could my \nfriend from Wisconsin identify where these free haircuts occur and are \navailable to Members of this body? I would get trimmed all the time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I have no idea. I raised the issue of free haircuts \nbecause people always told me there were free haircuts. Mr. President, \nis the Senator asking me a question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are trying to document accurately \nthe circumstances, and I heard about these free haircuts all morning, \nbut I know of none and my friend from Wisconsin evidently knows of \nnone. So I encourage my colleagues to take a free haircut with a grain \nof salt because we can get trimmed on the edges, but if we do not \nportray accurately what this gift ban is all about, why, then I think \nwe are misleading ourselves, as well as being misled on the issue \nitself. If we are going to talk about free haircuts----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I have the floor, and I am prepared to respond. You are \nbeing misled now by the Senator from Alaska, because I came out here \nand pointed out there were a number of public perks I was told existed. \nI do not know if they exist. I am not out here talking about the \nhaircuts as something I am working on today. I thought that was taken \ncare of. I got here 2\\1/2\\ years ago. I never found out where the \nSenate barber is. I could not get there if I had to. I have my own \nplace where I go and pay just as the Senator from Alaska does.\n  I am not out here yelling and screaming about the public perks. If \nthere are free haircuts, they should be eliminated. If there are not \nfree haircuts, fine. That is not what I have been talking about. \n\n[[Page S 10590]]\n\n  In fact, I made the point that the public and others in this \ninstitution are talking about the public perks and some of them, as the \nSenator from Alaska points out, do not even exist. People say to me, \n``Did you know you have that free gym over there in the Senate?'' I \nsay, ``Well, by the time I got to the Senate, they already had a charge \nfor that.'' I do not know if it is $35 or $40. I do not happen to be \ninvolved.\n  But I think the Senator actually is right, that we have to be \naccurate. I have not asserted that any of these things actually exist \non the public side. If they do, they should be eliminated. But I have \nmade it my practice here to identify the private perks which I do \nbelieve go on. I have pointed out several examples, such as the Bankers \nAssociation trip before the vote. We can document those. In fact, we \ncan document the fact that in our office--and I can document this item \nfor item--we have received 1,072 gifts in our office in the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears.\n  So, if there are free haircuts here, they should be eliminated; if \nthere is not, fine. That is not the issue today. I have not asserted I \ncan prove that there are free haircuts. This is a red herring. The \nissue here is what about the private perks. If there are more public \nperks out there, let us go after them.\n  The Senator from Alaska is right, it is our responsibility to first \ndocument that such a thing exists, and I will be happy to join with him \nto identify items of that kind.\n  Mr. President, under the McConnell proposal, charitable travel would \nhave to be approved by the Senate Ethics Committee. It would not be \njust a completely free system as it is now.\n  Under our proposal, recreational travel is simply prohibited, but \nunder the McConnell proposal, such travel is permitted if a Senator \ncould get a stamp of approval from the Ethics Committee.\n  The Ethics Committee is an in-house committee made up of whom? Made \nup of Senators who themselves may want to partake in the same trip or a \ntrip like it.\n  Now, without suggesting that members of the Ethics Committee would \nnot exercise restraint in granting such approval, we should ask \nourselves how this will look to the American public.\n  Under the McConnell proposal, we are giving ourselves, through the \nEthics Committee, the ability to decide whether a certain trip is okay \nor not.\n  Mr. President, if this is not thumbing your nose at the American \npeople, I do not know what is. To all those Americans that have lost \nfaith in their Government and have developed a fundamental distrust of \ntheir political system, we are supposed to tell them that the key to \nbanning these sorts of junkets is to have the Senators who go on the \ntrips tell other Senators whether this one is a good one or a bad one.\n  I do not want to have to try and explain that one back home. I do not \nthink that will go over, Mr. President. We have heard a lot of \ninteresting arguments against our gift ban proposal last year. We heard \nthat the Ethics Committee was going to have to triple its staff--triple \nits staff--they said, to deal with this problem, and that the whole \nsystem would fall prey to bureaucratic gridlock.\n  We heard an unbelievable argument. We should not pass the gift ban \nbecause it would be bad for business for all the Washington restaurants \nand theaters. I saw the restaurant owners up in the gallery looking \npretty worried. We heard an argument that our legislation was going to \nmake crooks out of a lot of honest people.\n  Mr. President, I have said it several times before but will have to \nsay it again and again. This is not complicated. I served in the \nWisconsin State legislature for 10 years. That legislature has operated \nunder strict rules on the issue of gifts for over 20 years now. It is \nan even tougher rule in Wisconsin than contained in S. 101. The \nWisconsin Legislature is simply prohibited from accepting anything of \nvalue from a lobbyist or an organization that employs a lobbyist. You \ncannot even get a cup of coffee from a lobbyist.\n  Mr. President, we are very proud that the Wisconsin legislators, is \nknown as one of the most ethical in the country. Contrary to some of \nthe notions put forth by opponents of the gift ban last year, we do not \nhave Wisconsin legislators starving to death. No restaurants in our \ncapital city have closed because of our gift ban. Our State ethics \nboard has not had to hire an army of bureaucrats to interpret the gift \nrules.\n  Mr. President, it works just fine under Republican leadership, under \nDemocrat leadership, Republican Governors, Democrat Governors, it does \nnot matter; it has worked just fine. It is a simple rule that is easy \nto understand and operate under. There is not a single valid argument \nfor not applying a similar gift prohibition to Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan editorial from today's Wisconsin State Journal entitled ``Ban Gifts \nand Boost Credibility.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Ban Gifts and Boost Credibility\n\n       Would a member of the U.S. Senate trade his or her vote for \n     a fruit basket? Of course not. How about a bottle of cognac \n     and dinner in a fancy Washington restaurant? The answer is \n     still no.\n       But what if the shower of gifts includes free ski trips, \n     golf outings and other vacation packages from special-\n     interest groups--as well as other perks and meals that fall \n     under a $100 per-gift limit? Again, few members of the Senate \n     would be tempted to swap their integrity for freebies--after \n     all, many of them are millionaires who don't need the help.\n       But at what point does the public perception of gift-giving \n     practices on Capitol Hill begin to erode the credibility of \n     Congress? That is the question being pushed by U.S. Sen. Russ \n     Feingold, the Wisconsin Democrat who is leading the fight to \n     dramatically restrict the kinds of gifts members of the \n     Senate can legally accept.\n       Feingold isn't accusing his fellow senators of being on the \n     take. He knows better. He's simply pointing out that so long \n     as the American public believes Washington is a den of \n     special-interest perks, the credibility of Congress will \n     suffer.\n       Feingold is a product of the Wisconsin Legislature, where a \n     ban on legislators accepting anything of value from lobbyists \n     has served that institution well. Wisconsin has not been \n     immune from lobbyist scandals--but those instances have been \n     few in number and relatively minor compared to what happens \n     in some states. People can and will disagree with the \n     Legislature's actions but at least they need not worry that \n     the fate of public policy in Madison hangs on who bought what \n     senator the most expensive dinner at the Blue Marlin.\n       Since he took federal office in 1993, Feingold has been \n     offered 1,072 gifts. With very few exceptions, he's returned \n     them or donated them to charity.\n       Maybe he gets all these gifts because he's a nice guy. More \n     likely, he gets them because various interest groups want to \n     catch his eye or get his ear. What's amazing is that after \n     2\\1/2\\ years in office, the gifts keep coming, even though \n     Feingold has made clear his policy from the beginning.\n       Some senators believe Feingold's push to embrace the \n     Wisconsin model is overkill born of beachfront news footage \n     of cavorting congressmen, or an attempt to score political \n     points by beating up on the institution. U.S. Sen. Mitch \n     O'Connell, R-Ky., says the Feingold bill is ``lined with \n     legalistic punji sticks'' and would ``make a lot of honest, \n     highly ethical people into crooks.''\n       There's nothing all that complicated about a ban on \n     accepting gifts, free meals and trips from lobbyists. This is \n     not a case of O'Connell and friends being unable to \n     understand the language in S.101, Feingold's bill. It's a \n     case of them not wanting to adopt it.\n       Congress has brought much of today's public cynicism upon \n     itself. Passage of the Feingold bill would be a welcome step \n     toward undoing that damage and bolstering faith in the \n     Senate.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will read one portion:\n\n       There's nothing all that complicated about a ban on \n     accepting gifts, free meals and trips from lobbyists. This is \n     not a case of McConnell and friends being unable to \n     understand the language in S. 101, Feingold's bill. It's a \n     case of them not wanting to adopt it.\n\n  Mr. President, I have said before, for most constituents back home, \nthe Washington beltway has become more than a simple road, a boundary \nof sorts, that seems to separate Washington and the special interest \ncommunity from the rest of America. The perception is that the beltway \nrepresents a safe haven for lobbyists and legislators where most of \ntheir interaction goes unreported and unbeknownst to the voters back \nhome. The lobbying needs to be disclosed and the gift giving needs to \nbe discontinued.\n  I am afraid the McConnell proposal, if enacted in its current form, \nis nothing more than a sham. It is counterfeit reform. It allows \nunlimited gifts from lobbyists. It allows recreational travel. It \nchanges virtually nothing from the status quo. It sends a very clear \nmessage to the American people that the \n\n[[Page S 10591]]\nU.S. Senate is as chained to the special interests as ever.\n  The Washington lobbyists, Mr. President, are on a roll. Here we are, \n7 months into the new Congress, and this body has not passed or even \nconsidered a single piece of legislation to address the influence of \nspecial interests here in Washington.\n  Mr. President, the lobbyists asked for telecommunications reform and \nthey get it. They ask for regulatory reform, and they may very well get \nit. They ask for tax breaks, and it looks like they will get them.\n  When the American people ask for campaign finance reform, the \nCongress ducks. When the American people ask for lobbying reform, the \nCongress dodges. When the American people ask for a tough gift ban, the \nCongress plays tricks and tries to offer a paper tiger.\n  Acting on a tough gift ban will fundamentally reform the way Congress \ndeals with thousands of benefits and other perks offered to Members \neach year. It would, Mr. President, be more than a cosmetic change. I \nbelieve now, even though I may have thought it was more minor when I \ngot here, I believe this marks a major change in the way Washington, \nDC, does business.\n  I thank my colleagues from Minnesota and New Jersey for their \npersistence on the issue, and also the Senator from Michigan, Senator \nLevin, for his overall dedication to reform issues and his leadership \nin crafting the provisions of S. 101. I urge my colleagues to take a \nvery hard look at this. This is an opportunity to put this issue behind \nMembers so we do not have to keep coming out here and talking about it. \nIt is unpleasant, and it really does not befit the dignity of this \nbody.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I do not think there is any question \nthat we need reform, and campaign finance gift ban, et cetera, are \nappropriate for this body to resolve, but I suggest that there are a \nfew statements that do need some enlightenment.\n  I will refer briefly to a reference made by the Senator from \nWisconsin with regard to the perception that Members get free hair \ncuts. Mr. President, as I stated, when I asked my friend from Wisconsin \nif he had any knowledge just where a person gets a free hair cut--I \nhave been in this body 15 years, I have read it, that somehow Members \nare perceived to get free hair cuts--I know of no free hair cuts in \nexistence during the 15 years I have been here.\n  I think this is part of the perception that is out there, that \nMembers do get free hair cuts. We get clipped, we get shaved, but we do \nnot get free hair cuts, Mr. President. It is a misnomer.\n  I think there are other extended examples where it is assumed that \nbecause there is a gym, that we get free services. We corrected that \nsome time ago. Those Members that want to pay and receive the services \nof the gym pay an amount each year equivalent to the cost of those \nservices. That is appropriate.\n  To suggest that somehow this is something that is extreme, that is \nnot accepted in the private sector--if you are with a corporation, \noftentimes you have the use of a gym or work-out facility, and anyone \nthat looked at the facility here would come to the conclusion that it \nis pretty antiquated, I think about early 1910 or 1915, thereabouts.\n  But in any event, I want to put that issue aside, because the reality \nthat somehow this is a gravy train, that there are benefits associated \nwith this, are not applicable in the private sector, I think, bears \nfurther examination.\n  As we look at the merits of this legislation before the Senate, the \nLevin-Wellstone legislation, private entities would not be able to \nreimburse Members for the cost of transportation and lodging, for \nparticipation in charitable events.\n  If we think about this, Mr. President, there is an inconsistency \nhere. Why is there not a ban on reimbursement for political events? \nWhat is a political event? A political event is something, perhaps, \nthat occurs in Los Angeles, perhaps it occurs in the Bahamas, perhaps \nit occurs in Florida, and a Member can go down and participate and \nreceive reimbursement for travel, reimbursement for transportation.\n  Now, under the bill before the Congress, the Levin-Wellstone \nlegislation, Members would still be permitted to be privately \nreimbursed if they travel to a fundraising event for another Member, in \nother words, a political fundraiser.\n  Now, under the Senate Ethics Committee rules, the interpreted rule \nNo. 193, it is my understanding that a Senator may accept travel \nexpenses from an official of a district's political party organization \nin return for his or her appearance at a rally sponsored by that \norganization.\n  In other words, Mr. President, we are mandating that we will still \nallow reimbursement, private reimbursement, for political events. We \ncan get our travel paid, we can get our hotel room paid.\n  Mr. President, every Member of this body, because we are all in the \nbusiness of politics, has at one time or another made a campaign \nappearance for his party, or a candidate of his party, and often that \nmeans flying to another Member's home State, attending a party \nfunction, maybe making a speech, sharing a meal, maybe attending an \nentertainment or sports function. The entire cost is covered by \nlobbyists and other political contributors.\n  As we look at the merits of this legislation, we should recognize the \ninconsistency associated with the hypocritical posture that we are \nputting ourselves in. We are saying, in the gift ban/campaign finance \nreform, we are eliminating the reimbursement for participation in \ncharities, and we are still allowing full reimbursement for political \nevents for travel, and for lodging. Who pays for it? Political \ncontributors--lobbyists. Why does this proposed campaign finance \nreform, gift ban and so forth not address political events?\n  Mr. President, we know why. Several Members do not want to talk about \nthat. They are hoping that nobody will bring up the inconsistency and \nthe hypocrisy associated with this bill in the manner it is currently \nstructured. I fail to understand why the sponsors of the legislation \nwould not simply go through and say, ``Let's clean the whole slate. \nLet's prohibit the other part of this, the unmentionable, the political \nevents.'' It is rather curious, Mr. President, for convenience and \nother reasons, this has been left out.\n  We have a situation, again, where a Senator can travel all over the \ncountry, attending political fundraisers, have lodging, and \ntransportation reimbursement, but a Senator cannot attend a charity \nevent, and get reimbursed.\n A Senator cannot attend events that raise money for worthwhile causes \nand have the costs of travel and lodging reimbursed. Is that not an \ninconsistency? Does this really make sense?\n\n  Why is it all right for a political action committee to host a $500-\na-plate political fundraiser or give a campaign check for $2,000 or \n$3,000 to an elected official but there can be no solicitation of \ncorporations or other individuals to participate in a charitable event \nthat only benefits a small community or State? I believe this whole \nnotion of preventing Senators and corporations from sharing and raising \nmoney for a worthwhile cause outside the beltway, but allowing $5,000 \nto $10,000 gifts, smacks of sheer hypocrisy.\n  This Senator is prepared to pursue legislation that would address \ncorrective measures to include in this broad campaign finance gift ban \nprohibition on reimbursement for political events for travel and \nlodging. Why is it that, in the structure of the proposed legislation, \nwe have eliminated reimbursement for charitable travel? We have had \nspirited debate about the role and influence that lobbyists and \ncorporations play in shaping the public's perception of the political \nprocess in Washington. We have heard a little bit about that public \nperception. We have heard mentioned, time and time again, the free \nhaircuts. There are not any free haircuts. I have been here 15 years \nand I defy a Member to suggest where you could get a free haircut in \nthe last 15 years.\n  To get back to my point, much has been made of the fact that \ncorporations have sponsored Senators' travel and lodging in connection \nwith events designed to raise money for charity. But nobody is saying \nanything about the contributions from lobbyists and political \ncontributors that will allow each of us to go off and attend a \npolitical fundraiser in the Bahamas or the Virgin Islands or Florida or \nHawaii and get reimbursement for travel and lodging. Why do we not fix \nit all? \n\n[[Page S 10592]]\n\n  Clearly, it is too sensitive. Politics is our business and we want to \nexclude, in the perception of things, those that we feel have some \nexposure, but not those that we feel are necessary--yet provide the \nsame base of support, political contributors and lobbyists.\n  When Senator McConnell submitted the Senate gift rule reform \nresolution, Senate Resolution 126, it provided that Senators would be \npermitted to be privately reimbursed for lodging and transportation in \nconnection with charitable fundraising events only if the Senate Select \nCommittee on Ethics determined, ``that participating in the charity \nevent is in the interests of the Senate and the United States.''\n  So, a Member of the Senate could be privately reimbursed for \nattending a charitable fundraiser only if the Ethics Committee makes a \ndetermination that the charitable function is in both the public \ninterest as well as the interests of the Senate. I believe one of our \nresponsibilities, as public officials, is to promote worthwhile charity \ncauses. Most of us are inclined to associate ourselves with those, from \ntime to time. Not everything that can be done for the public good \nderives from Government. We all know that. Private charities play a \nvital role in servicing many of the needs of our citizens.\n  Last year, in my State of Alaska, we had a situation that occurred \nwhere the mammogram machine in Fairbanks, AK, which had been in \noperation for several years, was growing older and it was difficult to \nget certified. This was a service that had been provided for many \nwomen. My wife is associated with it. It was started in the mid-1970's. \nThey offered free mammograms for women in the Fairbanks area and \nsurrounding smaller communities.\n  It became necessary to look at just how that group was going to \ncontinue to maintain that free service. We started a fundraiser to \npurchase a new mammogram machine for the Fairbanks Breast Cancer \nDetection Center in Fairbanks, AK. The idea was to hold a fishing \nevent, a fishing tournament at a place called Waterfall, in \nsoutheastern Alaska. We held that event and raised $150,000, and were \nable to buy a new mammogram machine for the Fairbanks breast cancer \nclinic.\n  It was cleared by the Ethics Committee, corporations contributed, \ntheir members came, they fished, and the breast cancer clinic got a new \nmammogram machine. As a consequence, the center was able to continue to \nprovide free breast cancer examinations and mammograms for some 3,700 \nwomen who came to the Fairbanks breast cancer clinic for screening. \nThey came from 81 villages in my State of Alaska.\n  This August, my wife, Nancy, and I are going to be hosting a second \nevent for the center to raise money for a second mammography unit. This \nis going to be a mobile mammography unit. It will fit into a van. It \ncan traverse the limited highways in Alaska. But more important, it \nwill be able to go into the National Guard C-130 aircraft, which will \ngo out on their training missions and fly into the various villages \nwhere there are no roads, and offer this free service to many of the \nNative women in the bush area of Alaska.\n  This is an example of a function that would be banned under the \ncurrent bill. We think we can raise, this year, another $150,000 to \n$175,000. This will allow us to buy a mobile unit. It alleviates a \nsituation where many women will be covered who otherwise are unable to \ntravel into Fairbanks and other areas for tests. They will be able to \nreceive this free screening in their local communities. Otherwise, they \nwould not be able to avail themselves to this technology. So, this kind \nof a contribution, this kind of charitable event, would be eliminated \nand, as a consequence, the opportunity to provide vital health services \nto many of Alaska's rural women would be lost.\n  The State's cancer mortality rate, I might add, is the third highest \nin the Nation. One in eight Alaska women, I am told, will develop some \ntype of breast cancer. And breast cancer screening can reduce these \namounts, I am told, by better than 30 percent.\n  I believe, without the money raised from these two fundraisers, the \nhealth of Alaska's women would be reduced to some extent. I am proud of \nthe work my wife and other women, as well as members of the community, \nhave done in providing volunteer efforts to operate these units. But \nthe point is, if we change the rules on charitable events, why, these \ntypes of charities will have to find a new home. And if the rules had \nbeen changed prior to this, I am convinced that neither of these units \nwould have become a reality.\n  I know of several Members who participate in charity events. Senator \nPryor has been running a golf tournament for some time in Texarkana to \nraise funds for children with development disabilities. Senator Jay \nRockefeller has been a supporter of funds for children's health care \nprojects and nonprofit organizations, that I understand operates mobile \nvans in New York City and rural West Virginia and other locations.\n  Most of you know my colleague, former Senator Jake Garn of Utah, \nraised a great deal of money for the primary children's medical center \nin Salt Lake City. Many of us have been at those occasions to assist in \nthe raising of those funds for those worthwhile causes. So, do we want \nto end our participation and the participation of corporations in these \ncauses simply because there is a so-called perception problem?\n  One of the other things that is even more important than perceptions \nis proximity, because if we eliminate the ability to participate in \ncharitable events, from the standpoint of travel and reimbursement for \nlodging, it does not exclude charitable events in the beltway area. So, \nfor those of us who live great distances, we have a problem. But for \nthose who are close to Washington, DC, they can hold a charitable event \nright here in Washington where there is no need for reimbursement for \ntravel--transportation. So my point, I think, is one of equity. It \nwould basically eliminate charitable events in my State, in California, \nOregon, Washington, the West--where, indeed, for a Member to come out, \nthere is a transportation expense of some significance as well as \nlodging. But if you have it here, where you do not have a problem for \nreimbursement for transportation or for lodging, why, you can have it. \nThat discriminates against those of us out West.\n  If you eliminate the reimbursement for transportation and lodging \nthen you are in a situation where the only alternative is to hold the \nevent in Washington, DC, and perhaps if you are a large national \ncharitable organization that has the clout to hold such an event in \nWashington, DC, why you can go ahead and have it successfully. But for \nthose of us in the Western part of the United States, it is just not \npractical to expect we are going to be able to put on a charitable \nevent here, in Washington, DC, and have the degree of success that we \nwould have if we are able to hold it in our own State. Certainly, if \nyou are a small organization like the Fairbanks Breast Cancer Detection \nCenter, or some of the other charities that I have mentioned, you do \nnot have the resources or the capability to hold your event in the \nNation's capital. If Senators cannot receive transportation and lodging \nreimbursement, events like mine, and others, are going to disappear. \nThey are going to disappear because it costs too much to get to Alaska \nor to get to other small States.\n  So, Mr. President, in conclusion, I am very sensitive to the \nprohibition that is in this legislation which would disallow \nreimbursement for travel and lodging for participation in charitable \nevents. Let us face it, Mr. President. In many of these cases, the \npresence of the Senators is significant in the ability to raise money \nfor the charitable event itself. This would be eliminated. I hope there \nstill will be some way that we can meet some kind of a compromise in \nthis area. The legitimacy of the event, of course, is the fact that it \nwould have to receive approval from the Ethics Committee.\n  Those who say, ``Well, since the Ethics Committee is made of up \nSenators, how in the world could you have an unbiased evaluation of the \nmerits?'' That is absolutely ridiculous thinking. If we cannot police \nourselves within the Ethics Committee structure to set certain \noversight and criteria for charitable events, why, probably none of us \nshould be here.\n  So I am quite confident that the Ethics Committee can set precedents \nto ensure that the perceptions associated with the worthiness of \nparticipation in these charitable events is handled in such a way as to \nprovide a check and a \n\n[[Page S 10593]]\nbalance and a public disclosure. Let us ask the public what they think \nabout the ability and the worthiness of some of these charitable \ncontributions that have been made as a consequence of the presence of a \nSenator.\n  Mr. President, I feel so strongly about this that I am seriously \nthinking of pursuing legislation on the Levin-Wellstone bill that would \npreclude reimbursement for the cost of transportation and lodging for \npolitical events--if, indeed, my colleagues feel that we must have \nsweeping legislation with regard to campaign reform and gift ban--\nbecause of the inconsistency, because of the hypocrisy associated with \naddressing charitable functions and not addressing the other.\n  The other is where Members receive payment from the political \norganization or the political function or political event which is made \nup of contributions of lobbyists and other political contributors so \nthat we can travel for those events, and so that we can stay at the \nelegant hotels in Florida or Virginia, in the Bahamas, and Hawaii.\n  So I think we had better examine a little more thoroughly the \nramifications of just what we are doing and just what we are trying to \nsell to the American public. We are trying to sell to the American \npublic gift ban, finance reform, and convince the American public that \nthere are no free haircuts--and there have not been. But what we are \nnot doing, very cleverly--we do not hear this mentioned--is that we are \nnot banning reimbursement for political events, transportation and \nlodging, but we are reaching out in a prohibition against participation \nin charitable events.\n  Well, I find that hypocritical, so hypocritical that this Senator is \nproposing at some point in time, if we do not get some balance in this \nprocess so we can continue a worthwhile contribution to charitable \nevents under whatever set of rules is appropriate for the Ethics \nCommittee to come down with, that I would propose that we also include \na ban on reimbursement for transportation and lodging to those \npolitical events, because Members are still permitted to be reimbursed \nfor travel to a fundraising event for another Member, or political \norganization. This is under the Senate Ethics Committee's \ninterpretative rules that a Senator may accept travel expenses from an \nofficial of a district's political party organization in return for his \nappearance at a rally sponsored by that organization.\n  And again, Mr. President, let us look at the makeup of those \norganizations. Those organizations are supported by lobbyists, \npolitical contributors, and that is where the funds come from for \nreimbursement for each Member who might attend as he or she seeks \nreimbursement for travel and lodging.\n  So I guess my concluding question is, if we are going to cut out \nreimbursement for charitable events for travel and transportation after \nit has been cleared by our own Ethics Committee, why are we not doing \nthe same thing, banning reimbursement for travel and lodging, for \npolitical events? It is hypocritical to do one and not the other.\n  So I hope, as the day goes on and we debate this matter fully, that \nwe examine a little bit more the inconsistency, and that the American \npublic wakes up to what is attempting to be done here. It is a bit of \nwindow dressing. It is a bit of telling the American people that we \nhave this grandiose scheme for campaign finance, gift ban, and no more \nfree haircuts, as if we have ever had them. But what we are not telling \nthe American public is we are going to still keep our ability to seek \nreimbursement for travel and lodging for political events.\n  Well, I hope the American public and the media pick up and understand \nthe difference. I hope that some balance remains in this body, and that \nwe recognize the significance of what our contributions and corporate \ncontributions mean to the charities in this country. If we are going to \nban the charities and not ban the political events, why, indeed, \nhypocrisy is the note of the day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining in the \nsponsorship of the legislation that is being considered, one that would \nprohibit the lobbyists from providing gifts and meals and travel for \nMembers of Congress.\n  Mr. President, it is quite apparent that the American people--and who \nknows it better than Members of this body as we have seen the onslaught \nof change take over--are unhappy with the political system and want \nchange. The American people want Congress to respond first and foremost \nto the needs of ordinary Americans, not just the special interests, not \njust the wealthy, and not just to the lobbyists.\n  When I first introduced the proposal for a gift ban in the last \nCongress, many here on Capitol Hill did not understand or appreciate \nthe depth of the public's distaste for the status quo. Today, I hope we \nall do. It is way past time, frankly, to finally translate that rage \ninto a positive action.\n  Mr. President, this is a deeply emotional issue. It is an emotional \nissue for millions of ordinary citizens who feel that their Government \nhas been taken away from them, who feel that they do not have the same \nvoice as the powerhouses in Washington and State capitals around the \ncountry. But it is also an emotional issue here in the U.S. Senate. \nJust as our constituents are angry about being shut out of the process, \nmany Senators are angry because they think somehow or other this bill \nimplies that Members are corrupt. That is not the point at all. I do \nnot think of any of my colleagues, no matter how much I may disagree \nwith them, as being corrupt. I may be angry at their point of view. I \nmay think that they are hardhearted. I may think that they are \ndisengaged through the process. But corrupt? Not at all. So that is not \nthe issue. And I think we ought to make that clear. We have all kinds \nof references, adjectives that describe how things are and what \nconstitutes various conditions of honesty or hypocrisy.\n  Mr. President, I do not think that Members of Congress, of the \nSenate, are selling their votes for a cup of coffee or a trip to the \nCaribbean or to some glamorous event. To the contrary. The Members of \nthis body are dedicated public servants who make enormous sacrifices to \nserve the public. That is true across the board. Some of my colleagues \nmay be asking themselves. ``Well, if that is true, then what do we need \nthis piece of legislation for? Why the bill?''\n  There are a couple of answers to that. The first answer is that the \nbill can begin the process of restoring public trust in the Congress. \nThat does not solve the problem by itself. But it is a good place to \nstart. This bill can make it happen. That is important because, until \nwe restore public trust, Congress will never be able to have public \nconfidence that we are, in fact, addressing the serious problems facing \nour Nation.\n  But, Mr. President, the need for a gift ban goes well beyond the need \nto change public perception. There is also a substantive issue \ninvolved.\n  The issue is not corruption. It is access. And perhaps more \nfundamentally it is an issue of fairness to ordinary Americans.\n  When lobbyists take a Senator to dinner, they are not just buying a \nmeal for a nice person. The meal involves time, and time means access. \nWhen a lobbyist buys a Senator a meal, they do not usually sit at \nseparate tables. He does not say typically, ``Well, why don't you and \nyour friends go out to dinner and I'll pay for it,'' because the dinner \nincludes a tete-a-tete, face to face, a discussion. Nothing \nsurreptitious, nothing immoral, nothing illegal, but access. It is a \nchance to get a Senator's ear, a Senator's eyes, a Senator's attention \nfor an hour or two or three, and if the wine flows generously then it \nmay even last longer.\n  Mr. President, ordinary citizens do not have that access. They cannot \njust take their Senator to a quiet dinner at a fancy restaurant and \nexplain what it is like to be unemployed, explain what it is like to be \nworried about a child's education, explain what it is like to worry \nabout the loss of health care insurance, explain what it is like to be \nup against the wall and not know which way to turn. Those calls do not \neven get through, much less to have the ability to sit with the \nSenator. And there are millions of people who would like to do it, even \nif it was just to tell us off, millions of people who would love to sit \nthere and say, ``Senator, do you know what it is like to lose your job, \nto come home to your family that \n\n[[Page S 10594]]\nis dependent upon you for their food, shelter, clothing, and \nleadership, and to say I have been fired, my job is out?'' Let them \nhave a chance to explain it to a Senator.\n  I would ask anybody here how many times have they have sat down with \nan ordinary, hard-working citizen for an hour or a half-hour or for 2 \nor 3 hours and let that person explain to them the real conditions of \nlife, not what it is like to make sure that company A, company B, or \ncompany C has an appropriate tax deduction for their particular \ninterest or that they can expand their power to communicate because \nthey think it is good for the public.\n  They certainly cannot take Members to a beach resort in the Caribbean \nto discuss a problem that they individually are having with the Tax \nCode or how far behind they have fallen on their mortgage payments.\n  Lobbyists have lots of time under the present structure to do just \nthose things. And it certainly gives them an edge over John Q. Public, \nwhether a lobbyist goes on a trip with an individual and you sit on the \ndeck of a boat fishing for 3 days, or you go to a tennis tournament \nwhere the pro fakes his inability to beat the Senator just to win a \ncouple of points, or you are out on a golf trip where you get a golf \nbag as part of the trip, or you go to a ski tournament--and I have seen \nthem first hand--where it is a uniform, a jacket that could be \nexpensive, maybe a pair of skis, free lessons from one of the top pros \nin the ski business, sitting in a chair lift going up the side of the \nmountain that can be a 20 or 25 minute ride in some places, and the \nlobbyist is sitting alongside of you, and it is Joe and Harry and they \ntalk 20 minutes at a clip riding up and down the mountain.\n  What do you think the lobbyist talks about, horticulture or the \nlatest way to make a healthy salad? He has a mission, a mission for \nwhich he or she is paid, and the mission is to try to develop an \nattitude within that Senator that has to be favorable to my company, my \ncourse of action, my industry, my association. The average citizen does \nnot have a chance to do that. And when they see Members of Congress at \nthe fanciest restaurants getting wined, getting dined, they resent it. \nThey think the deck is stacked against them. They think it is wrong. \nAnd I agree. They do not respect a system that operates that way.\n  Mr. President, I said it before. I do not stand before my colleagues \nto criticize anyone or to question anyone's motives. I am not claiming \nto be the holy one around here; I am not. But I do think we all need to \nchange the way we do business. The public certainly thinks so, and it \nis about time we get it done.\n  The bill before us is a strong piece of legislation, with tough new \nrules on gifts. It would ban all gifts--all gifts--from lobbyists. It \nwould prohibit lobbyists from taking Members on recreational trips.\n  Unfortunately, the purpose of this legislation is being either \nmisunderstood or misrepresented because I, like the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska, who spoke just a few minutes ago, believe that \nwherever possible we ought to support voluntary groups that have a \nhumanitarian or social mission. But if the organizations sponsoring the \ntrip spend more on feeding and hosting Senators and their travel to get \nto an event than the ultimate beneficiary gets, there is something in \nthat arithmetic that does not sound particularly honest. And as a \nconsequence what we have said is any trip that is substantially \nrecreational is prohibited. There is no prohibition to participating in \ncharitable events as long as the focus is on the charity.\n  So, Mr. President, we are at a point in time when we have to step up \nto the plate. Under the Republican proposal, Members of Congress would \nbe able to accept an unlimited number of gifts so long as each gift is \nworth less than $100. That means it can be lunch; it can be theater \ntickets; it can be dinner the next day; it can be a tennis racket, if \nthey still cost less than $100; it can be anything as often as a \nlobbyist likes as long as it costs less than $100. The $99.95 special \nis OK, and it can continue forever.\n  Well, it does not take long for a few of those to convince someone \nthat this lobbyist is more than a good friend who just wants to be a \nnice guy.\n  Lobbyists under the proposal that our Republican friends are putting \nup could give Senators tickets to the opera one day, tickets to the \nSuper Bowl the next day, tickets to a fancy restaurant the next day, as \nlong as they are buying tickets that cost less than $100, and so on and \nso on. Mr. President, that is not reform. It is a sad joke, and it is \njust not going to wash with the American people.\n  Before I conclude, I wish to express my appreciation to Senator Levin \nand Senator Wellstone and Senator Feingold, all of whom have played \ncritical roles in the development of this legislation. We have been \nclose allies in what has been a long and difficult battle. I appreciate \ntheir effort, their skill, and their cooperation.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to \nreject the Republican alternative. Let us finally ban gifts from \nlobbyists. Let us try to win the confidence of the American people up \nfront, and let us do it the right way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have before us a bipartisan, very tough \ngift reform bill, and this bill will finally put an end to the \nsituation where we get free tickets and free meals and we get \nrecreational travel paid for courtesy of special interests. It is a \ntough bill, but cynicism is running deep in this country, and they want \npolitical reform. The worst thing we could do would be to pretend we \nare reforming gifts when we are not doing it.\n  Now, the McConnell substitute represents business as usual. We are \npretending to be tough in the McConnell substitute, but basically we \nare continuing the current rules--pretending to be tough but basically \nmaintaining the status quo. It is what I would call a sheep in wolf's \nclothing. It is pretend reform. If you can give an unlimited number of \n$99 gifts without disclosure, without accumulating them, that is sham \nreform. This recreational travel where we can get fancy resorts, fancy \nmeals paid for by special interests, a vacation because it is billed as \na charitable event, because part of the money which the special \ninterest pays into the charity goes to the charity, what is left over \nafter they pay for our recreational travel, that has to stop. That has \nhelped to bring this body into disrepute. We must change it. I hope we \nwill change it and do real reform today or tomorrow or when we finally \nresolve the gift issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10585-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, that 60 minutes is to be divided, as I \nunderstand it, between my legislation proponents and those who oppose, \nto just alert those who are interested.\n\n[[Page S 10595]]\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1846\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that lobbying expenses \n                     should not be tax deductible)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1846.\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT LOBBYING EXPENSES SHOULD \n                   REMAIN NONDEDUCTIBLE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that ordinary Americans \n     generally are not allowed to deduct the costs of \n     communicating with their elected representatives.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that lobbying expenses should not be tax deductible.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that a practice currently in law be \ncontinued; that is, that lobbying expenses should not be tax \ndeductible. It simply affirms current law and puts the Senate clearly \non record in opposition to any efforts to reinstate the lobbying \ndeduction.\n  The question is reasonable. It says, ``Why bother? Why bother, Frank, \nwhen in fact it is in law now?'' Because I get rumblings, I get \ncommunications, indirectly, that there are people who think that we \nought to reinstate the deductibility for lobbying expenses. I want to \nsee the Senate clearly on record that says if we have the majority of \nthe votes, that this is a practice that ought to be continued.\n  What provokes this? It is that I offered an identical amendment in \nthe Budget Committee, on which I sit, during this year's markup of the \nbudget resolution. The amendment was solidly backed by a voice vote and \nit passed the Senate as part of the Senate version of the budget \nresolution.\n  Unfortunately, I guess somebody blinked in conference and the \nprovision was dropped. So what the conference said is, ``Well, we don't \nwant to confirm the fact that present practice should continue, but it \nimplies, therefore, that perhaps the deductibility of lobbying expenses \nought to come back into the arena.''\n  One can question why it was dropped, but one cannot obtain a \nsatisfactory answer.\n  So, Mr. President, since we are discussing lobbying reform, and this \nis an excellent bill and just the right time to make sure that \neverybody knows what goes on here and that lobbyists have no advantage \nthat other people in this society should be having, while it is not \npossible to clearly do that because of the physical presence, we ought \nto get as close to leveling this field as we can. I want to see the \nSenate clearly go on record in final opposition to providing a tax \nbreak for lobbying efforts.\n  After all, this year we are in the process of developing budget \nlegislation that will impose severe costs on ordinary Americans. \nCongress has already asked senior citizens to accept deep cuts in \nMedicare and Medicaid. I can tell you from the calls I get back home in \nNew Jersey, and across this country, people say, ``For Lord's sake, \nSenator Lautenberg, don't let them do that. Right now I am burdened \nwith the extra costs on top of my Medicare reimbursement that I get to \nthe tune on average of 20 percent of my income.''\n  They say, ``I can't afford to pay more.'' They say to me that, ``When \nI face the prospect of spending $3,300 more in the next 7 years, the \nlast year being $800 or $900, it could break the bank, as far as I am \nconcerned,'' remembering that 75 percent of our senior citizens live on \n$25,000 a year or less in income; 35,000 live on $10,000 a year or less \nin income.\n  So as we examine our budget, we want to make sure that we are being \nfair with ordinary, hard-working American people or, if not hard-\nworking, those who worked hard for many years and finally have retired.\n  Students are going to be asked to accept sharp reductions in student \nloans. It is going to cost them a lot more, and I hear pleas from young \npeople who want desperately to go to college, who say, ``My folks just \ncannot hand me the money to do that and I have to go out and borrow the \nmoney and pledge my future against it.'' Everyone knows they are clever \nenough, those young people going to college, to know that it is going \nto cost them more for their student loans than it did before. They are \nnot like I who was able to get the benefit of a GI bill because I \nserved in World War II and got my education paid for. These young \npeople are not going to have that opportunity.\n  Working families will be asked to endure a significant tax increase \nas Congress cuts back on the earned income tax credit, a provision to \nhelp lower income people keep their head above water.\n  The people who lose in this year's budget generally are people who \nhave no lobbyists representing them. They are simple, ordinary \nAmericans who hardly know what is about to happen to them; thus, the \nfrustration that we see is transferred into anger and rage. Most are \ntoo busy to follow developments in Washington. They have their own jobs \nto do, their own families to raise, their own bills to pay, and they do \nnot have lobbyists on retainer to watch out for their interests and \ncall them up and say, ``Hey, Joe, guess what is happening? They are \ngoing to make you pay more for'' this, more for that, ``what do you \nthink?'' Their opinions are not sought.\n  Meanwhile, many of the special interests that benefit from the lavish \nsubsidies are well represented in Washington. Special interests, \nlobbyists are already working hard to protect their clients' favorite \nGovernment handout, and you can be sure they will be doing everything \nthey can to ensure their wealthy clients will not lose any of their tax \nbreaks.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that those Americans who can \nafford to hire lobbyists for special interests already have a major \nadvantage in the legislative process. They ought not also to get an \nadvantage in the Tax Code. Fortunately, the 103d Congress recognized \nand repealed the deduction for lobbying. That repeal saved the U.S. \nGovernment $653 million over 5 years, a substantial sum. More than half \na billion dollars over a 5-year period. And, yet, not everybody is \nhappy with the repeal of that deduction.\n  Now that we have a new majority in the Congress, some believe that \nthe lobbying deduction ought to be reinstated. According to the \nnewspaper Roll Call, a national grassroots campaign is now underway to \npush for restoration of the lobbyists' tax break. The main targets of \nthis campaign are those who are members of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee and the Finance Committee in the Senate. But all Members are \nlikely to feel the pressure, and I know I have heard from people in New \nJersey urging that the deduction be reinstated. I can only assume that \nall of my colleagues have been subject to similar lobbying efforts.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the vast majority of the public opposes \na tax break for lobbying. In fact, this proved to be a significant \nissue in my campaign last year for my third term. My opponent in 1994 \ncalled for reinstatement of the lobbying deduction. I strongly \ndisagreed with him and, obviously, did it publicly. In judging from the \nreaction of the people I met in New Jersey, this was an argument that I \nwon hands down.\n  Unfortunately, the possibility of reinstating the lobbying deduction \nso far has not received a great deal of attention in the public at \nlarge. So long as the American people do not know what is going on, it \ncan be easy to quietly insert a related provision in a huge tax bill. I \ndo not think that ought to be allowed to happen. As we are getting \nclose to the consideration of the reconciliation bill, I think it is \nimportant that the Senate go clearly on record in opposition to the \nidea of reinstating that tax deduction.\n  The need to put the Senate on record is especially important, given \nthe opposition from the House to including this same amendment in the \nconference report on the budget resolution. The House was willing to \naccept other sense of the Senate language, but for some reason they \ncould not bring themselves to accept this. Our Senate negotiators could \nnot keep it in the bill. One can only conclude that the House \nleadership apparently thinks \n\n[[Page S 10596]]\nthat the lobbyists ought to get this tax break back.\n  Now, Mr. President, I understand the view of some that say that \nlobbying should be considered like any other cost of doing business, \nand so it should be deducted. That is a view that apparently many in \nthe other body believe. Based on the feedback that I have heard from \nconstituents, the American people would strongly disagree. In their \nview, I think it is a matter of basic fairness, a matter of priorities.\n  Mr. President, if an ordinary citizen writes a letter to their Member \nof Congress to express their concern about proposed cuts in education, \nthat is not deductible. If an ordinary citizen takes the train or a \nplane or drives down to Washington from New Jersey or other places to \nmeet with Senate staff about the high cost of Federal taxes, the cost \nof that train ride or the plane ride are not, generally, deductible. If \na senior citizen, concerned about Medicare cuts, drives across his or \nher State to collect signatures on a petition, these costs are not \ndeductible.\n  Now, Mr. President, if ordinary citizens like these cannot deduct \ntheir lobbying expenses, neither should a special interest group who \nhires a lobbyist to protect its favorite Government subsidy and neither \nshould a billionaire who hires a lobbyist to protect his favorite tax \nbreak or his special opportunity to grow his profits.\n  It is a question of fairness. It is a question of priorities. Think \nof it this way, Mr. President. Reinstating the deduction for lobbying \nwould cost the Government over $100 million a year for the next 5 \nyears--in fact, $650 million. Even if we think that lobbying expenses \nshould be deducted, is this really a priority in these times of fiscal \nausterity, in these times of extreme sacrifices by many of our citizens \nwho work hard and are barely treading water?\n  How can we in good conscience spend $650 million for a tax break for \nlobbyists and then severely cut Medicare? How can we spend $650 million \nfor a tax break for lobbyists and then turn around and cut education? \nHow can we spend $650 million for a tax break for lobbyists and then \nturn around and increase taxes on ordinary Americans, lower income \ncitizens, by cutting back on the earned income tax credit?\n  Mr. President, with all the problems facing this country, we simply \nhave to set our priorities straight. And giving a tax deduction to \nlobbying just should not be high on that list.\n  I want to be clear about something. I am not here to bash lobbyists. \nNot by any means. In fact, I would be the first to say that they often \nget a bum rap. Most are top-notch professionals--some of them trained \nin postgraduate courses, law school, Government, et cetera--and they \nperform important functions. They have every right, under the first \namendment to the Constitution, to petition Government officials. What \nthey do not have as a right is the ability to have their expenses \ndeductible.\n  Now, this is not a radical idea, Mr. President. Congress reached the \nsame conclusion 2 years ago. My point today is simply that we should \nnot reverse that earlier decision, that, in fact, we ought to reaffirm \nthat earlier decision so there cannot be any mistake about what this \nCongress stands for in terms of that deduction. This is a declaration \nof fealty, of loyalty, that we are going to preserve the \nnondeductibility of those expenses.\n  It would only strengthen the public cynicism about the Congress, \nwhich they already see as controlled by lobbyists and special \ninterests. We cannot wonder why. It is quite apparent.\n  I want to add this point. I appreciate, Mr. President, there is some \ncontroversy about some of the details of the current law and how it is \nadministered. My amendment is not intended to address these issues. I \nam not here to endorse every dot and comma in the IRS regulations, or \nto oppose minor modifications to current law in the area. I am here to \nmake a more general point. If ordinary Americans are not allowed to \ndeduct the costs of communicating with their elected representatives, \nlobbying expenses should not be deductible, either. It is a basic \nmatter of fairness and priorities.\n  So, to repeat, Mr. President, my amendment simply expresses the sense \nof the Senate that lobbying expenses should not be tax deductible. \nPresent law ought to continue. I hope that my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle intend to continue the present policy. That is what we are \ngoing to see by the vote that we will be requesting, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, as I understand, any opposition to this amendment has \nhalf an hour to express their opposition.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask that the time be charged \nequally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I interrupt the quorum call simply to \nmake certain that we are ordering the yeas and nays.\n  I ask the distinguished manager of the bill on the Republican side \nwhether he will join me in calling for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator seek consent to have the time \ndivided between the two sides?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. As was requested, unless it expedites the process \nfurther by yielding back?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my indication from floor staff is they \nprefer the two votes to occur at 12. I am unaware of any speakers on \nthis side.\n  If Senator Lautenberg would like additional time, I will be happy to \nyield it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the case was made, I hope clearly and \nsufficiently.\n  I therefore will yield all time and just have the vote occur as \nplanned at 12 o'clock.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We are planning on the vote occurring at 12. So my \nsuggestion would be for us to just put in a quorum call and let the \ntime run and the two votes will occur at 12.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The time will be equally deducted from both sides.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10594-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BOSNIA RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Finally, Mr. President, let me say with reference to the \ngift ban, \n\n[[Page S 10597]]\nthat has been debated this morning. It started at 9 o'clock, it would \nbe my hope that during the debate on Bosnia we could continue our \nbipartisan efforts to reach some agreement on a gift ban.\n  I do not know of anybody here that will live or die based on what \nhappens on the gift ban. I think what we want to make certain of is \nthat you do not have someone in this body who gets in trouble for some \nunintentional act.\n  I received five birthday cakes last week. I am not certain what the \nvalue of the cakes were. I only ate one piece. But I might be in \ntrouble because I am certain that the value of some of those cakes was \nin excess of $20.\n  I was in Ocala, FL, on Sunday. They gave me a very nice piece of \nartistic work from wood. I do not know the value of it. The artist is \nnot well known but well known in that part of Florida. Are we to say we \ncannot take that? There was not any lobbying group there. There were \nabout 400 people there. For some reason they were happy I was there, \nand they gave me this gift.\n  I believe that the thing we want to make certain of is that we do not \ngo over the cliff here. I know there are 23 exemptions, as I understand \nit, for ``nonlobbyists.'' But I would hope my friend from Kentucky, who \nis present on the floor, would make certain, in our effort to make \ncertain we are all simon pure, that we do not unintentionally involve \none of our colleagues in some difficulty down the road if somebody in \nan election year, particularly if somebody did not register this \nbirthday cake, they did not register this or that. I think it is easy \nto go to the extreme.\n  If you do not have any friends they do not give you any gifts, and \nyou do not have any problem. But most of us have friends, and they are \ngood people. They are people from our home State, and people from other \nStates which we visit.\n  I am talking about minimal gifts, not anything of any great \nsubstance.\n  If we can work out a bipartisan agreement, then obviously we will \ntake it up tomorrow. If not, we may delay it for a while because we \nwant to start on the State Department authorization bill. Hopefully, we \ncan finish that in 2 or 3 days. That would still leave DOD \nauthorization and appropriations, also foreign operations, welfare \nreform bill, four appropriations bills, the Ryan White bill, and a few \nother things before we recess for August.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this year, Congress took an \nimportant step forward in reforming the way we conduct the Nation's \nbusiness by passing congressional coverage legislation. Now, we will \nthink twice before imposing new regulatory burdens on the private \nsector because these burdens will be imposed on Congress, too.\n  Today, we will pass another key element of the reform agenda--\nlobbying reform.\n  Unlike last year's bill, this legislation strikes the right balance: \nit tightens up the registration and disclosure requirements for the \nWashington-based lobbyists, without infringing upon the rights of \nordinary citizens at the grassroots to petition their Government. This \nwas the main bone of contention during last year's debate, and I \nbelieve we have resolved our disagreements.\n  While I was hopeful that we could have made a number of additional \nchanges, including codifying President\n Clinton's executive order which imposes a 5-year ban on postemployment \nlobbying by executive branch officials, I am nonetheless pleased that \nthe bill includes my amendment restricting the postemployment \nactivities of our Nation's top trade negotiators.\n\n  This amendment will prohibit anyone who has served as U.S. Trade \nRepresentative or Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, from ever \nrepresenting, aiding, or advising any foreign government, foreign \npolitical party, or foreign business entity with the intent to \ninfluence a decision of any officer or employee of an executive agency.\n  Current law prohibits the U.S. Trade Representative from aiding or \nadvising a foreign entity for a period of 3 years after his service has \nended. My amendment transforms this 3-year ban into a lifetime ban and \napplies the ban to the Deputy Trade Representative as well.\n  The real problem here is one of appearance--the appearance of a \nrevolving door between government service and private-sector \nenrichment. This appearance problem becomes all the more acute when \nformer high Government officials work on behalf of foreign interests.\n  Service as a high Government official is a privilege, not a right. \nThis amendment may discourage some individuals from accepting the \nU.S.T.R. job, but in my view, this is a small price to pay when the \nconfidence of the American people is at stake.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to congratulate my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Levin, Cohen, McConnell, and Lott, for all the \nhard work they have put into this effort.\n  I know they have been working a number of days--in fact weeks--in \ntrying to come to some agreement. And because of their efforts, and \nbecause of the their willingness on a give-and-take proposition, I \nbelieve they have crafted a very clear and a very sensible bill. And it \nshould go a long way toward helping restore the trust of the American \npeople in their elected representatives.\n  I think the vote yesterday reflects broad support. The vote for the \nMcConnell-Levin substitute was 98 to 0. There were two Senators absent, \nor it would have been 100 to 0. And I predict the vote today will \nprobably be unanimous. Every Senator present will vote in favor of it. \n\n[[Page S 10598]]\n\n  So, again I congratulate my colleague from Kentucky, Senator \nMcConnell, Senator Levin from Michigan, Senator Lott, who more or less \nhad the responsibility for moving this bill along for the past several \nweeks and working with different groups; and, of course, Senator Cohen \nwho was the principal author of the bill last year and again worked \nhard this year.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me take just a few brief moments to \ncommend the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin, and the Senator from \nMaine, Senator Cohen, for their tireless work on trying to plug the \ngaping holes that exist in our current lobbying disclosure laws.\n  Like the gift ban legislation that the Senate will soon be turning \nto, the Lobbying Disclosure Act has traveled a long and winding road. \nS. 349, the original lobbying disclosure bill, passed the Senate in \n1993 by a margin of 95 to 2.\n  Unfortunately, that legislation fell victim to a filibuster near the \nend of the 103d Congress when some last-minute concerns were raised \nthat the bill might infringe on the lobbying activities of grassroots \nand religious organizations.\n  Though the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin, has made clear that \nthat bill would have had no such effects, I think it is to his credit \nthat he has addressed those concerns in the underlying legislation, and \nmade perfectly clear that it is neither the intent nor the practical \neffect of the bill to restrict such grassroots lobbying in any way.\n  The effort of the Levin-Cohen legislation to shed some much-needed \nlight on the activities of Washington's paid lobbyists is long overdue, \nand together with a strong gift ban bill will make dramatic progress \ntoward lessening the degree of influence that the special interests \nhave here in Washington.\n  The Levin-Cohen bill, which I am an original cosponsor of, does not \nban lobbying or restrict the rights of individuals to petition their \nGovernment in any way. It is simply a disclosure bill. It states that \nif you spend a certain percentage of time lobbying or spend x number of \ndollars on lobbying activities, you must disclose certain types of \ninformation about what legislators you are lobbying and the issues \nraised.\n  The bill would require paid, professional lobbyists to disclose \nessential information, such as who they are lobbying, who they are \nrepresenting and what issues they are lobbying on.\n  The Levin-Cohen bill would also simplify and streamline the reporting \nprocess by allowing a single registration by each organization that \nemploys professional lobbyists. This will dramatically cut down on the \nunnecessary and burdensome paperwork that has become associated with \nour current inadequate registration laws.\n  As I said, Mr. President, this legislation is long overdue. Our \nconstituents are entitled to know who is lobbying us, who they \nrepresent, how much they are spending to lobby us, and what issues they \nare trying to influence us on.\n  The Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin, has probably illustrated \nhow the current lobbying disclosure laws are riddled with holes and \ninefficiencies, and have resulted in only a fraction of the Washington \nlobbyists actually registering under the current laws. In short, the \npublic is essentially in the dark as to the kinds of back room lobbying \nand deal cutting that has unfortunately become a large part of the \nlegislative process.\n  I am pleased that this body is apparently going to overwhelmingly \napprove this bill. I have said before that many of these reform issues \ncan be done and should be done on a bipartisan basis. I have joined \nwith the senior Senator from Arizona on a number of issues, ranging \nfrom campaign finance reform to revolving door lobbying reform to gift \nreform, and I hope that the bipartisan cooperation that was so \neffective in producing this strong lobbying disclosure bill can be \nextended to make progress and the many other areas of our legislative \nprocess that have cried out for reform in recent years.\n  Again, I compliment the two sides for their willingness to get \ntogether, compromise and produce a bipartisan bill that preserves the \ntough disclosure requirements in the original Levin-Cohen bill while \nensuring that the reporting provisions in this bill are not overly \nburdensome to those who are going to be complying with the new \nrequirements. I look forward to a resounding vote on this legislation \nand I yield the floor.\n                           Amendment No. 1847\n\n     (Purpose: To make technical corrections to lobby reform bill)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I now send to the desk a managers' \namendment in behalf of myself and Senator McConnell. This amendment \nclears up two provisions in the bill in order to make the wording more \nunderstandable. The first part of amendment is the request of the \nFinance Committee to clarify the language in the bill which avoids \ndouble bookkeeping. The second part of the amendment restructures the \namendment of Senator Brown on the disclosure of income and assets to \nmake it conform to the structure of the Ethics in Government Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself and Mr. \n     McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered 1847.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the page 57 of the bill, at line 13, strike ``required \n     to account for lobbying expenditures and does account for \n     lobbying expenditures pursuant'' and insert: ``subject''.\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . DISCLOSURE OF THE VALUE OF ASSETS UNDER THE ETHICS IN \n                   GOVERNMENT ACT OF 1978.\n\n       (a) Income.--Section 102(a)(1)(B) of the Ethics in \n     Government Act of 1978 is amended--\n       (1) in clause (vii) by striking ``or''; and\n       (2) by striking clause (viii) and inserting the following:\n       ``(viii) greater than $1,000,000 but not more than \n     $5,000,000, or\n       ``(ix) greater than $5,000,000.''.\n       (b) Assets and Liabilities.--Section 102(d)(1) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978 is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (F) by striking ``and''; and\n       (2) by striking subparagraph (G) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(G) greater than $1,000,000 but not more than $5,000,000;\n       ``(H) greater than $5,000,000 but not more than \n     $25,000,000;\n       ``(I) greater than $25,000,000 but not more than \n     $50,000,000; and\n       ``(J) greater than $50,000,000.''.\n       ``(c) Exception.--Section 102(e)(1) of the Ethics in \n     Government Act of 1978 is amended by adding after \n     subparagraph (E) the following:\n       ``(F) For purposes of this section, categories with amounts \n     or values greater than $1,000,000 set froth in section \n     102(a)(1)(B) and 102(d)(1) shall apply to the income, assets, \n     or liabilities of spouses and dependent children only if the \n     income, assets, or liabilities are held jointly with the \n     reporting individual. All other income, assets, or \n     liabilities of the spouse or dependent children required to \n     be reported under this section in an amount or value greater \n     than $1,000,000 shall be categorized only as an amount or \n     value greater than $1,000,000.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes equally divided on the \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me simply say lobbying reform is one of \nthe three pillars of political reform. Gifts and campaign finance \nreform are the other two.\n  For 50 years we have tried to reform lobby disclosure laws. Last year \nwe almost made it. This year we are back on the road. I hope that the \nHouse will quickly adopt what we pass here, hopefully this afternoon.\n  I want to thank Senator Cohen and Senator Glenn and all Senators on \nboth sides who have been helpful--Senator Lott, Senator McConnell--and \nSenator Daschle, who has stood with political reform with great \nconstancy throughout his determination that we take up political reform \nissues, is one of the driving forces behind these efforts. I \nparticularly want to thank him as well. But I think we are back on the \nroad when it comes to political reform. I am glad that we did it on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just say briefly that this is \nnow a good bill. It will not keep citizens from exercising their rights \nto petition the Congress. We were able through bipartisan compromise to \nwork out something which I think everybody can proudly vote for.\n  I particularly want to thank Melissa Patack of my staff, and Alison \nCarroll of Senator Lott's staff for the good \n\n[[Page S 10599]]\nwork they have done on this and helping us get to this particular \nplace.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in addition to the two staffers that \nSenator McConnell mentioned that deserve plaudits, indeed, let me thank \nparticularly Jim Weber of Senator Daschle's staff, Kennie Gill of \nSenator Ford's staff, and my two staffers who are really extraordinary, \nLinda Gustitis and Peter Levine. They have carried this and guided this \nfor many years. And a special thanks to Senator Ford whose guidance has \nbeen so helpful and whose wisdom has been so constant throughout this \neffort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the managers yield back their remaining \ntime?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield back the time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield back the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1847.\n  The amendment (No. 1847) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, shall the bill pass? On this question the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lobbying Disclosure Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) responsible representative Government requires public \n     awareness of the efforts of paid lobbyists to influence the \n     public decisionmaking process in both the legislative and \n     executive branches of the Federal Government;\n       (2) existing lobbying disclosure statutes have been \n     ineffective because of unclear statutory language, weak \n     administrative and enforcement provisions, and an absence of \n     clear guidance as to who is required to register and what \n     they are required to disclose; and\n       (3) the effective public disclosure of the identity and \n     extent of the efforts of paid lobbyists to influence Federal \n     officials in the conduct of Government actions will increase \n     public confidence in the integrity of Government.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       (1) Agency.--The term ``agency'' has the meaning given that \n     term in section 551(1) of title 5, United States Code.\n       (2) Client.--The term ``client'' means any person or entity \n     that employs or retains another person for financial or other \n     compensation to conduct lobbying activities on behalf of that \n     person or entity. A person or entity whose employees act as \n     lobbyists on its own behalf is both a client and an employer \n     of such employees. In the case of a coalition or association \n     that employs or retains other persons to conduct lobbying \n     activities, the client is the coalition or association and \n     not its individual members.\n       (3) Covered executive branch official.--The term ``covered \n     executive branch official'' means--\n       (A) the President;\n       (B) the Vice President;\n       (C) any officer or employee, or any other individual \n     functioning in the capacity of such an officer or employee, \n     in the Executive Office of the President;\n       (D) any officer or employee serving in a position in level \n     I, II, III, IV, or V of the Executive Schedule, as designated \n     by statute or Executive order;\n       (E) any member of the uniformed services whose pay grade is \n     at or above O-7 under section 201 of title 37, United States \n     Code; and\n       (F) any officer or employee serving in a position of a \n     confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-\n     advocating character described in section 7511(b)(2) of title \n     5, United States Code.\n       (4) Covered legislative branch official.--The term \n     ``covered legislative branch official'' means--\n       (A) a Member of Congress;\n       (B) an elected officer of either House of Congress;\n       (C) any employee of, or any other individual functioning in \n     the capacity of an employee of--\n       (i) a Member of Congress;\n       (ii) a committee of either House of Congress;\n       (iii) the leadership staff of the House of Representatives \n     or the leadership staff of the Senate;\n       (iv) a joint committee of Congress; and\n       (v) a working group or caucus organized to provide \n     legislative services or other assistance to Members of \n     Congress; and\n       (D) any other legislative branch employee serving in a \n     position described under section 109(13) of the Ethics in \n     Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C.

It is, in the narrow legal sense, therefore, in my \nopinion, illegal as it is applied to Bosnia because Bosnia did not even \nexist as a separate country at that time.\n  But more to the point and ironically, cynically, when adopted by the \nUnited Nations Security Council in 1991, this arms embargo on the \nformer Yugoslavia was requested by and supported by the then Government \nof Yugoslavia in Belgrade, which is to say the Milosevic government. \nAnd I say cynically because the pattern that was to follow was clear \nthen, which was that the Milosevic government was going to set about \nsystematically trying to create a greater Serbia and, therefore, \nknowing that Serbia itself, by accident of history, contained the \nwarmaking capacity, the munitions, the weapons which were part of \nYugoslavia, would enjoy essentially a monopoly of force as against its \nneighbors.\n  But we took that political act, supported by well-meaning governments \nin the West and elsewhere, as a way to stop arms from flowing into the \nBalkans so as to stop a war from going on, and we have made it into the \nHoly Writ. It is not. It is immoral. It is quite the opposite of the \nHoly Writ. It is immoral and it is illegal; illegal not only for the \ntechnical legal reasons I cited a moment ago but because it denies--\nthis political resolution of the Security Council--denies Bosnia the \nrights it has gained as a member nation of the United Nations to defend \nitself.\n  What could be more fundamental to a nation as the guarantor of its \nown existence then the right to defend itself? \n\n[[Page S 10604]]\nYet, this resolution continues to be imposed to deny the Bosnians just \nthat right.\n  The embargo is illegal and, Mr. President, let me say respectfully, \nit is immoral. It is immoral because it is having an impact on people \nwho have done no wrong. This is not some expression, some sanctions \nresolution imposed on a people who have acted against international law \nor against their neighbors. It is imposed on the Bosnians, who have not \nbeen accused of wrongdoing here. And, of course, more to the point, \nhistory has shown, since the embargo was imposed in 1991, that the \nBosnians have been the painful and tragic victims of Serbian aggression \nand, yes, genocide.\n  Talk about accidents of history, it is a quirk of fate that, on this \nday, when the Senate goes to this critical issue and debates the \nlifting of the arms embargo, word comes from the Hague that Bosnian \nleader Radovan Karadzic and his military chief of staff, Ratko Mladic, \nhave been charged with genocide, war crimes, and crimes against \nhumanity by the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal \nestablished in the Hague for that purpose. They are charged with \ngenocide and crimes against humanity arising from atrocities \nperpetrated against the civilian population throughout Bosnia and \nHerzegovina.\n  This is an indictment. This is a legal instrument of international \nlaw. The tribunal said today that, in the summer of 1992, Bosnian Serbs \nheld over 3,000 Moslems and Croats at the Karaterm Camp.\n  From the indictment, ``Detainees were killed, sexually assaulted, \ntortured, beaten, and otherwise subjected to cruel and inhuman \ntreatment.'' In one incident, the indictment recalls, machineguns were \nfired into a room filled with 140 detainees, who all died. This is the \nindictment, turned out today by the International Criminal Tribunal in \nthe Hague. Karadzic and Mladic are accused of ordering the shelling of \ncivilian gatherings, including the May 1995--this is July 1995; the May \n1995, a few months ago--attack on Tuzla, in which 195 people were \nkilled, and the seizure earlier this summer of 284 United Nations \npeacekeepers in Pale and Gorazde.\n  Karadzic and Mladic are also charged with ``persecuting Moslem and \nCroatian political leaders, deporting thousands of civilians, and \nsystematically destroying Moslem and Catholic sacred sites.''\n  I am not reading from any advocacy group for the Bosnians. I am \nreading from an instrument of international law, an indictment returned \ntoday in the Hague by an International Criminal Tribunal authorized by \nthe United Nations, charging the leaders of the Bosnian Serb aggressors \nwith war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n And as these crimes have been committed, as horrible as they are, what \nwells up inside me--and I know so many of my colleagues here--is that \nwe were part of continuing to enforce this arms embargo which denied \nthese victims of these war crimes and atrocities the weapons with which \nthey could fight back. Just think of how we would feel ourselves if in \na personal context somebody was attacking our home, our neighborhood, \nour community and for some reason the police were not available, and we \nhad no capacity to defend ourselves or to fight back. That is what we \nhave done and why it is time finally to lift this arms embargo.\n\n  Mr. President, there always seems to be another reason not to do it. \nFirst, it was that if we lifted the arms embargo the Serbs would seize \nU.N. personnel as hostages. They have done that already. That reason \nfor not lifting the arms embargo is gone, tragically and sadly. Then it \nwas said that if we lift the arms embargo the Serbs would attack the \nsafe havens and go back to the slaughters that the world saw in 1992, 3 \nyears ago. We did not lift the arms embargo, and the Serbs have \nattacked the safe havens.\n  Now the question is whether there is something happening coming out \nof London last Friday that gives us pause and should make us hesitate. \nMr. President, I hate to say it, but it is hard to believe that the \nUnited Nations mission in Bosnia has not been a failure, has not \ncollapsed. As for the London communique, I take some small heart from \nit because it is the first sign of a willingness by the Western allies \nto use air power to hold the Serb aggressors at bay, to make them pay \nfor their aggression. Nonetheless, at this moment it is simply a \nthreat. The London communique is a threat, not a policy calculated to \nend the war. And it is a limited threat, limited as it is to only one \nof the four safe havens that have not fallen to Serb aggression. \nGorazde will be protected. But what about Bihac which is under fierce \nattack now? What about the great capital of Sarajevo? What about Tuzla? \nWhy not them too?\n  The threat remains uncertain, although the original stories coming \nout of London on Friday were heartening in that it was said that this \ndual-key approach which has so frustrated the brave soldiers who have \nworn the blue helmets of the United Nations, that this dual-key \napproach which gives the political leadership of the United Nations the \nopportunity to veto the request for air cover and air support from \nNATO, it appeared that this dual-key approach was finally ended, and \nNATO would be able to protect itself without getting approval from Mr. \nAkashi or Secretary General Boutros-Ghali. But there seems to be a \ndisagreement about the timing of this.\n  In this morning's news it is reported from New York that Mr. Fawzi, a \nspokesman for U.N. Secretary General Boutros-Ghali, said that the \nairstrikes are to defend U.N. peacekeepers, not to defend the safe area \nof Gorazde, and that the authority to order an attack ``remains with \nthe Secretary General for the time being.'' So the dual-key is still an \napproach making even more uncertain the impact of the London \ncommunique.\n  When will NATO air power be employed to strike back? Will it be when \ntroops mass around Gorazde that they attack? What are the rules of \nengagement? It remained uncertain in the meeting in Brussels yesterday \nwhether the NATO countries could resolve that. But I will say to you, \nMr. President, that if the threat to protect the safe area is carried \nout, then there is some hope because it will amount to the beginning of \nan implementation of the strike part of the lift-and-strike policy \nwhich Senator Dole and I and others have advocated since 1992.\n  But, Mr. President, what happened in London is no excuse to vote \nagainst the lifting of the arms embargo, illegal and immoral as it is. \nThe embargo stands separate and apart as it in itself is an \nunacceptable act of the international community, and we must repeal it \nand let these people defend themselves.\n  Mr. President, the other argument that is being used by some critics \nof lifting the arms embargo is that it will ``Americanize'' the war if \nwe lift the arms embargo. And the implication here is that it will lead \nto the placement of American troops on Bosnian soil.\n  Let me say here that from the beginning, when Senator Dole and I and \nothers began to work on this proposal to lift the arms embargo, we have \nsaid we do not want American troops on Bosnian soil. We do not have \nenough of a national interest, and there is not enough of a strategic \nopportunity for those troops. And what is more, the Bosnians do not \nwant them, and do not need them. They have said over and over and over \nagain to us, ``We have soldiers on Bosnian soil. They are Bosnian \nsoldiers. All we needed were the weapons, the tanks, the antitank \nweapons, the heavy artillery to help them fight a fair fight against \nthe Serbs.''\n  So it is ironic to see at this moment the delays and the excuses for \nnot lifting the arms embargo and, when we are finally at a point of \nhaving a strong bipartisan vote in favor of lifting the arms embargo, \nthat the reason given by some to vote against it is that it will cause \nthe ``Americanizing'' of the war. If it leads to the exit of the United \nNations--and the United Nations, in my opinion, will exit for many more \nreasons than the lifting of the arms embargo--that will not be anything \nthat we have desired, those of us who have proposed this policy for now \nmore than 3 years. But why punish the Bosnians, the victims, for the \nerror of our policy, for the inappropriateness of our commitments? They \nhave been consistent all along. And I think we owe it to the victims to \nlisten to them.\n  So why say now because the United Nations' forces were sent in and \nthe President made a commitment to send \n\n[[Page S 10605]]\nAmerican troops to help extract the U.N. forces if that becomes \nnecessary, that is a reason for us to sustain the illegal and immoral \narms embargo and victimize further the Bosnian people?\n  Mr. President, this question of whether the war is ``Americanized'' \nis up to Americans. The President, the Congress--we will decide when \nand where American troops will be sent. This will not happen. \nAutomatically lifting the arms embargo does not put us on some slippery \nslope where we inevitably end up with troops on the ground there. Far \nfrom it; certainly not in combat positions.\n  The other argument made is that lifting of the arms embargo will \n``Americanize'' the war because we will have to send Americans there to \nbring the weapons and train the Bosnians. I have two responses to that. \nOne is that if it becomes necessary to send Americans to train the \nBosnians in the use of our weapons, we can do it in Croatia without \nsending them into Bosnia. But I will tell you, Mr. President, many of \nmy colleagues here have had the same conversations about this with the \nBosnians themselves. They say to us, if the arms embargo was lifted \ntoday, they really do not prefer American weapons. They do not prefer \nour American trainers. They prefer weapons from the former Warsaw Pact \ncountries from when Yugoslavia was alive, and on which most of the \nfighters, the soldiers in the Bosnian Army, have been trained. They \nprefer them because they do not need a long period of training. They \ncan get the weapons, and in a short time put them onto the battlefield.\n  I think what they most hope for is that as soon as this embargo is \nlifted the United States and other countries of the world hopefully--\nparticularly Moslem countries who are infuriated by the one-sidedness \nof the battle and the way in which the international community has \nsustained that one-sidedness--will contribute funds for the Bosnians to \nuse to equip them so as to make this fair play.\n  Mr. President, it is true that over the weekend or late last week in \nGeneva, there was a meeting of the Council of the Organization of the \nIslamic Conference, and the foreign ministers of the so-called OIC \nContact Group on Bosnia and Herzegovina voted that the member states of \nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference do not consider themselves \nlegally bound to abide by the unlawful and unjust arms embargo imposed \non Bosnia and Herzegovina which is a United Nations member. The \nministers said that the burden of justifying the legality of \nmaintaining the embargo imposed on Bosnia herself rested on the \nshoulders of the United Nations Security Council. So help may well be \ncoming in implementing a lifting of the embargo.\n  Mr. President, we have, as we have had all along I am afraid, a \nchoice here between the policy that we are advocating of lift and \nstrike and a policy of wait and see. And we have waited for 3 years, \nand we have seen aggression continue. We have seen more than 200,000 \npeople killed. We have seen more than 2 million refugees created. It is \ntime to stop waiting and stop seeing, and it is time for us to lift the \narms embargo and strike from the air in the hope that will finally put \nsome pressure on the Serbs that they have not felt up until this time, \nso that they will come to the peace table with the prospect of \nnegotiating fairly and accepting a peace agreement for Bosnia that the \nBosnians themselves, who have accepted every previous peace treaty \noffer, can accept to bring an end to this tragic war. That is a policy \nthat I think more than any other which has been tried to date and those \nthat have been tried have failed offers even at this late and difficult \nhour in Bosnia some prospect not only for peace, but for the \nresurrection of some credibility, some legitimacy in the institutions \nupon which Europe and the rest of the world must depend in the years \nahead for security and order; that is to say, NATO, the United Nations, \nand most of all, the strength and leadership of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I note the presence on the floor of my distinguished \ncolleague and friend from Virginia, Senator Warner. And I yield to him \nat this time.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there are no easy solutions to the tragic \nconflict in Bosnia. Throughout Europe and here in the United States \npersons with the most noble intentions have struggled with this program \nto no avail. The Senate has conscientiously searched for solutions. The \ndebate knows no party lines, as is appropriate. The various policy \noptions facing our Nation change weekly; giving the Senate an excuse to \nsit and wait. I join the majority leader and Senator Lieberman in \nsaying: ``No longer, the Senate must act.''\n  The course charted by the majority leader offers the best hope for \nthe long-suffering people of Bosnia. While I have opposed, over 2 \nyears, Senator Dole's earlier approaches, he has now amended his \napproach to where I can now join as a cosponsor of the Dole-Lieberman \nresolution. The thrust of this resolution is to lift the arms embargo \nagainst the Government of Bosnia, but with conditions precedent. The \ncurrent resolution incorporates these conditions which I have, all \nalong, regarded as essential to a lifting of the embargo.\n  I commend the majority leader and the Senator from Connecticut for \nmodifying their original resolution by making a withdrawal of UNPROFOR \npersonnel the trigger for a U.S. lifting of the arms embargo. This \nmodification addressed my main concern with previous legislative \nattempts, namely, of an immediate, unilateral lift of the arms embargo. \nMy earlier concern was for the UNPROFOR troops being in place \nsimultaneously with a lifting of the embargo. Such a move by the United \nStates would endanger these troops who have been admirably, \ncourageously, trying to perform peacekeeping, humanitarian missions in \nBosnia under most difficult circumstances. I credit this effort with \nsaving many lives which otherwise would have been lost to malnutrition \nand illness. Having gone to Sarajevo twice, I saw first-hand the \nefforts of UNPROFOR and UNHCR personnel.\n  The Dole-Lieberman resolution sets a responsible course toward \nachieving a goal of recognizing the sovereign right of a nation and its \npeople to self-defense. The U.N. Charter so provides. Common law, \ncommon sense so provides.\n  Mr. President, until recently I had held out hope that a settlement \ncould be successfully negotiated by the international community to end \nthe conflict in Bosnia. It is now obvious that the numerous attempts by \nthe United Nations, the\n European union, and the contact group, with U.S. participation, to \nresolve the differences over Bosnia have been thwarted. Despite the \nbest efforts and sacrifices of the U.N. peacekeepers, it is clear that \nUNPROFOR is no longer capable of fulfilling its mandate, there simply \nis no peace to keep. What further evidence do we need, given the \nattacks on the undefended ``safe havens.''\n\n  Mr. President, administration officials have just completed their \nsecond weekend of discussions with our allies and Russia over the \nsituation in Bosnia. And what are the results of those discussions? \nMore warnings of military action by the international community. This \nform of deterrence has repeatedly failed. Consequently, the Bosnian \nSerbs have intensified their attacks against Sarajevo and the other \nsafe havens. Each day, more death and destruction occurs in Bosnia. The \nSenate must act.\n  The most recent tragic aggressions by the Bosnian Serbs against the \nso-called safe havens close the door on the valiant efforts of the U.N. \npeacekeeping mission. There remains, in most regions of Bosnia, no \npeace to keep. The Bosnian Serb attacks on Srebrenica, Zepa, Bihac, and \nSarajevo are a clear illustration of the futility of continuing on the \npresent course. It is now time for the international community to make \nthe decision to withdraw the UNPROFOR troops, and to proceed with that \nwithdrawal in an orderly manner. To continue with the status quo--or \neven worse, to reinforce that status quo, as is being contemplated by \nthe administration--would bring additional humiliation to the \ninternational community, and no hope for an end to the suffering of the \nBosnian people.\n  While I continue to have concerns about the possible adverse effects \nof lifting the arms embargo, I believe that this is the best of the \nremaining available options. For a variety of reasons, the \ninternational community has \n\n[[Page S 10606]]\nnot been able or willing to take the actions necessary to bring an end \nto the conflict in Bosnia. We should at least be willing to allow the \nBosnians to acquire the weapons they need to defend themselves, in \naccordance with international law. This is what the Bosnian Government \nhas been asking for. The United Nations should not continue to stand in \ntheir way.\n  Let us examine some of the main arguments that the administration has \nbeen making against the Dole-Lieberman resolution. First, we have heard \nrepeatedly from administration officials that this resolution will \nforce a withdrawal of UNPROFOR. To the contrary, no action will be \ntaken under the authority of this resolution until all UNPROFOR \npersonnel have been withdrawn\n from Bosnia. We are not asking UNPROFOR to leave. We are certainly not \nrequiring UNPROFOR to leave. We are simply saying that when UNPROFOR \ndoes depart, the Bosnian Government should be allowed to acquire the \nweapons it needs to defend its people and territory.\n\n  Second, the claim is made that this resolution will Americanize the \nwar. I disagree. A U.S. move to lift the arms embargo will not \nAmericanize the war unless we allow that to happen with subsequent \naction--that is, if we subsequently commit ourselves to equip and train \nthe Bosnian army, and provide them with air support. The resolution \nbefore us specifically states that,\n\n       Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as \n     authorization for deployment of United States forces in the \n     territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina for any purpose, \n     including training, support, or delivery of military \n     equipment.\n\n  In my view, we are in far greater danger of seeing this war become \nAmericanized if we carry through with proposals--as reported in weekend \npress reports--to conduct aggressive airstrikes against Bosnian Serb \npositions as part of the defense of Gorazde. This policy is very ill-\nadvised. Americans will become directly involved in combat at that \npoint--we will be combatants. We are taking sides in this conflict. \nAmerican lives will be at risk--and for what purpose? To shore up a \nU.N. peacekeeping mission which has reached its end.\n  Mr. President, history has shown that the use of air power alone is \nnot enough to win a war--it is not decisive without a proportional \nground effort. It sounds appealing--it sounds like a cleaner, less \nrisky military operation than ground combat. But it simply will not \nturn the tide of a battle. What clearer precedent do we need than the \ngulf war. For weeks prior to ground operations, air was used, used to \nlessen--not eliminate--the task of ground operations that followed.\n  During the gulf war, we spent weeks of massive, unrelenting air \nstrikes against Iraqi targets in both Kuwait and Iraq. But that was not \nenough to force an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. It took a large-scale \nground operation to secure final victory in that conflict. Further, \nthis air operation was carried out under terrain and weather conditions \nfar, far superior to those in Bosnia.\n  And in Bosnia we have additional complicating factors which were not \npresent in the gulf war. First, there are over 28,000 U.N. troops and \nuncalculated numbers of U.N. civilians scattered throughout Bosnia. \nOnce we start offensive air operations, and become combatants, we are\n subjecting those U.N. troops and civilians to retaliatory action by \nthe Serbs. How will we react when the Bosnian Serbs, once again, take \nhostages?\n\n  Past tactics of the Bosnian Serb forces was to colocate heavy weapons \nwith the civilian population in Bosnia--next to schools, hospitals, and \nother population centers. Any NATO air strikes would run a very high \nrisk of causing collateral damage. How will we react when we see \npictures on CNN of Bosnian children who have been killed or wounded by \nNATO air strikes?\n  And finally, there is the problem the command and control \narrangements which have reigned in Bosnia--the so-called dual-key \narrangement. This dual-key usage by United Nations officials in Bosnia \nhas resulted in less effective military action in response to Serb \naggression. This is of greatest concern to all those worried about the \nsafety of United States airmen flying missions over Bosnia--this dual-\nkey arrangement has prevented preemptive air strikes to take out the \nBosnian Serb air defense system. Scott O'Grady can tell you about the \nconsequences of that failure. Will the dual key still be the order of \nthe day if we proceed with the air operations agreed to over the \nweekend? Early reports seem to indicate that that indeed will be the \ncase. Will the Bosnian Serb air defense network be eliminated before \nUnited States pilots again take to the skies over Bosnia?\n  We should not fool ourselves into believing that an air campaign to \nsave Gorazde--this late in the game--will turn the tide in Bosnia. What \nabout the remaining safe havens, other than Gorazde? We should not \nallow ourselves to become directly involved in the fighting, \nparticularly when there is no clear unanimity among our allies about a \ncourse of action.\n  Mr. President, since the beginning of this conflict, I have \nconsistently opposed the use of United States military force as a \npossible solution to the war in Bosnia. Events of recent weeks have \nreinforced this view. I do not want to see American lives expended in \ntrying to resolve a conflict that is based on centuries-old religious \nand ethnic hatreds which none of us can understand or in any way can \njustify.\n  At this point, we should recognize that the United Nations mission \nhas failed, and allow the Bosnians to do what they have been asking \nfor--to acquire the weapons they need to defend themselves against Serb \naggression.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters from the \nBosnian Prime Minister, and a letter from President Clinton be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            The Republic of Bosnia\n\n\n                                              and Herzegovina,\n\n                                                    July 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: Today, the United Nations allowed the \n     Serb terrorists to overrun the demilitarized ``safe area'' of \n     Srebrenica. Helpless civilians in this area are exposed to \n     massacre and genocide. Once and for all, these events \n     demonstrate conclusively that the United Nations and the \n     international community are participating in genocide against \n     the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       The strongest argument of the opponents of the lifting of \n     the arms embargo toppled today in Srebrenica. They claimed \n     that the lifting the arms embargo would endanger the safety \n     of the safe areas. The people in Srebrenica are exposed to \n     massacre precisely because they did not have weapons to \n     defend themselves, and because the United Nations did not \n     want to protect them. Attacks are also under way against the \n     other safe areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       That is why we think it is extremely important that the \n     American Senate votes to lift the arms embargo on the \n     legitimate Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       If the Government of the United States of America claims \n     that it has no vital interests in Bosnia, why then does it \n     support the arms embargo and risk being associated with \n     genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n       It is essential that the elected representatives of the \n     American people immediately pass the bill to lift the arms \n     embargo. This will provide a clear message that the American \n     people do not want to deprive the people of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina of the right to defend themselves against \n     aggression and genocide.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Dr. Haris Silajdzic,\n     Prime Minister.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Office of the Prime \n           Minister,\n                                                    July 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dole and Lieberman: I write you today to once \n     again appeal to the American people and Government to lift \n     the illegal and immoral arms embargo on our people.\n       Today's vote is a vote for human life. It is a vote for \n     right against wrong. It is not about politics, it is about \n     doing the right thing.\n       In just the past two days in Sarajevo, 20 people have been \n     killed while more than 100 have been wounded.\n       Brutal, unceasing attacks against the so-called UN safe \n     areas of Zepa and Bihac are taking their toll on the lives of \n     our civilians. The defenders of Zepa have heroically defied \n     the aggressors and fight on and are ready to accept a \n     collective suicide rather than submit to the atrocities we \n     witnessed in the former UN safe area of Srebrenica--from \n     where 10,000 people are still unaccounted for.\n       Yesterday, the Bangladeshi UNPROFOR battalion in Bihac \n     requested air-strikes to \n\n[[Page S 10607]]\n     deter and to stop the Serb attacks on Bihac. The Serb forces are \n     attacking from Serb-occupied Croatia, Serb-occupied Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina with the full participation and backing of the \n     so-called Yugoslav Army of Serbia-Montenegro. The Bangladeshi \n     request was ignored--I ask myself if this same request would \n     be ignored if it were requested by a British battalion.\n       This fact, and the silence about the continuing slaughter \n     in Zepa, Sarajevo and Gorazde only further shows the \n     impotence of the UN and international community which \n     continues to hide behind the fig-leaf of consensus and \n     consultations. News agencies have even reported that members \n     of the French government want to change the map of the \n     Contact Group's peace plan. The reports of these concessions \n     air the same day that those to whom the concessions are to be \n     given, Karadzic and Mladic, are indicted for war crimes by \n     the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague.\n       I wonder how many more Bosnian children must be killed, how \n     many more Bosnian women must be raped, how many more Bosnian \n     men and boys must be executed, how many more Bosnian families \n     must be destroyed, how many more Bosnians must die while \n     waiting in line for water before something is done? The \n     current policies have failed. They died with Srebrenica. \n     There is no line that the Serbs will not cross. It is clear \n     that they will not stop until there are no more Bosnian \n     people in Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n       Today, the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina received \n     humanitarian aid from a joint Jordanian-Israeli delegation. \n     This act between former enemies shows that Bosnia is not a \n     question of politics and real politik but of humanity. The \n     carnage we have endured thus far is inhumane.\n       I must reiterate that the arms embargo is an issue of human \n     life and that it is time to do the right thing. It is not an \n     issue of politics nor of excuses such as training or \n     containment or ``Americanization'' or linkage to other \n     international regimes and decisions. The arms embargo is \n     illegal, it is a failed policy, it is immoral, it is in the \n     interest of only the Serbian war machine, and it is a tool \n     for genocide. The arms embargo is a matter of right and wrong \n     and it must end.\n       Our people ask that we be allowed only our right to defend \n     ourselves. It is on their behalf that I appeal to the \n     American people and government to untie our hands so that we \n     may protect ourselves. The slaughter has gone far enough. My \n     people insist that they would rather die while standing and \n     fighting than on their knees. In God's name we ask that you \n     lift the arms embargo.\n           Sincerely,\n     Haris Silajdzic.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, July 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I am writing to express my strong \n     opposition to S. 21, the ``Bosnia and Herzegovina Self-\n     Defense Act of 1995.'' While I fully understand the \n     frustration that the bill's supporters feel, I nonetheless am \n     firmly convinced that in passing this legislation Congress \n     would undermine efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement in \n     Bosnia and could lead to an escalation of the conflict there, \n     including the possible Americanization of the conflict.\n       There are no simple or risk-free answers in Bosnia. \n     Unilaterally lifting the arms embargo has serious \n     consequences. Our allies in UNPROFOR have made it clear that \n     a unilateral U.S. action to lift the arms embargo, which \n     would place their troops in greater danger, will result in \n     their early withdrawal from UNPROFOR, leading to its \n     collapse. I believe the United States, as the leader of NATO, \n     would have an obligation under these circumstances to assist \n     in that withdrawal, involving thousands of U.S. troops in a \n     difficult mission. Consequently, at the least, unilateral \n     lift by the U.S. drives our European allies out of Bosnia and \n     pulls the U.S. in, even if for a temporary and defined \n     mission.\n       I agree that UNPROFOR, in its current mission, has reached \n     a crossroads. As you know, we are working intensively with \n     our allies on concrete measures to strengthen UNPROFOR and \n     enable it to continue to make a significant difference in \n     Bosnia, as it has--for all its deficiencies--over the past \n     three years. Let us not forgot that UNPROFOR has been \n     critical to an unprecedented humanitarian operation that \n     feeds and helps keep alive over two million people in Bosnia; \n     until recently, the number of civilian casualties has been a \n     fraction of what they were before UNPROFOR arrived; much of \n     central Bosnia is at peace; and the Bosnian-Croat Federation \n     is holding. UNPROFOR has contributed to each of these \n     significant results.\n       Nonetheless, the Serb assaults in recent days made clear \n     that UNPROFOR must be strengthened if it is to continue to \n     contribute to peace. I am determined to make every effort to \n     provide, with our allies, for more robust and meaningful \n     UNPROFOR action. We\n      are now working to implement the agreement reached last \n     Friday in London to threaten substantial and decisive use \n     of NATO air power if the Bosnian Serbs attack Gorazde and \n     to strengthen protection of Sarajevo using the Rapid \n     Reaction Force. These actions lay the foundation for \n     stronger measures to protect the other safe areas. \n     Congressional passage of unilateral lift at this delicate \n     moment will undermine those efforts. It will provide our \n     allies a rationale for doing less, not more. It will \n     provide the pretext for absolving themselves of \n     responsibility in Bosnia, rather than assuming a stronger \n     role at this critical moment.\n       It is important to face squarely the consequences of a U.S. \n     action that forces UNPROFOR departure. First, as I have \n     noted, we immediately would be part of a costly NATO \n     operation to withdraw UNPROFOR. Second, after that operation \n     is complete, there will be an intensification of the fighting \n     in Bosnia. It is unlikely the Bosnian Serbs would stand by \n     waiting until the Bosnian government is armed by others. \n     Under assault, the Bosnian government will look to the U.S. \n     to provide arms, air support and if that fails, more active \n     military support. At that stage, the U.S. will have broken \n     with our NATO allies as a result of unilateral lift. The U.S. \n     will be asked to fill the void--in military support, \n     humanitarian aid and in response to refugee crises. Third, \n     intensified fighting will risk a wider conflict in the \n     Balkans with far-reaching implications for regional peace. \n     Finally, UNPROFOR's withdrawal will set back prospects for a \n     peaceful, negotiated solution for the foreseeable future.\n       In short, unilateral lift means unilateral responsibility. \n     We are in this with our allies now. We would be in it by \n     ourselves if we unilaterally lifted the embargo. The NATO \n     Alliance has stood strong for almost five decades. We should \n     not damage it in a futile effort to find an easy fix to the \n     Balkan conflict.\n       I am prepared to veto any resolution or bill that may \n     require the United States to lift unilaterally the arms \n     embargo. It will make a bad situation worse. I ask that you \n     not support the pending legislation, S. 21.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am happy at long last to join my \ndistinguished colleague from Connecticut on this issue. For roughly \n2\\1/2\\ years I have been in strong opposition to the efforts by the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, and his coauthor of this \nmeasure, the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, recalling that \nduring the gulf war operation when I was the principal sponsor of the \nresolution adopted by the Senate, my distinguished colleague from \nConnecticut was my principal cosponsor on that. So once again we have \njoined.\n  I wish to make very clear, Mr. President, I join for the very clear \nreason that the majority leader and the Senator from Connecticut \nchanged in a very material way the approach they had initiated some \n2\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  I think it is well worth the time of the Senate to focus on exactly \nwhat those changes were that led this Senator--and I now believe a \nmajority of the Senate--to join in this. As a matter of fact, I am \nhopeful that close to 70 Senators will eventually join on this. I know \nmy colleague from Connecticut and I and many others have talked among \nourselves. These are the conditions that have materially changed this \napproach, in such a manner that it now gains the support of the \nmajority of the Senate and indeed many of us. These are the conditions \nunder which the United States will terminate the embargo. I read from \nthe measure which is at the desk:\n\n       Termination. Section 4. The President shall terminate the \n     United States embargo of the Government of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina as provided in subsection (b) following:\n       1. Receipt by the U.S. Government of a request from the \n     Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina for termination of the \n     United States arms embargo and submission by the Government \n     of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in exercise of its sovereign \n     rights as a nation, of a request to the United Nations \n     Security Council for the departure of UNPROFOR from Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina.\n\n  That is a very dramatic change. The initiative is on the Government, \nthe recognized Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to first petition \nthe United States and/or to petition the United Nations for the \ndeparture of UNPROFOR.\n  The second condition under which our President is authorized to act:\n\n       A decision by the United Nations Security Council or \n     decisions by countries contributing forces to UNPROFOR to \n     withdraw UNPROFOR from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n  That is very clear. It is an exercise of sovereign rights.\n  Now, the Senate received today a letter from the President of the \nUnited States addressed to the leadership. I have now had an \nopportunity to review that letter, and I regret to say that it is \nwritten as though the author had not read what is before the Senate \ntoday. \n\n[[Page S 10608]]\nThis letter now appears in the Record in its entirety, and I say to \nthose who wish to take the time to examine it--and I hope all Senators \nwill--it is a communication from the President of the United States to \nthe leadership of the Senate in which he acknowledged that there are no \nsimple or risk-free answers in Bosnia. But he goes on to recite a \nprocedure that has been abandoned by the proponents of this measure \nbefore the Senate and, it seems to me, does not recognize in sufficient \nclarity exactly what has been put forth to the Senate.\n  So I will address that in greater detail later, but I should now like \nto pose a question or so to my distinguished colleague.\n  The criticism leveled at the initiative proposed by the majority \nleader and the Senator from Connecticut centers around the term \n``Americanization'' and that if the Senate were to adopt this it would \nconstitute an invitation, an invitation to the Government of Bosnia to \ntake the initiative. My recollection is, having met with a series of \nGovernment officials, including the Prime Minister of Bosnia, they have \ncome and specifically asked, asked of individual Members of the Senate \nthat this be done in the exact fashion as is laid out in the measure \nbefore the Senate today. Am I not correct in this?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia is absolutely \ncorrect, in many ways. First, that the Bosnians have consistently asked \nthat the arms embargo be lifted. Second, they have been confronted with \nthis question: If you have to choose between lifting the embargo and \nthe U.N. forces remaining in Bosnia, which will you choose? And they \nhave said clearly lifting the embargo.\n  The language of this proposal before the Senate today is intended to \ngive some ear finally to the victims and give them the opportunity to \nrequest, and in that sense to formally require that they request, the \nUnited Nations leave if that is their judgment as a precondition for \nthe lifting of the embargo. And there are those who have said, well, \nthey want the United Nations to leave, but they really do not.\n  This says that the condition on which the embargo will be lifted is \nif the Government of Bosnia says officially, formally that they request \nthe United Nations to leave. Then the embargo will be lifted.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is a substantial change from the \noriginal proposition advanced by the majority leader and the Senator \nsome years ago?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator from Virginia is absolutely correct. If \nthe Senator will allow me, I just want to amplify on my answer to that \nquestion. It is a substantial change, and it is a change that has been \ninserted out of sensitivity both to our allies in Europe and other \nnations that have troops on the ground wearing the blue helmets of the \nUnited Nations. It is also an act of sensitivity and respect and \ndeference to colleagues within this Chamber and, in fact, to the \nadministration, which has expressed concern repeatedly on earlier \noccasions when the embargo lifting has been raised about the impact it \nwould have on our allies.\n  So we are saying here we owe it to our allies, who have had soldiers \nserving bravely in the most difficult of circumstances, essentially \nunarmed in a hostile situation, to give them the opportunity to get out \nof there before we lift the arms embargo.\n  I must say to my friend from Virginia that I am particularly \nperplexed, angered by some who now say that the trouble with this \nproposal, S. 21, as substituted before the Senate now, is that it will \nrequire the U.N. troops to leave as a precondition for lifting the \nembargo.\n  Well, we have put it in there, Senator Dole and I and others, to \nrespond to the concerns that these same critics offered, issued a year \nago or so, that just lifting the embargo was not respectful or fair to \nour allies and their brave soldiers on the ground. So the Senator is \nabsolutely correct; it is a substantial change from the earlier version \nof this proposal.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, a second question. I have had the \nopportunity to travel to this region four times with various Members of \nthe Senate. I was one of the very first to go into Sarajevo, and then I \naccompanied the distinguished majority leader to Sarajevo on a second \nvisit. At that time we met with President Izetbegovic, and then, of \ncourse, the Prime Minister personally has been here in the United \nStates I think on two occasions in the last 6 or 8 weeks. I do not \nrecall in the discussions--I repeat, I do not recall--that they laid \ndown any conditions whatsoever that would place an obligation upon the \nUnited States of America in the event this arms embargo is to be \nlifted.\n  Quite specifically, in my discussions regarding this matter with both \nthe Bosnian President and Foreign Minister, they refuted that there was \nany obligation on the part of the United States. However, the President \nof the United States in his letter implies that if such action were \ntaken as envisioned by the measure now before the Senate, there would \nbe, impliedly, so to speak, an obligation on the part of the United \nStates to provide arms, provide training and otherwise Americanize--\nthat is this trick phrase that has been utilized--this situation.\n  I ask my distinguished colleague, in the Senator's discussions with \nthe leadership of Bosnia, have they laid down to him any conditions \nwhatsoever that would either imply or infer or indeed directly involve \nthe United States in a period subsequent to the lifting of the embargo?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in responding to my colleague from \nVirginia, in all of the conversations I have had with the various \nrepresentatives and leaders of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina \nthere has never once been a condition set for the lifting of the arms \nembargo--never once a condition set. And that is again why I think some \nof those who argue against lifting now are using very stretched, \ntortured, circuitous logic. It is not the Bosnians who have requested \nthe United States to come in to help the United Nations out. It was \nobviously not the Bosnians who have made the commitment, a commitment \nwhich I think is appropriate, but that is for another day, to have \nAmerican troops go in and help the United Nations out.\n  The Bosnians have said consistently, ``We have the soldiers. Please \ngive us the weapons.''\n  Now, I will say, to give a complete answer to my friend, in recent \nconversations there have been occasions when the Bosnian leadership has \nrequested, but certainly not said it was an obligation, that the full \nlift-and-strike policy be implemented, which is to say that not only \nshould the arms embargo be lifted, but that they would be assisted in a \ntransitional period while they are receiving arms if NATO could use \nairpower to keep the Serb aggressors at bay. No obligation ever. In \nfact, I have said to them, because others have said it to me, I said, \n``You understand that people are saying to us, if you lift the arms \nembargo, there will be a bloodbath. You will demand that American \ntroops come in.'' They have said, ``No, Senator. Not only do we have \nenough troops on the ground, but how could there be a bloodbath any \nworse than we have already had? So we are ready to take the \nconsequences.'' No obligation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me refer to the letter dated July 25 \nfrom the President of the United States to the leadership. On page 2:\n\n       It is important to face squarely the consequences of a U.S. \n     action that forces UNPROFOR departure.\n\n  I will return to that allegation that this is forcing the departure.\n\n       First, as I have noted, we immediately would be part of a \n     costly NATO operation to withdraw from UNPROFOR.\n\n  And that is a matter that the President has addressed previously. And \nit is my understanding that the distinguished majority leader, the \nSenator from Connecticut, the Senator from Virginia, and others have \nindicated that once the framework of such participation by the United \nStates in assisting a withdrawal by UNPROFOR is brought to the Senate, \nit is likely that we will support it. Most likely. Certainly speaking \nfor myself.\n  But I proceed to the second point:\n\n       Second, after that operation is complete, there will be an \n     intensification of the fighting in Bosnia. It is unlikely the \n     Bosnian Serbs would stand by waiting until the Bosnian \n     government is armed by others. Under assault, the Bosnian \n     government will look to the U.S. to provide arms, air \n     support, and if that fails, more active military support.\n\n\n[[Page S 10609]]\n\n  My question to my colleague: Do you know of any documentation to \nsupport that assertion by the President of the United States? I do not.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, respectfully, I do not. Clearly they \nare hoping for arms in Bosnia. That is what they most desperately want \nand need. As I indicated earlier, their first choice is to receive them \nfrom former Warsaw Pact countries, not from us. Second, yes, they would \nlike air support in the transitional period. That is up to NATO. But \nthey have never asked for more active military support. In fact, \nSenator Dole and I, on every occasion we met with them, have said, \n``Please do not expect that American troops will end up on the ground \nfighting for you in Bosnia.'' And they have said over and over again, \n``Not only do we understand that, we do not want that.''\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. I \nfrankly call on the administration to provide the Senate with \ndocumentation to back that up because I find it contradictory to what \nthe President of Bosnia and the Prime Minister of Bosnia have \nrepresented to individual Senators in our private meetings. There may \nbe. There may be such documentation. But I think given that assertion \nin this letter to the leadership of this Senate, that that \ndocumentation should be brought to the attention of those of us who are \nactively supporting the measure.\n  Mr. President, I have a great deal to say, as I am sure others do, on \nthis subject. I see the distinguished Senator from California present \nin the Chamber. I know that we spoke earlier when I was consulting with \nher in the hopes that she would support the measure on the floor. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to indicate my intention to vote for the \nDole-Lieberman resolution. I want to state what my intent is, and what \nit is solely. My intent is solely to allow an afflicted people to \ndefend themselves.\n  Last week I stated that I had hoped that a specific course of action \nwould result from last weekend's meetings in London. The actions taken, \nunfortunately, are limited to one enclave, Gorazde. They are not well \ndefined, and as we have seen, the shelling of Gorazde has been ongoing \nsince last weekend.\n  Also, last week I spoke about the devastating photograph of a young \nBosnian woman who decided she could not go on and hung herself from a \ntree. This anonymous image spoke eloquently to me of the desperation \nfacing the Bosnian people as they endure rape, torture, summary \nexecution, and a litany of war crimes. However, no one knew who this \nwoman was, and to this day we still do not. But now at least we have an \nidea of what might have driven her to take her own life.\n  According to one witness, a young mother tried in vain to trade her \nlife for her 12-year-old twin boys who were taken from her and had \ntheir throats slit by the invading Serbs at Srebrenica. Later the \nmother tied a scarf to a tree limb and hung herself. Was this young \nmother the woman in the photograph? We may never know. But this story \ntells us all we need to know about what drives a person to such an \nextreme.\n  As the stories of the Srebrenica survivors have emerged, the picture \nof the suffering endured by the refugees and the atrocities committed \nby the attackers has become increasingly clear. I want to lay some of \nthese out because in recent days news reports and other sources have \nrevealed the true extent of the horror. Here are just a few examples.\n  On July 17, the New York Times reported several accounts of \natrocities related by refugees. Two women, Hava Muratovic and Hanifa \nMasanovic, told nearly identical stories of Serb soldiers, dressed in \nuniforms of U.N. soldiers, breaking into a factory where some refugees \nwere staying and hauling away a group of teenage boys.\n  According to Mrs. Muratovic: ``The next morning I saw a pile of \nbodies next to the water fountain. There were about ten of them, all \nwith their throats cut. There was a tree next to the fountain, and two \nother bodies were hanging from the branches.''\n  Another woman, Sveda Porobic, told of three apparent rapes. In \nanother factory where refugees were gathered, Bosnian Serb soldiers, \ndressed as U.N. peacekeepers, no less, came through the factory and \ndragged away two girls, ages 12 and 14, and a 23-year-old woman. After \nseveral hours, the three returned. They were crying, naked and \nbleeding, covered with scratches and bruises. One said, very simply, \n``We are not girls anymore.''\n  On July 16 the Washington Post reported that a teenage girl found a \nstack of bodies of young men behind a factory. They had been shot with \ntheir hands tied behind their backs. Near the same factory, two other \nteenagers witnessed 20 men gunned down by a Serb firing squad.\n  Three days later, on July 19, just last week, USA Today quoted a \nBosnian refugee, Zarfa Turkovic, who said she witnessed a brutal gang \nrape at the U.N. camp in Potocari, where refugees had gathered. She \nsaid that four Serb soldiers grabbed a young woman from among the \nsleeping refugees. ``Two took her legs and raised them up in the air,'' \nTurkovic said, ``while the third began raping her. People were silent. \nNo one moved. She was screaming and yelling, begging them to stop.'' \nThe rapists stuffed a rag in her mouth and continued raping her.\n  Since the day that Srebrenica fell, the U.N. High Commission for \nRefugees has been caring for Bosnian refugees fleeing the Serb armies. \nIn Tuzla, UNHCR has been responsible for providing food and shelter to \nthousands of refugees in the last week and a half.\n  On July 18, the U.N. High Commission for Refugees released a report \ndescribing the experiences of a number of refugees, based on interviews \nwith those who arrived in Tuzla. I would like to relate a few of the \nmost disturbing examples.\n  A 60-year-old man and his wife described how the bus that was \ncarrying them to Tuzla was stopped by Serb soldiers. The soldiers took \nfour young women off the bus and into the woods. An hour later, three \nof the women emerged from the woods. The fourth woman appeared later in \nthe town of Kladanj, naked, with only a blanket wrapped around her.\n  Buses were stopped by Serb soldiers a number of times along the road \nto Kladanj. Men and boys over age 12 were taken away, along with many \nyoung women. Most have not been seen since.\n  Most alarmingly, a group of refugees fleeing Srebrenica on foot \nthrough the woods encountered a group of Serb soldiers wearing the \nuniforms and blue helmets of UNPROFOR troops and using U.N. vehicles. \nOne Serb soldier called out on a megaphone for the Bosnians to come out \nof the woods. Between 20 and 30 Bosnians, mostly women and children, \nemerged from hiding. The Serb soldiers lined them up on the road, and \nopened fire with machine guns, killing them all.\n  None of these reports has been independently confirmed, but based on \nthe facts available, these stories are compelling, believable, and \nconsistent with documented Serb behavior. There have also been many \ninstances of refugees telling identical stories independently.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the \nUNHCR report be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. In recent days, we have seen more substantiated \nreports of atrocities. Dutch peacekeepers present in Srebrenica have \nreported witnessing summary executions of Bosnian soldiers. The U.N. \nhuman rights envoy told reporters that ``what happened (in Srebrenica) \ncannot be described as moderate violations of human rights, but as \nextremely serious violations on an enormous scale.''\n  Yesterday, the Bosnian Foreign Minister called me from Zagreb. He \ntold me that as many as 10,000 people are still missing from \nSrebrenica, and that of the 6,000 Bosnian men and boys held hostage in \na stadium in Bratunac, north of Srebrenica, as many as 1,600 have been \nexecuted.\n  Most startlingly, he indicated that last Monday, the Bosnian \nPresident offered to peacefully evacuate Zepa. This \n\n[[Page S 10610]]\noffer was turned down by General Mladic. I believe we know the reason.\n  If the evacuation had taken place peacefully and under U.N. \nsupervision, it would have deprived the Serbs of the opportunity to \ndetain and kill all the men of fighting age, and the opportunity to \nrape, torture, and humiliate defenseless refugees.\n  To me, it is unfathomable that crimes like these can be perpetrated \nin 1995, 50 years after the liberation of Auschwitz. The names Karadzic \nand Mladic will go down in history with the greatest villains of our \ntime. They have led a regime that sanctions, promotes, and encourages \nits soldiers to murder, torture, rape, and humiliate innocent Bosnian \ncivilians. They are evil.\n  Today, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia \nannounced indictments of both Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic for war \ncrimes. It is my hope that both these men, and numerous other war \ncriminals, will be successfully prosecuted.\n  I know that every Member of the Senate is outraged by the barbaric \nbehavior that has taken place. But for the Bosnian victims of these \ncrimes, our outrage is worth little, unless it leads to action. In the \nface of these atrocities, we must make an important decision.\n  Our choices are clear: we must either dramatically change the U.N. \noperation on the ground in such a way that it will be able to protect \nBosnian citizens from Bosnian Serb murderers and rapists; or, we must \nlift the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government, unilaterally if \nnecessary, in order to allow the Bosnians to defend themselves.\n  But there is one thing we cannot do, and that is nothing.\n  Last week, Secretary of Defense Perry, Secretary of State \nChristopher, and General Shalikashvili met in London with our NATO \nallies. They were attempting to devise a response to the collapse of \nSrebrenica and Zepa that will prevent and punish further Bosnian Serb \nattacks on safe areas and defend the civilians in those areas.\n  Before these meetings began, I felt that in order to be successful, \nthey would have to succeed in radically changing the mission and \nmandate of the allied troops on the ground in Bosnia, giving them the \nwherewithal and command structure to fight effectively that they have \nlacked thus far.\n  Unfortunately, I do not feel that the agreements reached in London \nmeet that test. I have spoken with the Secretary of State. I have \nspoken with our Ambassadors in London and Paris. And I have spoken at \nlength with the Foreign Minister of Bosnia. All of these conversations \nhave solidified my view that there has not been a sufficient change in \nthe situation on the ground.\n  The London meetings only addressed the enclave of Gorazde. It is true \nthat a fairly resolute statement was issued regarding a Serb offensive \non Gorazde. Substantial allied airstrikes will be ordered in response \nto any attack on Gorazde.\n  What constitutes a Serb assault on Gorazde? Is this present shelling \nthat has been going on since the London Conference enough to provoke \naction? Does a siege that cuts off the flow of humanitarian aid warrant \nairstrikes? Gorazde has in fact been shelled continuously since the \nLondon conference. Why have the airstrikes not begun?\n  Unfortunately, the promised defense of Gorazde only means that the \nSerbs will continue their attacks at Zepa, which I understand has \nfinally fallen, Bihac, then Sarajevo, and Tuzla, and then what? In \nfact, the fate of Bosnia is sealed if the enclaves fall--for only 30 \npercent of Bosnia remains in government hands today.\n  As we debate this resolution, Bihac is surrounded and under attack. \nIn this offensive, the Bosnian Serbs are receiving assistance from \ntheir Croatian Serb brethren--25,000 Croatian Serbs are coming over the \nborder to augment the attacking forces. Bihac has received no food \nconvoys for two months, and relief flights have been suspended because \nof the shelling. There is virtually no food left in Bihac, and \nresidents are able to eat only what they can grow.\n  As for Sarajevo, it is perhaps the most important of all the \nenclaves. Its fall would mean the end of Bosnia. Yet, Sarajevo was \nhardly mentioned in London. It is true that since the conference, \nBritish and French troops from the Rapid Reaction Force have deployed \naround Sarajevo to respond to Serb shelling. But their mission, it \nseems, is primarily to protect U.N. forces. Earlier, in our caucus, the \nSecretary of State indicated that these troops would respond to Serb \nattacks on the civilian population. I certainly hope so.\n  As the Bosnian Foreign Minister told me, drawing a line in the sand \naround Gorazde alone is like drawing a line in the sand around one \nsolitary sunbather on a beach. It may protect that one sunbather, but \nit ignores everything else on the beach.\n  Third, it is not at all clear that the United States and our allies \nhave the same understanding about the agreements reached in London. \nWhile British Foreign Secretary Rifkind, promised a ``substantial and \ndecisive'' response to any Serb attack on Gorazde, only U.S. officials \nmentioned the certainty of airstrikes.\n  Furthermore, it is entirely clear that Russia does not support a \npolicy based on the use of airstrikes to contain the Bosnian Serbs. \nForeign Minister Kozyrev went out of his way to say that ``no \nconsensus'' had been reached in London. How Russia would respond to a \npolicy that it does not support is uncertain. This uncertainty may well \nprove dangerous.\n  I had hoped that the London meetings would have initiated a genuine \nchange to the situation on the ground in Bosnia. I wanted to be \nconvinced. But with the weight of all the evidence, I am afraid the \nLondon conference appears inconclusive, and that the status quo will \ncontinue.\n  The London meetings do not produce a new course of action, and did \nnot commit the allies to protect the Bosnians. I am convinced that we \nhave no choice but to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnians. I \nprefer that it be a multilateral lifting. It has become painfully clear \nnow that no one will defend the Bosnians except the Bosnians \nthemselves. If no one will defend them, we can no longer deny them the \nright to defend themselves. And so, I intend to support the Dole-\nLieberman resolution.\n  Last year, I opposed a similar resolution, in large part because it \ncontained a policy of ``lift and leave''. It would have forced the \nPresident to lift the arms embargo unilaterally before any effort had \nbeen taken to extract UNPROFOR from Bosnia. I felt that was unfair to \nour allies, who have troops on the ground there.\n  The resolution before us has gone a long way toward addressing those \nconcerns. It now contains a ``leave and lift'' sequence, which is very \nimportant. The President would not be required to lift the arms embargo \nuntil 12 weeks after UNPROFOR began its withdrawal, and that period \ncould be extended in 30 day increments if the withdrawal took longer \nthan expected. I believe that this change alters the effect of the \nresolution considerably.\n  This is a time for the entire world to feel outraged at the \natrocities now being carried out with merciless abandon.\n And where is the conscience of the world? In fact, much of the world \ngenuinely wants to help. Today, for example, a joint delegation from \nIsrael and Jordan are meeting in Bosnia to see what they can do to \nhelp.\n\n  Let there be no mistake--we are watching the development of a \n``Fourth Reich'' dedicated to the genocide of a people simply because \nthey are different. To me, after the events of the past 3 years, there \nis little difference--except in size--between the drive for a pure \nAryan nation 50 years ago, and that for an ethnically cleansed Greater \nSerbia of today.\n  The Bosnian Foreign Minister put it to me so eloquently yesterday \nwhen he said:\n\n       No one has taken on the job of defending the Bosnian \n     people. UNPROFOR is not a substitute for our defense, and the \n     Rapid Reaction Force is committed only to defend UNPROFOR. We \n     must know that somebody is going to defend us--and that \n     somebody is only us.\n\n  An afflicted people must have the right to defend themselves. This \nresolution signals no more and no less.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n    United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) Preliminary \n                 Protection Report No. 1 July 18, 1995\n\n       The following is a report based on initial interviews \n     conducted with displaced people who fled Srabrenica after it \n     was overrun by Serb forces.\n     \n[[Page S 10611]]\n\n\n\n                        i. chronology of events\n\n       11 July--Serb forces overran Srabrenica after days of \n     intense artillery and mortar shelling. Residents and \n     displaced people flee burning houses and head for the Dutch \n     UNPROFOR Battalion in Potocari, about 10 km north of \n     Srabrenica. Others escape toward Sagna Finger on foot heading \n     for Tuzia. Serb forces enter Potocari in the afternoon and \n     disarm Dutch troops.\n       12 July--Serb forces began moving by bus people who had \n     escaped to Potocari to Klandanj, about 70 km away. From \n     there, the displaced were forced to move across 6 km of no \n     man's land. They were met across the other side by Bosnian \n     trucks and transported to the Tuzla Air Base. As the number \n     of people swells, UNPROFOR opens a camp settlement inside the \n     base.\n       13 July--Thursday Bosnian government agrees to move \n     displaced people massed outside the air base to collective \n     centers.\n       14 July--Government says the first elements of a column of \n     15,000 Bosnian soldiers, some of them accompanied by their \n     families arrive in the village of Medjedja after walking \n     across the forested Sapna finger. Four days later, the number \n     of people had reached 8,000. The arrivals were wearing rags \n     and mostly barefooted after their shoes were torn apart \n     during the march. The government says it expects more \n     soldiers and civilians to arrive in Madjedja and requested \n     UNHCR for food and non-food items.\n       18 July--ICRC evacuates to Tuzla 87 wounded from a hospital \n     in Bratunac and the Dutch medical facility at Potocari.\n\n\n                       ii. summary of narratives\n\n       2.1 Random interviews were conducted among arrivals at the \n     tent camp at the Tuzlaa airbase. At the outset, it must be \n     explained that none of the accounts could be independently \n     confirmed. The accounts include incidents of rape, robbery \n     and execution stories were told of families being separated \n     of men and women being taken away by Serb soldiers. Soldiers \n     who escaped across the Sapna finger say the encountered heavy \n     shelling, mine fields, ambushes and massacres along the way \n     to Sapna in which hundreds were either killed or captured.\n                            iii. interviews\n\n       1. From Potocari to Kladanj.\n       1.1 As civilians, mostly women and children, were fleeing \n     advancing Serb forces, shells fell everywhere along the road \n     to Potocari. One woman claims she saw scores of people killed \n     and wounded in the mortar and artillery barrages. Upon \n     reaching Potocari, the civilians gathered in and around the \n     Dutch battalion camp and in the surrounding abandoned \n     factories. Serb soldiers walked inside the camp and started \n     separating families. Men of fighting age and young women were \n     taken away, according to uniform accounts of the people \n     interviewed.\n       1.2 One woman says her husband was stabbed dead before her \n     eyes. She was dragged away to a bus but she managed to go \n     back to look for her husband. Later, she found his body at \n     the garage of a factory. Seven other bodies were lying there. \n     Other women say that as they were waiting to be boarded in \n     buses to Kladanj their husbands were taken away and that they \n     did not know what happened to them.\n       1.3 Two women interviewed say men were separated from women \n     as people were being loaded in the buses. They claim that \n     Serb soldiers demanded money from them, but gave nothing \n     since they didn't have any. One woman was separated together \n     with the men because she is a relative of a senior Bosnian \n     army officer.\n       1.4 The buses were stopped a number of times along the road \n     to Klandanj. Men who were allowed to leave after the first \n     screening were picked out of the buses and taken away. They \n     include boys aged 12 years and upward and young women.\n       1.5 A 60-year-old man and his wife say that in their bus, \n     four young women were taken out into the woods. An hour \n     later, only three of the women returned to the bus. The \n     fourth woman showed up in Kladanj naked with only a blanket \n     wrapped around her.\n       1.6 Not only were incidents of robbery narrated before the \n     people were put on the buses, but also as the convoys moved \n     toward Klandanj. Along the route, Serb soldiers would demand \n     the meager belongings and money from the passengers. One Serb \n     soldier slashed the upper lip of a woman who could not \n     produce money. Robbery also was allegedly committed as the \n     people were offloaded at Kladanj.\n       1.7 One man says he counted 11 bodies as he walked toward \n     Bosnian-controlled area along a six-kilometer stretch of no \n     man's land. He says they apparently were victims of robbery \n     attempts by Serb forces operating across the no-man's land.\n       1.8 Dead Bosnian men in civilian and military clothes were \n     seen scattered along the route to Kladanj. Groups of hundreds \n     of captured Bosnian soldiers, their hands behind the back of \n     their head were all along the route.\n       2. Escape to Sapna Finger.\n       2.1 Four soldiers interviewed say they were among a column \n     of 15,000 people, including 6,000 women and children, who \n     broke across Serb-controlled areas after Srebrenica fell. \n     They walked through 70 km of forests and faced heavy \n     shelling, land mines and ambushes. Hundreds were reportedly \n     killed and hundreds more were captured.\n       2.2 One soldier said the first ambush took place in \n     Jaglici, the day the column left Srebrenica. He says more \n     than 60 people were killed. At Konjevic Polja, the column \n     encountered Serb soldiers in UNPROFOR uniform and using UN \n     vehicles. One Serb soldier with a loudhailer called on the \n     Bosnians to come out. Between 20 to 30 Bosnians, mostly \n     children and women, who emerged out of hiding were lined up \n     on the road. Then the Serbs opened fire with machine guns, \n     killing all of them. The same soldier says he saw about 50 \n     Bosnian bodies beside a road toward Cereka. And in another \n     place later on, soldiers stepped on mine fields and that 150 \n     were reportedly killed there. At Udrio, 300 to 400 were \n     allegedly killed in an ambush. Another 300 to 600 were \n     reportedly captured. Three other soldiers gave similar \n     stories.\n       3. MEDEVAC.\n       3.1 Interviews were conducted with four male and five \n     female civilians who were evacuated by car from Srebrenica--\n     the Dutch facility at Potacari and the hospital in Bratunac--\n     by ICRC. They were among 87 brought to Tuzla at the Norwegian \n     medical center. The males were mostly soldiers who were \n     wounded during the fighting before the fall of Srebrenica and \n     were confined at the hospital there. After the Serbs took \n     control of the town, the patients said they were mistreated. \n     Serb soldiers and civilians entered their rooms a number of \n     times and kicked and beat them up. One 60-year-old man says \n     he was hit by a rifle butt in the chest.\n                                                    Alvin Gonzaga,\n                                               Protection Officer.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we wish to thank our distinguished \ncolleague from California for the very strong contribution to this \ndebate. I just want to draw on one point, to make sure I understood her \ncorrectly, because it coincides with my understanding, and that is that \nthe Secretary of Defense, when asked by the Senator, made it very clear \nthat these rapid reaction forces, primarily from France and Great \nBritain, which are coming there now, and pictures of which we saw \nmoving up into Sarajevo today, are there not to protect the civilians \nbut simply to facilitate a protective cover to the UNPROFOR forces as \nthey continue to struggle to perform their mission; is that correct?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I might comment through the Chair, \nwhat I learned from our caucus is that what my colleague has just \nstated is true in general, but there is some higher commitment in the \nSarajevo area. I am not certain of this, but I believe I understood the \nSecretary to say that they would defend against the shelling of \nSarajevo. I am sure someone will straighten this out for certain later \nin the debate, but that is what I understood today.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is another example of the difficulty \nmany of us are having in getting an accurate understanding of precisely \nwhat is the intended use of these forces. We have had hearings in the \nArmed Services Committee and repeatedly we have pressed for these \nanswers, and as yet we have not received them.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if I may respond very briefly to the \nquestion of the Senator from Virginia, I was in the same meeting and I \nthought the answer was unclear. I thought the Secretary of State said \nthat the rapid reaction forces in the vicinity of Sarajevo were capable \nof responding to attacks against the population there as well as \nagainst U.N. forces. But it was not clearly their authority to do so at \nthis point. And the news wires carry stories today of the British \ntroops that are there as part of the rapid reaction forces on the hills \naround Sarajevo saying that their understanding of their mission is to \nrespond only to attacks by the Serbs against them, against the U.N. \nforces, and not against the civilian population.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank our friend and colleague from \nCalifornia for a very powerful statement. It is not just that I am \nhonored she will support this legislation before us, but it is the \nstrength of the high road that she took in her statement, and I am very \ngrateful for it, and it encourages me as we begin this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me join our colleague from Connecticut \nin commending our colleague from California. Her speech was a very \nmoving speech. I think anybody who is not affected by her definition of \nthe problem, and the concerns she raised, clearly is not in touch with \nthe reality of this situation. \n\n[[Page S 10612]]\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution lifting the \narms embargo. I would like to explain why I believe that the arms \nembargo should be lifted, why I believe the United Nations forces \nshould be withdrawn, why I believe that the United States should not \nsend ground troops into Bosnia, and why I am convinced that the only \nsolution is to allow the Bosnians to have access to the arms that will \nallow them to defend themselves.\n  Let me start at the beginning. Like many Members of the Senate, I \nhave been to the Bosnian region. I have talked to the leaders of the \nvarious factions. I have talked to the American military leadership. \nAnd, like every Member of the Senate, I have sat in on endless \nbriefings about our situation in Bosnia and the options we have. I \nthink basically it all boils down to this: To be decisive in stopping \nthe killing in Bosnia would require at a minimum, according to our \nmilitary leadership, 85,000 combat troops. If the United States of \nAmerica sent 85,000 combat troops into Bosnia, there is no doubt about \nthe fact that in that environment, we would take casualties. And if the \nconflict rose in intensity, we could take a substantial number of \ncasualties.\n  I do not think there is any doubt that if we chose to, we would have \nthe military power to intervene. In the process, for the period when \nour intervention was active and where we had troops on the ground, \nthere is no doubt that we could temporarily change things in Bosnia. \nBut I think one thing that everyone who has looked at this conflict \nagrees on is that the day that America pulled out or the day that a \nlarger involvement by the United Nations was withdrawn, nothing \nfundamentally would have changed. And on that day, the conflict would \nreignite.\n  I think we all understand that if the United States intervened, or if \nwe participated in the intervention with our allies, then ultimately \nthe day would have to come when we would have to withdraw. I do not \nbelieve that the American people are convinced, given that we cannot \npermanently change a conflict that is 500 years old, that we can \njustify the loss of American life in Bosnia.\n  I do not believe that the American people support a massive ground \nintervention in Bosnia. I am opposed to it. I think it would be a \nmistake to send ground forces into Bosnia. I believe that the American \npeople oppose it with enough intensity that if we did intervene, as \nsoon as we started to lose American lives, then the pressure would \nmount for us to withdraw.\n  So where are we? I think we have a conflict that America cannot be \ndecisive in changing through our intervention for any more than a very \nshort period of time. It is not going to make me feel any better and I \ndo not think it will make the American people feel any better to add \nAmerican names to the casualty list in Bosnia.\n  I think the U.N. mission has failed. The safe havens are not safe. \nThere is no peace for the peacekeepers to keep. I believe the U.N. \nforces should be withdrawn.\n  I think to engage in intensified airstrikes would simply put us into \na position where, if they did not succeed, we would be drawn deeper and \ndeeper into this conflict. And everything we know about the region and \nthe effectiveness of airstrikes in a geographic area like Bosnia tells \nus that airstrikes are not likely to be decisive.\n  So what do I think the solution is? I do not think it is a very happy \nsolution. I think, first of all, we have to recognize that there are \nlimits of power and that, even though we are the most powerful country \nin the history of the world, even though we have greater military \ncapacity than any nation in the history of the world has ever had, we \ndo not have the ability to fix everything that is broken. We do not \nhave the ability to right every wrong, and we do not have the capacity, \ngiven the unwillingness of Americans to sacrifice American lives, to be \ndecisive in Bosnia.\n  Therefore, I think we should call on the United Nations to withdraw. \nI think we ought to lift the arms embargo. We ought to allow the \nBosnians to arm themselves and defend themselves. We have to realize \nthat foreign policy involving American military power is not like \nsocial work. It is not a situation in which we see something wrong in \nthe world and we decide to fix it.\n  It seems to me we have to ask two questions to guide us in our policy \nwith regard to Bosnia.\n  First of all, do we have a vital national interest in Bosnia? It is \ndifficult to listen to the distinguished Senator from California and \nanswer that question no. I think we do have an interest in what is \nhappening there. I think the whole world has an interest in it.\n  But the second test is, can we be decisive, through our intervention, \nin solving the problem? I think the answer to that question is, \nregrettably, no. I think our intervention in the short run on a massive \nscale could have a short-term impact. But the day we withdraw, the \nproblem is going to recur. I do not believe that the American people \nsupport the use of ground troops, and I do not support it.\n  We must recognize that while we have a national interest, and I think \ncivilization has an interest, I do not think we have the capacity to be \ndecisive in this conflict.\n  Finally, never, ever, under any circumstance, could I support sending \nU.S. troops into combat under U.N. command. It is an absolutely \nunworkable structure. The United Nations was never organized to conduct \nmilitary operations, and I, for one, am determined to see that under \nthe current structure of the United Nations or anything remotely \nsimilar to it, we do not put Americans into combat under U.N. command.\n   Let me, before I end, respond to a couple of points the \nadministration has made. The administration has argued that lifting the \nembargo Americanizes the war. I strongly disagree with that argument. I \nthink continuing to threaten to do things we are not going to do \nAmericanizes the war.\n  I think the Serbs understand that we are not going to send ground \ntroops into Bosnia. I think the Serbs understand that, at least to this \npoint, we have been unwilling to use massive air power because it would \nnot have been decisive and because a massive bombardment using American \nair power would have caused collateral damage, including killing \ninnocent civilians, that would clearly have been very large. Even as \nsophisticated as our weapons are, that is likely to happen.\n  Instead, we have continued to threaten things that do not menace the \nSerbians. What we have to do is level with our allies and level with \nourselves in saying some very simple things.\n  No. one, we are not going to send American ground troops into Bosnia. \nNo. two, the U.N. mission is a failure, and nothing that we are going \nto do is going to change that. The obvious thing to do, the \nhumanitarian thing to do, and in the long run the thing that is in the \ninterest of the people of Bosnia is to lift the arms embargo and give \nthe Bosnians the opportunity to defend themselves.\n  That is something that we are not going to do for them. The United \nNations has been unwilling and unable to do it for them. They \ndesperately want to do it for themselves. I cannot in good conscience \ndeny them the ability to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                            Bosnia Decisions\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we are considering legislation that would \nunilaterally lift the arms embargo against Bosnia on a date certain \nthat is established by actions outside the control of the United \nStates. A demand by the Bosnian Government for the United Nations \nProtection Force (UNPROFOR) withdrawal from Bosnia would cause the \nlifting of the United States embargo against the Bosnian Government. \nThe sponsor of this legislation, Senator Dole, and cosponsors and \nothers have argued that UNPROFOR is not effectively protecting the \nU.N.-declared safe areas--and I agree with that--and that it should be \nwithdrawn, allowing the Bosnian Government to defend itself and its \npeople.\n  But, Mr. President, this scenario does not fully reflect ongoing \ndevelopments. There is another option to what is clearly a failed U.N. \nmission, failed because no peacekeeping operation can succeed when \nthere is no peace to keep. Last Friday, representatives of the 16 \nnations comprising the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] met in \nLondon to hammer out a coordinated \n\n[[Page S 10613]]\nNATO response to the recent Serb aggression. That meeting has resulted \nin a new policy, the details of which are being finalized today. The \nmost important element of the policy is that our NATO allies are \nremaining in Bosnia. They have not seized upon excuses to quit the \nmorass that is Bosnia. Our European allies recognize that aggression in \nEurope feeds upon itself and must be met. They recognize that the \nspread of this cancer will eventually threaten the stability of NATO \nnations, through huge refugee flows, black market arms trading, and \neconomic instability. They are not leaving the refugees in the safe \nareas with no hope that the West cares about their fate. NATO is \nprepared to take action if Gorazde is attacked. As the discussion \nproceeds in NATO councils, we should soon know if the ``dual key'' \napproach to approving airstrikes will remain in its now modified form, \nor if--as I hope--the retaliatory strikes are to be fully in NATO's \ncontrol. My opinion is that now is the time for the U.N. bureaucracy to \ncompletely step aside.\n  This is a big change for U.N. and NATO policy in Bosnia, and one that \nis not recognized in the legislation we are debating. The U.N. \noperation in Bosnia has been castigated for not truly protecting the \nBosnian Moslem refugees in Srebrenica, Zepa, and other safe areas. It \nis certainly true that the United Nations was unable to keep those \ntowns from being overrun; just as it is true that Bosnian Government \nforces also failed to keep the towns from being overrun. Perhaps that \nis cause for some to call for the United Nations' withdrawal from \nBosnia. I am opposed to unilateral action by the United States. I \nsuggest that it is time to let NATO take over from the United Nations \nin Bosnia. That is the path that is being taken in the recent NATO \ndecisions.\n  NATO is a fighting force, while the United Nations is not. For the \nfour and a half decades since its inception in 1949, NATO has thrived \nas one of history's most successful alliances, serving as a defensive \nshield protecting its 16 members from a massive assault by Warsaw Pact \narmies. The fact that it has never had to fight the Warsaw Pact is \nperhaps proof of its effectiveness. In times of rivalry on trade and \ndiplomatic fronts, NATO has been a stabilizing factor in U.S.-European \nrelations, a forum where Western countries can air and coordinate \nimportant global policies of concern such as arms control, \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and instability in the \nregion. Now, it is proving to be a forum where, perhaps, a workable \nplan for the tragic situation in Bosnia can be hammered out and \nimplemented.\n  NATO troops are seasoned and practiced in joint operations. They have \nthe equipment, training, and rules of engagement to make them an \neffective enforcer of the decisions announced this weekend. The NATO \nmilitary command is establishing the command and control links and \ndecisionmaking rules to guide NATO operations in Bosnia in fulfillment \nof the decisions so recently made.\n  But NATO needs time, it needs the opportunity, to prove that it can \nbe more effective in Bosnia than the U.N. peacekeepers have been. I \nknow that proponents of this legislation will say that airstrikes have \nbeen tried before, and they have not worked. I do not deny that. But \nprevious retaliatory airstrike operations have been bound with so many \nrestrictions and such cumbersome lines of control as to be useless. \nPrevious airstrikes have required advance notice to the targets that \nwere to be hit. They have required a time-consuming and cumbersome \ndecisionmaking process that rendered the strikes toothless and not \ntimely. They have been conducted by flights of aircraft not necessarily \nsuited to the task at hand. And, they have been deterred by the \npresence of hostages at the sites to be bombed.\n  These restrictions do not appear to be the case in the retaliation \nthat has been outlined for NATO and by NATO. NATO retaliation will be \nswift, it will be at a time and place of NATO's choosing, it will not \nbe announced, and it may encompass any Serb military target, including \ncommand and control centers and headquarters. Our NATO allies with \nforces on the ground have even accepted the possibility that hostages \nmay be taken, and have pledged to continue on even in these difficult \nconditions. This is a far cry from the previous ineffective U.N.-\ncontrolled airstrikes.\n  Will this be easy? No, I do not think so. Is it important to support \nNATO in this effort? Yes. I think it is very important. Our NATO allies \nhave made two points clear: First, they are committed to taking action \nin Bosnia, and remaining engaged there. Second, they have made it clear \nthat United States actions to unilaterally lift the arms embargo would \nseriously damage the allied coalition on Bosnia. The United States has \nurged NATO to take on this larger role, and to become more active in \ndeterring aggression in Bosnia. They are doing it.\n  Mr. President, this legislation does not address the key issue, which \nis the role of NATO in keeping the peace on the European continent. It \npretends to lift an embargo that the United States has not enforced for \nmonths, due to compromise language worked out in last year's defense \nauthorization bill. Arms and funds to buy arms are making their way to \nthe Bosnian Government from sympathetic governments, just as arms are \nmaking their way to the Bosnian Serbs. A lifting of the United States \nembargo could very well be a prelude to greater American involvement in \nthis conflict. Following a formal lifting of the United States embargo, \nshall we expect to see legislation introduced to use U.S. taxpayer's \nfunds to supply arms to the Bosnian Government? Such legislation has \nbeen included in bills in the past, up to $200 million. Some $50 \nmillion in defense articles and services from the Department of Defense \nwas authorized to be provided to the Government of Bosnia in the Fiscal \nYear 1995 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill (Public Law 103-306), \nsubject to Presidential certification. This assistance even may prove \nnecessary, if action to lift the embargo weakens NATO's resolve and \nability to act in Bosnia. After all, why should our allies, who have so \nmuch more at stake in Bosnia, undertake such risks, when on the heels \nof their consensus, the United States adds a new unilateral element?\n  All of us sympathize with the suffering in Bosnia. Nobody sympathizes \nwith the suffering any more than I do. I am not blind to it. I hope \nthat the new NATO policy will be successful, and will finally let the \nBosnian Serbs know that they cannot defy the world, take more \nterritory, and displace residents in order to create an intolerant \nsociety. I simply cannot see how this legislation before us today \nimproves the situation for the Bosnian\n Government, or for the Bosnian people, or for the hope that the United \nStates and its allies can retain a united security policy.\n\n  It is this unilateral action that threatens to ``Americanize'' the \nconflict in Bosnia. If our actions here today on this measure \njeopardize the new NATO policy in Bosnia before that policy is \nimplemented and tested, we may have assumed some responsibility for the \nfurther deterioration of conditions in Bosnia. If our actions on this \nmeasure lead to our European allies quitting the field in Bosnia, then \nwe may feel more responsible for the fate of Bosnia. If we then begin \nto supply arms, and the Bosnian Government still fails to deter Serb \nadvances, and we are urged to supply training, and then intelligence, \nand then advisers, and then more powerful weapons, we will have chosen \na well traveled path--a path that in our own past has led to places \nlike Vietnam and Nicaragua. This is classic incrementalism. It is a \npoor substitute for decisive NATO action.\n  Active, decisive NATO operations to deter or retaliate against Serb \naggression will do more to support the Bosnian victims of aggression \nthan will an UNPROFOR withdrawal and a lonely battle fought only by the \nBosnian Government forces. With our European allies, the United States \nhas been involved from the beginning. It is better for Bosnia, and \nbetter for the United States, for the United States to act in concert \nwith our allies, rather than to act alone.\n  Mr. President, let us vote to give NATO a chance in a very complex \nand difficult situation. Let us not make that situation more complex \nand difficult. I intend to vote against this bill.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  \n[[Page S 10614]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the distinguished Senator from West Virginia yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  The premise, as I listened very carefully to the Senator's very \neloquent remarks, was that NATO be given the responsibility, given the \nresponsibility--and I copied it down correctly--to deter quite this \nsituation which would, first, be clearly taking sides.\n  The United States is an integral part of NATO, and that leads me to \nthe question, if NATO were to be given this authority, in my judgment, \nthat would immediately lead to the assumption that U.S. ground troops \nas an integral part of NATO forces called into the battle would then be \nsent into that conflict.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not agree with the Senator. He has a \nright to his opinion. He is a very able and long-time Member of the \nArmed Services Committee. I respect his viewpoint.\n  I am simply saying that the allies have determined on a course of \naction. I am saying that for us to adopt the measure that is before the \nSenate to unilaterally lift the embargo would be, in a way, jerking the \nrug out from under the allies. I am saying, let the allies take the \ncourse of action that they have taken, they have decided upon--we do \nnot have to pass this resolution today or tomorrow--but let us not take \naction here which may in the final analysis result in exactly what the \ndistinguished Senator has expressed concern against, and that is the \nuse of American fighting personnel in Bosnia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may ask a second question, if the \nresponsibility is turned over to NATO, what would be the likely \nreaction of Russia? Russia has a historical connection with Serbia and \nthe cultures associated with Serbia, and speaking for myself, I would \nwant to know exactly what their reaction would be before I say, ``NATO, \nyou take over this fight.''\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not suppose they will like it, but what will be the \nRussian reaction if we lift the embargo unilaterally? What will be \ntheir reaction to that?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think that has already been stated by \nRussia. They will revert to their historical ties to Serbia and in all \nprobability aid Serbia. But to give this situation over to NATO and let \nthem take such action, as I took notes here, I as yet have not seen any \ndecisive action. This is the whole problem--no decisive action thus far \nby NATO most likely as a consequence of the U.N. dual-key handle on the \nsituation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Which I am against.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand, Mr. President, very clearly that the \nSenator has made that point. But I do not see the circumstances under \nwhich--no matter how intriguing our distinguished colleague's \nsuggestion might be, I do not see the circumstances where this would be \nturned over to NATO. And if it were, then, in my opinion, we would have \nto participate as an integral partner in NATO both in the ground and in \nthe air and on the sea. That is my concern.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that even though I \nhold the floor, I may be permitted to ask a question of the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, is the Senator discouraged by the action \nthat will be taken by the NATO allies, the decision that was made by \nthe NATO allies on last Saturday and the follow-through which they are \nmaking today?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my answer to that----\n  Mr. BYRD. Is he not in concert with the decision that was made by the \nallies?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, most respectfully, I am not. I think that \nto begin a very serious air-bombing campaign of portions of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and possibly extending it on into areas bordering on if not \nSerbia--and that has been mentioned--is a very dangerous mission. What \nis to happen if hostages are taken during the course of this \nbombardment, not only hostages of the UNPROFOR but the U.N. forces \nthere associated with the food disposal and disbursements, and \ncivilians?\n  There has been a long history by the Bosnian Serbs, Mr. President, of \ncollocating with targets of opportunity, collocating innocent \ncivilians, of chaining hostages, of chaining hostages, Mr. President, \nto the likely targets. And I cannot see the United States being told or \nexercising leadership, bomb and bomb and bomb, while hostages are being \nchained and innocent civilians dragged into the collocation of those \ntargets.\n  Suppose you were a young American aviator and you were directed to \nbomb a target when you knew full well of the innocent people in the \nvicinity. Mr. President, that policy disturbs me greatly.\n  I thank my good friend and colleague. We have served here these many, \nmany years together, and on this we have a difference of view.\n  Mr. BYRD. We do have. Mr. President, I am sorry that the \ndistinguished Senator deplores the fact that the NATO allies have not \ntaken any action, and yet he also deplores the decision by the NATO \nallies on last Friday to take action. He says, why have they not taken \nany action? They have not had time to follow through on the decision.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, they have indicated a willingness to put \nthe rapid reaction force into positions where those forces can better \nprotect UNPROFOR, not stop in any way the killing, the raping of many, \nmany innocent civilians.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator has taken on more than a man-\nsized job now when he talks about stopping the raping and killing of \nthe innocents. That goes on here in the District of Columbia and \neverywhere else. And that has been going on in the area that we are \ntalking about for over 2,000 years. It was from that area that the \nRoman legions were able to get their best soldiers, in Pannonia and \nDalmatia, Illyria--the area more recently referred to as Yugoslavia--\nwhere, in A.D. 6, some 200,000 Dalmatians and Pannonians revolted and \nmassacred thousands of Roman citizens and Roman soldiers.\n  We are dealing with an extremely difficult problem here. It is not \ngoing to be dealt with overnight. And I am afraid--I simply say it is \nmy opinion. I may be wrong; I have been found wrong upon several \noccasions in my 77 years. I may be wrong this time. It is my opinion \nthat this is the wrong thing to do, to lift this embargo unilaterally.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for the \nopportunity to have a colloquy together.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think the colloquy between the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia and the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Virginia is probably as illustrative of the debate \nwe have here as anything. Without meaning to embarrass either of the \ndistinguished Senators, one from West Virginia and one from Virginia, \nthey are two of the most knowledgeable Members of this Senate, they are \ntwo people probably who have observed history, the use of force, the \ntrends in history and trends in the use of force as much as anyone, \ncertainly longer than the senior Senator from Vermont. It is indicative \nof the agonizing choice here that they are in disagreement on this. \nThey are two Senators respected by their colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle and respected by each other and yet they differ on this. That \nis a measure of the strong feelings we all feel about this desperate \nsituation.\n  It is indicative of the larger issues that underlie this debate. I \nworry, for example, about what will remain of NATO when this is over? \nThis is an issue that many of us feel, as does the Senator from \nVermont, should have been handled by NATO in the first instance, \nstarting several years ago. And NATO--which has been supported by the \nUnited States, maintained by the United States, in many ways led by the \nUnited States ever since the beginning of the cold war--NATO, when \nfaced with its first real challenge, a challenge to show leadership, a \nchallenge to deal forcefully with a conflict taking place right on \ntheir borders, they failed and failed miserably. And it is almost as \nthough the meetings in Brussels and the dinners in the chandeliered \ndining rooms and the discussions of \n\n[[Page S 10615]]\nthose driven around in limousines and saluted were more important than \nthe policy. And I worry that part of the damage of this whole sorry \nepisode in the former Yugoslavia, part of the damage may be a wounding \nof NATO itself. I am very concerned that NATO may not be as relevant as \nwe go into the next century, just 4\\1/2\\ years away.\n  I say this because I am one who does not assume that NATO is no \nlonger needed today, that the Soviet Union has completely disappeared. \nI am not ready to accept that. I certainly accept there have been \nmagnificent and significant changes in the former Soviet Union. But \nthose things that we feared about the Soviet Union, I would say to my \nfriend from Virginia and others, those things we feared I am not sure \nthey cannot reappear.\n  I applaud the things that have happened in Russia, for example, the \nopening of a far freer press. I certainly applaud the privatization \nthat is going on, the efforts toward openness and democracy. I \ncertainly hope these changes are permanent, and I have strongly \nsupported aid to the former Soviet Union to help them succeed in this \ndifficult transition. But I am not ready to accept that Russia is like \nour European allies who we have grown accustomed to throughout our \nlifetime. It is still a country with thousands and thousands of nuclear \nwarheads, a country still having difficulty deciding what kind of a \ngovernment it is going to have, and a country with many in positions of \npower who long for the good old days of Soviet privilege and power.\n  I do not say that to be overly pessimistic. But I am saying that if \nthe Western World is going to stand up for democracy, human rights, and \nthe civilian control of military power, then NATO is the place to show \nit. I worry much that NATO may have been so badly damaged by this \ndebacle that it will never recover its footing. I hope it does.\n  Throughout this debate on the Dole-Lieberman amendment to \nunilaterally lift the arms embargo against Bosnia, there have been \neloquent and persuasive arguments on both sides. I find myself torn. In \nfact, when similar resolutions as this came up in the past I found \nmyself actually supporting the other side at one point, something I \nrarely have done in 21 years. I can think of few issues in my 21 years \nabout which I have felt so conflicted.\n  I do think there are things we all agree on. The arms embargo which \nwas imposed by the United Nations Security Council with strong U.S. \nsupport was well-intentioned but, I believe, a tragic mistake. It was \nagreed to even before Bosnia declared its independence, at a time when \nvery few anticipated the disaster that has since befallen the former \nYugoslavia. While the embargo has not prevented Bosnian Moslems from \nobtaining arms on the black market, it has provided a military \nadvantage to the Serbs by denying the Bosnians access to tanks and \nheavy artillery.\n  We also agree that while both sides are guilty of atrocities against \ncivilians and prisoners of war, the Serbs have been responsible for the \noverwhelming majority of the atrocities, especially in their hideous \ncampaign of ethnic cleansing. We have heard of thousands of women and \ngirls raped, thousands of prisoners mutilated and summarily executed, \ncivilian targets shelled, even the wounded in hospitals taken out and \nshot.\n  If there is anything that would fit a definition of war crimes, it \nhas been these atrocities. We have watched as the Bosnian Serbs have \noverrun 70 percent of the territory previously occupied by Bosnian \nMoslems. Even today, Sarajevo and Bihac are under attack. That is \nbeyond dispute.\n  We also know that an American F-16 was shot down by a Serb missile. \nThere was absolutely no evidence that the NATO aircraft, which was \nenforcing the no-fly zone, posed any threats to the Serbs. But yet they \nshot it down.\n  I think we all agree that the status quo is completely unacceptable. \nUNPROFOR went to Bosnia to protect civilians, but they were never given \nthe mandate, the equipment, or the rules of engagement to do the job, a \njob they were asked to carry out under agreements worked out with \nparties that continuously lied and broke their word.\n  It was unconscionable to inject U.N. peacekeepers into a war where \nthere is no peace to keep and without adequate means to defend \nthemselves. We have watched as the United Nations and NATO have been \nhumiliated and weakened as Serb violations of U.N. resolutions were met \nwith silence. We have been disgusted as NATO, the most powerful \nmilitary alliance in recorded history, seemed impotent to respond \naggressively to these outrages.\n  We have watched helplessly as U.N. troops were taken hostage, abused, \nand even killed. Bosnians civilians accompanied by U.N. soldiers have \nbeen seized by Serb soldiers, been taken away and shot. The U.N. \nsoldiers have had to stand by and watch this, helpless to stop it. U.N. \nweapons and equipment have been flagrantly stolen.\n  The U.N. mission was to protect civilians. While UNPROFOR has saved \nlives, it has fallen far short of accomplishing its full mission. U.N. \nsafe areas have proven to be anything but safe. The U.N. dual-key \napproach turned out to be a terrible mistake.\n  Finally, I think there is widespread agreement that the response of \nthe West, including the United States, to the genocide in Bosnia has \nbeen a catastrophic failure. We even refused to call it genocide when \nwhat we watch on television was clearly genocide. The policy of our \nEuropean allies and two consecutive American administrations have been \ntimid, equivocal, and ineffective.\n  Mr. President, I wish there had never been an arms embargo. But with \none in place, we now have a real problem of whether to break with our \nNATO allies. Many feel that would be a very serious mistake.\n  The Bosnian Government wants the arms embargo lifted. But does it \nwant the United Nations to leave? The Bosnian Government has never \nasked the United Nations to leave. That is because they know that, even \nas flawed as this has been, the United Nations is saving lives and is \ngetting food and medicine to over 2 million stranded, defenseless \npeople. If the United Nations leaves, they know the war will escalate \nand more people will die. Bosnia's Prime Minister wants the United \nStates to enter the war, and that is why he supports this amendment.\n  I have also listened to those who believe that even large U.S. \nairstrikes aimed at strengthening the U.N. operation would not defeat \nthe Serbs. They argue the only way to defeat the Serbs is with massive \nnumbers of NATO ground troops, including thousands of Americans, to \nseize territory and defend it. Since the Serbs know that the United \nStates is not prepared to undertake such a hazardous, costly military \noperation of indefinite duration in a country where no U.S. security \ninterests are at stake, there is a possibility the Serbs will resist \nour air attacks and fight on.\n  They may be right. But our Pentagon commanders believe that punishing \nair attacks could swing the balance in this war. And maybe they are \nright.\n  And so, Mr. President, it is because there is no easy solution to the \nconflict in Bosnia that we face this agonizing choice. Everything in my \nheart and emotion makes me want to vote to lift this embargo. As I \ntalked with the Bosnians themselves, and I hear them say, ``Let us \nfight like human beings and not die like animals,'' I want to lift the \nembargo.\n  And if I thought that unilaterally lifting the arms embargo would \nstop the bloodshed there, I would vote for it without hesitation, \ndespite, I might say, the unfortunate and even the dangerous precedent \nit would set in rejecting a Security Council resolution that we here in \nthe United States voted for and supported. I would do so because I \nbelieve so strongly that the genocide in Bosnia must be stopped.\n  Mr. President, I am one who has said for a long, long time, even when \nour own Government would not say so, that this is genocide. But I find \nthat it may well be impossible for me to vote for this amendment \nbecause our military leaders predict that the bloodshed would quickly \nescalate and that, as UNPROFOR leaves, U.N. troops would be drawn into \na protracted ground war in Bosnia. That may be inevitable. It may be \ninevitable. But there is still a chance that NATO can prevent such a \ndebacle.\n  I cannot support the withdrawal of the United Nations when there is \nstill a chance that NATO would display the \n\n[[Page S 10616]]\nkind of unity and power that it should have displayed from the very \nbeginning of this conflict. I cannot turn my back when NATO may be able \nto redeem itself and be a viable force for bringing about an end to \nthis cruel war.\n  I believe our first responsibility is to NATO. I say that as one who \nhas supported NATO throughout my adult life, as one who believes that \nthe West needs a strong leader.\n  NATO is our first responsibility, and today the administration and \nour NATO allies are feverishly working to develop a strategy to deter \nfurther Serb advances on the Bosnian Moslem enclaves.\n  I would like to see some time at least elapse following the meetings \nin London this past weekend, while the meetings are continuing today, \nbefore we vote on the question of lifting the arms embargo.\n  I am afraid if we pass this amendment today, we are inviting NATO to \nwalk away from Bosnia, and we are saying we do not support a forceful \nNATO response, that we are prepared to see an appalling situation \nbecome even worse. I think that would be a mistake. I think we should \ngive the process underway in London time to unfold.\n  Frankly, I was disappointed, as I know many Senators were, that last \nFriday in London, the NATO Ministers only threatened to use substantial \nand decisive force if the Serbs attack Gorazde. Why should that threat \nnot apply equally to Serb attacks against the other remaining safe \nhavens? They are under Serb assault right now.\n  Innocent people have been dying for months. Secretary of State \nChristopher and Secretary of Defense Perry have both suggested the \nenclaves would be covered by the NATO threat, but it is unclear whether \nNATO feels that way. I believe this is absolutely crucial. I have \ndiscussed this with the Secretary of State.\n  I am confident that the administration will continue to push for the \nbroadest and strongest rules of engagement for NATO, and that the \ndisastrous dual-key policy will end. Frankly, Mr. President, I hope our \ncountry will never be party to something like this again.\n  Any decision to use force will be made by NATO commanders, not U.N. \nbureaucrats, and U.S. ground troops will not be involved except, of \ncourse, I might say, as we the President has already said, to ensure \nthe safe withdrawal of U.N. troops.\n  Mr. President, the easy vote for me on this amendment would be to \nvote ``aye.'' That is an easy, visible way for me to cast my lot with \nthose suffering in Bosnia, suffering that should never have happened if \nthere had not been mistakes made by the West for at least 5 years now.\n  I feel for those desperate people as passionately as anyone in this \nChamber. How could any human being not? But I find it virtually \nimpossible to support an amendment which I believe would lead to wider \nwar, greater suffering, that would endanger the lives of the troops of \nour NATO allies who are on the ground, and possibly endanger thousands \nof Americans at this moment when NATO is substantially revising its \npolicy in Bosnia.\n  As I have said, I have been torn by this more than any issue here. If \nthe new policy does not work, perhaps I will feel differently, perhaps \nI would vote differently.\n  If the decision is made to withdraw UNPROFOR, which is what this \namendment does, then tens of thousands of U.S. troops will be sent to \nassist their retreat, If that occurs, Americans and U.N. peacekeepers \nwill be killed and possibly taken hostage.\n  As the leader of NATO we have that responsibility. If we are asked by \nUNPROFOR to help them withdraw, we will have to say yes. I am one \nSenator who would vote to support that, even though it means we will \nput American troops in harm's way. But I cannot support an amendment \nwhich does not spell out all these risks for the American people. This \namendment says nothing about the fact that American ground troops would \nlikely end up in Bosnia. Perhaps we should vote on that.\n  Mr. President, while I have been deeply disappointed by the failure \nof the Western countries to act more forcefully to stop the genocide in \nBosnia, I have hope that that is changing. I think we and our allies \nhave failed badly. The past 3 years will be remembered for horrifying \nbrutality met by timidity and meaningless threats.\n  Today, NATO has a last chance to redeem itself. President Clinton has \ngone to great lengths in recent days to persuade our national allies to \nact forcefully. There has been significant progress toward a unified \nposition. He has urged us to give NATO a chance to prove itself--not \nthe U.N. but NATO. I believe we have a responsibility as the leader of \nNATO to stand up for that alliance today.\n  For that reason, and primarily for that reason, I will vote no. If \nNATO does not stand up, if the situation does not change, if after the \nconclusion of the discussions in London further Serb atrocities are \nstill met with inaction, then frankly, Mr. President, I do not see how \nI could continue to vote no.\n  I want to say, again, Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I see \nmy friend from Virginia, and I have so much respect both for him and \nfor the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. Hearing that \ncolloquy, I could not help but think that they spoke to the things that \nhave been going back and forth in my mind.\n  I walked the fields of my farm in Vermont, and I have gone back and \nforth and been awake in the middle of the night. I find myself one \nmoment saying yes, and the next moment, no. I have gone back and forth. \nThis has, frankly, Mr. President, been one of the most difficult votes \nI have cast, even though there is no question in my mind that the \nresolution of the distinguished majority leader and the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut will pass this body, I suspect, by a fairly \nlarge margin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, a question to my distinguished colleague.\n  The American taxpayer has been paying this bill, now, in 1993, $138 \nmillion; 1994, $292 million; 1995, $315 million; now at even a higher \nrate, for their participation in the air and in the naval embargo.\n  I think it is time that the U.S. Senate stood up for something. Does \nthe Senator from Vermont--and I listened very carefully--does the \nSenator advocate a larger role for NATO then, Mr. President? I think \nyou are obligated to tell what you want NATO to do. We now have \ndispatches today that Boutros-Ghali, the head of the United Nations, is \nnot about to turn this thing over to NATO.\n  Let Members not hold out there is a solution by NATO.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator, of course, is entitled to his \nown analysis of what I said, which of course is not what I said. I have \nspoken on this floor many times and elsewhere for several years, both \nin the past administration and in this administration, saying there has \nbeen opportunity after opportunity lost by NATO in the past.\n  This is not something calling for NATO to act today. It is something \nI have been saying for years, something I have said both to the current \nPresident and his predecessor. This is not something I am saying up \nhere and raising this point. It is a situation where I wish I had been \nwrong in calling for stronger action in the past. It may have had a lot \nmore effect. But I see now, as I look back, I was right and the \ndecisions made by two administrations were wrong.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply conclude by saying that if \nsomeone has a plan that NATO should carry out, perhaps they ought to \nbring it out here and discuss it. If we have NATO with greater \ninvolvement, I cannot see how our President can say NATO will continue \nin the air, but no way will we go in on the ground.\n  If you bring NATO in and give it full responsibility, then we are in \nthis combat on the ground very decisively, in my judgment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I note the presence on \nthe floor of the majority leader, the principal sponsor of the \namendment. I have been waiting for some time, but if the Senator from \nKansas, the majority leader, wishes to make a statement, I am happy to \nyield.\n  Mr. DOLE. I came to listen to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  \n[[Page S 10617]]\n\n  Mr. EXON. I hope I will not disappoint the Senator from Kansas with \nmy remarks.\n  Mr. President, the vote that I will cast on the Dole-Lieberman \nmeasure on the critical, complicated, and extremely dangerous situation \nin Bosnia is one of the most important, if not the most important vote, \nthat I have ever cast in the Senate.\n  I will vote no, Mr. President, because I am convinced that this ill-\nadvised Americanization of the war will gut our relationships with our \ntraditional allies, sow the seed for the end of NATO, and make the \nUnited Nations substantially less of an instrument for the settling of \ndisputes.\n  To my colleagues, I say vote no. This is not the correct course of \naction. Vote no, I plead--I plead, since I am convinced that this ill-\nadvised action could turn out to be disastrous for the world and for \nthe United States of America.\n  Mr. President, last Wednesday I addressed the Senate on the reasons \nwhy I oppose S. 21, the Dole-Lieberman bill to unilaterally lift the \narms embargo against Bosnia. Since that time, the United States has met \nwith our European allies to assess our collective policy in response to \nSerbian attacks on two Bosnian safe havens. I am convinced now even \nmore than last week that passage of S. 21 in its present form would \nonly worsen the situation in Bosnia.\n  With the deployment of the French and British Rapid Reaction Force \nand the recommitment of the alliance, including the United States, to \nthe use of air strikes to blunt Serbian attacks on safe havens, the \ncrisis in Bosnia has entered an important new phase that I think we \nshould recognize. The alliance is now committed to meet Serb aggression \nagainst civilian populations with force unencumbered by a restrictive \ndual-key arrangement for authorizing airstrikes. As Secretary \nChristopher said in his July 21 press briefing, the city of Gorazde, \nour most immediate concern, will be defended.\n  Unilateral lifting of the embargo prematurely starts a series of \nevents in motion that will directly undercut the agreement reached by \nthe alliance over the weekend. Lifting the embargo will result in an \ninfusion of arms on all sides of the conflict--not simply the Bosnian \nGovernment, but to all sides--that will only sustain the ability to \nwage war, inflict casualities, and terrorize the civilian populations. \nRemoval of the peacekeepers would be inevitable and the dogs of war \nwill be\n unleashed, newly strengthened, to carry on the fight until one dog \nremains or there is nothing left alive to fight over.\n\n  As I said during my statement last week on S. 21, I am not a \nsupporter of an embargo that hinders the Bosnian Forces in there \nability to defend themselves. I also question the effectiveness of the \npeacekeepers to fulfill their mission when a peace agreement is not in \nplace. We have turned over responsibility of protecting civilians on \nthe ground and seeing that convoys of food and medicine get through to \nour allies. We have asked that the French, the British, the Dutch, and \nmany other countries shoulder the costly burden of putting their \nsoldiers at risk on the ground, while we lament their inability to stop \nthe bloodshed and demand that something be done, we suggest by Dole-\nLieberman that we ``courageously'' unilaterally lift the embargo.\n  It is disingenuous for the U.S. Senate to be calling for a unilateral \nlifting of the embargo and undercutting our allies when their soldiers \nare the ones dying in an attempt to protect innocent men, women, and \nchildren. The United States lost 43 men in Somalia in an operation to \nsave hundreds of thousands of lives imperiled by starvation. The French \nhave now lost 42 men in Bosnia since arriving in June 1992. I could \nonly imagine the howls emanating from this Chamber had a nation not \ninvolved on the ground in Somalia decided, contrary to international \nagreement, to supply arms into Somalia that in turn further endangered \nAmericans there. Our foreign policy is not made in a vacuum and we must \nbe aware of the standards we ask other nations to adhere to when we \ncontemplate a course of action that places us at odds with our allies.\n  Sure, proponents will say that the situations are not the same and \nthat S. 21 provides for a lifting of the embargo after the peacekeepers \nare withdrawn. But the point is that this bill is the impetus for the \nBosnian Government to demand that the\n peacekeepers leave. S. 21's enticement to remove the shield, now \nreinforced by this weekend's decision, is the promise of arms, a \npromise, by the way, that S. 21 neither fulfills nor addresses. \nSimilarly, the bill before us refuses to take into account the need to \nauthorize United States forces to assist in the withdrawal of United \nNations forces from Bosnia. S. 21 is only half of the story. The other \nhalf of the story no one wants to be bothered with is a lot more messy: \nthousands of United States ground troops in Bosnia extracting our \nallies; increased fighting among combatants as the arms pour in to \nBosnia and its cities become the battlelines; more brutality; more \ndeath; and ever-deepening scar of human suffering.\n\n  There are no easy courses of action with respect to our policy in \nBosnia. No alternative is guaranteed to reach a peaceful and equitable \nsettlement. President Clinton has joined our allies in strengthening \nthe prospect of bringing the Serb Forces attacking civilian safe havens \nto heel. I have heard none of the proponents of S. 21 suggest that \nlifting the arms embargo and removing the U.N. peacekeepers will reduce \nthe fighting. Likewise, the proponents of S. 21 will not tell you that \nby pulling out the peacekeepers protecting the safe havens Serbian \nforces will cease their attacks on civilian populations. That is so \nbecause we know such a conclusion is faulty, as the events of the past \nhave clearly shown. Every one knows the opposite is true. Lift the \nembargo, pull out the peacekeepers, flood the region with more arms, \nand watch the bloodshed rage. S. 21 will prolong the war, not end it. \nS. 21 will lead to more casualties, not less.\n  The West's dedication to use air strikes to keep the Serbians at bay \nimproves the prospect that the military balance\n will shift to the point that the Serbs cannot exploit their advantage \nin the Eastern Bosnian enclaves, thus hopefully--I say hopefully \nbecause nothing is assured--leading to a realization that this war \ncannot be won on the field of battle. After all, Bosnian Government \nForces are numerically superior to the Serb Forces and have been \nretaking land from the Serbs in some of the western areas. Perhaps the \nstatus quo is the lesser of two evils. But there are no simple \nsolutions. We must work with the hand that we are dealt. I believe the \nPresident's policy and that of the NATO alliance is measured and \nappropriate under the circumstances. It has been totally agreed to by \nour military leaders. This is not Kansas. We can not click our heels \nthree times and expect the problem to go away. Our allies are doing \ntheir best in a very difficult situation. Let us not undercut them. Let \nus not undercut our President as he carries out his constitutional \nauthorities as Commander in Chief.\n\n  S. 21 has the allure of cotton candy. But as we know, the sweet taste \nsoon disappears and leaves only the threat of tooth decay. Cotton candy \nis not good for you and S. 21 is not good for the cause of peace in \nBosnia. I urge the Senate to not endorse a course of action that \nresigns us to a cynical view that endorses the rearming of the region \nin a misguided hope that more arms, more fighting, more American \ninvolvement will further the prospect of peace.\n  When tens of thousands of women and children were being brutally \nhacked to death by machetes in Rwanda, I do not recall anyone in the \nSenate taking the floor calling for the need to send arms to the \npersecuted minority in Rwanda to defend themselves. I mention this \nbecause the Senate has a way of being selective in its indignation over \nforeign policy matters. The Congress has an unfortunate tendency to be \ninconsistent in how we involve ourselves in foreign affairs. So let it \nnot be a surprise, if S. 21 becomes law, when at some point in the \nfuture an ally of ours decides to break out of the Iraqi, Libyan or \nSerbian international embargo and points to our vote today as \njustification for the action.\n  The fact is that the present policy has\n   the best shot, although I agree it is a long one, of realizing a \npeaceful settlement to the fighting in Bosnia. We hope and we pray that \nthat will happen.\n\n  Until we as a Nation have forces involved in there are more than we \nhave \n\n[[Page S 10618]]\nnow, our indignation over the recent policy decisions in the Balkans \nrings, in the view of this Senator, as somewhat hollow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I ask my colleague, has he had the \nopportunity to read the letter from the Prime Minister of Bosnia \nrequesting that this specific action before the Senate today be taken?\n  Mr. EXON. No. I have not read that letter. I do not believe, in \nanswer to my friend from Virginia, that we should necessarily be swayed \nby such a letter. If the Bosnian Government would make the official \nrequest to remove the peacekeepers at the proper agency, which I \nsuggest is the United Nations, then I think it would be more \nmeaningful. Will the Senator from Virginia agree?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I agree. That is precisely what this \nmeasure before the Senate at this time provides. If I could draw the \nSenator's attention--I am sure he has read it--the distinguished \nmajority leader and the Senator from Connecticut revised earlier \nprovisions to say expressly that should be done; namely, that the \nBosnian Government make a formal appeal. This does not constitute a \nformal appeal. But time after time Senators have come up and said the \nDole-Lieberman measure gives an inducement for them to take certain \naction. They have already made the decision. Here are two letters, one \nJuly 11 and one dated today from the Prime Minister corroborating \nstatements that he made to many of us here in terms of his desire.\n  So I say to the Senator, this is not an inducement. This government \ndoes desire the action recited in the present measure.\n  Mr. EXON. May I ask the Senator from Virginia, has the Government of \nBosnia made a formal request to the United Nations for such action?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it has not as yet.\n  Mr. EXON. As I said in my speech last week, I remind my friend from \nVirginia that, if that would happen, that would be the proper means of \ndoing it. I do not believe that it necessarily follows that, since the \nSenate had received a letter from the President of Bosnia indicating \nwhat his intentions are, that necessarily in and of itself justifies \nour taking the action that S. 21 provides.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will simply say I call your attention to \nthe measure pending before the Senate in which it says clearly the \nPresident of the United States shall terminate the arms embargo to the \nGovernment of Bosnia as provided following receipt by the United States \nGovernment of a request from the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina \nfor termination of the arms embargo in exercise of its sovereign \nrights. Then it goes on to say decision by the U.N. Security Council or \ndecision by countries contributing. So there it is right in this \nresolution.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator from Virginia tell me about how our \nallies, who presently have combat troops on the ground at risk and \nbeing killed, what is their attitude toward the letter that the Senator \nfrom Virginia is using to justify S. 21? Does he think we should take \ninto consideration the commitment of the United Nations, the commitment \nof our allies, the commitment of NATO? Does that have anything to do \nwith the situation?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it certainly does. It has a great deal to \ndo with it. But at this point in time our President, together with our \nallies, is putting forth a plan which, in the judgment of many, will \nnot work to resolve this situation; that is, increased bombing in the \nface of increased hostage taking.\n  I call the Senator's attention also to articles in today's press \nwhich still recite the utter confusion as to whether or not the dual-\nkey policy has been revised. So it is more and more of the same, while \nthe American taxpayer is shelling out more and more dollars.\n  But the most significant thing is we are standing by while more and \nmore innocent people are being denied the right to defend themselves. \nHow many more pictures do we need of this endless stream of refugees, \nof these stories of human atrocities which it is inconceivable to think \nin this century could take place? How much longer must we stand by?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. I ask my friend from Virginia if he recognizes and \nrealizes, or might even concede that, if S. 21 passes, or if it does \nnot, if the Bosnian Government would make its formal request to the \nUnited Nations that the U.N. peacekeepers be withdrawn, under that kind \nof a scenario, will the Senator from Virginia support the sending of \n25,000 American troops into Bosnia to help extricate the U.N. forces \nthere on the ground at this time in great peril?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the President of the United States \nindicated that he will recommend, indeed take action as the Commander \nin Chief to provide, whatever amount is required of our forces to help \nthe orderly withdrawal of the UNPROFOR forces. And I would support the \nPresident.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend for that forthright statement. I \nsuspected that would be his answer. Will the Senator from Virginia tell \nme if such an authority is granted in S. 21 as presently before the \nSenate?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is not addressed in this because the \nPresident of the United States has not come up with any specifics. We \nwould be simply trying to deal with an unknown situation. We do not \nknow what is to take place. I do not think at this point in time the \nSenate should be addressing a ``what if'' type question. We are \nspeaking out in this resolution very decisively as to what should be \ndone given the facts as of this moment.\n  At a later point in time, I will join others in this body in \nsupporting the President in such legislative action as might be \nrequired.\n  Mr. EXON. But not as a part of S. 21?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not intend to support it as a part of \nthis because it is not timely. We do not know the number of troops. We \ndo not know the situation. We have to make, I think, a very careful \nassessment of all factors. Again, this Senator obligates himself to \nsupport our President.\n  Mr. EXON. I would simply point out that I thought it was rather \ninteresting that my colleague from Virginia indicates that the \nPresident of the United States has not suggested that. I would simply \npoint out that I think the Senator from Virginia would clearly say that \nthe driving forces behind S. 21 are taking little, if any, heed from \nthe recommendations of the President of the United States on the matter \nof S. 21. But the Senator from Virginia is insisting that they might \ntake heed of a request from the President to authorize a sending of \ntroops into Bosnia to extricate U.N. personnel. Is that correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, they are entirely separable situations. My \ndistinguished colleague and I serve together on the Armed Services \nCommittee. We have sat there several times and heard about the plans \nconcerning the withdrawal. But they are only conjecture. They are only \nplans. We do not know specifically the circumstances under which such a \nwithdrawal would take place. But I again say that I would support the \nCommander in Chief at such time as he comes before the Congress to seek \nwhatever authority he feels he needs in addition to that which he \npresently has under the Constitution.\n  Mr. EXON. But the Senator from Virginia clearly does not support the \nCommander in Chief in his present efforts, nor does he support our \nallies in NATO and in the United Nations and our traditional allies. He \ndoes not accept their recommendations with regard to not unilaterally \nlifting the embargo. But I take him at his word in the future.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, that one of the most troubling matters on \nS. 21 for this Senator is that I find that many of my closest friends \nand colleagues, including my distinguished friend from Virginia, with \nwhom I have had the pleasure to serve for 17 years now on the Armed \nServices Committee, are on the opposite side of this Senator on this \nparticular issue. We have a different view in looking at it. I think \nthe Senator from Virginia and others that are supporting S. 21 are \ntaking an unwise course of action. But I do not for a moment feel that \nthey are doing it for other than what they think is best. I just do not \nagree with their judgment on this issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I share that. We do have an honest \ndisagreement. I see other Senators anxiously awaiting to participate in \nthis debate. \n\n[[Page S 10619]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the measure, of which I am a \ncosponsor, for the purpose, within the limit of my ability, of \nclarifying some of the issues that have been raised in this debate. \nSpecific consideration must be given to the role of the United Nations, \nas against that of NATO, and with regard to the right of individual and \ncollective self defense. These are three cascades, you might say, of \nrank from the collective to the regional to the individual state.\n  I am very conscious that I am standing on the Senate floor in the \npresence of our revered former chairman of the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, who was at the U.N. conference in San Francisco where the \nCharter was drafted, the anniversary of which was observed just 1 month \nago. He knows this subject as few persons living ever can do. I would \nplead the lesser but not perhaps the irrelevant credentials of having \nbeen the permanent Representative of the United States to the United \nNations and of having served in one period as President of the Security \nCouncil.\n  I would first of all go to the subject of whether this action would \nAmericanize the war.\n  Anyone who was in San Francisco last month, certainly much less 50 \nyears ago, would know that the U.N. Charter had as its fundamental \npurpose a system of collective security in which the United States and \nthe other permanent members of the Security Council would automatically \nbe involved in any international conflict anywhere in the world as \nwould the United Nations itself.\n  Article 24 of the Charter states:\n\n       In order to ensure prompt and effective action by the \n     United Nations, its members confer on the Security Council \n     primary responsibility for the maintenance of international \n     peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its duties \n     under this responsibility, the Security Council acts on their \n     behalf.\n\n  Now, the point I would wish to make here is that what we are seeing \nin Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the whole Balkan region right now is \nnot an action by the Security Council under article 24 concerning the \ntaking of prompt and effective action ``for the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security.''\n  It is another thing altogether. It is an invention, an important one, \nthat came in the course of the 1948 Middle East conflict in which U.N. \nvolunteers acted as peacekeepers in a situation where there was peace. \nThere is not peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. And it was, as all agree \nnow, an incomparable blunder to have sent peacekeepers into the middle \nof a war.\n  The Charter provides for warmaking capacity in the United Nations. We \ntend to forget it. Article 45 says:\n\n       In order to enable the United Nations to take urgent \n     military measures, Members shall hold immediately available \n     national air-force contingents for combined international \n     enforcement action.\n\n  It goes on to provide, under article 46, for military planning by the \nSecurity Council to be conducted with the assistance of the Military \nStaff Committee. It goes on in article 47 to describe the functions of \nthe Military Staff Committee with respect to the forces made available \nto it.\n  This Congress, the Senate, in 1945, passed legislation stating that \nthe President was authorized to make available forces to the United \nNations under article 45. He was to propose which forces might be made \navailable. The Congress was to agree to the particulars--for instance, \nthe 10th Mountain, the First Marine Division, the Sixth Fleet might be \nauthorized to participate. And Congress having agreed, the President \nwas thereafter free to deploy those forces under U.N. direction at his \nown behest without further reference to the Congress. That was the \ndepth of our conviction and commitment to assist in collective \nsecurity.\n  We do know that the whole arrangement vanished in the cold war. When \nI was at the United Nations amidst the cold war our representative on \nthe Military Staff Committee was a colonel. They originally had been \nadmirals. After it became clear that the Soviets were not going to \ncooperate--they did not--little by little this idea faded. But now the \ncold war is over, and the first test is before us. And if we meet it, \nfine. If we do not, we shall find ourselves asking what did we go \nthrough the last three-quarters of a century for? What has been \naccomplished since the time Woodrow Wilson brought the League of \nNations Covenant back to this body?\n  Mr. President, at the San Francisco Conference, there was a specific \nand revealing difficulty. Members of the U.S. delegation were opposed \nto including language on the right of self-defense in the charter for \nfear that such a provision might be used to limit the right of self-\ndefense. Somewhat the same issue arose with respect to the American \nConstitution and the adoption of the Bill of Rights. There were those \nwho argued that if you ever list any specific number of rights about \nwhich Congress may make no law, if you leave one out, you may indicate \nthat possibly you could make a law with respect to that right. Wiser \ncounsel prevailed, and we have the Bill of Rights, and wiser counsel \nprevailed in San Francisco.\n  On May 15, 1945, James Reston described the breakthrough. He said:\n\n       San Francisco, May 15.--President Truman broke the deadlock \n     today between the Big Five and the Latin American nations \n     over the relations between the American and the world \n     security systems.\n       After over a week of negotiating, during which American \n     foreign policy was being made and remade by a bi-partisan \n     conference delegation, the President gave to the Latin \n     American nations the reassurance which they wanted before \n     accepting supremacy of the World Security Council--World \n     Security Council it then was--in dealing with disputes in the \n     Western Hemisphere.\n       This assurance was announced late tonight by Secretary \n     Stettinius, who said that an amendment to the Dumbarton Oaks \n     proposal would be proposed reading substantially as follows:\n\n  Mr. Reston was not only a great journalist. He had a great friend on \nthe Chinese delegation, that we now know, and he quotes:\n\n       Nothing in this charter impairs the inherent right of self-\n     defense, either individual, or collective, in the event that \n     the Security Council does not maintain international peace \n     and security and an armed attack against a member State \n     occurs.\n\n  That with very slight changes became article 51 of the charter. And \nthat, sir, is exactly the situation which we confront today. The \nSecurity Council has not carried out its responsibility to maintain \ninternational peace and security under article 24. An ambiguous and in \nthe end unavailing deployment of NATO and other forces as peacekeepers \nwhere there is no peace has clearly broken down.\n  A year ago, I was speaking on this subject on this floor, and I said \nwhat the UNPROFOR had become at that time. I said:\n\n       But if we are to refrain from helping the Bosnians out of \n     concern for their welfare, let us be candid and call the \n     members of UNPROFOR what they have become: hostages.\n\n  I have visited some of the UNPROFOR forces and found them to be \ncourageous to a fault, incredibly self-sacrificing, honorable, \neverything you would want in military men: but hostages even so.\n  Now, the question is what if we move to lift this arms embargo which \nI regard as an illegal sanction. It was never directly imposed on \nBosnia and Herzegovina. How could it be? They have committed no act of \naggression. They have violated no international law. People say, \n``Well, what about Iran? What about Iraq? What about Libya?''\n  The answer, Mr. President, is very simple. In each case, those \nsanctions apply to a country which is in violation of international \nlaw--invaded a neighboring country, committed international acts of \nterrorism.\n  In no sense is there a comparable situation. To make such an argument \nis to equate the victim with the victimizer in this situation. The U.N. \nforces are not capable of carrying out the assignment given them, nor \nare the forces from other countries involved.\n  I was in Sarajevo in Thanksgiving of 1992. I made my way into the \ncapital through a hail of small arms fire and heavy machine gun fire in \na Ukrainian armored personnel carrier, was then transferred to an \nEgyptian armored personnel carrier to meet with President Izetbegovic \nand dined at the ceremonial mess with a British officer formerly with \nthe Gurkha Regiment.\n  That is the international setting in Bosnia, the urge to collective \nsecurity, \n\n[[Page S 10620]]\nbut they cannot defend themselves. They cannot make peace. And they are \nsent as peacekeepers where there is no peace.\n  In this situation, sir, could I suggest that one of our problems as a \nnation is that we have never fully understood the role of ethnicity, of \nreligion, of nationalism in this second half of the 20th century where \nit seemed that the great issue was the impending Armageddon of an \nencounter between the Soviet Union and its Marxist-Leninist creed and \nthe western, liberal, Democratic, free enterprise world. Yes, there was \nthat. Heaven knows, there was that. It ended up with the Soviet Regime \ncollapsing under ethnic pressures--not that we ever foresaw it but it \ncould have been foreseen. Some of us who have worked in this field \npredicted it, wrote about it, but were not heard. Now because the \nSoviet Union is over, there is the impression such tension is over. To \nthe contrary.\n To the contrary, we invite, by the actions we now take, a conviction \nin the Islamic world that we will not defend Muslims horribly violated \nby Christian forces from a neighboring country and living also within \ntheir own country. Even as this London conference was meeting this \nweekend, Islamic nations met to ask what were they to understand the \nworld was saying about an Islamic State, the victim of aggression. Were \nthey saying it would not be defended and it would not be given the \ninherent right of self-defense? Turkey, a NATO member was at that \nconference.\n\n  The possibility of these events leading to a general encounter \nbetween Islamic forces in Europe and in the region just beyond in Asia \nMinor is not to be discounted, sir. The possibility of it spreading \nacross the vast Islamic areas of the former Soviet Union is not to be \ndiscounted. Those who discount it could well ask, how did we get into \nthis situation we are now in? It has been made clear this is a \nsituation that this present administration inherited from its \npredecessor. But in both cases, they have acted in the same way, \ndeclining to seek an elemental legal principle and, if you wish, a \nmoral imperative as well. It seems to me that we should recognize the \nstandards we brought to the world.\n  That conference took place in San Francisco. The announcement of the \nagreement that produced what would become article 51, was made by the \nAmerican Secretary of State, Mr. Stettinius. These are our standards. \nIf we will not uphold them, we will have hugely diminished our position \nin the world, and the world will become a vastly more dangerous place.\n  I simply would like to express my appreciation to the Republican \nleader for having seen this from the beginning. I thank him \nparticularly for showing me a letter sent just this day to him and to \nhis distinguished cosponsor, the Honorable Joseph Lieberman, from the \nPrime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I will read a few sentences, \nMr. President, if we cannot hear these things, we are not equipped for \nthis time. The Prime Minister notes that:\n\n       Yesterday, a Bangladeshi UNPROFOR battalion in Bihac \n     requested airstrikes to deter and stop the Serb attacks on \n     Bihac. The Bangladeshi request was ignored. I asked myself if \n     this same request would be ignored if it were requested by a \n     British battalion.\n\n  ``I asked myself if this request would be ignored if it were \nrequested by a British battalion.''\n  Mr. President, it is all there to see. People who cannot see that \nought to stay away from this work. We have heard not very helpful \ncomments from the Secretary General about such matters. But this ethnic \ndimension is not local; it is not Balkan; it is worldwide. And if we \ncannot act in response to its potential for worldwide crisis, we shall \none day wonder how could we have been so blind.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator. May I first thank him for his \nextraordinary statement, if I may say, extraordinary for most of the \nrest of us, but not for himself. Because I have come to appreciate the \nrange that he has shown, again, the Senator from New York, in his \nability to look beyond the events of the day, both backward and \nforward, and to help us understand the significance today of both of \nthose points of view.\n  I want first to thank him overall for the force of his statement and \nfor reminding us of what the history of the United Nations is and what \nhas brought us to this day. And of the impact on the United Nations of \nwhat has happened in Bosnia, second, which was the misuse of the U.N. \ntroops to go in where there was war and not peace, in sending them in \nas noncombatants though they were seen as combatants by particularly \nthe Serbs. Also, I want to thank him for pointing out what is too often \nmissed here as we localize this conflict, but it does go to the heart \nof the genocidal aspects of it, which is that a people are being \nsingled out because of their religion, in this case, Moslems. And the \nconsequences are broad throughout the world, throughout the Islamic \nworld and throughout the world. They have an effect on our relations \nwith that great and rising force of Islam in the world.\n  I note for the Senator from New York that last week on Thursday, July \n20, the Gulf Cooperation Council called for a lifting of the arms \nembargo against the Bosnians and told the European leaders that it \nwanted to help stop what it called the great tragedy of the 20th \ncentury. This was followed over the weekend by the meeting that the \nSenator from New York has referred to in Geneva of the Organization of \nthe Islamic Conference, which announced it was considering the arms \nembargo to be invalid and was prepared to assist.\n  I would like to ask this question of the Senator. Would he care to \ncomment for a moment on the impact of this sad story in Bosnia on NATO, \non what NATO's position has been, and what it suggests to us about what \nwill become of NATO in the post-cold-war world?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. NATO will have been engaged in its first military \naction in almost 50 years and it will have been defeated. Just at that \nmoment when it seemed to have triumphed by virtue of its capacity and \npresence in the face of the Soviet Union, it will have in fact gone to \nwar and will have been defeated. And we will have put it in that \nsituation. The aftermath will be demoralization, domestic protest, a \nsense of ``what are we doing?'' And curiously, at just the moment you \nsee some sense of the complex issues involved. I note that the \nsituation is at such a critical level in Bosnia that the Jewish \ncommunity in Germany asked that German forces be committed to this \nissue. It is genocide.\n  And you put not just at risk the whole situation in the Islamic \nworld. It is an idea that I do not want to insist too much on, but not \neveryone would know, I suppose, that until recently the third largest \nnuclear power in the world was Kazakhstan. We put that at risk. In \nTurkey, the civil government of Istanbul and of the other major cities, \nincluding the capital, is an Islamic fundamentalist party, known as the \nWelfare Party, that being a translation into English as such.\n  Turkey joined with nations with which it normally has no relationship \nat that meeting which you related. We could see NATO come apart along \nethnic religious lines. We could see its moral collapse and its \ndomestic support disappear because we will have allowed it to be \ndefeated by deploying forces never envisioned by the U.N. Charter. The \nU.N. Charter specifically calls for military forces to be made \navailable to the United Nations through the military staff committee. \nStatutes enacted on this floor provide that the President of the United \nStates can reach an agreement to provide soldiers to the U.N. Security \nCouncil. And the Congress having approved of this, the President may \ndeploy them thereafter without further reference to Congress.\n  That was a system of collective security envisioned by the charter. \nAt no time were peacekeeping forces envisioned. Deploying peacekeeping \ntroops was well intentioned, but a good invention in a situation where \nthere was peace, not in the present situation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may say one thing in the way of a \nquestion to my colleague. You would not want to, I think, end up with \nsaying defeat for NATO given that there are so many Americans, as we \nspeak, flying, at sea, and otherwise trying to carry out the missions \nassigned them as part of the NATO forces. NATO has been handcuffed, \nvirtually handcuffed, by virtue of the United Nations dual-key policy.\n\n[[Page S 10621]]\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I absolutely agree.\n  Mr. WARNER. To say this would go down as a defeat for NATO I am sure \nwas not the intention of my distinguished colleague from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I will put it this way: It would not be the intention \nof anybody involved. But the perception might be very different, sir. \nWe put NATO in jeopardy by letting it assist in a mission at which it \ncannot succeed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nYork for his outstanding statement. I say to my colleagues, I hope that \nwe can reach some agreement so we can have a rather early disposition \nof this matter. I think some feel strongly on each side of the issue, \nbut the issue has been debated.\n  As we speak, I understand there is an all-out attack on Bihac. All \nout. I do not know where NATO is. I do not know where the protection \nis. It seems to me that what may have been a meeting in London to work \nout some plan apparently did not succeed.\n  This is an issue that many Members have been speaking on before. It \nwas back in the Bush administration, I guess, when I first raised \nquestions about what was happening in Yugoslavia. I did not agree with \nmy President, President Bush. I said so. Many others said so at the \ntime.\n  That was 1992. Here we are, halfway into 1995, and I have been \nworking with many in this body, primarily the Senator from Connecticut \n[Mr. Lieberman], in a bipartisan, nonpartisan way to bring this issue \nbefore the Senate, but more importantly, before the American people.\n  I do not imagine the average American has really spent a great deal \nof time focusing on what is happening in Bosnia. It is on the evening \nnews. It is in the newspaper. It is on the radio. It is tragedy. It is \nsuffering. It is rape. It is murder. It is slaughter. We are sensitive \nto that, but it is not close. It does not threaten America. There are \nno American troops involved, except those in NATO.\n  It seems to me that we have an historic opportunity--not as \nRepublicans, not as Democrats--but as a Senate. I have said for some \ntime, we are the one best hope the Bosnians have--right here in the \nU.S. Senate. And then, hopefully in the House.\n  In fact, we met this morning with the Speaker in a joint leadership \nmeeting and suggested if we could pass this resolution, that maybe the \nHouse could take it up at a very early date and send it to the \nPresident.\n  I have a different view than President Clinton. My view is if we pass \nthis resolution, it will strengthen his hand in developing and shaping \nand directing policy, not weaken his hand, not Americanize what is \nhappening in Bosnia.\n  It seems to me that we have all known for some time that what is \nhappening there is immoral. It is unjust. No doubt about it, it is easy \nto single out the aggressors.\n  Today, the International War Crimes Tribunal indicted Bosnian Serb \nleaders Karadzic and Milosevic for war crimes. Maybe that does not mean \nanything. It means somebody else in the world recognizes what is \nhappening. This is an independent body.\n  Meanwhile, hardly deterred by this indictment, Milosevic is \nsupervising attacks on Bihac and Sarajevo. In today's Washington Post, \na senior State Department official is quoted as saying, ``The arms \nembargo is morally wrong.'' This is a State Department official. This \nsame official was quoted last week as saying, ``The dual-key commands \narrangement between NATO and the United Nations is insane.'' It is not \na partisan statement. This debate has never been partisan in the sense \nthat it was Republican versus Democrats, or the Senate versus the \nPresident or the administration.\n  This is only one individual. Maybe this individual is wrong.\n  What does this say about America? Are we willing to go along with \nimmoral or insane policies because the rest of the international \ncommunity is doing so? What does it say about us? What does it say \nabout American leadership, including the Congress? Are we willing to go \nalong with ludicrous commands arrangements that threaten U.S. air crews \nand are seriously damaging the credibility of NATO, that we are \nunwilling to use the influence, power, and prestige of the United \nStates to lead the way and to do what is right in an effective way?\n  I learned something today from the Senator from New York that I did \nnot know about article 51, that we had made the motion or made the \nchange or set the policy. It is fairly difficult to tell people there \nis not some inherent right of self-defense as an individual, as a \nnation. That is what this debate is all about. It is not about sending \nAmericans anywhere.\n  Again, referring to the letter that has been referred to that has \nbeen received by my colleague and myself from the Prime Minister of \nBosnia and Herzegovina, he said: ``Today's vote is a vote for human \nlife. It is a vote for right against wrong. It is not about politics. \nIt is about doing the right thing,'' which should be easy for America \nto do the right thing. ``In just the past two days in Sarajevo, 20 \npeople have been killed, while more than 100 have been wounded.'' After \na while maybe people become immune, whether it is 10, 20, 50, or 100.\n  I hear the voices raised about the U.N. protection forces, that if \nthey are withdrawn, there could be American casualties, because I think \nmost would support the effort the President has committed himself to, \nto help them withdraw.\n  How long will they stay there? This is not an occupation force. Four \nyears? Five years? Ten years? How long will the U.N. protection forces \nstay there, and how long will we continue to pay a large portion of \nthat, 31 percent, as I recall, as the Senator from Virginia pointed out \nearlier.\n  The President asked the Senate last week to postpone the vote. We did \nthat, as we should have. The President made the request, and we honored \nthat request. The President even suggested maybe the two of us could \nsit down and talk about policy. I am not certain I could talk about \npolicy, not having the information, but I am certain that we ought to \nlook at the facts.\n  I want to say that the President sent a letter today, and he said:\n\n       The passage would undermine efforts to achieve a negotiated \n     settlement in Bosnia and could lead to an escalation of the \n     conflict there, including the possible Americanization of the \n     conflict.\n\n  Now, I have heard that dozens of times in the past 2 weeks. It is not \nthat I want to criticize the President. It is not an accurate \nstatement. That is not what we are about. That is not what we are \nabout. I just want to set out the facts very quickly.\n  With respect to negotiations, the 1-year anniversary of the Bosnian \nGovernment signing a contact group plan has come and gone. Bosnia \nsigned it; the Serbs never have. Never have, and probably never will, \nas long as the only repercussions are the huffing and puffing of \nWestern leaders and the buzzing of NATO planes overhead.\n  As for talks in Belgrade, Milosevic is driving a hard bargain. He \nwants the sanctions lifted but is busy supplying the Bosnian Serbs with \nweapons, as exposed recently by the New York Times, I think, two or \nthree Sundays ago. They are getting weapons and troops and other \nsupport.\n  The bottom line is that no negotiation process is in place, and I do \nnot think there will be one until the Serbs pay some price for their \naggression.\n  As for escalation of the conflict, the conflict has escalated. More \nUnited Nations troops are being deployed, and as United States and \nEuropean leaders issue more empty threats, the reality is the \nindecisiveness and ineffectiveness of the West invited the Serbs to \nmove rapidly on all the so-called safe havens.\n  The London ultimatum on Gorazde has neither stopped assaults in \nGorazde or curbed the attack in Bihac. I indicated we just had a call \nfrom the foreign minister, saying it is underway, full force right now,\n and Sarajevo, also. And, as pointed out by the Senator from New York \nand others, there is still bickering over the dual-key approach. Is it \nin? Is it out? Will it work? Will it not work? So we have Boutros \nBoutros-Ghali back doing what he does best, blocking any action against \nthe Serbs that might remind the world that they are the aggressors.\n\n[[Page S 10622]]\n\n\n  But the point I really want to focus on is this Americanization, \nbecause that frightens the American people. Somebody asked me a \nquestion at a town meeting this weekend, ``Why should we Americanize \nthe war by lifting the embargo?\n  I said, ``We are not.''\n  But that is the word, that is the official word from some. There is \nno doubt now that our fingerprints are all over this conflict. We would \nnot like to think so. I would call it ``this disaster.'' It is \ndisaster, it is failed. It is a failed policy. Our fingerprints are on \nSrebrenica, on Zepa. We have not only tolerated, but participated in a \nfailed and morally flawed approach. And I do not believe, as the leader \nof the free world, that we can escape responsibility. We are not the \nother countries. We are America. We are the United States. We are the \nleader of the free world--supposedly to provide moral, spiritual, \neconomic and, where necessary, military leadership.\n  Last fall the Congress passed the Nunn-Mitchell position as part of \nthe fiscal year 1995 defense authorization bill. We passed so much I am \nnot certain anybody has really gone back and taken a look at that. My \nstaff did, went back and showed it to me, reminded me what we said \nthen. It has been almost a year now.\n  In the sense of the Congress, the section stated: ``The acceptance of \nthe contact group proposal by the Government of Bosnia should lead to \nthe lifting of the arms embargo.'' The Bosnians accepted the contact \ngroup. The Serbs never have. The embargo is still in place.\n  In the section entitled ``Interim Policy'' it states--this is the \nsame thing we passed:\n\n       If the Bosnian Serb faction attacks any area within those \n     areas that have been designated by the United Nations as \n     ``safe areas,'' the President or his Representative should \n     promptly, formally introduce and support in the United \n     Nations Security Council a resolution that authorizes the \n     selective lifting of the Bosnia arms embargo, authorized to \n     allow the provision of defense weapons such as antitank \n     weapons, counter battery radars and mortars to enable the \n     forces of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to defend \n     the safe areas.\n\n  That was a year ago, and the safe areas as we speak are being \noverrun. Maybe Tuzla will be left. Maybe Sarajevo. Maybe Gorazde. Two \nhave already fallen. One is under attack. There is no attempt to lift \nthe arms embargo.\n  This is what we passed. The Senate passed this. The President \naccepted it. We have not had any selective lifting of the arms embargo. \nThere has been no effort to prevent the safe havens from falling. We \nasked the Bosnians to ``turn in your heavy weapons and you will be \nsafe. We will protect you.''\n  Once they have done that, they have nothing to fight with. They have \nno artillery pieces. They have no heavy weapons. They have rifles \nagainst tanks--not a fair fight.\n  So when do we start? When does NATO strike? When does Boutros \nBoutros-Ghali turn in his key so somebody can make a decision. When we \nhave three safe havens left? Or two safe havens left? Or one safe haven \nleft? Or no safe havens left?\n  This was a policy developed by the British and the French and we \nsigned on. We were asked to wait, be patient. I know it does not seem \nlike it has been very long since we voted here in the Senate. But let \nus just assume we were in Bosnia all this time. Every day, every day, \nevery day the shells were coming in. They were hauling off our \nchildren. They were murdering our wives. They were raping our sisters. \nEvery day, every day, every day we were adding to the death toll of \ninnocent people who only wanted a chance to defend themselves.\n  It is pretty safe here in the Senate Chamber. And I know we cannot \nhave policy made by what we see, images we see on television or in the \nnewspapers or reports from commentators who are on the scene. And maybe \nthe Bosnian people understand that, well it has been a year, it has \nbeen 2 years, it has been 3 years--maybe someone will help us help \nourselves. And while the Bosnian people may understand the \ninternational community's unwillingness to protect them, they cannot \nunderstand the unwillingness to allow them to protect themselves. There \nis no way they can understand that.\n  If we are attacked in our homes, if we are attacked in our Nation, we \nhave a right of self-defense. And, as the Senator from New York so \neloquently pointed out, that is article 51, now, of the United Nations \nCharter.\n  So we have had all the excuses. We have heard them over and over \nagain. We heard them in the last administration. I do not know, I have \nlistened to the Senator from Virginia ask the rhetorical question about \nNATO. I am not certain what happens to NATO, what the future of NATO \nis. I know they are in a box. But their credibility is on the line, \ntoo. It has been weakened. There is no question about it. In the eyes \nof the international community, the people--notwithstanding our \ncommitment to NATO and the importance to NATO--NATO has been weakened \nbecause of its subordination to the United Nations.\n  So the NATO alliance, I think, is in some jeopardy. The Serbs will \nattack. This is what Secretary Christopher said earlier today, if the \nDole-Lieberman legislation is passed, ``the Serbs will attack.'' I \nthought the Serbs have been attacking every day. They are attacking \nright now as we debate the resolution--not because we are debating the \nresolution--they have been doing it for a week or 10 days in Bihac.\n  They were given a green light in the Bush administration. The Bush \nadministration talked about a united Yugoslavia, even after they had \nelections in Croatia and Slovenia. There was no more Yugoslavia.\n  So, it seems to me the London conference certainly was not a red \nlight for anybody to stop. The green light is still on. The Serbs \nunderstand the green light is still on, and they are making all the \nheadway they can.\n  We are also told that if this passes and becomes law, it is going to \nend humanitarian assistance. I think we have heard the Prime Minister, \nMr. Silajdzic, say from time to time: When you talk about food or talk \nabout death, it is difficult. They are living a subsistence existence. \nBut the bigger picture is they have no protection. What good is food \nagainst snipers and heavy shells and death? They have no future. They \nare at the mercy of Western leaders who think they know best. I can \nunderstand the British. It would be embarrassing if they withdrew. I \ncan understand President Chirac. He is new. He wants action; something \nto happen. And they have just lost two more French soldiers.\n  I have the highest regard for the members of the United Nations \nprotection forces, whether they are from Bangladesh or Great Britain or \nFrance or Pakistan or wherever.\n  So I would just conclude by saying many of us believe that the arms \nembargo is illegal.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It is.\n  Mr. DOLE. Indeed, an arms embargo was never imposed on the \nindependent, sovereign state of Bosnia. An arms embargo was imposed on \nYugoslavia, which no longer exists, at the request of Belgrade, at the \nsuggestion of Britain. And, as has been said here by everybody, Bosnia \nis a member of the United Nations. They are an independent nation. They \nhave a right to self-defense.\n  But this is not just a vote about Bosnia. It is a vote about America. \nIt is a vote about what we stand for, about our humanity, and our \nprinciples. And I know, probably relentless pressure is coming from the \nBritish and the French and others of our allies, traditional allies, \njust to stick a little while longer--1 more week, 1 more month. In \nabout 2 more months we will be into winter again--2\\1/2\\ more months. \nAnd that is when the suffering really begins, when it really begins.\n  I know there will be a little hiatus here if the U.N. protection \nforce is withdrawn and we lifted the arms embargo. It will be a very \ndifficult time for the Bosnians. But it is a very difficult time for \nthem now. We have the rapid reaction forces now in place in some areas. \nBut let us face it. It has been a fact for weeks and weeks the United \nNations protection forces could not even protect themselves, let alone \nprotect the safe areas or anyone else.\n  So it would seem to me this is not a vote about Republicans or \nDemocrats or philosophy. It is a vote about what is right.\n  Again, as stated by the Prime Minister as he closes his letter, he \nsaid:\n\n       Our people ask that we be allowed only our right to defend \n     ourselves. It is on their behalf that I appeal to the \n     American people and Government to untie our hands so that \n\n[[Page S 10623]]\n     we may protect ourselves. The slaughter has gone far enough. My people \n     insist that they would rather die while standing and fighting \n     than on their knees. In God's name we ask that you lift the \n     arms embargo.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, the majority leader, if \nhe will engage, perhaps, in a brief colloquy? I would like to take the \nopportunity to ask a few questions, if possible.\n  I would like to ask the majority leader--first of all I would like to \nsay I think every U.S. Senator shares the anguish and frustration \nexpressed by the Senator and by others on the floor.\n  The question here is what is the consequence of one step or another?\n  I would like to ask the Senator if we could perhaps have a little \ndialog. I think it would be helpful to elucidate this a bit. I would \nask the Senator if this is the Senator's preferred policy. I heard the \nmajority leader talk about American leadership and inaction, and being \nhamstrung by the U.N. I presume there is a policy that is growing out \nof frustration. I would ask him if this is his preferred policy, and if \nit is not, whether or not the Senator would articulate what he would \nprefer to see us doing now that would make a difference.\n  Mr. DOLE. Obviously, in my view--and I think the view of everyone--\nthe preferred policy would have been some negotiated settlement months \nago, a week ago, or a year ago. But that has not happened. As I said, \nthe Bosnians signed on the dotted line with the contact group \nrecommendations. The Serbs never have.\n  So how long do we wait? There is no negotiating process in place now. \nPreferred options? We have listened to everybody except the people in \nBosnia. Do they not have any rights? Can they not say, ``U.N. \nprotection forces get out. Lift the arms embargo. Let us die for our \ncountry''? That may not be the best option. People are going to be \ninjured. People are going to be killed. They are being injured and \nkilled as we speak. There is not any good option.\n  Mr. KERRY. If I could say to the Senator, the Senator talked about \nforcefulness and the need to stand up and be a leader. My question is \nthis: Is the only leadership that we are offering a leadership that \neffectively says not only will we not give you weapons, not only will \nwe not strike, but we will simply lift an arms embargo and you fight it \nout?\n  Mr. DOLE. Oh, no. I would go beyond that. I would provide weapons, \nalthough I understand the Bosnians are much better equipped to handle \nRussian weapons, and will not need as much training. I would train the \nBosnians. That is not ``Americanizing.'' It would be training in a safe \nplace, just as we helped train the Afghans in that adventure in El \nSalvador. So I would go as far as to provide air cover in this little \nhiatus, as I mentioned earlier on.\n  But I think the problem was in June of 1993, when President Clinton \nsaid, ``Let me tell you something about Bosnia. On Bosnia, I made a \ndecision. The United Nations controls what happens in Bosnia.''\n  That is not an American policy. That is United Nations policy. That \nis not American leadership. I do not know. I see all the people who \ncome to our offices. They are just asking for a right to defend \nthemselves. That may not be the best policy. But it is a policy the \nBosnians themselves are asking us to try. It seems to me they are doing \nall the dying. There is not any dying here. Their voice should be \nheard.\n  Mr. KERRY. I accept that. I understand that.\n  But my next question would then be if the Senate went the full \nmeasure and Congress passed this, at that point in time does the \nSenator accept the French and British pronouncements that they will \nwithdraw completely?\n  Mr. DOLE. I am not certain how to accept their pronouncements. If we \npassed this legislation, which I assume the President will veto, we \nwould have to override his veto.\n  Mr. KERRY. Assuming we would override it and it became the law of the \nland, apparently this British Prime Minister, as recently as yesterday, \nsaid to the President if this passes the Senate, they will begin the \nprocess of withdrawal.\n  Mr. DOLE. My own view is I think the British Prime Minister may be \nlooking for some excuse to withdraw, and it would be nice if he could \nlay it on the United States because we have no forces on the ground. \nBut we are, of course, engaged in NATO forces. We have people at risk, \nas we learned a few weeks ago with the young pilot. But I do not know \nwhether they would withdraw or not. There is lot of rhetoric out there.\n  We have had rhetoric for 3 years, and no results. We can ask these \nendless questions forever, and go on and ask this question. We have \nbeen asked these questions forever. It seems to me that it is time to \nvote. It is time to send a message. If we lose, we lose. If we win, we \nwin. And then it goes through all the other processes. The President \ncan decide what to do. But I do not believe that just passing this in \nthe Senate is going to cause the British and French to say, ``Oh, that \npowerful U.S. Senate has spoken. We had better get out of here.'' I do \nnot believe that will happen.\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate the Senator taking the time. I would like to \nask again a couple more questions, if I may.\n  Mr. President, I ask the majority leader, would the majority leader \nprefer a policy that went further than what was achieved in London, \nwhere each of the safe areas was in fact given a guarantee of being \nsafe? Would NATO be capable of enforcing that with American air support \nreinforcing French and British troops on the ground and with sufficient \ntroops to make real the notion that the international community will \nmake a difference? Would the Senator prefer that policy?\n  Mr. DOLE. I would prefer that policy. But it is probably not a \nsolution. I do not know if it is a policy. I do not think we have a \npolicy.\n  Mr. KERRY. Would that not be a policy that might not in fact leverage \nthe negotiated settlement that would be everybody's desire?\n  Mr. DOLE. But that is not what happened in London. We do not even \nknow if they have not abandoned the dual-key approach. They have not \ndecided what did happen. Bihac is under siege right now by Krajina \nSerbs and Bosnian Serbs, and nothing has happened. NATO is doing \nnothing. The United Nations is doing nothing. Another 15,000 people are \nat risk, and they say, ``Well, that is all; 15,000, take that off; take \noff the other two safe havens that have fallen, Srebrenica and Zepa. \nThat leaves three. We will protect whatever is left.''\n  By the time they get around to it, there may not be any left. It may \nbe a better policy if NATO did not have to be supported. The U.N. in my \nview would be a much better way to do it, as the Senator I think would \nlike to do it.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the final question that comes out of that \nis since Bihac is already under attack and Gorazde is already under \nattack, if we were to put into law the notion that all we are going to \ndo is lift the embargo, why would the Serbs then not accelerate the \npace of the attack in order to guarantee that during the interim, \nbefore heavy weapons can get there, they would finish the job?\n  Mr. DOLE. I assume there would be an acceleration. Nobody is under \nthe illusion they are going to say, ``Well, let us see. Let us take a \ntime out while the Bosnians get ready. Let us have 30 to 60 days while \npeople bring in arms and heavy weapons.''\n  But the Bosnians are people who understand and comprehend. They \nunderstand what they are up against. But in understanding what they are \nup against now, take a look at the casualties. Who has been doing the \ndying? It has been the Bosnians--women, children. There has been a lot \nof talk on this floor about the children, that we ought to do more for \nchildren.\n  We are not engaged. We are not asking to send ground forces. I would \nsupport air cover even during this hiatus, as I think the Senator from \nMassachusetts maybe might, if I understand the question correctly.\n  But all I am suggesting is--and I hope the Senator from Massachusetts \nwill join us because he has the experience. He is a member of the \ncommittee. He understands what this is all about. This is about the \nU.S. Senate. It is not about Republican Bob Dole or Democratic Senator \nJoe Lieberman. This is about the Senate and whether or not we have a \nvoice and whether or not we \n\n[[Page S 10624]]\nhave a role, or whether we care about what happens in the world. We \nbelieve it is a failed policy, as I did back in the administration of \nthe Republican President.\n  So I am not here standing and jumping up, saying we had a Democrat \nPresident and I am a Republican, so I should find some way to find \nfault with this policy.\n  I hope that we will have a strong vote. I think it would send a \nmessage of hope to the Bosnians.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor taking the time.\n  I would like to respond a little bit to some of the answers and some \nof the notions, if I may, because I accept what the Senator has said. \nThis is not due to him. He has consistently been critical of the lack \nof adequate response, and he has been for a stronger response. I think \nwhat is really noteworthy is that in his answers, he acknowledged that \nhis preference would be to have a stronger allied response, a stronger \nresponse without dual key, a stronger response with a NATO that is \ncapable of immediately impacting events, and a stronger capacity on the \nground.\n  What we have watched is a steady process where the Bosnian Muslims \nhave systematically and methodically had the entire fabric of their \ncommunity and life stripped away. But what we are doing is debating a \nresolution that will effectively ratify our own hesitation, our own \nconfusion, our own weakness, and even the cowardice of the Western \nworld. And what will happen with this resolution is that because it \neffectively says here is what we will do when we can do nothing else--\nthat is what this amendment says: Here is what we will do because in \nour ineptness, in our frustration, we cannot find another policy. So we \nare basically saying, ``We are going to feel good about your dying.''\n  It is interesting that the President of Bosnia keeps saying, ``Give \nus the weapons.'' But he does not say, ``UNPROFOR, get out of here.'' \nHe wants the best of both worlds. And there is a reason for that \nobviously, which is precisely why the British and the French have been \nreluctant to go along with lifting the embargo, because they understand \nhow they could get trapped in a worse war if the weapons are coming in \non both sides and they are there supposedly trying to keep peace.\n  Now, the Senator is absolutely correct. The reason this equation has \nbeen so crazy on balance is that there has been a gutless process \nwherein the civilian leadership of the U.N. itself has been unwilling \nto guarantee what it originally gave as a guarantee. So we disarmed \npeople. We gave them the notion of an enclave that was safe. We \npromised humanitarian assistance. And we pretended that their presence \nwould act as the leverage to try to get a peace agreement when in fact \nwe, never being willing to respond, annihilated our own leverage and, \nin fact, invited more and more aggression by the Serbs.\n  So we have a lot of blame to make here. But the question we ought to \nbe asking ourselves today is are we going to come here now and codify \nthat blame, codify our own guilt into a policy that effectively says we \nare prepared to wash our hands of this?\n  In effect, this amendment will stand for all of history to say that \nnot only were we so craven as to not find a policy but we were ready to \ncodify our own helplessness. The majority leader has acknowledged it. \nHe said his preferred policy is to be tough. His preferred policy is to \nguarantee that we can make them pay the price of violating the safe \nzones, of shooting against innocent civilians who go out to get water \nat a fountain or cross a street. Are we so helpless in the front of \nthat that all we can do is turn around and say, ``We are going to give \npeople the capacity,'' not even the weapons, not even the training? \nThat is not in here. There is no strike in here. There is no long-term \naid program like Afghanistan in here. This is the abandonment \namendment.\n But it is cleverly written. It is cleverly written to only take place \nif the President of Bosnia goes to the United Nations and says, \n``Leave, UNPROFOR.'' Or if UNPROFOR is out after a period of time. So \nin effect the proponents can stand there and say to everybody, well, we \nare really not doing anything except if the President wants us to or if \nUNPROFOR has already left, and then what are we doing?\n\n  Is this really our response to what is happening in Bosnia, to come \nup with an amendment that has two condition precedents, two triggers, \nboth of which effectively wind up saying a message, neither of which \ndoes a darned thing to change the situation and meet the needs of \npeople today? But we are going to pretend that this somehow meets \nneeds.\n  Those who favor this approach somehow suggest that someone--we do not \neven say who--just putting arms into the Bosnian Moslem hands is going \nto affirmatively change the equation on the ground, and it is going to \nmake us feel better simultaneously. The truth is that it promises to do \nneither.\n  Let us be very clear, Mr. President. Lifting the embargo, as the \nSenator from Kansas said, will not stop the killing. It will probably \nincrease the killing. And it is everybody's guess as to how much and \nhow fast.\n  I wonder what America is going to do if this becomes law. And we \nought to act responsibly on what we pass around here with a notion that \nit might be law and not just pass it on for others to deal with by veto \nso a minority can kill it and people can walk around and feel good. \nBecause if this does become law, we will have unilaterally breached an \ninternational agreement.\n  I am not suggesting we should keep the embargo, incidentally. I voted \nto lift it last year for the simple reason that I thought it might \nchange the equation at that time and we were sending a message. It did \nnot and we have not. But now we are talking real. Now we are talking a \nvery different situation.\n  It is clear that just lifting it at some point in time in the future \nis not going to meet the needs of now. It does nothing to provide for \nthe immediate needs of any of those enclaves that the Senator listed as \nbeing under siege or being next to be under siege. But it will result \nto an absolute certainty, if it becomes law, in the withdrawal of \nhumanitarian assistance, the withdrawal of the U.N. effort, and the \nshifting to the United States for having made this choice a future \nresponsibility for whatever it is that flows.\n  Now, I cannot predict what it is that will flow, but I think most \npeople here have a pretty good sense that there is going to be a lot \nmore killing. If the people think that the CNN images of refugees were \nbad in the last few weeks, wait until all of the U.N. effort is out and \nthe population is left to the whim and will and fancy of people running \naround with guns desperate, all of them, to stay alive.\n  Then what will the U.S. response be? Will the Senator come back to \nthe floor and say, ``Well, at least they are dying with a gun in their \nhands?'' Will the Western world response be, ``Well, this is OK because \nthey are able to make a choice?''\n  I do not think so. I think, on the contrary, the probability is that \nMoslem countries will not tolerate what might be going on and maybe \nthey will become more deeply involved. And perhaps it will then spread \nacross another border. Perhaps all the unthinkable things that we never \nstopped to think about before World War I and World War II take place. \nWho knows? Will it spread to Macedonia? I do not know. I do not have \nthe answers to that. But I know wise people exercising good judgment \nwith respect to foreign policy should not just take a step and throw \ntheir hands up in the air and say we should not try to think those \nthings out and measure what the consequences are.\n  It is hard for me to believe that a Senate that is so filled with \npeople who want to be tough about what is happening with respect to \nSerb behavior and who understand that we should be responding more \nforcefully would come to the floor with anything but a resolution \nseeking that kind of a response. This is not a policy for the now. This \nis a policy that is an epitaph for Bosnia, and it basically says, ``We \nignored you for a few years. Then we lifted the embargo after we did \nyou damage. And we wished you good luck. Have a nice war.''\n  That is the impact of this. At the very moment that our allies that \nwe have spent, what, 45, 50 years building an alliance with to make a \nNATO work \n\n[[Page S 10625]]\nare saying ``do not do this,'' we are prepared to unilaterally pull the \nrug out from under them.\n  It does not make sense. We are prepared to deal a major blow to a \nNATO that has already dealt itself a blow, obviously. But Tuzla still \nstands. Gorazde still stands. Sarajevo still stands. And all of those \npeople in those cities are safer today for that fact and for the \npresence of the United Nations than they would be without it.\n  Who will come to the floor in a few months and explain away those \npeople who are lost when we claim responsibility that the world will \nquickly give us for having pulled the rug out from under this \ninternational effort? And what happens when one of our allies comes to \nus and says, ``Hey, you know, we don't really like that embargo on \nIran. We are tired of the embargo on Iraq. We really don't agree with \nyou on what we are doing to Qadhafi, and, by the way, North Korea is \nyour problem; you people figure out what to do with the nuclear \nweapons.'' All of those things can flow as a consequence of the \nunilateralness of what we are doing. I would love to see the embargo \nlifted.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will be delighted to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Does the Senator agree that there is a difference \nbetween the embargoes or sanctions applied to Iran and Iraq, which are \nlawbreaking countries, as opposed to an embargo placed on a country, \nYugoslavia, which does not exist, now enforced against Bosnia, a \nsection of that former country, independent, a member of the United \nNations, having committed no violation of international law or U.N. \nresolutions?\n  Does the Senator not agree that there is a difference there?\n  Mr. KERRY. Absolutely. There is a profound difference. And I agree \ncompletely with the Senator. As I was just starting out in the last \nsentence when I broke to answer the question of the Senator, I was \nsaying we should lift the embargo. It makes sense in terms of article \n51, in terms of the law, in terms of the equities. But we should not do \nit unilaterally.\n  Now, that is where we get caught in the Catch-22 that has confounded \neverybody for the past months because every time we turn around and go \nto the French and the British and say we want to do this, we are told, \n``No, if you do that, we are going to leave.'' And so we do not do it, \nand we pull back, and we go around in this circle.\n  I think that what has changed in the last week or two is the \nrecognition, hopefully, that the situation is, indeed, untenable and \nthat we cannot continue in the form in which we are. And the President \nhas made that about as clear as a President of the United States can \nmake it. The President has been forthright in saying this policy is not \nworking. He has been forthright in acknowledging that the dual key is a \nterrible mistake and we must never do that again. He has been \nforthright in acknowledging that we have not adequately been able to \nrespond because we have had a proportionate response rather than a \ndisproportionate response.\n  So I think the President has pretty much laid the policy of the past \nmonths on the table and said it is changing.\n  Now, I listened to the Secretary of State today say to us point \nblank, there is no more dual key. The NATO commander on the ground has \nthe ability to make the decision, if he observes an attack, to call in \na strike.\n  In addition to that, the French and the British have put howitzers up \non Mount Igman. They have put additional troops, Legionnaires up in the \nhills around Sarajevo. They have strengthened their own capacity. And \nso suddenly, in the face of their willingness to do all of this, we are \ngoing to turn around and say, ``Sorry, folks; the United States of \nAmerica says time to cut.''\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will be happy to yield for another question.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I read to the Senator from an Associated Press article \nwritten today, dateline Washington, Barry Schweid, diplomatic writer, \nquoting Ahmed Fawzi, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary General Boutros-\nGhali, saying that ``authority to order an attack'' in Bosnia ``remains \nwith the Secretary General for the time being,'' and that there was \ngeneral agreement at the allies' high-level meeting in London that \n``the dual key arrangement remains in place.''\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me just say, if the Senator wants to suggest to me \nthat the Secretary of State lied to the Democratic caucus today, then \ndo that.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Obviously, I would not say that.\n  Mr. KERRY. I will not accept whatever Mr. Boutros-Ghali is putting \nout to the press.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I have an extraordinary respect for Mr. Christopher.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. Boutros-Ghali does not have the ability to stop the \nNATO commander from doing a strike if the NATO commander--the NATO \ncommander does not report to him, the last time I understood it. If it \nis our understanding that the NATO commander has the capacity to do the \nstrike, I am confident when he radios Washington with the appropriate \nmessages, he is going to strike notwithstanding whatever Mr. Boutros-\nGhali said for the purposes of international U.N. political \nconsumption.\n  Now, I agree with the Senator that is part of the problem here. It \nalways has been. And when we were at the meeting at the White House the \nother day, a number of us suggested to the President that it is \nimperative to be out from under any control factor in the clearest \nterms. If we cannot do that, then I would agree with the Senator we \nhave to find an alternative solution.\n  But I would still respectfully say to the Senator, the alternative \nsolution is then, hopefully, not to throw up one's hands and say we \ncannot do anything. I think then the appropriate solution is to say \nNATO and willing nations must assume what the United Nations is either \nunwilling or incapable of doing. Now, that is my preference before we \ncome to the floor of the U.S. Senate and ratify an abandonment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator not agree this is not the first time \nwe have come to the floor? This is not an issue of first impression. We \nhave been coming to the floor for 3\\1/2\\ years once war broke out in \nthe former Yugoslavia saying, how can we justify not allowing one side, \nthe Bosnians, who wish to defend themselves, to have the weapons? Would \nthe Senator not agree that the United Nations and NATO have had all \nsorts of time to prove that they can be effective? And in all that \ntime, the Bosnians have been ultimately defenseless and have been \nslaughtered?\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend from Connecticut, whose concern \nfor this is as passionate as anyone's in the Senate, that he is \nabsolutely correct. We have been here, done that, seen that, said that. \nAnd that is part of what is feeding the frustration that every Member \nfeels today. But as far as I know, that is not a predicate for \nsuggesting that we should personally step in, step in in a way that now \nunravels whatever potential is left of minimizing the loss of life.\n  I believe the Senator will also acknowledge that every step of the \nway, when we were serious about a strike, we made a difference. That is \nhow we secured the safe zones in the first place, if everybody goes \nback to think about it. It was the fact of airstrikes that gained us \nthis notion of safe zones. And each time we stepped up to bat, the \nSerbs have stepped away from the plate or off the field.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Would the Senator not agree that----\n  Mr. KERRY. I just want to say to my friend, why should we ignore that \nhistory? This is not a big place. Four million people, 600,000 on this \nside, 2 million on one side. What are we talking about here? This is \nnot Russia. This is not Vietnam where there were 77 million people. \nThis is not the same kind of struggle. We are not talking about \nbecoming involved in the civil struggle. We are talking about \ndelivering humanitarian assistance. We are talking about guaranteeing a \nsafe zone. Those are the two most minimalist things that you can \nconceivably ask for under the laws of warfare. Is the Western World \nincapable of living up to the most minimalist standard of protection \nunder the laws of warfare? Are we incapable of taking this incredible, \nmighty war machine and putting it to use to guarantee that trucks can \ngo down a road, that we can keep people from a certain perimeter from \npicking \n\n[[Page S 10626]]\noff an old woman who goes to a drinking fountain? I do not believe we \nare that incapable. I am not going to come to the Senate floor and \nratify an effort that literally puts into law that lack of capacity and \nwill. I think it is wrong.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The answer is that--\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. We are clearly that capable, but we have been \nunwilling.\n  Mr. KERRY. Why not be willing today?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. How can we continue to justify delay, while those \nolder women going to the drinking fountain are getting hit by Serbian \nshells? We will not--the Bosnians themselves have the ability to defend \nthemselves. We are not intruding ourselves in. We are finally getting \nourselves out.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me ask the Senator, are there any weapons provided for \nin this resolution? Yes or no.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. No.\n  Mr. KERRY. Is there any strike provided for in this resolution?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. We leave that to the President and our allies.\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senate is going to be big and brave and take this big \nstep that does not provide a weapon.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, I will be \nglad to join with him, as soon as this measure passes, in introducing a \npackage authorizing aid to allow the Bosnians to buy weapons that they \nneed. There is an outstanding resolution----\n  Mr. KERRY. I say to my friend, in the U.S. Senate that is the kind of \nthing that could take 6 months, a year to pass maybe. What would happen \nin the meantime? Here is this great effort that says we are going to \nguarantee them weapons. Who is going to provide the heavy weapons and \nartillery and the antitank weapons? Who is going to provide the tanks \nthemselves if they need them? Where are they coming from?\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERRY. Besides, let me ask this. How are they going to get in? \nBecause I am told they can only arrive by ship. If they arrive by ship, \nthey must cross Croatia, and there is no guarantee that the Croatians \nare going to permit that. So where are we?\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. For a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Addressing the Senate, the Senator said if you pull back \nthe UNPROFOR, then all war breaks out. That infers that UNPROFOR is \nthere to protect the civilians. And I strongly take disagreement with \nmy colleague and good friend. UNPROFOR is there for the reason only to \ndeliver food and medicine. They did not go equipped with the armaments \nto defend either themselves or the other people.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say----\n  Mr. WARNER. We made a terrible mistake, Mr. President, in calling \nthem ``safe areas'' when we did not put in place such military \nequipment as to make them safe should they be attacked. And if UNPROFOR \nis there solely to protect themselves and to carry out their limited \nmission--limited mission--of delivering food and medicine, the Senator \nis wrong in saying, if you pull them out, all war breaks loose.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend from Virginia, that is not in \nkeeping with what safe havens were. We did guarantee safe havens.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, did we put in the weapons to carry out \nthat guarantee?\n  Mr. KERRY. No.\n  Mr. WARNER. The answer is ``no.''\n  Mr. KERRY. No. Because not one U.S. Senator, myself included, I \nthink, will put American troops on the ground. And the British and the \nFrench were not prepared to put additional troops in at the time. Now I \nthink that equation has changed.\n  But the truth is, and the Senator from Virginia knows this well, the \nsafe zones were designed to protect civilians. That was the concept. In \nfact, we said to people, give us your weapons. We disarmed them in \norder to protect them, and then never followed through with sufficient \ncapacity to do that. But the concept was that they would be safe in a \nsafe zone.\n  Mr. WARNER. But----\n  Mr. KERRY. I will say to my friend, I do not think it is the \nresponsibility of an American to be on the ground in Bosnia without a \npeace agreement. I accept the notion we should be part of legitimate \npeacekeeping if there is an agreement. But this is, after all, not \nWorld War I or II. And it is Europe's backyard. And I have no guilt nor \nshame, no restraint whatsoever in suggesting that the majority of the \nresponsibility on the ground belongs with Europeans. And if they are \nwilling to carry that, I am willing to support the notion that a young \nAmerican should go in harm's way in air support and logistical support. \nAnd I think that is the appropriate balance.\n  Now, absent a British or French willingness to do that, then maybe we \nare left with nothing more but to do this epitaph resolution. I do not \nbelieve we have exercised that full measure of diplomacy yet. I do not \nthink we have come to that point yet. And if we have, it is a sorry \nstate of affairs. As Pope John Paul said, this represents a defeat for \ncivilization. But it has not happened yet, notwithstanding the horror, \nnotwithstanding all that has gone on.\n  Now, I am not suggesting that we can make peace. I am suggesting we \ncan guarantee the most minimalist notion that we have carved out, which \nis the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the protection of a few \nsafe havens.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I remind my colleague that his \nemphasis is on air power to protect the safe havens. The last time, Mr. \nPresident, we used that air power to any degree, hostages were \nimmediately taken. People were strapped to the targets and the air \npower dissolved.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say to my friend, that is because we \nhave basically been searching for 3 years or more for a no-risk policy. \nAnd every balancing act that we have made in each equation that we have \ncome up with has been sort of the minimalist, the minimalist of what we \ncan achieve on the ground without upsetting Yeltsin, the minimalist of \nwhat we do without getting Croatia at a point where they move too much, \nthe minimalist of what we do with respect to Milosevic in Serbia, the \nminimalist of what we can get out of the French, and the minimalist of \nwhat we give ourselves. That is the history, all of which from our \npoint of view has been geared essentially to be no risk.\n  Now, I do not think there is such a thing. And I do not think the \nSenator from Virginia believes there is either. Nobody knows it better \nthan he as a former Secretary of the Navy and as a former marine. There \nis a reason young Americans put on the uniform. There is a reason we \nhave a standing military. And we make judgments, or we are supposed to, \nabout the different tiers of interest that we have as a nation. \nSometimes that interest rises to vital national security, a challenge \nto our way of life, and we go all out.\n  Sometimes it arises just to ease security interests. Sometimes it is \nonly a national interest. Sometimes it is only an interest.\n  I respectfully suggest that with each of those different tiers, you \nmay or may not be willing to risk a patrol plane, you may be willing to \nput a bomber wing on the line, you may put a squadron, company, or \ndivision. You make those decisions. We have essentially tried to avoid \nall of those.\n  I do not think you can resolve this problem in any way that is \nsatisfactory to the NATO commitment, to the civilized notion of who we \nare as a country and where we should be going, and certainly, to the \nhistory of Europe, without assuming some risk.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I conclude--and I see other Senators very \nanxious to speak--by saying that if it would be minimalist after \nminimalist throughout this time, this diplomacy, this inaction has \ndenied the people of Bosnia the most fundamental thing, the right to \ndefend themselves. This is a right which is founded in the common law \nwhich has been honored by mankind since the earliest hours and which \nwas enshrined as article 51 in the U.N. Charter. That is what this \nmeasure does.\n  Mr. KERRY. I say to my friend, in a sense it does that. In an \nemotional kind of litmus test, a written sense, it does that.\n  The reality is that it does a lot more than that. It does a lot more \nthan that. It is not just us making this decision. \n\n[[Page S 10627]]\nFor better or worse, we engaged with the United Nations; for better or \nworse, NATO involved itself with the United Nations; for better or \nworse, our allies are involved; and mostly for the better, it is they \nthat are on the ground, not we.\n  They are saying this is not the preferred way to go. It is a \nFrenchman who was buried yesterday. Mr. President, 42 or so Frenchmen \nhave died.\n  Now, I suggest that we cannot just come here in a vacuum and be \ninsensitive to the implications that are far more complicated than this \nresolution permits for. What bothers me so much about this resolution \nis it is so attractive on its face. It is so easy. We basically say it \nwill not happen unless the President of Bosnia asks it to happen, and \nit will not happen unless the troops are coming out.\n  Everyone understands there is a different message in it, really. We \nshould not be debating on the floor how we withdraw. We should be \ndebating on the floor how we summon the will and the capacity to put \ntogether a structure that can win for the Western world the capacity to \nleverage a settlement.\n  Now, that may be long in the doing. One of our greatest problems is \nthat for 20 years nobody believes any longer in our staying power. Most \ncountries have come to believe through Somalia, through all of our \ndebate, that all they have to do is put us to the test. I rather \nsuspect that is one of the reasons why Saddam Hussein went the distance \nthat he did. It seems to me that at some point, if we are going to put \nan end to that legacy, we will have to be prepared to assume or define, \nat least, a certain amount of risk.\n  I am willing to understand that this is fraught with pitfalls. There \nis no guarantee that we may set a certain limit of the risk we are \nwilling to assume and may not be able to get beyond that. Boy, I would \nrather do that, Mr. President, than turn around and ratify our \nhelplessness, which is effectively what we are doing today.\n  I say, there is no certainty at all that weapons will get through \nCroatia. None whatever. There is a certainty to the fact that 25,000 \nAmerican troops are going to go in to get everybody out. That, there is \na certainty of.\n  So when people say this is not a way to Americanize the war, let me \nsay, if you are the British and you are already apprehensive about this \npolicy, or you are the French and you think you have been abandoned by \nan ally who wants to unilaterally do something, there is no finer \nexcuse than to be able to turn around and say, ``OK, you guys have your \nown program; you go in and help us get out, and it is your ball game.''\n  Then what happens if, while we are getting out, a lot of helpless \nwomen and children come running up to Americans because there are \npeople killing them and chasing them in the background; are we going to \nstand and watch as we get out? What are the rules of engagement going \nto be for the young soldiers? What will happen if someone wants to lure \nthem into some kind of a fire fight? And then when we lose people, we \nfeel we have to retaliate against one side or the other?\n  I think it is a hell of a lot better, I say respectfully, to be there \nwith the defined purpose of delivering humanitarian assistance and \nhelping to protect a safe haven than worrying about how we are getting \n25,000 of our troops back out. I think for history's sake, we would be \nbetter off taking that position than the road we are about to go down.\n  I am in favor of trying to lift the embargo on a multilateral basis. \nI wish we were changing this in a way that set up a structure for a \nmultilateral process and for some diplomatic leverage with an attempt \nat a cease-fire and an ability to enforce and reinforce this kind of \neffort.\n  My belief is that the administration understands the difference in \nthis equation today. My belief is that we must put this London meeting \nto the test. For the U.S. Senate to not even have the patience to allow \nthe next few days to play out before we step in with an arrogant club \nis to somehow ignore both our relationships as well as common sense.\n  Other colleagues are on the floor. They want to speak, Mr. President. \nI have other comments, but I did not expect to go on at this point in \ntime.\n  Mr. PELL.\n   Mr. President, I share the deep frustration many of my colleagues \nhave expressed during the course of the Senate's debate on the Dole-\nLieberman bill. Whatever the outcome of the vote on this bill, all of \nus agree that the behavior of the Bosnian Serb leadership is dreadful. \nThe International War Crimes Tribunal at the Hague has also \nacknowledged this. It has, in fact, just issued indictments against \nBosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Bosnian Serb military \ncommander Ratko Mladic for crimes and abuses committed earlier in the \nBosnian war. The Serbs' most recent offenses--their utter disregard for \nthe U.N. protected-safe havens--outrages us, and make us want to do \nsomething in response. Where proponents and opponents of the Dole-\nLieberman legislation disagree, however, is what that something should \nbe.\n\n  At the urging of the United States, the contact group countries have \nagreed to do something in response to the atrocious Serb behavior. \nDetails still need to be worked out, but this much is clear: earlier \nthis week, the allies delivered an ultimatum to the Bosnian Serb \ncommander that any threat against Gorazde will be met with \ndisproportionate air strikes. Secretary Perry has made clear that the \npolicy adopted for Gorazde could quickly be adopted to other areas \nshould they come under attack. At the same time, British and French \ntroops--part of the rapid reaction force--are working to open a key \nhumanitarian supply route into Sarajevo.\n  These new efforts have just begun, yet by passing this bill today, \nthe Senate is saying that we are not willing to give them a chance. As \nPresident Clinton said in a letter today to the distinguished minority \nleader opposing this bill, ``Congressional passage of unilateral lift \nat this delicate moment will provide our allies a rationale for doing \nless, not more. It will provide the pretext for absolving themselves of \nresponsibility in Bosnia, rather than assuming a stronger role at this \ncritical moment.'' I would add that in passing this bill, we not only \nundercut the policy, but in so doing, we put at risk the brave U.N. \npersonnel on the ground.\n  The troop contributing countries, the U.N. Security Council, indeed \nthe Bosnian Government have all made the judgment call that the United \nNations should remain and redouble its efforts in Bosnia. None of those \nparties is asking for a U.N. withdrawal at this time. They know that if \nthe United Nations were to pull out altogether, any areas of Bosnia \nwhich are now stable and well supplied due to the U.N. presence would \nlikely face a humanitarian disaster. This is particularly true in \ncentral Bosnia. In his letter to Senator Daschle, President Clinton \npoints out that ``for all its deficiencies UNPROFOR has been critical \nto an unprecedented humanitarian operation that feeds and helps keep \nalive over two million people in Bosnia.'' The President, our NATO and \nU.N. allies, and indeed the Bosnian Government have balanced the \npotential catastrophe of a U.N. withdrawal against the current tragedy, \nwhich has led many to call for a complete U.N. pullout. They have \ndecided not to advocate a U.N. withdrawal at this time. Yet by passing \nthis bill, the Senate is unilaterally calling for the United Nations to \nleave. That does not come without cost.\n  I would remind my colleagues that the United States has committed to \nhelping our allies withdraw from Bosnia as part of a NATO effort. So, \nin essence, by passing this bill, we are triggering the commitment of \nup to 25,000 United States troops to Bosnia to help with that \nwithdrawal. We need to be clear about what we're voting for.\n  This bill advocates, indeed would precipitate, a U.N. withdrawal from \nBosnia followed by a unilateral lifting of the arms embargo. I do \nbelieve that if and when a decision is made to withdraw UNPROFOR, the \narms embargo will de facto, be lifted with the support of our allies. \nThat is as it should be. We are just not at that point yet.\n  As I argued last week, if we pass this bill, it will inevitably be \nperceived as the beginning of a United States decision to go it alone \nin Bosnia. It is naive to think we can unilaterally lift the arms \nembargo, and then walk away.\n  Another serious concern I have about this legislation is that it says \nthat the lifting of the embargo shall occur after \n\n[[Page S 10628]]\nUNPROFOR personnel have withdrawn or 12 weeks after the Bosnian \nGovernment asks U.N. troops to leave, whichever comes first. Basically, \nthis legislation gives the Bosnian Government--the power to end United \nStates participation in a U.N. imposed embargo. While the Bosnian \nGovernment does indeed have the right to ask UNPROFOR to leave, we \nshould not abdicate to the Bosnian Government the power to trigger a \nunilateral lifting of the embargo.\n  I have been somewhat torn about how to vote on this matter, and have \nnot made my decision lightly. Like my colleagues who support this bill, \nI want to do something to alleviate the suffering of Bosnian civilians; \nto make the Serbs pay for their brutality; to tell them that aggression \nwill not be rewarded. I am not convinced, however, that we will achieve \nthose goals by passing this legislation. Indeed, we could make things \nworse, at great risk not only to the besieged Bosnians, but to the \nUnited States and our European allies. I reached this decision too, out \nof respect for our President's request that we not move ahead with this \nlegislation. I will therefore, with some reluctance, vote against the \nDole-Lieberman bill. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nPresident's letter on Bosnia be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, July 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I am writing to express my strong \n     opposition to S. 21, the ``Bosnia and Herzegovina Self-\n     Defense Act of 1995''. While I fully understand the \n     frustration that the bill's supporters feel, I nonetheless am \n     firmly convinced that in passing this legislation Congress \n     would undermine efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement in \n     Bosnia and could lead to an escalation of the conflict there, \n     including the possible Americanization of the conflict.\n       There are no simple or risk-free answers in Bosnia. \n     Unilaterally lifting the arms embargo has serious \n     consequences. Our allies in UNPROFOR have made it clear that \n     a unilateral U.S. action to lift the arms embargo, which \n     would place their troops in greater danger, will result in \n     their early withdrawal from UNPROFOR, leading to its \n     collapse. I believe the United States, as the leader of NATO, \n     would have an obligation under these circumstances to assist \n     in that withdrawal, involving thousands of U.S. troops in a \n     difficult mission. Consequently, at the least, unilateral \n     lift by the U.S. drives our European allies out of Bosnia and \n     pulls the U.S. in, even if for a temporary and defined \n     mission.\n       I agree that UNPROFOR, in its current mission, has reached \n     a crossroads. As you know, we are working intensively with \n     our allies on concrete measures to strengthen UNPROFOR and \n     enable it to continue to make a significant difference in \n     Bosnia, as it has--for all its deficiencies--over the past \n     three years. Let us not forget that UNPROFOR has been \n     critical to an unprecedented humanitarian operation that \n     feeds and helps keep alive over two million people in Bosnia; \n     until recently, the number of civilian casualties has been a \n     fraction of what they were before UNPROFOR arrived; much of \n     central Bosnia is at peace; and the Bosnia-Croat Federation \n     is holding. UNPROFOR has contributed to each of these \n     significant results.\n       Nonetheless, the Serb assaults in recent days make clear \n     that UNPROFOR must be strengthened if it is to continue to \n     contribute to peace. I am determined to make every effort to \n     provide, with our allies, for more robust and meaningful \n     UNPROFOR action. We are now working to implement the \n     agreement reached last Friday in London to threaten \n     substantial and decisive use of NATO air power if the Bosnian \n     Serbs attack Gorazde and to strengthen protection of Sarajevo \n     using the Rapid Reaction Force. These actions lay the \n     foundation for stronger measures to protect the other safe \n     areas. Congressional passage of unilateral lift at this \n     delicate moment will undermine those efforts. It will provide \n     our allies a rationale for doing less, not more. It will \n     provide the pretext for absolving themselves of \n     responsibility in Bosnia, rather than assuming a stronger \n     role at this critical moment.\n       It is important to face squarely the consequences of a U.S. \n     action that forces UNPROFOR departure. First, as I have \n     noted, we immediately would be part of a costly NATO \n     operation to withdraw UNPROFOR. Second, after that operation \n     is complete, there will be an intensification of the fighting \n     in Bosnia. It is unlikely the Bosnian Serbs would stand by \n     waiting until the Bosnian government is armed by others. \n     Under assault, the Bosnian government will look to the U.S. \n     to provide arms, air support and if that fails, more active \n     military support. At that stage, the U.S. will have broken \n     with our NATO allies as a result of unilateral lift. The U.S. \n     will be asked to fill the void--in military support, \n     humanitarian aid and in response to refugee crises. Third, \n     intensified fighting will risk a wider conflict in the \n     Balkans with far-reaching implications for regional peace. \n     Finally, UNPROFOR's withdrawal will set back prospects for a \n     peaceful, negotiated solution for the foreseeable future.\n       In short, unilateral lift means unilateral responsibility. \n     We are in this with our allies now. We would be in it by \n     ourselves if we unilaterally lifted the embargo. The NATO \n     Alliance has stood strong for almost five decades. We should \n     not damage it in a futile effort to find an easy fix to the \n     Balkan conflict.\n       I am prepared to veto any resolution or bill that may \n     require the United States to lift unilaterally the arms \n     embargo. It will make a bad situation worse. I ask that you \n     not support the pending legislation, S. 21.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. PELL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate for \nthe last 2 hours and I find the debate to be somewhat disassociated \nfrom the resolution we are being called upon to adopt. We have had it \nsaid that we are talking about American leadership. We are talking \nabout American prestige. We are talking about America's willingness to \nassume its proper role in the world.\n  Yet, when I look at the actual language of the resolution, \nparticularly on page 5 where it states, ``Nothing in this section shall \nbe interpreted as authorization for deployment of United States forces \nin the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina for any purpose, including \ntraining, support or delivery of military equipment,'' that is not a \nheroic call to action. That is not a statement that stirs men's blood \nwith a commitment to the protection of the innocent.\n  I believe that what we have before us is a resolution which \nessentially is an abdication of some of the most basic national \ninterests of the United States of America. What are those interests \nthat will be affected by the proposal of the United States to \nunilaterally lift, and therefore abrogate, the resolution of the United \nNations which had prohibited the international community from supplying \nadditional arms to the former Yugoslavia?\n  I suggest that we have at least five national interests at stake in \nthis debate tonight. One of those is the national interest in terms of \nthe protection of our fighting men and women. Do we wish to place U.S. \nmilitary personnel, especially ground troops, at risk?\n  Interest No. 2 is to contain the conflict and not allow it to become \nthe catalyst of an even larger war in the Balkans and in southern \nEurope.\n  Interest No. 3: We have an interest in preserving the integrity and \ncapacity of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n  Interest No. 4: We have an interest in the international community \nrespecting international agreements.\n  Finally, we have an interest in the capacity of the United States, \ngiven the reality that we are a government of divided responsibility, \nand therefore the necessity of the executive and the legislative to \nwork with some degree of harmony and mutual respect in order for the \nUnited States to be an effective force in the world community.\n  I believe all five of those important goals are placed at risk \nthrough the adoption of this resolution.\n  What I think is interesting about those goals is, if you think of \nthem as concentric circles, only the first two of those relate directly \nto circumstances affecting Bosnia. The other three are more generic \ninterests of the United States. And it is somewhat gratuitous that the \ncircumstances in Bosnia are the basis of those interests being placed \nat risk.\n  Let me just comment briefly as to why I believe each of those five \ninterests are jeopardized by the adoption of this resolution. Our first \ninterest is to avoid the unnecessary placing of U.S. military personnel \nat risk. There are a series of comments that have been made. Our \nclosest allies in NATO, who do have military personnel on the ground in \nBosnia, have stated repeatedly--and, I think, unequivocally--that it is \ntheir intention to withdraw from \n\n[[Page S 10629]]\nBosnia if the United States unilaterally lifts the arms embargo. I \nbelieve they are sincere in that statement.\n  The United States has made a commitment that if they do withdraw, we \nwill provide up to 25,000 troops, to provide them cover while they are \nwithdrawing. So the effect of adopting this resolution to unilaterally \nlift is that our allies will withdraw and that we will facilitate that \nwithdrawal with up to 25,000 U.S. ground troops. So we have directly \ncountered one of our interests, which is to avoid placing U.S. troops \nat risk on the ground.\n  Second, containing the war. In my judgment, which is not particularly \nmeaningful--but in the judgment of virtually every serious student of \nthis issue, from the leadership of the United States military to our \ndiplomatic leadership--they have all stated that if the arms embargo is \nlifted, it will precipitate an urgent move by the Bosnian Serbs to take \nadvantage of the military circumstances as they now exist before those \nadvantages are compromised by armaments reaching the Bosnian Moslems. \nSo there will be an escalation of the conflict.\n  There will be additional weapons introduced into the region and they \nwill not all be the weapons that the United States might be prepared to \nintroduce. Although this resolution explicitly indicates that we are \nnot committing ourselves to provide any additional training, support or \ndelivery of military equipment to the Bosnian Moslems, the Russians are \nnot so circumspect. A news item from Tass, the Russian news bureau, \ndated July 12, states that the Russian Duma, the Russian Parliament, \nhas condemned the new NATO bombing raids on the positions of the \nBosnian Serbs near Srebrenica.\n  Since this time, that former safe haven has fallen.\n  According to the statement of the Duma, these bombardments have \ncreated a situation where armed provocations by the so-called Moslem \nCroatian Federation, unrestrained by the West and NATO, cause response \nfrom the Serbs which is always followed by a unilateral use of power by \nNATO.\n  The Duma resolution goes on to call for the Russian participation in \nthe lifting of the arms embargo for purposes of providing arms to the \nBosnian Serbs.\n  So we are going to have the Russians providing military equipment to \nthe Serbs, the United States assumedly providing military equipment to \nthe Moslems--a major escalation of the conflict within Bosnia, creating \nthe potential of a serious overflow of this conflict into an already \ntinderbox adjacent area.\n  This has the potential of a major conflagration throughout the \nBalkans and southern Europe, even the potential of drawing into that \nconflict Greece and Turkey, two of our NATO allies. So if one of our \nobjectives is to try to contain the war, if that is why we have 400 \nUnited States military troops in Macedonia, the adoption of this \nresolution and all of the things that are likely to flow from it will \nhave exactly the opposite effect.\n  Third, it is in our interest to preserve the integrity of the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization. That is an organization which is already \nunder serious pressure as a result of events in Bosnia. This would \nraise that pressure. We have been besieged by our French and British \nallies not to unilaterally lift the embargo because of the greater \ndanger that it will pose for its troops that are on the ground. We are \ngoing to be called upon, if this resolution is adopted, to protect our \nNATO allies by assisting them in withdrawal. I fear one of two things: \nI fear that we either will--or I fear that we will not--vote on an \namendment to this resolution which will specifically authorize the \nUnited States to place some 25,000 troops in Bosnia in order to assist \nour NATO allies in their withdrawal.\n  I fear that we would debate that because I fear that it will fail. In \nfact, I have a reason to believe that gives me confidence that the \namendment would fail. Therefore, the Senate would be sending a \nstatement to our NATO allies that we are not going to honor our \ncommitment to protect them. I am distressed that we would not debate \nthat amendment because it indicates I think the fundamental level of \ntimidity which is part of this resolution that we are calling for \nactions that have very high probable consequences and yet are not \nwilling to accept affirmatively the implications of those \nresponsibilities. So in so doing we place our NATO alliance at risk.\n  Fourth, is the respect for international agreements. This is not the \nonly international agreement in which the United States has joined with \nthe rest of the international community in adopting.\n  Let me just refer to one of those other agreements; that is, the \nagreement that the United States led the Security Council in adopting \non August 6, 1990, imposing on Iraq a sweeping set of sanctions. What \nare those sanctions? A ban on the import of any product originating in \nIraq. This primarily relates to oil which is 90 percent of Iraq's \nexports. A worldwide freeze on Iraq's financial assets; a ban on all \nweapon sales to Iraq; a ban on any exports to Iraq with the exceptions \nof food and medical supplies.\n  On September 25, 1990, to those set of sanctions was added an \nadditional prohibition on civil air activity. That is an international \nagreement of which we are a party. There have been tremendous pressures \non that Iraq embargo. Iraq has offered to Russia, France, Germany, and \nother countries huge quantities of oil at discounts, lucrative \ncontracts for oil exploration and industrial redevelopment. Thus far \nour allies have resisted those entreaties. They have resisted them \nbecause Iraq has not lived up to its obligations, including its \nobligation to allow full surveillance of its capacity to produce \nweapons of mass destruction, weapons which already have destabilized \nthe Middle East, and have the potential to do so again.\n  It is very much in our interest that this embargo against Iraq be \nhonored by all of the world's countries. Yet, what moral ground do we \nhave to continue to urge that they be honored if we have just \nunilaterally breach the United Nations' embargo which was arrived at \nwith equal solemnity relative to the provision of armaments in the \nformer Yugoslavia?\n  Mr. President, I think we are about to shred our moral capacity to \nlead the world and to ask the world to follow the rule of law and \ninternational obligations. And there is no country which will pay a \ndearer price for that than will the United States of America.\n  Fifth, and finally, Mr. President, I believe we have a great stake in \nthe capacity of this Government of the United States of America to be \nable to function in international affairs.\n  When I was a boy growing up in a home, the father of which had been \nborn in Croswell, MI, our political hero was Senator Arthur Vandenberg \nof Michigan. Senator Vandenberg accomplished much in his life and in \nhis public career. But the thing for which he is best known is his \ncooperation with President Truman in the critical years after World War \nII in fashioning a bipartisan foreign policy for the United States \nwhich did in fact allow us to lead, to lead in a very difficult period \nof 45 years until finally the Soviet Union crumbled.\n  That standard of cooperation is, I fear, one of the real potential \ncasualties in the adoption of this resolution. If I can use as the \nexample that commitment that the United States made to our allies to \nprovide up to 25,000 troops to help extricate them from Bosnia should \nthat be called upon, I imagine what happened was that a representative \nof this Government, possibly at the highest level, the President \nhimself, possibly at the level of the Secretary of Defense or the \nSecretary of State, in a meeting with our allies reviewed a series of \ncontingencies. We were trying to encourage our allies to put troops \ninto Bosnia as peacekeepers in hopes that they would play a positive \nrole both in the humanitarian relief of the besieged people of Bosnia \nbut also in the containment of the level of violence that had been \noccurring. One of those concerns of our allies before they would make \nthat commitment is what would you do in the event that we have to \nremove our troops and our troops are under military siege? And we \ncommitted that as part of their obligation to go in, that we would \nassume the obligation to help them get out. That was a commitment that \nwas made in the name of the United States of America through our \nCommander in Chief and President. \n\n[[Page S 10630]]\n\n  If we are unwilling to now honor that commitment, as I fear the \nimplications of this resolution is that we are so unwilling, I believe \nwe strike a fundamental and maybe lethal blow to not only our world \nleadership but also our capacity to function as a Nation attempting to \nestablish a singular credible policy position in the world.\n  So, Mr. President, I fear that we have much at risk here to the \nUnited States' national interest. And as a U.S. Senator and as a U.S. \nSenate, I think that is where our principal focus should be. What is in \nour national interest? It is not in our national interest to adopt a \nresolution that would cause us to abrogate a solemn international \nagreement which had the result of placing the United States troops at \nrisk, has the potential of causing this serious conflict in Bosnia to \nbecome an even greater fire throughout southern Europe. It is not in \nour interest to see the integrity of NATO put at risk. It is not in our \ninterest to see a diminution of respect for international agreements, \nand it is not in our interest to see the necessity of bipartisanship in \nforeign policy development and implementation rendered by this action.\n  So, Mr. President, I think this is a serious moment for the Nation \nand for this Senate. I would strongly urge that this resolution be \nsubstantially modified, and failing such modification be defeated.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have in a rather informal way managed \nthis afternoon's very important debate on this issue. I know speaking \nwith the majority leader, and the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, myself and others, we will urge the Senate to vote \ntonight.\n  So I would hope that Senators who are desiring to address this \nimportant matter would find the opportunity, if they so desire, to come \nto the floor as soon as possible.\n  I see the Senator from Texas. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have listened to the debate on the \nfloor tonight. It seems to me that we are all looking at the same fact \nsituation. But we are coming at it from a very different vantage point, \nand with the same facts we are coming to very different conclusions.\n  One side says this is a failed U.N. peacekeeping mission, and that we \nshould shore up the United Nations and escalate the effort that the \nUnited Nations is making. The other side says this is a failed U.N. \nmission, and within the constraints of our commitment it is time for us \nto withdraw.\n  Mr. President, I am in the second category. The time has come for us \nto get the United Nations out and let the Bosnian Moslems have a fair \nfight. We have stood by and watched while the well-armed Serbian forces \nhave waged war against the Bosnian people that has made us cry at night \nwatching what has happened.\n  The fall of Srebrenica, and the ethnic cleansing which followed, \nprovides convincing evidence of the failure of this current policy. The \nSerbs are not going to negotiate. They have demonstrated that they \nbelieve they have more to gain by fighting than negotiating. Absent a \nmilitary threat, the aggressor Serbs have no reason to negotiate in \ngood faith.\n  We have debated this issue for over a year now, and we have watched \nthe situation in Bosnia continue to deteriorate.\n  History will not judge us kindly if we continue to withhold from the \nBosnians the means to fight for their own freedom. Our action has not \nbeen one of neutrality because the effect has been to keep the Bosnian \narmy from defending themselves with the same kinds of arms that the \nSerb aggressors have had. The time has come for us to end this debate, \nwithdraw the U.N. forces, and lift the arms embargo once and for all.\n  The old adage said, ``It is preferable to die fighting on your feet \nthan to live begging on your knees.'' It is clear the Bosnians have \nmade their choice. They have been bravely fighting on their feet for \nmonths, but they have been severely limited in arms. The Bosnians are \nnot asking us to arm them. They are not asking for American troops to \ndefend them. They are simply asking to be allowed to fight their own \nfight. It is unconscionable for us to continue to deny them that basic \nright to fight for their survival.\n  What we have is a bloodstained policy which denies them the means of \ndefending themselves, and it is one which we can no longer countenance.\n  Two months ago, I stood on the border of Macedonia and Serbia. I was \nstanding side by side with our Americans with U.N. blue caps. They were \nat an outpost watching the border to make sure that this fight did not \nspread. I returned to the United States to find that our administration \nwas considering requests from our allies which will only draw the \nUnited States deeper and deeper into an implacable situation. We are \nbeing asked to help increase and reinforce the U.N. mission in Bosnia, \nmore airstrikes, and a larger U.N. ground force. For us to participate \nin such a plan would be a grave mistake.\n  We are considering increasing the U.N. involvement when the message \ncould not be more clear. What we are doing is not working. The last \nthing we should do is increase that commitment.\n  I have been opposed to sending ground troops into Bosnia, and in \nlight of recent developments, my resolve is even stronger. Any decision \nto involve United States forces in additional air support roles would \ntake us two steps closer to a United States ground presence in Bosnia.\n  I heard the Senator from Massachusetts earlier today saying maybe it \nwould be a balance, that we would provide air cover and airstrikes for \nour allies who would be on the ground.\n  I do not think that would be a fair balance, Mr. President. The \nshootdown of Capt. Scott O'Grady served to remind us that providing air \nsupport is not without cost. It has the potential of getting us more \ndeeply involved in this conflict.\n  We are now drawing up operational plans for airstrikes should the \nSerbs move on Gorazde. We are on the brink. The U.N. is conducting a \npeacekeeping mission in a region where there is no peace. The U.N. is \nparalyzed, unable to respond and unwilling to retreat.\n  Two weeks ago, the Bosnian Serbs attacked the U.N.-designated safe \narea of Srebrenica. They rounded up the men for ``questioning.'' They \nthrew women and children out of their homes and onto the roads--no \nfood, no water. The tales of the acts of barbarism committed by the \nBosnian Serb forces are now being reported by the United Nations. One \nU.N. official said the Serb actions constituted very serious violations \nof human rights on an enormous scale that can only be described as \nbarbarous.\n  Using artillery and armored vehicles, the well-armed Serbs quickly \noverran Zepa and now they have turned their sights on Bihac, Gorazde, \nand Sarajevo.\n  For some time, this administration has argued that their reluctance \nto lift the arms embargo stems from a fear that if the arms embargo \nshould be lifted, the Bosnian Serbs would only be encouraged to go on \nthe offensive and press their attack on the Moslems.\n  This line of reasoning, Mr. President, is frustrating and beneath the \nstandards of our great Nation. The Bosnian Serbs are on the attack. \nThat should be obvious to any casual observer. The Serbs are oblivious \nto what the U.N. is doing because they have seen only empty threats and \nrhetoric. The refugees fleeing Srebrenica and Zepa provide ample \nevidence of the failure of this embargo where only one side of the \nconflict is armed.\n  I remember my meeting with the Prime Minister of Bosnia when he was \nhere just a few weeks ago. He was bemused. He said, ``I keep hearing \nthe United Nations say there are two sides to this war.'' He said, \n``There are two sides all right. One side is shooting and the other \nside is dying.''\n  That is two sides, but it is not a fair fight, and we must do \neverything in our power to let them have a fair fight without U.S. \npresence in that fight.\n  The bill we are debating acknowledges what we all know, that the \nUnited Nations can no longer function in Bosnia in anything but a \nlimited humanitarian role. Since this bill links termination of the \nembargo to United \n\n[[Page S 10631]]\nNations withdrawal, the Bosnians and those participating in the United \nNations will make ultimate decisions as to when and under what \nconditions the United Nations would withdraw and the embargo would be \nlifted.\n  By linking United Nations withdrawal to the lifting of the arms \nembargo, the Serbs will be on notice that should the U.N. leave, they \nwill get the fight they have been seeking, but it will not be with \nunarmed women and children, unarmed men. It will be a fair fight with \narmed Moslem soldiers.\n  The United Nations is an effective peacekeeper when two sides to a \ncrisis want peace. That is not the situation in Bosnia today. As the \nfrustrated Bosnian Foreign Minister said so eloquently following the \nfall of Srebrenica, ``The U.N. troops have become a hindrance, a clumsy \nreminder of the U.N.'s failure.''\n  It is time for the U.N. to abandon this failed mission, not because \nthey did not try but because the tide was not right. I urge the \nPresident to turn away from this recent shift in American policy and \ninstead of encouraging the United Nations to increase its activities, \nwe should lift the arms embargo so the Bosnian Moslems can defend \nthemselves and allow our allies to decide if they want to leave.\n  One Bosnian official said last week, ``We have never seen the United \nNations do much more than talk. We have given up on anyone from the \noutside coming to our rescue.''\n  Mr. President, we can no longer leave the Bosnians defenseless. It is \ntime to recognize the failure of our current policy and to do what it \ntakes to provide the Bosnian Government the right to defend its own \npeople from aggression. The United States has acted unilaterally \nbefore, and we will again. We must lift the arms embargo. Vice \nPresident Ganic said, ``We are dying anyway. Let us die fighting, \nfighting for our country.''\n  I think the time has come for this Senate to remember our own \nheritage. Over 200 years ago, we fought for our freedom. ``Give me \nliberty or give me death'' was the rallying cry of our soldiers. We \nshould remember the sacrifices that our forefathers willingly made \nbecause they cared so much for freedom. And we should heed the pleas \nthat come from a country far across the ocean, a country that wishes to \nfight for their freedom, their liberty, their families, and their \nfuture generations.\n  Mr. President, we must step out of the way and let them have a fair \nfight. I hope my colleagues will give overwhelming, bipartisan support \nto finally taking the stand that we have talked about and debated and \ndanced around for months on end while other people have paid the \nultimate price of enduring rape and ravage and murder, and let us let \nthem have the ability to take what is left of their country and defend \nit with the honor they are seeking.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to say that I listened very \ncarefully to the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Texas, and I \nthink it brings another very important perspective to this debate.\n I wish to express my congratulations.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. NUNN. I wonder if the Senator from Virginia would let me give a \n5- or 6-minute explanation of the amendment. I want to get the \namendment on the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would be pleased to yield to the Senator \nfrom Georgia. I would like to have the opportunity to seek recognition \nat the conclusion of his remarks.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, is the Chair in the position, since so many people are \nwishing to speak, to, in a sense, unofficially acknowledge the order in \nwhich we are standing on the floor? I think it might make things \nappropriate. I know the Senator from Michigan was here before the \nSenator from Delaware. The Senator from Delaware was here before other \npeople.\n  My inquiry is, is there an attempt on the part of the Chair to \nrecognize people in the order in which they are sitting on the floor \nwaiting to be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is beyond the power of the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. There has been an informal arrangement purely based on \ncomity among Senators, since this matter was introduced at about 2:15, \nto follow much what the Senator from Delaware has suggested. I just \nthink if we recognize among ourselves, without any request for action \nfrom the Chair, that the Senator from Virginia has been waiting, he \nrecognizes that the Senator from Georgia desires to lay down an \namendment and speak for a few minutes, the Senator from Michigan, and \nthen the Senator from Delaware, that seems to me----\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia has just made a \nstatement I could not propound in the form of a question. I thank him.\n  Mr. WARNER. We thank the Chair.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank the Senator from Virginia for yielding to me on \nthis. I would like to discuss two amendments, one very briefly and the \nother amendment in detail.\n  The first amendment that I had intended to propose to this Dole-\nLieberman bill, Mr. President, would have made it very clear that the \nPresident of the United States is authorized to use United States \nmilitary forces for the purpose of assisting in the withdrawal of \nUNPROFOR personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina provided, No. 1, that \nthe Secretary-General of NATO requests the participation of U.S. forces \nand certifies that such participation is necessary for the successful \ncompletion of the operation; No. 2, the withdrawal operation will be \ncarried out under NATO operation control and using NATO rules of \nengagement; No. 3, participating NATO forces will not be unduly in \ndanger to remove the military equipment of the UNPROFOR forces; and, \nNo. 4, the North Atlantic Council decides to conduct the operation.\n  That was one of the amendments I intended to introduce. I do not \nintend to introduce that amendment now. I think the amendment would \nenjoy substantial support on the floor. There would also be opposition \nwithout any doubt. The President has not sent up a request, and without \na request or at least an expression from President Clinton and his \nadministration that they would welcome this kind of authorization, I do \nnot think it is really appropriate to ask our colleagues to vote on \nthat kind of authorization at this time.\n  I do add, though, Mr. President, that everyone should understand--and \nI hope the American public understands--that the amendment that we are \ndebating, the Dole-Lieberman resolution, basically encourages the \nUnited Nations to withdraw from Bosnia. In encouraging the United \nNations to withdraw from Bosnia, the enticement is very clear--the \nunilateral lifting of the arms embargo, as the amendment is currently \ndrawn, if the United Nations withdraws after a request by the President \nof Bosnia. So that gives the President of Bosnia an incentive to make \nthat request.\n  Now, I think for the Senate, we need to understand that if the U.N. \nforces withdraw, President Clinton has clearly said publicly--I am not \nsure it has been focused on all over the country--but it is clear that \nthe President of the United States has committed to send U.S. military \nforces if requested by NATO to assist in the withdrawal of U.N. and \nNATO forces.\n  I happen to believe the President is correct on this. I believe that \nwe do have an obligation if there is a withdrawal and if we are needed. \nIf, of course, withdrawal can be accomplished in a peaceful way without \nU.S. forces, then that would suit all of us better. But if we are \nneeded, we have had two Presidents, President Bush as well as President \nClinton, who have encouraged our allies to go in there on the ground. \nThe United States has not sent ground troops. But we have had President \nClinton encourage, even to this day, the U.N. forces and the forces of \nour NATO allies to remain on the ground. And for them to get in \ndifficulty on withdrawal and for the United States not to come to their \nassistance, as already expressed publicly and \n\n[[Page S 10632]]\nprivately by the President of the United States, in my view, would deal \na lethal blow to the alliance we have been part of since World War II.\n  So I think no one should make any mistake about it here on the floor \nof the Senate. The Senate of the United States is going to have to face \nup to this question at some point if there is a withdrawal. And the \nDole-Lieberman amendment anticipates, in fact encourages, withdrawal.\n  I had hoped we would join this issue on the floor. I know that there \nare a number of Senators who agree with me on both sides of the aisle. \nI know that the Senator from Kansas, Senator Dole, and Senator \nLieberman have both indicated that they would support this general type \nresolution. I am not talking about this specific wording. But there are \nSenators who would oppose it. But at this stage, without a request by \nthe President, or without at least an expression by the President that \nhe would encourage this kind of proposal at this time, then, in my \nview, it is not appropriate to present it for a vote at this time. But \nit cannot be avoided. At some point we are going to have to face up to \nit. And I hope the Congress of the United States will understand what \nis at stake here. Far more than the question of Bosnia, what is at \nstake is U.S. leadership, United States commitment, and the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization itself were we to choose not to support \nthe President's commitment here and not to help our allies.\n  Mr. President, I do intend to send another amendment to the desk. We \nmade a few changes in it. I have talked to the Senator from Virginia, \nSenator Warner. I ask that Senator Graham, the Senator from Florida, be \nadded as a cosponsor of this amendment. This amendment I will describe \nbriefly and when it is retyped with a couple of small changes, \ntechnical but important changes, then I will send it to the desk as \ncalled for in the unanimous consent order.\n  Mr. President, this amendment that I will send to the desk in a few \nminutes has two aspects. First, it adds a new finding that reiterates \nthe position of the contact group that was first expressed in July 1994 \nand maintained ever since. And that is that the U.N. Security Council \ntermination of the Bosnian arms embargo would be unavoidable as a last \nresort if the Bosnian Serbs continue to reject the contact group's \nproposal.\n  Mr. President, the contact group is composed of Britain, France, \nGermany, the United States, and Russia. This is a statement they issued \nin July of 1994. And I want to repeat that the contact group itself \nsaid that the termination of a Bosnian arms embargo would be \nunavoidable as a last resort if the Bosnian Serbs continue to reject \nthe contact group's proposal. Of course, we all know the contact \ngroup's proposal has continued to be rejected by the Bosnian Serbs.\n  Second, this amendment adds a new provision that would require the \nPresident, President Clinton, to immediately introduce and to press to \na vote in the U.N. Security Council a resolution offered by the United \nStates to terminate the Bosnian arms embargo on a multilateral basis if \nthe Bosnian Government requests the withdrawal of the U.N. forces or if \nthe troop-contributing countries or the Security Council decides to \nwithdraw the U.N. forces from Bosnia. The resolution would provide that \nthe Bosnian arms embargo would be terminated no later than the \ncompletion of the withdrawal of the U.N. forces from Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I believe that it is important to set up a mechanism \nas a part of this bill to ensure that the Clinton administration seeks \nto achieve a multilateral lift of the Bosnian arms embargo if the \nevents stipulated in the Dole-Lieberman bill for triggering the embargo \nshould occur. In other words, the Dole-Lieberman bill now visualizes a \nunilateral lift of the embargo if these events are triggered. What this \namendment would do is insert that, before that unilateral embargo was \nlifted unilaterally, the President would go to the United Nations \nSecurity Council and seek a multilateral lift. I emphasize, this \namendment would not delay the Dole-Lieberman unilateral lift, because \nthat is now not going to occur until after the U.N. forces have been \nremoved from Bosnia, pursuant to either their own decision or pursuant \nto a request from the President of Bosnia to the Security Council.\n  Mr. President, if the Dole-Lieberman amendment is enacted into law, \nit would result, as it now stands without this amendment, in the \nunilateral lifting of the Bosnian arms embargo upon the withdrawal of \nthe UNPROFOR in Bosnia. That might happen even if my amendment were \nadopted. I will make that clear, also. But we would at least first seek \na U.N. multilateral lift, which I think most people in this body prefer \nas the first choice.\n  This arms embargo was established with the concurring vote of the \nUnited States during the Bush administration. It has been complied with \nthroughout by the Clinton administration. Mr. President, I think it \nwould be an unfortunate precedent if the United States, a permanent \nmember of the U.N. Security Council, a member who has been the \nstrongest supporter of various arms and economic embargoes on countries \nsuch as Iraq and Libya, which continue to this day, was to lift the \nembargo unilaterally on Bosnia without at least first going to the \nSecurity Council and asking for a multilateral lift before we take \nunilateral action.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that if the decision is made to \nwithdraw the U.N. forces from Bosnia, then the Security Council should \nbe receptive to a lifting of the Bosnian arms embargo on a multilateral \nbasis. And I repeat, the contact group, composed of Britain and France \nand Germany and the United States and Russia, have issued a statement \nlast year saying as a last resort they believe the United Nations \nSecurity Council should lift the embargo. That indicates at least \nimplicitly some support in that group when we get down to the last \nresort.\n  Mr. President, if we are not close to the last resort in Bosnia, we \nare very, very close to it. I think we are close to it if we are not \nalready there. Our allies who have troops on the ground in Bosnia and \nwho have resisted the termination of the arms embargo because it would \nendanger their troops, should be willing to vote for such a resolution \nonce their troops are out of Bosnia. If we can get a multilateral lift \nin the Security Council, it would be a much better, much improved \nsituation for the United States because we would not meet ourselves \ncoming back on such critical embargoes as Iraq where there is strong \nsentiment by some members of the Security Council to lift that embargo \nand where we resist lifting that embargo. Mr. President, I hope that we \nwill support this amendment.\n  The contact group has been on record for more than a year that the \narms embargo should be lifted by the Security Council if the Bosnian \nSerbs continue to reject the contact group's proposal. As I said, that \nis what they have done. Surely, the continued rejection by the Bosnian \nSerbs, coupled with their repeated violations of the humanitarian laws \nof war, merits a positive vote by all members of the contact group for \nsuch a resolution and, I also believe, for the Security Council to make \nthis same decision.\n  I realize there is no assurance that such a resolution would be \nadopted by the U.N. Security Council. I also realize that it is \npossible that Russia, or one of the other permanent members, would be \nin a position of vetoing this resolution. But I do believe that even if \nit is vetoed, there is no reason we should continue to avoid a vote. We \nought to at least have the Security Council vote, and we ought to make \nat least some effort to have a multilateral lift before we strike out \non our own.\n  I would have preferred that the administration would have pressed for \na vote on the resolution it submitted and supported last year, and that \nresolution was submitted by the Clinton administration pursuant to the \nDepartment of Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, which \ncalled for a multilateral lift of the Bosnian arms embargo.\n  The President committed to us in conference last year that he would \nintroduce and support such a multilateral lift effort in the Security \nCouncil. However, the administration did not ask for a vote. They did \nintroduce a resolution and they did support it, but they did not ask \nfor a vote. So there still has not been a vote at our request on this \nkey issue.\n  I realize that diplomats like to avoid unpleasant confrontations. I \nrealize the United States does not like to be on \n\n[[Page S 10633]]\nthe losing side of a U.N. vote in the Security Council, but I believe \nin this instance, it is imperative that we press this resolution for a \nmultilateral lift to a vote and at least find out where every member of \nthe Security Council stands. And if a member of the contact group who \nis also on the Security Council objects to this resolution, if it is \nintroduced by the Clinton administration pursuant to this amendment, if \nthis amendment is adopted, or if the member of the Security Council who \nis also on the contact group vetoes the resolution, then they should \nanswer the question, What did you mean when you agreed to the contact \ngroup statement that in the event of continued rejection by the Bosnian \nSerbs of the contact group's proposal for Bosnia and Herzegovina, a \ndecision in the United States Security Council to lift the embargo as a \nlast resort would be unavoidable?\n  If there is a veto, then at least we would hopefully get some \nexplanation as to what that contact group statement meant when it was \nissued last year.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I emphasize that this amendment does not \ninterfere in any way with the operation of the Dole-Lieberman bill. The \nDole-Lieberman bill requires that the Bosnian arms embargo be \nterminated upon the withdrawal of the U.N. forces from Bosnia. That \nwithdrawal will take some time.\n  We received various estimates from our military ranging from 7 to 22 \nweeks for the completion of a withdrawal operation. Best case, about 7 \nweeks; hopefully, worst case about 22 weeks. That leaves ample time, \neven under the 7-week estimate, for the Security Council to carefully \nconsider and vote on a United States resolution to multilaterally lift \nthe arms embargo on the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  Mr. President, I certainly welcome support on this amendment. Again, \nI ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Florida, Senator Graham, \nbe added as a cosponsor. I hope there will be other cosponsors as the \ndebate continues.\n  I yield the floor and, again, I thank my friend from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. At the outset, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a \ncosponsor to the amendment of the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Madam President, as we watch the sovereignty, independence, \nand territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina \nwither under Serbian attack, we are faced with a very difficult choice: \nStay the course with the U.N. and allied forces on the ground in the \nhope of limiting the bloodshed and containing fighting as best we can, \nor breaking with the current policy and letting the Bosnian Army defend \nitself.\n  I am troubled by the fact that we treat Bosnia and Herzegovina as a \nbarren wasteland, not as a country. We have slipped so far into a \npolicy of sustaining and occupying U.N. force in the Balkans for the \nsake of rebuffing Serbian aggression that we shut aside the views and \naspirations of Bosnian Government officials, Prime Minister Silajdic \namong them.\n  Madam President, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a living, breathing \ncountry, represented in Washington, at the United Nations and around \nthe world. We should respect and listen to the views of its officials \nand not ignore them.\n  Like many of our colleagues, I met recently with the Prime Minister, \nand he angrily intoned that our policy of militarily straitjacketing \nhis forces made us complicit in the Serbian slaughter of the Bosnian \npeople.\n  While I took very strong issue with his point that we were serving as \na partner in genocidal crime, his message was unmistakable: We and the \ninternational community are standing in the way of a free and \nindependent country seeking to fight for its very survival on its own \nterritory and terms.\n  I understand those who caution us about the consequences of letting \nweapons flow to the Bosnian Government forces. They argue that a lift-\nand-strike policy does not consider the battlefield incineration that \nmight follow. But I believe that we should leave these decisions in the \nhands of Prime Minister Silajdic and other Bosnian leaders.\n  The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, like Serbia, Croatia, and \nany other sovereign nation, should be allowed to exercise its right of \nself-defense under article 51 of the U.N. Charter, and our policies \nshould not interfere with that fundamental authority.\n  There are no painless options before us. Ultimately, there are \nsubstantial risks, and we have to be prepared to assume some of them. \nWith no peace to keep in the former Yugoslavia, however, I believe a \npolicy of simply muddling through is a prescription for failure. It \nextends the war indefinitely and provides no hope or answers to the \nBosnian people on how the community of nations intends to help defer \nSerbian aggression. I advocated pushing our allies much harder earlier \nto change course, but they have clung to a policy of defending the \nstatus quo.\n  As the situation on the ground has worsened, we have failed to \nrespond decisively in any way. Given that bleak outlook, I have \nconsistently supported an approach in the past that allows the Bosnian \nGovernment to defend its people and territory. We have voted on seven \nseparate occasions on the arms embargo question and, in each instance, \nI have supported giving the Bosnian Army the military capability to \ndefend itself. And I will support legislation again tonight that I \nbelieve provides the only real chance for eventually establishing a \npermanent and lasting peace in the Balkans, and that is by lifting the \narms embargo.\n  I should note, however, that while I share the goals of what is \nlikely to be a majority of my colleagues regarding the lifting of the \nembargo, I am deeply troubled by the invasive means by which we \nencroach on Presidential authority.\n  On war and peace issues, I have long advocated placing our trust and \nsupport in the hands of our Commander in Chief.\n  This legislation, admittedly, challenges Presidential authority \noutright and sets a bad precedent for our intervention in executive \nbranch prerogatives. But we have been urging this course of action \nliterally for years now, and yet the genocidal slaughter continues.\n  Madam President, I feel Congress ought to exercise its oversight on \nmatters of national security with great caution and be particularly \nsensitive to actions that might have the effect of micromanaging \nforeign policy or usurping the President's constitutional \nresponsibilities.\n  I have tried to support Presidents of both parties on defense and \nforeign policy decisions, and I want to continue to do so in the \nfuture.\n  Serbian atrocities, beyond the pale, however, force the Senate to act \ntoday. Ethnic cleansing, gang rapes, hostage-taking of noncombatant \npeacekeepers, and pillaging the eastern enclaves of Bosnia, demand an \nunequivocal United States response. In that case, it is lifting the \narms embargo.\n  An affirmative policy of lift and strike will clarify to Serb \nmarauders that their military campaign is ultimately a futile one and \nthat a negotiated settlement is the only way out.\n  For now, Serb gunners and soldiers have no incentive to lay down \ntheir arms. They brazenly march ahead. Srebrenica last week, and then \nZepa, Bihac today, and Gorazde tomorrow, fighting a defenseless enemy.\n  Bosnian Government soldiers, lacking the wherewithal to fight back, \nretreat and scatter. UNPROFOR stands as an idle force nearby, if \nanything, helping Belgrade's aspiration for achieving a greater Serbia. \nWhile UNPROFOR certainly deserves credit for supporting humanitarian \nmissions, the war-torn Balkans, separating the combatants and \nattempting to deter atrocities, I do not see how the international \ncommunity can afford to keep peacekeepers in a region where there is no \npeace. The role of UNPROFOR has gone from keeping the peace to \nregulating the war. It is time for a change.\n  Secretaries Christopher and Perry, for whom I have enormous personal \nrespect, visited us again today and said now is not the right time to \nunilaterally lift the embargo. \n\n[[Page S 10634]]\n\n  Time is running out on the Bosnia people. If not now, when? The \nescalation of events these last few days with Bihac under attack today, \nunderscores 3 years of failure to achieve a peaceful settlement.\n  Madam President, this civil war, in my view, must ultimately be \nresolved by the different groups within the former Yugoslavia. We \nshould conduct a policy that provides the greatest incentive for both \nsides to peacefully negotiate their differences at the bargaining \ntable.\n  To wit, I believe the United States should first press our allies for \nthe expeditious withdrawal of UNPROFOR; second, lift the arms embargo \nmultilaterally, if possible, unilaterally, if we must; third, continue \nto isolate the Bosnian Serbs politically and economically; fourth, not \nharbor any illusions about the consequences of lifting the embargo.\n  We cannot duck the question of whether United States forces--up to \n25,000, in some scenarios--will be required near and in Bosnia to help \nextract UNPROFOR.\n  President Clinton has pledged to support UNPROFOR's emergency \nextraction. In my judgment, this is the right thing to do. We ought to \ngo on record supporting him in this regard. In that regard, I certainly \nsupport the Senator from Georgia.\n  With emergency extraction, however, come risks. Both the Bosnian \nSerbs and the Bosnian Government forces could choose to interdict the \nUNPROFOR withdrawal. Given the narrow and fragile transportation routes \nin Bosnia, either side could do much to accomplish this goal.\n  Closer examination suggests that neither side has a compelling \nincentive to prevent UNPROFOR's withdrawal by force. The Bosnian \nGovernment would be loathe to attack its potential supporters, and \nalthough the Bosnian Serbs are benefiting immensely from UNPROFOR's \nindecisiveness, they would have no rational reason to delay UNPROFOR's \ndeparture.\n  We must accept, however, that lifting the embargo will not and can \nnot mean the end of United States involvement. The Bosnian Government \nwill request that the U.S. provide airstrikes to stem a Bosnia Serb \nadvance. It is reasonable to expect that the United States will need to \ncontinue the equivalent of Deny Flight to keep the skies free of \nBosnian Serb air power. The United States may have to take an active \nrole in supplying the Bosnian Government with arms and equipment, \nintelligence, and training, and the United States will have to supply \nextensive humanitarian assistance by airdrops and other means to \ncompensate for the departure of the humanitarian assistance personnel.\n  The Balkans conflagration may well get worse before it gets better, \nimplementing a lift and strike plan, but it is going to end sooner due \nto it, and it will save many innocent victims in the long run.\n  These, Madam President, are not attractive options. There are no \nattractive options before the Senate.\n  Accordingly, Madam President, I believe that the United States should \nlead by example and not be deterred by protestations from our allies on \nlifting the embargo unilaterally if they choose not to join us.\n  The time has come to give the Bosnian Government a fighting chance. I \nhope the Senate will send that message in resounding fashion. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I am happy to yield to the Senator \nfrom Virginia if he has a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. I simply wish to address the Chair and those present. We \nare following an informal order. The Senator from Michigan has waited \nfor about an hour and a half. Somehow it has worked out for 5\\1/2\\ \nhours.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I think it is good to follow an \norder. I know the Senator from Michigan was here before I was on the \nfloor and I am happy to yield at this time to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I wonder if I could get in line.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, what we have done before is just \nrecognize Senators. The Senator from Maine has been here for some \nperiod off and on.\n  Perhaps, without seeking ratification by the Chair, just among \nourselves, have a comity by which the Senator from Michigan be followed \nby the Senator from Kansas. The Senator from Delaware, very definitely, \nhas been here.\n  Mr. COHEN. I object, because none of us will get to speak.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, maybe he will learn something.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Michigan, Delaware, Kansas, Rhode \nIsland, and then Maine.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator from Maine was here before I was.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will reverse that. The Senator from Arizona is behind \nthat group.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator restate that.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will first recognize the Senator from Michigan, \nfollowed by the Senator from Kansas, followed by the Senator from \nDelaware, followed by the Senator from Maine, followed by the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, and then the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, did we get a firm commitment that the \nSenator from Delaware will be in his usual crisp style?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from Michigan yield for a unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order of recognition be \nas described by the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I say to my friend from Maine and from Rhode Island, had \nthey listened to the Senator from Delaware 2 years ago, we would not be \nhaving this debate today.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Madam President. I also thank the Senator \nfrom Kansas for yielding. I promise for my part to be quite concise \nhere tonight.\n  I rise today in support of S. 21, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Self-\nDefense Act of 1995. I do so because I believe it is past time for us \nto allow the Bosnian Government to defend itself against naked and \ncruel aggression. The United Nations has failed to protect this state, \nNATO has been prevented from effectively protecting this state, and the \nvaliant peacekeepers on the ground have been placed in the impossible \nposition of keeping the peace where there is no peace to keep. Under \nthese circumstances, the United States cannot continue to abide by an \nembargo that punishes the very people it was meant to protect.\n  I did not always believe that lifting the arms embargo was necessary. \nPreviously, I considered the introduction of yet more weapons to this \nwar to be destabilizing and capable of pushing the conflict outside of \nthe former Yugoslavia.\n  However, this is no longer the case. The arms embargo has not been \nobserved by all sides. Because of these violations, the Bosnian Serbs \npossess a disproportionate number of heavy weapons and as a result \npossess a clear military advantage that cannot be overcome by the \ncourage, numbers, or moral authority of the Bosnian Government; it can \nonly be met by similar arms.\n  When we recently me with the Prime Minister of Bosnia, he stated ``We \ndo not want American, French, British or any other country's boys to \nfight for Bosnia. Our own boys are willing to fight for our country. \nThe problem is we do not have the means to defend ourselves.'' It is \nthe arms embargo that is denying the Bosnians those means, and it is \nthe arms embargo that must end.\n  Mr. President, I believe a full discussion of this issue must also \ninclude Croatia. The Bosnian-Croatian Federation represents one of the \nstrongest mechanisms to bolster Bosnian sovereignty, and must not be \nforgotten. Strong democratic institutions are taking root in Croatia, \nand the Croatians in Bosnia are capable of helping secure similar \nliberties in Bosnia. I am concerned that lifting the embargo on Bosnia \nalone will kill this federation in \n\n[[Page S 10635]]\nits infancy and with it, one of the strongest allies the Bosnians may \nhave.\n  For the Croatians to feel capable of assisting in the defense of \nBosnia, they must also feel capable of defending themselves. Therefore, \nif we are to claim the Bosnian Government is entitled to have access to \nthe arms necessary to defend themselves, then so too are the Croatians. \nI commend Senators Hatch and Gorton for also raising this important \nconsideration, and would welcome efforts to address this issue.\n  But the whole of the Balkans is not the issue before us today, it is \nBosnia alone. With Bosnia, we must act now. To continue to sit idly \nwhile the Bosnian Moslems are systematically evicted from their homes, \nrounded up like cattle for forced relocation, and uniformly persecuted \nsimply because they are Moslem is wrong. The United States has the \ncapacity to provide the means necessary for Bosnian self-defense, but \nhas for too long remained on the sidelines, using as an excuse one \nthing after another, primarily the inaction of multilateral \ninstitutions which were never designed to meet such threats, and which \nare not and may never be capable of doing so.\n  I did not come here today to say this administration is totally to \nblame for the tragedy in Bosnia. Mistakes were made before, and \ncontribute to the problems we face now. However, the current \nadministration has broadened these problems because of its failure to \nenunciate a clear set of national security interests in Bosnia, a set \nof goals to protect those interests, and a decisive plan to achieve \nthose goals.\n  This is the very essence of foreign policy, and yet the \nAdministration has been unwilling and incapable of formulating even \nthis basic building block so vital to the protection of our national \ninterests.\n  Where this has led the United States is a policy of mindless \nreaction. We repeatedly find ourselves responding to the latest crisis \nin the Balkans, wondering which course to take next instead of taking \ndeliberate action intended to achieve a precise set of goals. So I \nthink now is the time to develop a strategy that will give us the \ncapacity to make wise decisions that will stand the test of time.\n  We must not allow such short sightedness to happen again. Some day \nsoon, we could very well find ourselves facing an even more serious set \nof decisions concerning Bosnia or some other part of the world--the \nissue of sending American troops into harms way. Making such decisions \nwithout a strategy in place is a prescription for disaster. Hence, the \nvalue of staking out a clear path to follow.\n  So let today or tomorrow, whenever these votes shall come, be the \nwatershed. Let us first decide today to restore the right of self-\ndefense to the people of Bosnia. Hopefully this will provide that \ngovernment the means necessary to bring about a just and lasting peace. \nBut we must be prepared for the next crisis, and that requires our \nimmediate examination of the complete issue, and our role in its \nresolution.\n  I applaud the bipartisan leadership of the majority leader and the \nSenator from Connecticut in addressing the problems we face today. I \nlook forward to their continued leadership in defining our long-term \ninterests and plans in the Balkans to avoid these crises in the future. \nBut for today, I call on my colleagues to support this effort and bring \nto the Bosnian people an opportunity to fight for their country, their \npeople, and their land.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, the Senate has returned once again \nto the question of whether the United States should act unilaterally in \nlifting the arms embargo on Bosnia. We debated this course before and \nrejected it for what I believed then, and I still believe, were \ncompelling reasons.\n  I listened with great interest to the amendment that was put forward \nby the Senator from Georgia, [Mr. Nunn], about some language that \nwould, indeed, begin to make it a collective action on the part of the \nSecurity Council and with our allies. This approach may be something \nthat will improve, although I hope not unduly confuse further, the \nlanguage in the bill. It seems to me that does open possibilities, but \nI would like to explain why I still share deep concerns about \nunilaterally lifting the embargo.\n  I well understand--in fact, I share--the sense of frustration and \nanger that underlies this legislation. Time after time, we and our \nallies have failed to find a consensus for acting on the pressing and \nhorrific situation in Bosnia. Time after time, we have been cowed and \nbuffaloed by the Bosnian Serbs and by Serbia. We have appeared, and \nhave been, indecisive, ineffective, and divided.\n  It is, therefore, no surprise that unilateral American action has \ngreat appeal to many Senators and will, I do not doubt, be approved by \na large number of Members of the Senate at the end of this debate. That \nmay make us feel better. But I am not at all sure that it means it is \nthe right solution.\n  I have enormous respect for the bill's authors. The majority leader \nand my colleague from Kansas, [Mr. Dole], has been a firm, consistent, \nand powerful advocate for clear and concerted action in Bosnia, as has \nhis coauthor, the Senator from Connecticut, [Mr. Lieberman]. This is a \nbipartisan effort. It is not a partisan effort.\n  Given the President's failure to produce a consensus with our allies \nfor such action, it may well be that Congress must step into the breach \nby dictating a go-it-alone American strategy. If so, I think we should \nnot fool ourselves about the realities that may follow.\n  All the old arguments against this course are still valid, I believe. \nIn acting unilaterally, we are breaking the kind of international \nagreement that we have needed before and we may need again. We are \ncreating a precedent for others to thumb their noses at the \ninternational community. In acting alone, we are directly undercutting \nour allies, primarily the British and the French, who have troops on \nthe ground in Bosnia. Those troops will be the first targets of what \ncould be a steadily escalating conflict, as the Serbs seek a decisive \nvictory before Bosnia can obtain the heavy weapons to prolong the war. \nIn acting alone, we may force the total abandonment of humanitarian \nrelief. But despite the profound flaws of the current effort, and they \nhave been significant, its elimination would create enormous hardship \nand disaster in the short run. Finally, in acting alone, we will give \nforce to our failure of leadership. Madam President, this may be, in \nsome ways, the most significant and subtle aspect of this.\n  Far from demonstrating America's willingness and ability to lead the \nwest, unilateral action is the final concession that we can find no one \nwilling to follow us. The full impact of that admission may not stop in \nBosnia. It could be felt for a long time to come in NATO and other \nmultilateral organizations that are vital to our national interests.\n  Against these very real dangers, supporters of this legislation raise \nthe argument that since we, our allies and United Nations cannot defend \nBosnia--which we clearly have not--then Bosnia should be allowed to \ndefend itself by lifting the arms embargo. It is a compelling argument, \nmade more effective each day as the allies and the U.N. forces appear \nmore and more ineffective.\n  We have all felt this as we have watched food convoys be turned back \nbecause there was a Bosnian Serb tank blocking the convoy, and rather \nthan stand up and say, ``This food delivery is going to get through,'' \nit turns around and retreats.\n  Certainly, Bosnia has the right to defend itself. What it lacks is \nthe ability to defend itself. This legislation, by itself, cannot \ncreate that ability. That can only happen as Bosnia obtains armaments \nand supplies and then trains its forces in their use. That will take a \ngreat deal of effort and money--which we here may or may not be willing \nto provide--but most of all it will take time.\n and not that that is not also important. But we have to recognize that \nit will take time. There is going to be a certain period of time in \nthere in which the armament--the large armament and the capability to \ndo so--they will still be trying to put it in place. And the population \nthat we most want to help can be at risk.\n  The reality is that the only time left to Bosnia may be that \npurchased by the international community. Clearly, the U.N. protection \nforce [UNPROFOR] \n\n[[Page S 10636]]\nhas not and cannot serve that purpose in any effective way and its \nmission should be ended.\n  Whether the current shift of policy will produce an effective \nreplacement for the U.N. force remains to be seen. There is \nconsiderable confusion and many conflicting signals about the role of \nNATO air power and the new rapid reaction force being put in place by \nBritain and France. It is possible that this new policy will never \nevolve into an effective force but I believe we must not cut off that \npossibility prematurely.\n  If in passing this legislation we undermine that international \neffort, we may prove that it is still possible to make the situation in \nBosnia even worse.\n  Madam President, this legislation is well intended. The anger and \ndismay of its authors is well founded. It may be the right thing to do, \nbut I do not believe so and I will oppose it as it presently is \npresented.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I understand the unanimous consent order \nwas that I was to be recognized next. My colleague from Maine has asked \nwhether or not he might be able to go first. I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be able to yield to him since he was next in line and then have \nmy opportunity to speak when the Senator from Maine finishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                  The ``Uniting for Peace'' Amendment\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Madam President, let me thank my friend from Delaware, and \nespecially in view of the fact that I expect that he will engage in a \nvery passionate recitation which may start out to be 15 minutes but I \nsuspect will extend long beyond that time. I say that having been the \nbeneficiary of many of his speeches here in the Senate and in many \ncases having been enlightened as a result of his taking the floor.\n  Madam President, let me just respond to some of the comments offered \nby my colleague from Georgia who has not offered yet but has outlined \nan amendment that I believe goes a long way toward addressing the \nconcerns of the administration and many of our colleagues in the Senate \nover the implications of a unilateral lifting of the arms embargo in \nBosnia.\n  The administration has made the point, I believe, to the Democratic \ncaucus, to the Republican conference, that if we lift the embargo \nunilaterally, the United States is then going to be endangering the \nviability and the continuing force of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and Libya. \nSo to deal with this concern, Senator Nunn is proposing--or will \npropose--an amendment that directs the President to seek a vote in the \nU.N. Security Council on lifting the embargo as the President has said \nhe would do and as the Senate urged him to do last August in the Nunn-\nMitchell amendment.\n  I might point out that Senator Nunn was on the floor last year in \nAugust asking the President to go to the United Nations to seek a \nresolution on this. And, of course, the President went but did not seek \na vote in order to lift the embargo.\n  Senator Nunn's amendment aims to achieve a multilateral action. The \namendment does not in any way, as he said, impact upon the provisions \nof Dole-Lieberman. It simply strives to give the greatest possible \ninternational support of U.S. policy.\n  Here is my concern. If the Nunn amendment is accepted and becomes \npart of the bill, once UNPROFOR decides or is asked to leave, the \nPresident would then go to the United Nations and seek a multilateral \nlifting of the embargo. Then, obviously, that resolution could be \nvetoed by one of the members of the Security Council. I think it is \nreasonable to expect that. I think it is inevitable it would occur.\n  At that point, as I understand the legislation, the President would \nbe required to automatically lift the embargo unilaterally as soon as \nUNPROFOR's withdrawal from Bosnia is complete. Once he has made the \neffort under the Nunn approach to go to the U.N., and it fails, because \neither they fail to take action in the U.N. Security Council or a \npermanent member vetoes it, then under the Dole-Lieberman bill the \nPresident will be required to lift the embargo unilaterally.\n  It raises an issue that we have to contend with. If the Security \nCouncil undertakes consideration of the measure and a permanent member \nof the Security Council vetoes it or prevents it from coming to a vote, \nthen under terms of this legislation, automatically the President will \nbe forced to lift the embargo. Does that not flout the U.N. Security \nCouncil? That is one way of interpreting it.\n  What I suggest as a possible option--and it is something that we \nought to consider during the course of this evening, and if the matter \ncarries over until tomorrow, we can consider it at that time as well--\nis to consider requiring under that scenario that the matter be taken \ndirectly to the General Assembly. Under existing procedures, the United \nNations does have a way to bring this matter before the General \nAssembly.\n  The ``Uniting for Peace'' resolution was created at the initiative of \nthe Truman administration during the Korean war. It has been a part of \nU.N. practice and procedures since 1950, and basically it works as \nfollows. If the Security Council is unable to act on an issue affecting \ninternational peace and security because of disagreement among the \npermanent members of the Council, consideration of the issue can be \nmoved to the General Assembly. This is done through a procedural \nresolution in the Council, which is not subject to a veto.\n  Secretary of State Dean Acheson, who was the father of the ``Uniting \nfor Peace'' idea, said at the time of its adoption, ``The General \nAssembly can and should organize itself to discharge its responsibility \npromptly and decisively if the Security Council is prevented from \nacting.''\n  The 1950 resolution, itself, states that ``the failure of the \nSecurity Council to discharge its responsibilities on behalf of all the \nMember States--does not relieve the Member States of their obligations \nor the United Nations of its responsibilities under the Charter to \nmaintain international peace and security--(S)uch failure does not \ndeprive the General Assembly of its rights or relive it of its \nresponsibilities under the Charter in regard to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security--.''\n  In the event of a failure by the Security Council to counter a threat \nto international peace and security, the resolution states that ``the \nGeneral Assembly shall consider the matter immediately--.'' The General \nAssembly's powers in such circumstances are far-reaching. The \nresolution for example, states that the Assembly can call on Member \nStates to take ``collective measures including, in the case of a breach \nof the peace or act of aggression, the use of armed forces when \nnecessary.''\n  It has been pointed out during the debate that in each of the last \ntwo years, the General Assembly has voted overwhelmingly and without \ndissent to lift the embargo. This has been to no avail, however, \nbecause the Security Council has primary authority on questions of \ninternational peace and security. But once the Council has failed to \nact because of a conflict among the permanent members and the Uniting \nfor Peace process is invoked, authority shifts to the General Assembly \nto take the matter up.\n  I suggest that this is one option we may want to consider. I realize \nit may pose some difficulties for Members; namely, if we take the \nmatter to the General Assembly and the General Assembly \noverwhelmingly--as it has done on two prior occasions--votes to lift \nthe embargo, are we not setting a precedent that other efforts will be \nmade to invoke the General Assembly's authority on measures that we \nmight not like to see go forward? That is an issue we have to contend \nwith.\n  I might point out that use of this procedure is, in fact, not \nunprecedented. This procedure has been used at least eight times. It \nwas used by the United States in 1950 to respond to a Soviet veto of a \nresolution regarding North Korea's aggression. Subsequently, the \n``United for Peace'' mechanism was invoked to support international \naction in the Suez crisis; also in response to the invasion of Hungary \nback in 1956; the Lebanon crisis of 1958; \n\n[[Page S 10637]]\nthe crisis in the Congo in 1960; and the question of Bangladesh in \n1971. It was used again after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. A \nresolution was introduced to condemn the Soviet Union for that \ninvasion, but a veto was cast by the Soviet Union and the matter was \ntaken to the General Assembly.\n  So in the event that the Nunn amendment does not include my provision \nor in the event that the Nunn amendment is not tabled, then it would be \nin order to take up the second-degree amendment that I would like to \noffer. s\n  Let me just give you a few reasons why I think we should give this \nsecond-degree amendment serious consideration. First, it would serve as \na means to enable the members of the U.N. to exercise their right and \nobligation under the U.N. charter to maintain international peace and \nsecurity even if the Security Council fails to act.\n  Second, it would allow the United States to act in conjunction with \nthe more than 100 U.N. members states who have voted during the last 2 \nyears for the General Assembly resolutions urging the lifting of the \nembargo.\n  Third, it would recognize the importance of multilateral action in \nthis critical area. As such, I believe it meets the objections the \nadministration and a number of our colleagues have raised during the \ncourse of this debate regarding the damage that a unilateral lifting of \nthe embargo would cause to the credibility and integrity of the United \nNations system. We would be going to the General Assembly where, with \noverwhelming support, lifting the arms embargo would be undertaken as a \nU.N. action. It would not be a unilateral lifting, as would result \nunder the Dole-Lieberman bill, even if it is amended by Senator Nunn.\n  And fourth, let me suggest that it perhaps reduces the likelihood of \na veto in the Security Council because all the permanent members would \nbe on notice that the United States is going to seek to refer the \nmatter to the General Assembly.\n  For each of these reasons, I would respectfully ask my colleagues to \nconsider it this evening. I think it adds to the Nunn resolution. It \ndoes pose the issue of whether or not we want to see this procedure \ninvoked when it may be adverse to our interests. That is something with \nwhich we have to deal. My basic question would be whether or not we \nwant to be in a position to obtain multilateral action in lifting the \nembargo, when we know that one or more permanent members might veto or \nwill exercise a veto in the Security Council. If a veto is to be \nexercised, then going to the Security Council is really a futile act. \nAnd second, the bill would require the President automatically to then \ngo and unilaterally lift the embargo. With my second-degree amendment, \nthe matter would be brought to the General Assembly to take action on a \nmultilateral basis. I believe that would be preferable to taking \nunilateral action ignoring the U.N. Security Council.\n  So I thank my colleagues for their deference, especially the Senator \nfrom Delaware for his consideration. This is only a proposal. I would \nask my colleagues to consider it during the course of the debate. I may \nnot offer it. But I have talked to Senator Nunn about it, and we share, \nI think, mutual concerns about the procedure we are now invoking in \ngoing to the United Nations. But I think it is a worthwhile endeavor on \nour part to give it serious consideration. I now yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, as the Chair observed, many of my \ncolleagues have commented on my passion on this issue. In the last 2\\1/\n2\\ years I have probably risen in the Chamber a dozen times to speak on \nthis issue. I know they do not mean to suggest otherwise, but I do not \napologize for my passion on this issue.\n  In the 23 years I have been here, there is not another issue that has \nmore upset me, angered me, frustrated me, and occasionally made me feel \na sense of shame about what the West, what the democratic powers in the \nworld, are allowing to happen.\n  I have on two occasions, with a year interval between, visited \nBosnia, Croatia, and Serbia. This does not make me qualified for \nanything other than explaining the depth of my concern and anger on \nthis issue. I have been in and out on more than one occasion in \nSarajevo and Tuzla and other safe areas. I have seen, as many have on \ntelevision, and I personally have interviewed in the camps, people who \nliterally as a consequence of the cleansing left--literally, not \nfiguratively--their elderly mother on a frozen mountaintop to die \nbecause it would have slowed up the whole family to continue with her.\n  I, quite frankly, never thought that--as a young Senator arriving \nhere when I was 30 years old with a traditional education both in \nundergraduate and graduate school with a focus on history--I would ever \nstand in the Chamber of the Senate and hear people refer to the policy \nof ethnic cleansing in anything other than a historical context. I \nnever thought I would stand in this Chamber and read accounts and \nhear--not from Senators but in the general discussions--about how the \nBosnian Government and the Bosnian people are trying to sucker us to \nget involved.\n  I remember reading about people saying that the Jews in the Warsaw \nghetto were trying to sucker us into a war against Germany. We have a \nway in this modern day to make the victim the aggressor. We make loose \nuse of terms about this being a civil war.\n  The fact is that Bosnia is an independently recognized country--\nrecognized by the United Nations and this country--that is being \naggressively moved upon by the neighboring country of Serbia.\n  I hear people say in the media, in the councils of Europe, and even \nto some extent on the floor of the Senate that the Bosnian Government \nand the Bosnian military are Moslem.\n  When I first raised this issue for my colleagues--and I say not with \na sense of pride but with a sense of futility, that I believe I was the \nfirst to raise this issue with my colleagues several years ago--it was \nnot a Moslem government. It was a multiethnic government.\n  In Sarajevo I met with the government that at the time was made up of \nover a third Bosnian Serb, about 20 percent Croat, and the rest Moslem. \nAll these people are Slavs. They are Croatian Slavs. They are Moslem \nSlavs. They are Serbian Slavs. It is not as if you read the press here \nand speak to Western leaders and it sounds as though we are talking \nabout the Government of Iran in Bosnia--or Moslem fundamentalism. All \nyou have to do is walk through the markets and the cafes. On one \noccasion when I was there, the bombing had ceased and the people were \nout. You saw Moslem men drinking liquor, and Moslem women, none of them \nwearing veils. It is not a fundamentalist Moslem society. These are \npeople for whom, when the Ottoman Empire defeated them two different \ntimes, including the Hapsburg Empire, the deal was made. If you want to \nown property in what is now Bosnia, if you want to do business, you \nmust be a Moslem. So people converted.\n This is not some occupying nation. This is not a leftover from the \nOttoman empire. These are Slavs, all Slavic people. And here I am on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate defending and arguing for a resolution \nthat was the same resolution that we passed in the last months of the \nBush administration. We passed overwhelmingly a law urging the \nPresident to push to lift the arms embargo, and authorizing President \nBush to be able to directly send $50 million worth of American military \nequipment to the Bosnian Government. We passed that. That is the law \ntoday, the law. The President needs no authority to send weapons. We \npassed it.\n\n  I stand on the floor and listen to my colleagues talk about the fall \nof the safe areas. Do you know how those safe areas became safe areas? \nThe contact group got together and said, ``I will tell you what, we \nwill make a deal with you Bosnians defending yourself in Srebrenica and \nZepa'' The two that I mentioned already have fallen. ``Here is the \ndeal. You give us the weaponry you have, and we will tell the Serbs you \nare no longer a danger. And we will protect you. We will disarm you. We \nare not only going to stop arms from coming in to you, but we are going \nto disarm you.''\n  And the Bosnian Government said OK, if that is what protects those \nfolks. And then the United Nations understandably--and I will not take \nthe time to explain why I think it is understandable--stood there and \nwatched \n\n[[Page S 10638]]\nthe Serbs come in and overrun the safe areas.\n  How many years on this floor have we heard, ``If you lift the arms \nembargo, we are going to lose the safe areas''? You saw what the \nSenator from Arizona spoke to on the floor last week. He held up a \npicture, I think from the New York Times, showing U.N. military blue-\nhelmeted personnel sitting on their weaponry watching the Serbs in \nSrebrenica divide the women from the men, to send the women to rape \ncamps, and take the able-bodied young men and send them off in another \ndirection to prison camps, and then load everybody else up on a truck \nwho was old and infirm and not suitable for rape or work and banish \nthem to a third ``safe area.''\n  Then I hear today from the administration and others on this floor \nthat what Senator Dole is proposing is not a policy. Let us review what \nthe policy of the contact group, of which we are a part, has been. And \nI challenge anyone at all within hearing distance of this discussion to \ncorrect me if I am wrong or they think I am wrong. What is the policy \nof the contact group? One, negotiate a settlement. Two, in the \nmeantime, guarantee the safe areas. That is the policy, beginning, \nmiddle, and end.\n  Now, let us examine it. When we joined the contact group--and we had \nnot been a member of the contact group--we said we are joining because \nwe had a commitment, made public, from the contact group members that, \nif in fact the contact group arrived at what they believed to be an \nequitable settlement, that they would present that settlement, which is \nessentially a division of Bosnia, to both the Bosnian Government and \nthe Serbs in Pale, and whoever rejected the contact group settlement \nwould ``suffer the repercussions.''\n  So guess what? We signed on. We came up with a proposal. I argued \nagainst it because it called for the partitioning of Bosnia, in effect, \nessentially 51-49. Presented to the Bosnian Government, they accepted \nit. Let me remind all my friends, they accepted it. And the Serbs, \nmeeting in Pale, their self-appointed ``parliament'' rejected it.\n  And what did we do? We suggested maybe we have to ease the arms \nembargo--ease the economic embargo on Belgrade to get Milosevic to put \nmore pressure on Karadzic to accept. And then we said we are going to \nuse airstrikes. Remember? That is what we said.\n  Well, obviously, the policy of a negotiated settlement is not on the \nSerb agenda. That is not part of what they are contemplating. And \nobviously we, the West and the contact group, did not fulfill our \ncommitment. We reneged. And as they say in court, ``Check the record.'' \nWe reneged. Nothing bad happened, directly or indirectly, to the Serbs.\n  Then we are told--and I hear it time and again--``You know, we cannot \nlift this embargo. Even if the Bosnian Government had weapons, they \nwould not know how to use them.'' Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, \nthe same Bosnian young men were in the same army as the Serb young men. \nThere was universal conscription until the breakup of Yugoslavia. They \nare fully as capable. They need no help. They can do it themselves. \nThey are not a bunch of folks who are not ready to fight. I heard \nsomeone say today--and because I am not sure whether it was intended to \nstay in the room or not, I will not mention the name --that he recently \nmade a commencement speech at a major university, and his predecessors \nhad made similar speeches at that university 20 years earlier and were \ngreeted with signs saying ``get out of Vietnam,'' and this particular \nperson said, ``The irony was I was greeted with signs saying `get into \nBosnia.' How ironic. Cannot we learn our lesson?''\n  The lesson is very different. Vietnamization was never a possibility \nbecause the Vietnamese people did not support it. Yet, unlike Vietnam, \nthe Bosnian Government said only one thing, ``Do not send us your men. \nDo not come and fight for us. Let us fight for ourselves.'' All those \nof you who think you are Balkan scholars, read the literature. I heard \n2 years ago on this floor, ``We cannot do anything in Bosnia. They are \nthe same forces, the Yugoslav forces that held off the Germans.'' I \nmight remind you most of that holding off was done by Bosnians in \nBosnia. They were Yugoslavs, but it was in Bosnia. These tough fighters \ndo not all live on the other side of the Drina River. The point is that \nthese folks are fully capable, have a long history of both a will and a \ncapability of defending themselves.\n  But what have we done in the name of peace? We have said, ``If you \ndefend yourselves, you will widen the war.'' Translated --we would \nrather 300,000 of your people get slaughtered in genocide than have the \nrest of us run the risk of a widening.\n  The second part of the policy--protect the safe areas. Well, does \nthat need to be spoken to? There will be no safe area, Madam President, \nwithin 6 months. That is the plan. That is how the West is going to \nsave its conscience, because if we dally around enough, do not let them \nfight for themselves, at the end of the day there will be nothing to \nprotect. We will say, ``Oh, my God, my God, what an awful thing has \nhappened.'' The Secretary of State said today, ``Many mistakes have \nbeen made. We would not do what we did again,'' in terms of policy.\n  Well, we are doing what we did again and again and again and again \nand again.\n  Madam President, I was told 2 years ago on this floor that airstrikes \ndo not work; it does not make any sense. Yet, we are told today that \nthe reason why we do not need this bill, I say to my friend from \nConnecticut, is that in London they set down the law--bang. The contact \ngroup said, ``If you, the Serbs, go at Gorazde, we will massively \nretaliate with airstrikes. It's going to work now.'' Do you not find \nthat amazing? When asked, by the way, ``Why Gorazde, why not Tuzla, \ntoo? Why not Bihac? Why not Sarajevo?'' ``Well, we intend that is \nprobably going to be covered,'' I think was the response.\n  Even a kid like me from Delaware can figure this one out. How did all \nof a sudden the threat of massive airstrikes take on a utility and \ncapability it did not possess for the last 2\\1/2\\ years? What has \nhappened? Was there a revelation? Did the Lord come down and say, \n``Mend your ways. You can do it if you have the will\"? Is that what \nhappened? And if it did happen, Madam President, I respectfully ask the \nopponents of this amendment, why only Gorazde? Why there? Why nowhere \nelse?\n  Madam President, this is not a policy. As I have said on this floor \nbefore with regard to arms control, we, the U.S. Congress, are not in a \nposition, nor were we institutionally designed to formulate foreign \npolicy. But, Madam President, we know enough to know when one stinks. \nWe know enough to know when one is recognized as a failure. We are \ninstitutionally constructed to be able to acknowledge that.\n  Madam President, the Secretary of Defense said to us today, ``if you \nlift the arms embargo, three things will certainly happen.'' I wrote \nthem down because I found them so fascinating.\n  First, the loss of the enclaves will occur. I assume that means if we \ndo not lift the arms embargo, then there is at least a chance the \nenclaves will not be lost. Two are gone out of five now. What will keep \nthe others from going?\n  Everybody understands the way this works, right? It goes like this. \nSince we did not sign onto the policy in the first place of putting the \nU.N. forces in there, and they went ahead and did that, then we, the \nUnited States, are now obliged to be there if the U.N. concludes that \nthey should no longer be there.\n  Let us go through this again. The U.N. was placed in there when \nWestern nations concluded that is what they should do. We said, ``OK, \nif that is what you want to do, but we don't think that is going to \nwork.'' Then, from the time I first introduced the lifting of the \nembargo 2\\1/2\\ years ago, I was told, ``No, if you lift the embargo, \nthe U.N. forces will leave and everybody will be slaughtered.''\n  Then that took on a new twist in its maturation. Now it goes like \nthis: ``U.N. forces are sent in, we lift the embargo, U.N. forces go \nout, we then must go in because we have committed to take the U.N. \nforces out.'' Therefore--talk about the tautology--if you vote to lift \nthe arms embargo, you are committing ground troops to fight in Bosnia. \nWe are being ``suckered in'' \n\n[[Page S 10639]]\nwas the phrase used today. Is that not amazing? How did we get there?\n  Had we listened and the arms embargo lifted, you would probably have \na stalemate on the ground by now, and probably have a settlement. \nObviously I cannot guarantee that, and we could have a wider Balkan war \nas well. Only history would be able to tell that had we acted. But now, \nJoe Lieberman, Joe Biden, and Bob Dole--who are arguing against putting \nany American forces on the ground--are told that if we prevail, we are \nthe reason America has to take over the war in Bosnia.\n  Madam President, the second thing the Secretary said today was that \nif we lift the embargo, we will damage the alliance. Tell me how you \nsave this alliance? Tell me why, I say to any of the people up here, \nthey should continue to spend $100 billion a year for NATO when there \nis no Soviet Union and they cannot even stop ethnic cleansing in their \nown back yard?\n  Third, I am told, they will send ground forces into Bosnia if we lift \nthe embargo.\n  Madam President, I am tired of all of this, and I am sure you are \ntired of hearing me over the last couple of years repeat these \narguments. But ask yourself the following question: If air power and \nthe threat of it will work to save Gorazde, why only Gorazde?\n  Another argument is that the Bosnian Army cannot fight, it would have \nto be trained and equipped. For example, the Secretary of Defense said \ntoday, if we lift the arms embargo, we will be in the position of going \nto war with our allies because we will be attempting to break the \nembargo through French lines to get in American tanks.\n  Whoa,--this is ridiculous. Madam President, the same people who say \nthese folks cannot fight are the same people who worry--on this floor \nand in the press 2 months ago--that the Bosnian Government is at fault \nbecause of the gains they made in Bihac. Remember? They were becoming \ntoo powerful. They beat the Serbs initially. All of a sudden the issue \nwas that they are too powerful. This is going to make Milosevic mad. \nMilosevic is now going to cross the Drina River. But now we are told, \nif you lift the arms embargo, they cannot use the weapons anyway. Well, \nlet us see, let us see.\n  I do not want American ground forces in Bosnia. I respectfully argue \nwe would not even be talking about the possibility had we not signed on \nto a failed policy of putting UNPROFOR in there in the first place.\n  And, Madam President, lastly--my friend from Rhode Island is waiting \nto speak and I will yield with this comment--we are told now that if we \nlift the arms embargo, all these terrible things are going to happen.\n  I ask my colleagues to ask themselves, if we do not lift the arms \nembargo, is anyone going to protect the safety areas? If we do not lift \nthe arms embargo, is anyone going to protect the part of Bosnia that is \nnot already occupied by the Serbs? If we do not lift the arms embargo, \nis the alliance going to be fixed up, right quick? If we do not lift \nthe arms embargo, is the United Nations going to become a credible \ninstitution again in terms of peacekeeping?\n  If Members can answer yes to three of those four, do not lift the \narms embargo. But if Members cannot answer yes to three of those four--\nand I think you cannot answer yes to any of them --then I respectfully \nsuggest that the Senate majority leader and the Senator from \nConnecticut are correct.\n  We tried this how many times, I say rhetorically, to my friend from \nKansas, over the last 1\\1/2\\ years? There is no more time, Madam \nPresident. Time does not work for these people. Time is not on their \nside. They will all be dead by the time the West decides to do anything \nat all about this problem.\n  I do not apologize for the passion. I do not even apologize for the \ntime, but I do apologize to the people of Bosnia. I do apologize to the \nwomen in those rape camps. I do apologize to those men in concentration \ncamps. I do apologize. For we are not to blame. But we have stood by--\nwe, the world--and watched in the twilight moments of the 20th century, \nsomething that no one thought would ever or could ever happen again in \nEurope. It is happening now.\n  If we do not do anything now to help them fight for themselves, I \nask, when are we going to do anything? I ask the rhetorical question, \ndo you think we--we, being the West--would be doing this, do you think \nwe would be as indecisive, do you think we would be as timid, do you \nthink we would be putting a rapid deployment force in who has an \nexpress purpose to defend only the peacekeepers there, not the civilian \npopulation, do you think we would be doing that, if, in fact, these \nwere not Muslims? Do you think we would be doing that if this was a \nChristian population? Maybe we would, Madam President, but I have a \nfeeling the reason why the world has not responded in Europe is because \nthey are Muslims--the same reason we did not respond in Europe--because \nthey were Jews.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator from Rhode Island yield for a moment \nvery briefly?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I simply want to thank the Senator from Delaware for \nhis remarks. He was teased a bit about how long he was going to speak. \nAs far as I am concerned, he can keep on speaking. He saw the \nsituation, as he has many others, very clearly from the beginning.\n  On several occasions before, as he has tonight, he has spoken with \ngreat eloquence and power. His voice pierces the stillness of this \nChamber with the power of truth. I just want to say how grateful I am \nfor his support of this measure and how proud I am to serve with him \nand to call him a friend. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, in previous debates over major foreign \npolicy matters, I have been reluctant to challenge the President \nthrough the legislative process, whether the President was a Republican \nor a Democrat. It is that there is always danger in the Congress, the \nSenate in particular, or either branch, actually, in legislating \nforeign policy, especially the details of foreign policy.\n  I came to this debate with a great deal of skepticism about the Dole-\nLieberman proposal, to lift unilaterally the arms embargo in Bosnia. My \nvoting record in the past on this issue reflects the skepticism that I \nhave. Like all Americans who have witnessed the events in Bosnia in the \npast weeks, I am outraged by the continued brutal campaign carried out \nby the Bosnian Serbs against the people of Bosnia. What has taken \nplace--there have been scores of atrocities, execution, ethnic \ncleansing, and the kidnapping of soldier-age men on trumped-up \ncharges--these are all undisputed facts that have been brought home by \nvery courageous journalists in the Balkans.\n  Through all of this, the Serbs have scorned the views of the United \nNations and have shelled safe area after safe area. The question the \nSenate faces today and tomorrow is, How does the United States respond \nto these horrors? What can we and our allies do to end the war and the \nsuffering, and to restore legitimate authority to the sovereign \nGovernment of Bosnia and secure a lasting peace in the Balkans? \nNeedless to say, these goals have been elusive since the war began 3 \nyears ago.\n  Previously, I have been supportive of the U.N. policy, which has been \nendorsed by the Clinton and the Bush administrations and our allies. \nThe policy is to try to protect Bosnian Moslems from Serb aggression \nthrough the establishment of six ``safe havens'' in Bosnia, which are \ntowns and cities in which the civilian population and humanitarian aid \ndeliveries would be defended by the U.N. protection force, UNPROFOR. \nWith the United Nations maintaining at least a modicum of stability in \nBosnia, negotiations could take place in search of a lasting political \nsettlement to some very serious and longstanding disagreements.\n  I have been opposed to U.S. unilateral lifting of the arms embargo in \nthe former Yugoslavia, a move that would undoubtedly and understandably \nresult in a serious rift with our allies by endangering the lives of \ntheir participating troops in UNPROFOR.\n  I have come to the regretful conclusion that the U.N. mission in \nBosnia has failed. I do not think we ought to pin much hope on it for \nthe future. After 3 years of very-well-intentioned and courageous \nattempts to halt the bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia, we cannot \nignore the facts. First, the six \n\n[[Page S 10640]]\nU.N. safe areas are anything but safe. Srebrenica has already fallen to \nSerb forces. Zepa is on the verge of falling. The other four, \nespecially the northwest enclave of Bihac, are subject to heavy \nshelling from the Serbs.\n  The United Nations mission of protecting the Bosnians is further \ndiscredited by additional atrocities such as ethnic cleansing on the \npart of the Serbs.\n  UNPROFOR is having a hard enough time protecting itself, never mind \nthe long-suffering Bosnians. Finally, the U.N.'s failure is illustrated \nby the chronic Serb attacks on humanitarian aid deliveries since the \ninception of the U.N. mission.\n  While I am encouraged by the allied declaration recently in London \nlast week to reinforce the U.N. contingent in Bosnia, I have great \ndoubts this will prove to be a successful, long-term solution. Indeed, \nit appears unclear whether any safe area other than Gorazde will be \ndefended. We have heard a number of different accounts as to whether \nNATO forces must still obtain U.N. permission before retaliating in \nresponse to continued Serb attacks.\n  It has also become clear that earnest, well-intentioned diplomatic \nefforts have failed in the Balkans. These efforts, largely through the \ncontact group--what is the contact group? The contact group is composed \nof the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Russia--these \nefforts have simply not produced an agreement all sides could accept. \nThe most recent contact group peace proposal in which the Serbs would \nbe given 49 percent of Bosnian territory was accepted by the Bosnia \nGovernment but rejected by the Bosnian Serbs.\n  Given their overwhelming military advantage, the Serbs have shown \nlittle willingness to agree to any diplomatic solution that falls short \nof their goal of creating a greater\n Serbia out of the internationally recognized sovereign nation of \nBosnia.\n\n  So strong is the evidence pointing to the failure of the U.N. mission \nand diplomatic efforts in Bosnia, that despite my stated inclination \nnot to legislate foreign policy, I believe that Congress ought to step \nin and require the Clinton administration to move in a different \ndirection. After much reflection, I am convinced that the only logical \nchoice we have in Bosnia is to give the Bonsians what they currently \nlack and what they desperately seek: the ability to defend themselves \nthrough lifting the U.N. arms embargo. There is no doubt that this \nembargo, imposed in 1991, even before the establishment of the nation \nof Bosnia, has overwhelmingly worked to the benefits of the Bosnian \nSerbs, who inherited massive amounts of arms and equipment from the \nformer Yugoslav army. In fact, the Bosnian government army is more than \ndouble the size of the Serb army, but has fared poorly in trying to \ndefend its nation, largely due to the embargo-caused lack of equipment.\n  I have serious concerns that the infusion of heavy military equipment \ninto Bosnia could cause the war in the Balkans to spread. That is a \npossibility. But I am at the same time convinced that an equitably \nequipped Bosnian military would halt the Serb advances and eventually \nforce the Bosnian Serbs to the negotiating table. It is, after all, the \ngoal of the world community to see a settlement to the Balkan War \nagreed to at the negotiating table. Whether a Bosnian military success \nwill take 1 week or 1 year, no one can say for sure. We certainly \ncannot take such a military escalation lightly. But, in the end, I have \nconcluded that unless we are willing to settle for continued \nfrustration over failed U.N. peacekeeping and diplomatic efforts in \nBosnia, we simply must give the Bosnians the opportunity to defend \nthemselves against unending Serb aggression.\n  My support for lifting the arms embargo only comes with the very \nsignificant modification made to the Dole-Lieberman bill. The proposal \nnow only provides for lifting the embargo after the U.N. has left, or \n12 weeks after a Bosnian request that they leave. This change should \nmollify those of us who were concerned that last year's proposal was \nunderstandably opposed by our allies, whose troops constitute the bulk \nof the U.N. Protection Force,\n  Mr. President, I do not take this vote lightly, not do I believe that \na military solution has to be the best course of action for Bosnia. \nHowever, 3 years have passed since the U.N. arms embargo was imposed on \nthe former Yugoslavia, and the situation there is as bad as it ever has \nbeen. The unending bloodshed, suffering and horrors inflicted on the \nBosnian people call out for a change in course. I believe it is time \nfor the United States to lift the arms embargo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I know that Senator Dole did not plan \ndebate on the resolution that is being presented to us to take place \ntoday for any particular reason. I think it is of more than passing \ninterest, however, to note that two things happened today which lend \nurgency and cogency to the passage of this resolution.\n  The first thing that happened today was that General Mladic, the \nchief of the Bosnian Serb armed forces, and President Karadzic, the \nPresident of the so-called Bosnian Serb Republic, were indicted today \nby a war crimes tribunal for crimes against humanity, two of the few \ntimes, to my knowledge, that individuals have been indicted for war \ncrimes since the end of World War II. The reason why this is \nparticularly compelling is that still the administration policy is one \nof avowed neutrality and a refusal to take sides in what we all know \nhas been a terribly uneven conflict.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that General Mladic and President \nKaradzic are guilty of war crimes of the most unspeakable kind. It, \nagain, makes clear that we cannot remain neutral in a war in which one \nside is exterminating the other and is helped dramatically in doing so \nby the continued enforcement of an arms embargo that ensures an unequal \nsituation on the battlefield.\n  The other thing that happened today is that another so-called safe \narea, Zepa, fell to the Bosnian Serbs. We will see, probably, on \ntelevision tomorrow and in the newspapers, the same thing we saw a week \nor so ago when Srebrenica fell to the Bosnian Serbs. First comes the \nseparation of men between ages 16 and 65, where they are taken to be \n``screened'' for war crimes. Following that, young women are removed \nfor the obvious purposes. And, following that, of course, those who are \nleft are herded out of town in the most unspeakable and brutal fashion.\n  The thing that makes this tragedy different--in fact, totally \ndifferent--is that standing by, observing these unspeakable atrocities \nbeing perpetrated, will be the very troops that were sent there to \nprotect them, the very United Nations Protection Forces, which is their \nname, wearing blue helmets, who promised them that if they went to the \nsafe area and if the Bosnian military removed themselves and their \nequipment, that they would be protected by the United Nations \nProtection Forces.\n  The moral there is that there really are worse things than dying. \nThere really is something worse than military defeat, and that is the \ndegradation and humiliation and dishonor in the most Orwellian and \nbizarre scenario of the very protectors standing by and watching those \nwho were to be protected being subjected to unspeakable horrors.\n  Both of those events today, the indictment for war crimes of the \nBosnian Serb leadership and the fall of Zepa, are compelling, yet \ncertainly not the only reasons why the Dole-Lieberman resolution should \nbe agreed to and with an overwhelming majority. The question is no \nlonger whether the resolution will be agreed to. The question is \nwhether it will acquire 67 votes or not, which, as we all know, is \nsufficient to override a veto.\n  What is wrong with the policy in Bosnia? We all know that it is an \nattempt to pursue a policy which is fatally flawed. Simply put, as has \nbeen said on this floor by many on many occasions, it is an attempt to \nkeep peace where there is no peace, ignoring the lessons of Beirut, \nignoring the lessons of Somalia, where we went in with the best of \nintentions but were unable to keep a peace where no peace existed.\n  I have to, in all candor, describe that one of the reasons why the \nAmerican people are so badly confused about this issue--yet are so \ndeeply moved--is because of the lack of leadership from the President \nof the United States. I believe the President of the United States, in \nalmost every instance, should be the steward of our foreign policy and \nour national security policy. \n\n[[Page S 10641]]\nBut when there is a lack of coherent leadership from the executive \nbranch, sooner or later the legislative branch will step into that \nbreach, and that time has come.\n  The American people do not know what our policy in Bosnia is. Let me \ntell you why.\n  On August 5, 1992, the President of the United States said:\n\n       If the horrors of the Holocaust taught us anything, it is \n     the high cost of remaining silent and paralyzed in the face \n     of genocide. We must discover who is responsible for these \n     actions and take steps to bring them to justice for these \n     crimes against humanity.\n\n  That was August 5, 1992.\n  On August 6, 1992, the President said:\n\n       We cannot afford to ignore what appears to be a deliberate \n     and systematic extermination of human beings based on their \n     ethnic origin. I would begin with air power against the Serbs \n     to try to restore the basic conditions of humanity.\n\n  On October 1, 1992, the President said:\n\n       While Mr. Bush's administration goes back and forth, more \n     lives are being lost and the situation grows more desperate \n     by the day.\n\n  On February 10, 1993, the President of the United States said:\n\n       You know about it. The rapes of the women. Murders of the \n     children. All these things you have read about. We have got \n     to try to contain it. I can tell you folks we are not going \n     to make peace over there in a way that is fair to the \n     minorities that are being abused unless we get involved. If \n     the United States now takes a leadership role, there is a \n     real chance we can stop some of the killing, some of the \n     ethnic cleansing.\n\n  That was on February 10, 1993.\n  On March 26, 1993, the President said:\n\n       We are going to do everything we can to put out a full \n     court press to secure agreement of the Serbs. I think we have \n     a chance to get a good-faith signing. We have to give that a \n     few days before we up the ante again.\n\n  On April 25, 1993, the President of the United States said:\n\n       Remember in the second war, Hitler sent tens of thousands \n     of soldiers to that area and never was successful in subduing \n     it, and they had people on the ground.\n\n  On May 7, 1993, the President of the United States said:\n\n       I think we have to take stronger steps. I would think these \n     fights between the Serbs and the Bosnian Muslims and the \n     Croats, they go back so many centuries, they have such \n     powerful roots that it may be that it is more difficult for \n     the people on the ground to make a change in their policy \n     than for their leaders.\n\n  On May 14, 1993, the President of the United States said:\n\n       Our interest is in seeing, in my view at least, that the \n     United Nations does not foreordain the outcome of a civil \n     war.\n\n  On May 21, 1993, the President of the United States said:\n\n       There may be some potential down the road for something to \n     be done in connection with a peacekeeping operation. But I \n     think it is something we have to be very skeptical about. We \n     do not want our people in there basically in a shooting \n     gallery.\n\n  On June 15, 1993, the President of the United States said:\n\n       Let me tell you something about Bosnia. On Bosnia, I made a \n     decision the United Nations controls what happens in Bosnia.\n\n  On October 20, 1993, the President of the United States said:\n\n       The conflict in Bosnia is ultimately a matter for the \n     parties to resolve.\n\n  On February 10, 1994, the President of the United States said:\n\n       Until these folks get tired of killing each other, bad \n     things will continue to happen.\n\n  On May 3, 1994, the President of the United States said:\n\n       We should never forget that there are tonight people in \n     Sarajevo and Tuzla who are alive because of the actions taken \n     by NATO working with the United Nations. I did the best I \n     could. I moved as quickly as I could. I think we have shown a \n     good deal of resolve.\n\n  On August 11, 1994, the President of the United States said:\n\n       It has been my long held view that the arms embargo has \n     unfairly and unintentionally penalized the victims in this \n     conflict and that the security council should act to remedy \n     their injustice. At the same time I believe lifting the \n     embargo unilaterally would have serious implications going \n     well beyond the conflict in Bosnia itself.\n\n  On June 5, 1995, the President of the United States said:\n\n       It's tragic. It's terrible. But their enmities go back 500 \n     years. Do we have the capacity to impose a settlement on \n     people who want to continue fighting? We cannot do that \n     there. So I believe we are doing the right thing.\n\n  Last week, Mr. President, on the occasion of the fall of Srebrenica, \nthe President of the United States said:\n\n       I think we ought to go right back in there and retake \n     Srebrenica.\n\n  Mr. President, that is why the American people are confused. We do \nnot have a consistent or coherent policy as regards the tragedy in \nBosnia, and that is why this resolution, this binding resolution, is \ngoing to receive overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, today my friend, Senator John Kerry, called this \nresolution ``the abandonment amendment.''\n  There is but one honest response to the Senator, and that is the \nfollowing: we have no need to authorize the formal abandonment of the \nBosnians; we abandoned them long ago.\n  Let no one tell the Senate that the ``London Communique'' represents \nsome hope that the West will spare the Bosnians from further Serb \nconquest. All that communique represents is the further abdication of \nU.S. leadership in the Atlantic Alliance. The parties to that \ncommunique cannot even agree that the utterly failed ``dual key'' \ncommand structure has come to a long overdue end.\n  All that was confirmed in London is that the United Nations and NATO \nwill preside for a little while longer over the ruthless extermination \nof the legitimate government of Bosnia.\n  We have promised an aggressive defense of Gorazde from the air. Zepa \nfell today, and the U.N. only seeks to negotiate the evacuation of the \ncity. When Bihac falls, we will be reminded that NATO only promised to \ndefend Gorazde. When Gorazde is again besieged, air strikes will be \ncalled in and their magnitude will fall somewhere in a range between \nutterly useless and inadequate. Gorazde will fall and the United States \nGovernment will blame it on the UN or Great Britain or France. But the \nfault will lie as much with us as it does with Boutras Galhi or John \nMajor or Jacques Chirac.\n  The plain truth, Mr. President, is that no Western government has any \nintention of fighting for Bosnian sovereignty. Our interests are not so \nseverely threatened by the war in Bosnia that we would make such a \nbloody sacrifice for that cause.\n  UNPROFOR will hold on for a little longer until the Bosnian tragedy \nplays out a bit further. Then the United States Armed Forces will \nevacuate them. That is an absolute certainty. No one should dissemble \nany longer about the viability of UNPROFOR. It is over, and only a fool \ncannot see that.\n  Mr. President, yesterday Assistant Secretary of State Richard \nHolbrooke offered perhaps the most mystifying defense to date of the \nadministration's opposition to lifting the Bosnian arms embargo. From \nSecretary Holbrooke we learn that the administration agrees that ``the \narms embargo is morally wrong,'' but they don't think that United \nStates refusal to participate any longer in that embargo is ``the right \nsolution.''\n  Mr. President, when has doing the morally wrong thing become the \nright solution. The United States has always tried to temper the \ndictates of Realpolitik with a little human compassion, a little regard \nfor the Rights of Man. Have we now reached a point where the United \nStates of America, the greatest nation on earth, the greatest force for \ngood in human history, Lincoln's ``beacon light of liberty'' can only \nrespond to another nation's claim of its right to defend itself with \nthe complaint that we are trapped by diplomatic circumstances--in an \nAlliance whose strength is directly commensurate to the strength of our \nleadership in it--we are trapped by diplomatic circumstances into doing \nthe ``morally wrong'' thing? By God, I hope not. I hope not.\n  As I said in an earlier statement, I don't know if the Bosnians can \nprevail in this conflict if we withdraw UNPROFOR and lift--at this late \ndate--the unjust, illegal, and ill conceived arms embargo. I cannot \npredict that the Bosnians will recover enough territory to make an \neventual settlement of that conflict more equitable. I cannot predict \nthat the Bosnians will mount anything more than a brief impediment to \nthe Serbian conquest of all of Bosnia. But they have the right to try! \nThey have the right to try. And we are obliged by all the principles of \njustice and liberty which we hold so dear to get out of their way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n[[Page S 10642]]\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, this debate is one of the most emotional \ndebates I think that I have had the opportunity to witness and in any \nway be involved. I think it is one of the major foreign policy issues \nof our time and probably the last major foreign policy problem that the \nworld will face in this century.\n  I must say, as I listened to the debate, in particular the remarks \nmade by the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, the emotion that he put \ninto those remarks and the strong personal feelings he expressed, I \nthink summed it up about as well as anyone could. I think it summed up \nthe frustration, it summed up the morality issue, the political issue, \nand made us all reflect on what a terrible crisis this is.\n  I have some concern standing here and speaking, because if words in \nthis Chamber could solve the world's problems, I guess they would have \nbeen solved many times over.\n  So I have some trepidation in trying to add. As Lincoln said at \nGettysburg, there is little to add or detract, to pay due respect for \nwhat they did, referring to those who died at Gettysburg.\n  In other words, words cannot express what is happening in Bosnia. \nThere is no way you can capture that in debate in this Chamber.\n  I wish to compliment Senator Lieberman because he has been steadfast \non this issue for many months, as has Senator Dole, the majority \nleader. The two of them have been very outspoken in particular, and \nothers have as well, on the arms embargo issue, even early on before \nthis has reached this crisis proportion.\n  I can remember both of these Senators being very outspoken and \neloquent on the issue of the arms embargo and the right of self-\ndetermination for the Bosnian Muslims. So I wish to publicly thank \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Dole for their leadership.\n  I should like to add a few remarks to express my feeling as well, \nknowing full well, considering the eloquence of many of the people who \nhave preceded me here to speak today, and probably will speak later, \nthere is not much one can add other than to express his or her own \npersonal outrage and disgust, contempt, frustration, whatever the words \nmight be, to describe it.\n  I would start by saying I think the word dilemma is probably \nappropriate in the sense that this is a world dilemma; it is a U.S. \ndilemma; it is a U.S. foreign policy dilemma; it is a dilemma certainly \nfor the participants in that war; it is a moral dilemma; it is an \nethical dilemma; and certainly it is a political dilemma for whomever \nhappens to be in the White House or in the Congress, in Government at \nthe time.\n  I rise in very strong support of this bill introduced by Senators \nDole and Lieberman to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian \nMoslems. It is the right thing to do. It has been too long in coming, \nbut it is the right thing to do.\n  Bringing this matter before the Senate is long overdue. Perhaps, had \nwe had this debate in this kind of public policy forum, we may have \nbrought it to a head a lot sooner. Perhaps if the Senator from \nConnecticut and the majority leader, the Senator from Kansas, had had \ntheir way, we might have saved some lives, had this embargo been lifted \nback in the days early on when the Senators were talking about that.\n  The illegal and immoral policy of denying people the capability to \ndefend themselves must stop. It must stop. If we are not going to \nintervene, which we have made the decision not to do, in terms of \nground forces, then we ought to lift the embargo and allow people the \nright to self-defense.\n  How can anyone, seeing what is happening now in Bosnia, dispute that? \nIt is time to lift the arms embargo against the Government of Bosnia. \nThe United Nations policy toward Bosnia--there is no other way to say \nit--is an unmitigated disaster--all well intended, the greatest motives \nin the world, no question about it. I admire the soldiers who went \nthere and the countries that sent them there. But they were not given \nthe tools to do the job. They did not go in as a fighting force, and \nthey did not go in as a protecting force, Mr. President. They are not \nfighting, and they are not protecting either. They need to get out, and \nthey need to get out right away.\n  Our acquiescence of this policy, indeed, our active enforcement of \nit, is not only wrong, it is absolutely unconscionable, unconscionable \nthat we would tolerate the sending of a force under the auspices of \nprotection, not engage, not stop the atrocities but simply stand by and \nallow them to happen.\n  Every day, every minute, as we speak on the floor, the situation gets \nworse. As I sat watching the Senator from Delaware, listening to his \nvery eloquent remarks, I wondered how many people died in Bosnia while \nhe spoke. I wonder how many people will die in Bosnia before we \ncomplete this debate, not because the United States of America or the \nallies did not go in and intercede and fight the war for them, not \nbecause of that, but because they were not armed, because they did not \nhave the opportunity to protect themselves or defend themselves, to \ndefend their women, to defend their children, to defend the very men \nwho have been hauled away and imprisoned and executed.\n  Every day, every single day that we participate in this embargo, this \nwhole action becomes more reprehensible, more unconscionable, more \nunethical, more immoral--every single day, every single minute that we \ncontinue this policy.\n  As I reflect upon this, I say to myself, it is easy to criticize, but \nthere are many times when we make policy mistakes. I am sure many of us \nhave made mistakes here with our votes on policy matters. Many \nPresidents, past and present and future, have made and will make \nmistakes in the future. But this one, this one is costing lives every \nday. Every single day lives are lost because of this policy.\n  Article 51 of the United Nations Charter affirms Bosnia's inherent \nright of self-defense as a sovereign nation. That is very clear. \nSovereign right, in article 51, of self-defense--self-defense. It does \nnot say in there that we have to defend them or anyone else has to go \ndefend them. It says to defend themselves. It says self-defense. Yet, \nthe arms embargo prevents them from exercising this very basic right. \nSo it is not just a matter of not intervening to help someone. It is a \nmatter of preventing them from helping themselves.\n  That is why it is immoral, and that is why it is unconscionable. No \nmatter how strongly you feel about this, how can anyone condone such a \npolicy which denies the Bosnians the capability for basic self-defense? \nHow can we participate in a policy that leaves them utterly vulnerable \nto territorial conquest and ethnic cleansing?\n  I hate that phrase, ``ethnic cleansing'' because the word ``cleanse'' \nhas a pure meaning to it, something good. It is not ethnic cleansing; \nit is murder. Let us call it what it is. Let us take the term out of \nthe vocabulary, the vernacular. It is murder, it is rape, it is \nextermination. That is what it is. It is brutality. Ugly words, ugly, \ndirty words. Not good, clean words.\n  Mr. President, the United States has no business, in my opinion, \nmaking matters worse by intervening in this conflict. At least that has \nbeen the policy decision that has been made. It is the overwhelming \nfeeling of the majority of the American people that we do not have \nmilitary interests and we do not have economic interests and we do not \nhave an alliance and relationship to enforce, and it is not our battle \nto fight. You have heard all the arguments. It is not our place to deny \ninnocent Bosnian victims the ability to defend themselves either.\n  If I were to give a comparison, Mr. President, I would say this would \nbe the equivalent of you seeing a terrible crime being committed, say a \nmurder, several murders. You call the police, and the police come. And \nthe victims who are being preyed upon by this murderer or murderers try \nto come to the police for aid, and the police simply stand by and watch \nit all happen.\n  That is what is happening. It is the exact same analogy there. There \nis nothing different about it. So, blue uniforms of the policemen; blue \nhats of the United Nations. They cannot do anything about it. They are \nnot doing anything about it. Therefore, why create the impression that \nsomehow they are going to help and be able to help these people?\n  It is not the United Nations' battle either although the so-called \nU.N. protection forces are currently deployed in several so-called safe \nhavens. I think the term ``protection forces'' is another \n\n[[Page S 10643]]\nmisnomer, misnamed. They are not protecting anybody. So why call them \nprotection forces? Again, it is the vocabulary, the vernacular, the \nsemantics, to help mislead the world that somehow these people are \nprotecting the Moslems.\n  And safe havens. Think of that word as we talk about vocabulary. Safe \nhavens. People are being butchered, raped, dragged out of their homes \nin safe havens. And that is what we continue to call them. That is the \nterm that is still being used. Gorazde, Zepa, safe havens, even though \nin many cases the safe havens have been overrun. It is completely \nmisleading to even use such terms. U.N. forces are not equipped to \nprotect the designated areas. And these areas are certainly not safe.\n  The truth is, the truth is--and this is harsh--but U.N. forces are \nnothing more, Mr. President, than a speed bump for the Serbian forces \nwho are overrunning these positions at will. That is all it is, a speed \nbump. Bloop. Out of the way. Seizing hostages wherever, whenever, it \nsuits their needs and using those hostages by placing them next to \nmilitary targets, in a sense saying, go ahead, bomb us. It is a \ndisgrace and embarrassment to the world and to our country.\n  No one likes to stand here and say that. We witnessed it once in our \nhistory in Vietnam and now we are seeing it again. And if we get into \nthis country, it will be Vietnam 10 times worse.\n  And perhaps the most telling example of just how preposterous this \nwhole situation is, Mr. President--this has really got to me \nemotionally--is recently U.N. troops, UNPROFOR troops, came under \nattack, not by the Serbs, but by the Moslems. Why were they attacked? \nThey were attacked because the Moslems wanted their weapons to protect \nthemselves. They wanted to take the weapons from their protectors, so \nthat they may be able to confront the Serbs. If that did not convince \nyou to support Senator Dole and Senator Lieberman and their endeavor, I \ndo not know what else could possibly convince you to do it. When the \nU.N. force is incapable of defending the victims of Serbian aggression \nand even preventing them from defending themselves, it is clear that \nthis policy is a failure.\n  The report on this was very brief, did not give a lot of detail. But \nyou cannot help but wonder just what happened in that little exchange \nwhen the Moslems confronted the U.N. forces to take their weapons. Did \nthey fight the Moslems? Did they voluntarily lay them down and give \nthem up? I did not see a lot of detail on that. It would be interesting \nto know just how that little exchange took place.\n  Mr. President, the only reasonable strategy--the only reasonable \nstrategy--is to terminate further escalation of military involvement, \nterminate it, move out the U.N. forces, lift the arms embargo against \nthe Bosnian Moslems, and we ought to establish a timetable to fully \nwithdraw the U.N. forces within the next 3 to 4 months, followed by an \nimmediate lifting of the embargo.\n  I want to be very clear on my position that I oppose the introduction \nof American ground forces for this conflict for the same reasons so \neloquently stated by Senator McCain a few moments ago. There is no \nmission. And without that mission being very specific, you are not \ngoing to get the job done. And when you go in, what is your mission? \nKill all the Serbs? Then what? Partition the country? Line up along the \nborders, not allow anybody in or out? For how many years? For 100 \nyears? For 1,000 years? Two days? They have been fighting for centuries \nthere. It is ethnic fighting. How do we police it? Do we plan to stay \nthere forever?\n  I have no objection to the use of American communications equipment, \ncommand and control assets, to support a withdrawal of U.N. forces. \nMaybe that will be necessary. I personally believe that the Serbs would \nwelcome withdrawal of the U.N. forces. I do not think they want them \nthere. I think they would welcome it, and I think resistance may be \noverstated in terms of how much resistance they would give if we \nannounce tomorrow that the U.N. forces were leaving.\n  The U.N. forces should be immediately withdrawn, followed by the \nlifting of the embargo. Let those who are being heinously persecuted, \nlet them meet destiny on their own terms, not on somebody else's terms, \nMr. President. Let them meet their own destiny on their own terms. And \nlet them meet that destiny from behind their own weapons, not cowering \nbehind the ruins of some unsafe haven, waiting, hoping, praying that \nsomebody in a blue helmet is going to come in and provide them \nprotection. Let them meet destiny on their own terms with their own \nweapons. We do not have the legal or moral authority to play policeman \nin this centuries-old conflict. Least of all do we have the moral \nauthority to do it when we go in there under the auspices of a \nprotection force and then do not protect anybody. That makes it worse. \nThat compounds it. Let us step back, allow the Moslems the dignity and \nthe capability to defend themselves.\n  It would be nice to read about a few successes with the Moslems as \nthey do have the opportunity to meet at least with some weaponry to \nallow them to meet this enemy on some reasonably equal terms on the \nbattlefield. It would be nice to witness that and read about that and \nsee that take place. And it can take place if we would stop this insane \npolicy. And it is insane.\n  This is exactly what this legislation does. At present the military \nequation is completely one-sided, totally one-sided. The Dole-Lieberman \nbill will enable the Moslem forces to better defend themselves and even \nthe playing field until a mutually acceptable peace settlement can be \nreached.\n  Mr. President, that is the least we can do. That is the least we can \ndo. No one, least of all this U.S. Senator, likes to stand up on the \nfloor of the Senate and admit that a foreign policy, no matter what \nPresident it is, or how many Presidents developed it, is a failure.\n  This is not, particularly, a direct hit on this President. This is a \nforeign policy failure. It perhaps goes back before the beginning of \nhis administration. There is enough blame to go around. This is not a \nblame game. This is much bigger than that. This is a moral issue of the \nhighest magnitude, and I think that when historians look back on the \nclose of this century, this will be one of the big moral issues, \ninternational moral issues that this country has faced. It is not too \nlate to have history judge us in a positive way, but it is getting \nthere. It is getting there, Mr. President. And we have to lift the \nembargo. The U.N. forces out, lift the embargo and we can at least make \nan attempt to correct a terrible injustice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I know there are a number of speakers who \nstill want to speak this evening. We are also trying to reach an \nagreement, which I think we can request momentarily. Maybe not. It will \nbe in just a few moments. So if I can just interrupt the Senator from \nIdaho later on.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Idaho [Mr. \nKempthorne].\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, just a few miles from where we stand \nis a brand new museum, a museum that opened just in the last couple of \nyears. And yet while it is a new museum, it has become one of the most \nwell-attended museums and locations anywhere in the Nation's Capital.\n  When citizens go to this museum, immediately you sense the hushed \ntones by which they experience what is inside this museum. You realize \nthat they are experiencing shock and revulsion. They cannot believe \nwhat they are seeing, because this museum is the museum of the \nHolocaust, and it gives evidence of the atrocities that took place some \n50 years ago. People go to see this, but they cannot believe what took \nplace. It is against our moral fiber to even think that humans could do \nthis to other humans.\n  This was done because of ethnic cleansing. These atrocities were \ngenocide. It was an attempt to wipe out an entire race of people.\n  At the conclusion of walking through this museum, you have the \nopportunity, if you wish, to buy books or mementos about what you had \njust experienced and seen. One of the little items that you can buy is \nthis button, this button which is a pledge, a pledge of mankind once \nthey had realized what had taken place 50 years ago. The button says \n``Never Again.'' ``Never again.'' \n\n[[Page S 10644]]\n\n  I do not know how many times I have gone to gatherings, large \ngatherings here in the Nation's Capital, where we discuss what took \nplace 50 years ago. I have listened as speakers, with great emotion, \ninvoked that pledge ``Never Again; Never Again.'' and the audience, in \ngreat emotion, erupts because that bond of the pledge has been \nreaffirmed.\n  I say this, Mr. President, because it is happening again. It is \nhappening in a place called Bosnia. Ethnic cleansing and genocide is \nagain running rampant as they try to exterminate a race of people.\n  We say, ``Never Again.'' We pledge that. But do we mean never again \nor do we mean never again except; never again maybe; never again. It is \neasier to say, I say to my friends, never again when you put it in the \ncontext that you are referencing something that happened 50 years ago, \nand so you are safe because you have that many years separating you \nfrom what was happening versus what action is called for now.\n  But we need to make that same pledge right now and say ``Never Again \nNow.''\n  Recently, Senator Dole hosted a meeting where a number of Senators \ngathered, and we met with the Prime Minister of Bosnia. One of the \nthings that the prime minister stated was, ``We can understand \nneutrality. We can respect if the United States of America says this is \nnot our war and, therefore, we will remain neutral. But,'' he said, \n``what we cannot understand is that you deny us the opportunity to have \nthe weapons so we can defend ourselves.''\n  He said, ``That is not neutrality. We do not want your boys to fight \nour battle on our land. We have boys. We have young men. We have men \nwho will fight the battle on our soil. But, please, allow us so that we \ncan arm the men and the women of our country so that we can defend \nourselves.''\n  This idea when we see that they capture the safe havens and then say, \n``Women and children this way, load them up, we are going to transfer \nyou, and then we want to take the men and the young men and the boys \nand you go this way, and we're going to take you to a stadium and we're \ngoing to hold you there.''\n  Then, as we all know, they are executing them in the name of what? \nEthnic cleansing? We said, ``Never Again.'' Are we simply historians or \ndo we mean it?\n  We have been told, ``Don't lift the embargo. Don't lift the embargo \nbecause the forecast of the scenario that it would bring about would be \ndire consequences for the future of the Bosnians.'' They do not have a \nfuture. While we talk about this, while we think about this, they are \ndying; they are dying.\n  We have a moral obligation to allow the Bosnians to defend \nthemselves. You would not deny it to anyone. I personally, Mr. \nPresident, do not feel that I could ever again in the future attend any \ngathering and invoke that pledge, ``Never Again,'' to the response of \nan audience if today I turned my back on lifting the arms embargo on \nthe Bosnians. That would be morally wrong, and I would be a hypocrite.\n  Therefore, I support the Dole-Lieberman amendment or measure that \nwill lift this arms embargo, and I commend Senator Dole and Senator \nLieberman for the action that they have generated to bring us to this \npoint where we stand on the eve of finally doing what is right.\n  It does not mean they will stop dying, but it means they can at least \ndefend their parents, their wives, their children. I also want to \ncommend Senator Feingold who early on, when he arrived as a freshman \nSenator, also was at the forefront of this issue, and I was proud to \njoin him at that point.\n  Mr. President, this must not go on.\n  Mankind has established a pledge: Never again. I uphold that pledge. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise for a second time in support of the \nDole proposal.\n  Current policy in Bosnia is a failure. Bosnian Moslems continue to be \ndriven from their homes under a horrific policy of ethnic cleansing. \nAtrocities are escalating. U.N. peacekeepers, while well-intended, have \nbeen unable to stop it and have themselves, tragically, ended up as \ntools for Serb aggression. Our allies are paralyzed and the unrest \nthreatens to destabilize the entire region.\n  It is time for the West to extricate itself from this failed policy \nand undertake a different course of action. S. 21 offers a sound and \njust mechanism to do so. Under this legislation, the arms embargo \nagainst Bosnia would be lifted only after one of two conditions have \nbeen met: a request by the government of Sarajevo for the withdrawal of \nthe U.N. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, or a decision by the U.N. \nSecurity Council to withdraw the UNPROFOR.\n  However, President Clinton has threatened to veto this legislation. \nHe seems to fear that a change in course would leave America \nresponsible for dealing with this conflict. This does not need to \nhappen.\n  The Bosnian Government is not asking America to send its ground \ntroops to fight against the Serbs. The Bosnians only want access to \nweapons and supplies that will enable them to more effectively counter \nwhat everyone I know recognizes as aggression.\n  The best approach now is to shift away from a policy that has only \npainfully and dangerously protracted the war, to a strategy structured \naround two clear objectives. The first is containment; that is, \nrestricting the spread of the fighting. The second objective is the \nestablishment of the balance of power necessary to stop Serb \naggression. Toward these ends, America and its allies must work closely \nfor the nations surrounding the conflict. The West must withdraw its \npeacekeepers, and we must allow the Bosnians to arm and defend \nthemselves.\n  The passage of the Dole proposal--I do hope that it will pass--is the \nfirst step in implementing such a strategy. It warrants our support.\n  I hope the President will reconsider his opposition. It is not a \ncarte blanche to the President. He must live up to its responsibilities \nas our Commander in Chief. The President must present the American \npeople a coherent strategy toward ending this conflict.\n  Mr. President, let me add that I support the amendment to be \nsubmitted by the Senator from Georgia. That amendment would require the \nPresident to request the U.N. Security Council to lift the arms embargo \nagainst Bosnia before the U.N. unilaterally lifts that embargo.\n  I believe this amendment is consistent with the motivations behind S. \n21 and would reinforce our interests within the United Nations and \namong our allies.\n  Mr. President, the vision among our allies has led to paralysis and \nappeasement in Bosnia. Consequently, it is even more urgent that we are \nnot divided at home.\n  As I stated last week, strong congressional support behind S. 21 is \nabsolutely essential. Combined with the President's support and \nleadership, S. 21 will be a first step toward a more effective strategy \nto end the aggression of atrocities now unleashed in Bosnia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak in opposition \nto the Dole-Lieberman legislation.\n  Mr. President, its intent, to change the direction of the United \nStates policy in Bosnia, is good. For me, the language of this \nlegislation is too ambiguous. To make a case it is ambiguous, Mr. \nPresident, I need only summarize the arguments of four Senators, myself \nincluded, two of them in favor of the bill and two of them against.\n  Senator Moynihan argued in favor. He wants the U.S. to stay involved \nbecause he believes it is in our interests to do so. Senator McCain \nargued, as well, in favor. He wants the U.S. to become less involved \nbecause he believes that Americans do not see our interests \nsufficiently engaged to commit ground forces. Senator Exon, on the \nother hand, argues against. He is against it because he wants the \nUnited States to stay more involved, and he believes it is in our \ninterest to do so.\n  I am here this evening arguing against, for the same reason cited by \nSenator McCain when he declared his support, which is that I am one of \nthose who do not want the United States to take the military lead, \nbecause I do not believe it is in our interest to do so.\n  Mr. President, this has become one of those great polarized debates \nwhere if you declare you are opposed to this legislation, people \nimmediately say, well, \n\n[[Page S 10645]]\nyou are for doing nothing. I received calls into my office today from \npeople who were saying, if you are not for Dole-Lieberman, you are for \ngenocide. That is how this argument is being framed here in America, \nunfortunately, at this moment.\n  I do not argue that we should become uninvolved. The United States \ncannot afford to turn its back on the events in the Balkans. Americans \nare appalled by what we see there, and thank God we are. Ethnic \ncleansing, intentional killings and terrorizing of innocents, and \narrogant disregard for international law, all of these have provoked us \nto the point that some of our citizens believe it is time for America \nto choose sides and enter this war on behalf of the Moslem minority.\n  Unfortunately, too many commentators and observers who want to pursue \na unilateral course of action try to leave the impression that those \nwho prefer an alternative would like the United States to do nothing. \nThe United States must lead, Mr. President, in a clear, defined, and in \nthis case, limited way.\n  For the past 4 years, beginning with the careless diplomatic \nrecognition in 1992 of Croatia and Bosnia that led to a grisly and \nhate-filled war with Serbia, we have been trying to exercise \nleadership. After ignoring or not hearing the warning signals coming as \nearly as 1988 from knowledgeable sources that ethnic hatred would erupt \nafter the Communist grip was loosened, our first action, one of \ndiplomacy, probably made matters worse.\n  Still, we did not walk away from our responsibilities. We helped \nnegotiate an end to the fighting between Croatia and Serbia. After the \npeople of Bosnia and Herzegovina voted for independence, Bosnian Serbs \nformed an insurgent government. Thus began a bloodthirsty move to \ncontrol territory by means of a cruel device known as ethnic cleansing.\n  While we recognized the deep and longstanding hatreds, we could not \nstand aside, Mr. President, and have not stood aside for the last 4 \nyears. Our response has been in part humanitarian, with relief flights, \nmedical care, and international efforts to break the siege on the city \nof Sarajevo. Our response has also been diplomatic, with round after \nround of discussions, the most notable of which were led by former \nSecretary of State Cyrus Vance.\n  Our response, Mr. President, to be clear, has also been military. \nAmericans, though we have withheld support for Americans going in on \nthe ground, peacekeeping forces, our sailors are in the Adriatic, our \nairmen in Avellino, Italy, and our soldiers in Macedonia have been \nregularly and daily risking their lives.\n  Those who say that the United States has made no military commitment \nhave to devalue the lives of those who, in fact, are regularly out \nthere on behalf of the United States of America and on behalf of those \nwho are being terrorized in Bosnia, risking their lives.\n  If we measure success as an end to the violence and killing, there is \nno question, Mr. President, that we have failed. If success is measured \nas a reduction in both, we have not failed.\n  That we have not turned our backs should likewise be apparent. This \nis not Nazi Germany where we ignored the overwhelming evidence that \nsomething terrible was going on. We have ignored nothing; its just that \nnothing we have been willing to try has stopped the killing.\n  We are frustrated by apparent impotence. We want success like we had \nin the Gulf War or Haiti or even for a while Somalia. We want this \nthing to be over. We want to be free of the images like the 20-year-old \nwoman who hanged herself after being driven from what we called a safe \nhaven in Srebrenica. We want to be free of what seems to be a policy \nthat stumbles blindly down one diplomatic path after another tripping \nwires that explode into more and more killing.\n  The Dole-Lieberman legislation is a response to that frustration. The \ngoal of this proposed law is to change the course of our currently \npolicy something I wholeheartedly agree needs to happen. Specifically, \nthe law proposes that we do two things: direct the President to lift \nthe current arms embargo which has had the unintended consequence of \nmaking it more difficult for one side--the Bosnian Government--to fight \nfor their country, and bring about the withdrawal of the United Nations \npeacekeepers.\n  If this resolution encouraged the multilateral lifting of the arms \nembargo, and if it authorized the President to deploy U.S. forces to \nlead an orderly and honorable withdrawal of the United Nations, I would \nsupport it. But according to the news of the past week, British and \nFrench forces in Bosnia are more aggressive than ever before. The \nBritish have inserted two batteries of artillery into the Sarajevo \narea. The French conducted a massive mortar attack over the weekend. \nAccording to news reports, the French responded to the death of two of \ntheir soldiers by using a one-bomb airstrike Sunday against the house \nof a Bosnian Serb leader in Pale. Now that our allies are committed and \nactively engaged, it is not the time for us to pull the plug on them. \nThey should get to vote on withdrawal. If they choose it, we should \nlead it.\n  Let me explain why I cannot vote for this legislation in its current \nform. First, it suffers from the same defect as the administration's: \nIt is ambiguous about purpose and objectives which, of course, \nencourages Senators to vote ``aye'' and explain their vote anyway they \nchoose. Second, it may prohibit the United States from honoring its \ncommitment to provide ground support for the evacuation of United \nNations peacekeepers. Such a prohibition may broaden the appeal in the \nSenate; it does not broaden our appeal in the world.\n  Defining an objective in the former Yugoslavia is neither morally \neasy nor objectively precise. Defining an objective forces us to decide \nif we are going to establish a principle which allows us to lead but \ndoes not require us to take the lead with our Army, Navy, Air Force, \nand Marine Corps in every world dispute, violent outburst, or tragedy \ninvolving human rights abuses. I believe we must establish such a \nprinciple. As difficult as it may be to weep for rather than fight in \nevery battle, to do otherwise would be a mistake.\n  The principle should be: only if the interests of the United States \nare at stake should we take the lead with our military forces. What we \nare witnessing in Bosnia is a civil war with the\n potential of spreading to other Balkan countries. The combatants, and \nespecially the Serbs, are guilty of gross violations of human rights \nand the laws of war. The Intelligence Committee, in fact, intends to \nhold open hearings on this very subject. But we are not witnessing the \nHolocaust or the rise of the Fourth Reich. Such references exaggerate \nand do not help us decide what we must do.\n\n  Our interests in Bosnia include the following:\n  First, prevent the conflict from spreading to other areas.\n  Second, preserve the territorial integrity of a nation recognized by \nthe United Nations.\n  Third, prevent ethnic cleansing and human rights abuses.\n  Of these three, only the first qualifies as a vital interest. If \neither Greece, Turkey, or Russia became directly involved, we would be \nat war. The second and third are more limited, and for obvious reasons \nmore difficult to limit. Indeed, some would risk a larger war in order \nto satisfy their desire to do something--almost anything--about them. I \nbelieve we should limit this risk.\n  Again, saying we are not going to take sides in a war to preserve \nBosnia's territorial integrity or to prevent ethnic cleansing and human \nrights abuses does not mean we should stand aside and do nothing.\n  Before we rush to judge the United Nations peacekeepers harshly we \nshould remember and pay tribute to their bravery. It is not their fault \nthat diplomats and political leaders have issued hollow threats or \npassed toothless resolutions. It is not their fault that a so-called \ndual key mechanism that was devised as a safety check has provided more \nsafety to the Bosnia Serbs by denying much needed and oft-requested \nNATO airplanes to United Nations forces so they could carry out their \nmission.\n  The broad consensus required to keep the United Nations together \nworks fine if there is a peace to maintain. If peace breaks down and \nforce is needed, this broad consensus is no match or substitute for \nindividual courage and a military code of honor. Both of these \n\n[[Page S 10646]]\nare what is needed to end the violence in Bosnia. And, it will take \ncourage on the ground to seize and hold territory; bravery from the air \ncan only support, not secure the victory.\n  Two examples of courage were reported by New York Times writer Mr. \nRoger Cohen on July 16, 1995. Mr. Cohen's story reveals two important \ntruths. Our United Nations peacekeepers have been very brave and we \nwill need such bravery on the ground if we are to persuade the Bosnian \nSerbs and the Bosnian Government to negotiate an end to their fighting.\n  In March, 1993, Lieutenant General Phillipe Morillon, who was the \ncommander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, went to Srebrenica when \nit was under attack by Bosnian Serbs. He declared he would not move \nuntil the survival of its people was assured. In Mr. Cohen's words: \n``It was an irrational act. Confronted by this stubborn general, the \nBosnia Serbs desisted from their onslaught and Srebrenica survived for \nanother 28 months.'' When it fell 10 days ago, almost no stubbornness \nwas revealed to the Bosnian Serbs by the Bosnian Government troops who \nwere armed and outnumbered their attackers. They did not fire a shot.\n  On May 27, 1995, the day after NATO air strikes near Pale, the \nBosnian Serbs began taking hostages and using them as human shields. \nFaced with the prospect of killing United Nations peacekeepers the U.N. \nhigh command decided not to order further air strikes.\n  Lieutenant Gilles Jarron, a member of the French Foreign Legion and a \nU.N. officer in Sarajevo, show no such reluctance. Along with 11 other \nLegionnaires he defended a U.N. weapons collection site in a Serb-held \nsuburb. Eighty Serbs armed with rocket-propelled grenades and a T-55 \ntank gave the peacekeepers 5 minutes to give up.\n  But, according to Mr. Cohen:\n\n       Lieutenant Jarron called his commanding officer. There was \n     little question the legionnaires would all be killed in any \n     battle. The last order he received from Colonel Jean-Louis \n     Francheschini was, ``From this moment on, make sure that \n     every French life is paid for dearly by the Serbs.\n       Every evening, as the stand-off wore on and the Serbs \n     failed to carry out their threats, the soldiers read each \n     other the code of the Legionnaire: The mission is sacred. You \n     execute it to the end, at any price. In combat you act \n     without passion or hatred. You respect your defeated enemy. \n     Never do you abandon your dead, your injured or your arms.\n\n  This is the behavior that wins wars. That seizes ground and holds it. \nAir strikes alone will not work. President Clinton's air strategy will \nlikely fail. According to the President:\n\n       The only thing that has worked has been when they thought \n     we would use disproportionate air power. This allowed us to \n     move their heavy weapons into pools. If we adhere to this \n     tougher policy, we can be successful at negotiating.\n\n  In an account of the battle that occurred on Mount Igman over the \nweekend, again after the French had taken two casualties, the French \nlaunched an attack and included the use of 122 millimeter mortars, 84 \nrounds launched into Serbian positions. And those who observed it said \nthat ground attack was more impressive and did more damage and did more \ngood for our cause than all the airstrikes together thus far in this \nwar.\n  I fear that a tougher air policy, in the absence of a tougher ground \npolicy, will make matters worse once again.\n At this stage we are inching close to a declaration of war against \nSerbia, an action we must not allow to happen unless and until we \nintend it.\n  When we threatened air strikes on February 9, 1994, which did lead to \nthe withdrawal and turning over to the United Nations of mortars, \nartillery pieces and other heavy weapons within a 12.4 mile range of \nthe center of Sarajevo, the Bosnian Serbs were wary of testing NATO's \nmettle. Our warnings of air strikes were repeatedly vetoed by Mr. \nBoutros-Ghali, the U.N. Secretary General, who is ultimately in command \nof the more than 20,000 European and other peacekeeping troops in \nBosnia. Seeing that NATO's mettle was soft, the Bosnian Serbs and the \nBosnian Government have both retaken their weapons and have resumed \nheavy shelling of Sarajevo, Gorazde, Bihac, Zepa, and Srebrenica.\n  This time we are told things will be different. There is good reason \nto believe they will be different. First, the Rapid Reaction Force--\nformed in response to the taking of hostages in May--has begun to \ndemonstrate a resolve the Bosnian Serbs have not seen from U.N. forces. \nImportantly and correctly the French and the British are taking the \nlead in this effort. The French have lost 44 soldiers in Bosnia. They \ndo not want to withdraw. We have lost none, and we do. The moment when \nthe U.N. is moving stronger forces into the heart of the conflict is \nprecisely the wrong moment to pass a law which would compel U.N. \nwithdrawal.\n  Second, the President has pressed for different operating procedures \nwhen carrying out NATO air attacks. NATO is asking that U.N. ground \ncommander in Bosnia, General Rupert Smith, alone be given the authority \nto request these attacks from Admiral Leighton Smith, the NATO \ncommander for this area. This would mean that neither General Janvier, \nthe U.N. Commander for all forces in Bosnia and Croatia, nor Secretary \nGeneral Boutros-Ghali would have the power to veto this request. Of \ncourse, airstrikes should not occur at danger-close distances to U.N. \npeacekeepers, and it should be easy to transmit this information to \nstrike pilots. But the dual key will hopefully be laid to rest.\n  As we debate this resolution tonight, and as the intensified fighting \naround Bihac makes more likely a renewal of open warfare between \nCroatia and Serbia, I am hard pressed to consider a better course of \naction than continuation of an even stronger U.N. presence. It is \napparent that none of the parties is yet ready to negotiate seriously: \nall of them believe they can achieve their aims on the battlefield. \nOutside support is already getting through to the combatants, even to \nthe Moslems. The flow of weapons will grow to a flood when the embargo \nis lifted, and all the parties will be much better armed. The departure \nof the U.N. will mean no international effort to get food to besieged \nareas and no international witnesses to war crimes. Most importantly, \nit will mean no international effort to halt or contain the fighting \nand America's principal interest here is to contain the war.\n  A weak, passive United Nations--and I refer to its political \nleaders--has done a mediocre job in accomplishing these tasks, not just \nin Bosnia but throughout Yugoslavia. You can be sure in the absence of \nthe U.N., these tasks would not get done at all. It is too easy for us \nto vote out of frustration and send the message, get the United Nations \nout of Bosnia and let them all fight it out. But think what the \nsituation of civilians would be in a no-holds-barred war involving \nSerbia and Croatia as well as Bosnia.\n  No option is ideal.\n   There may come a time in fact when the Dole-Lieberman legislation is \nprecisely what this country ought to be doing.\n  There is pain and risk involved in all of the options.\n  But in looking at those options, a larger, better armed, more \naggressive UN force, backed by NATO airpower not subject to a dual key, \nis the best course of action. Now the United Nation's spine is being \nstiffened by the increased commitment of two of our oldest allies, who \nhave already made significant sacrifices but are willing to do more. \nNow is not the time for unilateral United States action that would \nforce them out and leave the Bosnians, and many others in the former \nYugoslavia, without aid or witnesses, defenseless in a brutal ethnic \ncivil war. I will vote against the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of the Dole-\nLieberman legislation, and have spoken on a number of occasions about \nthe moral and strategic imperative to lift unilaterally the arms \nembargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina. I am confident that the legislation will \npass, and am pleased that the 104th Senate will finally go on record to \ndo the right thing in this intractable situation. My only regret is \nthat the Dole-Lieberman legislation does not include a mandate to \n\n[[Page S 10647]]\nlift the embargo on the Republic of Croatia as well.\n  Today we are all focused on the unspeakable horrors perpetrated by \nBosnian Serb rebels against the Bosnians. But the same patron, \nPresident Milosevic of Serbia, is complicitly supporting the Croatian \nSerbs' campaign of terror against Croatia as well. Though we expect to \naid the Bosnians with our legislation today, we can only effectively \naddress the entire Bosnian crisis if we seek a regional solution. That \nmeans including Croatia in the equation, and in this case, it means \nlifting the embargo against Croatia as well.\n  One of the successes the Clinton administration has had in this \nconflict has been the March 1994 Washington Accords which secured \nAmerican support for the Moslem-Croat Federation and the Bosnia-Croat \nconfederacies. The Federation recognizes the need for a regional \nsolution, an alliance where Serb forces are confronted by the united \nforces of the Bosnian and Croatian militaries. It also acknowledges \nthat both states would be more viable if they can be united. Indeed, in \norder to receive the arms we are supporting tonight, they will have to \nbe shipped through Croatia. Why would we want to pit these countries \nagainst each other when together they have a better chance of defeating \nthe Serb aggressors?\n  I am a proponent of lifting the embargo, Mr. President, because I \nbelieve that it is the only way to enable the Bosnians to effect the \nbalance of power on the ground against the Serb aggressors, and thus \nnegotiate in seriousness. Lifting the embargo on Croatia would help \nachieve the same goal by strengthening the credibility of the military \nthreat against the Serbs, and expedite the transport of weaponry to \nBosnia.\n  Since we will not be voting on the embargo against Croatia tonight, I \nhope that as the Administration begins to think about implementing our \nlegislation, it will take the practical path and lift the embargo \nagainst Croatia as well.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the issue before the Senate is \nwhether to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is one \nof the most important debates on the floor of the Senate this year. \nThis vote has the potential to dramatically change the course of the \nwar in Bosnia.\n  The international community has made a good-faith attempt to make the \ncurrent policy in Bosnia work. The United Nations, through the United \nNations Protection Forces, known as UNPROFOR, has tried to minimize the \nloss of life in Bosnia, to provide humanitarian assistance, to protect \nMoslem refugees in U.N.-dedicated safe areas, to contain the fighting, \nand to prevent this conflict from spreading into a wider regional war.\n  Between 1992 and the last few weeks, the United Nations was able to \ncontain the violence and the casualties. UNPROFOR has enforced a no-fly \nzone over Bosnia. The United Nations has enforced zones around urban \nareas where heavy weapons were excluded. The United Nations airlifted \nfood and medical supplies to civilian population, conducting the \nlargest airlift of humanitarian supplies since the Berlin airlift. And \nwhile there have been despicable attacks against civilians since \nUNPROFOR has been in Bosnia, these policies have dramatically reduced \nthe loss of life. In 1992, 130,000 people perished in the war in \nBosnia. In 1994, 3,000 people died.\n  But the fragile stability that UNPROFOR provided over the last 3 \nyears has been shattered. The policy is not working. The so-called safe \nareas of Srebrenica and Zepa have already been overrun. UNPROFOR cannot \nprotect the civilian populations in the safe areas or anywhere else it \nis deployed in Bosnia because it is not equipped as a fighting force. \nUNPROFOR's mission is to provide humanitarian assistance. It does not \nhave a mandate to confront or push back Serb forces. It does not have \nthe manpower or the armaments to protect civilians in a war zone. Even \nthe new Rapid Reaction Force, which is moving into positions on Mount \nIgman above Sarajevo, is charged with opening and securing routes into \nSarajevo for the delivery of humanitarian aid, and stopping Serb \nattacks against U.N. personnel and U.N. assistance convoys. The Rapid \nReaction Force is not mandated to stop Serb assaults against civilians. \nUNPROFOR cannot stop Serb aggression. It has not been able to halt \nethnic cleansing--the massive movement of refugees--the rapes of women, \nand the rounding up and disappearance of military-age men.\n  Mr. President, the terrible pictures of Moslem refugees we see in the \nnewspaper of Bosnia are not new. The other day, there was a photo on \nthe front page of the Washington Post of two middle-aged women walking \nout of Srebrenica into Moslem territory. They were each pushing a \nwheelbarrow. In one wheelbarrow was an old man; in the other was an old \nwoman. Better than any words, this photo crystalized the ethnic \ncleansing the Serbs have forced on the Moslems. It is the women, the \nchildren, and the elderly, who continue to suffer the most. But, Mr. \nPresident, we saw the same pictures 3 years ago. Today, the pictures \nare of refugees from Srebrenica. Earlier, the refugees were from Banja \nLuka, and other towns now under the control of the Bosnian Serb Army.\n  Today, we are again hearing reports of women disappearing. Serb \nsoldiers are approaching groups of refugees, and pulling young women \naway from their families. The Serbs are using rape to terrorize. They \nare also using rape as a tool of genocide--to impede the birth of the \nnext generation of Moslem children. The violence against women in this \nwar is horrific, and cannot go unpunished. But as I stand here on the \nfloor, I recognize that we have heard these reports before. Mr. \nPresident, in March 1993, 2 months after I arrived in the U.S. Senate, \nI signed a letter to Secretary Christopher with 30 of my colleagues \nrequesting information on the State Department's plans to fund medical \nand psychological assistance to the women of Bosnia who had been \nvictims of rape and forced pregnancy. March 1993, Mr. President. And in \nJuly 1995, we are hearing the same cries for help.\n  Not only has the United Nations been unable to protect civilians, it \nhas also been unable to put an end to this conflict. In March 1993, the \nVance-Owen plan was negotiated and presented to both parties. The \nMoslems signed the plan; the Serbs rejected it. The Contact Group of \nnations--the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Russia--\npresented the peace plan of July 1994. Again, the Moslems accepted it; \nit was rebuffed by the Serbs. These plans extracted major concessions \nfrom the Moslem side. They were proposals that rewarded aggression. But \nin the interest of their people, the Bosnian Government felt compelled \nto accept them. The Bosnian Serbs, however, have been unwilling to \nagree to an internationally mediated plan to divide up the territory.\n  This situation has muddled along, because there is no consensus on an \nalternative course. The continuing Serb attacks on the U.N.-safe areas, \nhowever, make it impossible to continue trying to muddle through. \nMoreover, I am convinced that the strategy developed in London this \nweekend will not be sufficient to bring both parties to the negotiating \ntable. Both human rights considerations and our own national interest \nrequire us to change our policy in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, the United States cannot allow the systematic abuse of \nhuman rights to continue unchecked. The American people will not accept \nit. I have received dozens of phone calls from people in Illinois over \nthe last few days expressing their outrage over the human rights abuses \nin Srebrenica. One gentlemen who called me is a physician. He spent 16 \nmonths in eight concentration camps in Bosnia. Now he is trying to put \nhis life back together in Chicago. He is a lucky one, Mr. President, \nbecause he is out of the horror.\n  But it is not only compassion that requires us to change our policy \ntoward Bosnia. Our national interests demand it. Because of the arms \nembargo, one side is able to dictate the pace and outcome of this war. \nThe United States cannot allow such naked aggression to continue. The \nSerb success in using military force to gain territory and forcibly \nmove ethnic populations sends a signal to other would-be dictators that \nmilitary force is a better option than political negotiations. This is \nthe wrong signal.\n  The war in Bosnia is causing profound tension in the NATO alliance. \n\n[[Page S 10648]]\n  Our NATO allies, especially Britain and France, have substantial ground \ntroops in Bosnia. The opposition of these governments to lifting the \narms embargo reflect their justifiable concern toward the safety and \nwell-being of their soldiers. I am very concerned, however, that \ncontinuing the status quo will only increase the tensions between the \nUnited States and our European allies.\n  This war is also causing tensions between members in the eastern part \nof NATO. While the historical resentments between Greece and Turkey are \nan ongoing issue within NATO, the Balkan war is exacerbating these \ntensions. Greece has traditionally had a strong relationship with \nSerbia. Turkey, a secular Moslem country which has tried to condemn the \nBosnian conflict without making mention of religion, is finding it \nharder to keep silent on the religious aspect of this war. The \nimplication is that if the Bosnians were Christian, the West would be \ndoing more to protect them.\n  This religious argument is a very important component of how the \nBosnian conflict is viewed in many circles in the Moslem world. A front \npage article in yesterday's Washington Post reports that moderate \nMoslem governments that are allies of the United States, including \nTurkey, Egypt, and Jordan, are under pressure from their citizens to \ncome to the aid of the Bosnian government not because a fellow member \nof the United Nations is in need, but because the principal victims in \nthis war are Moslem. Fundamentalist circles in these countries who \nargue in support of the Bosnian Moslems are gaining the moral high \nground. The Bosnian conflict is increasingly being viewed in religious \nterms. It is in the national interest of the United States to minimize \nthe perception that the West is forsaking the Bosnians because of their \nreligion.\n  These tensions, coupled with UNPROFOR's failure to curb Serb \naggression, or prevent ethnic cleansing and human rights atrocities, \nlead me to conclude that the status quo cannot be sustained.\n  In my view, either the international community must defend Bosnia, or \nwe must make it possible for the Bosnians to defend themselves. And \nsince the first option is not politically viable, the only choice left \nis to withdraw UNPROFOR and lift the arms embargo. In a speech this \npast April in Chicago, the Bosnian Ambassador to the United States, His \nExcellency Sven Alkalaj, was very clear: ``If we must choose between \nUNPROFOR and arms, we can only choose arms.'' The Bosnians are not \nasking the United States or any other country to defend them. They \nsimply ask for the right to defend themselves.\n  There will only be an end to this conflict if aggression is met head \non. As long as one side is free to wage war without meeting any counter \nforce, the aggression will continue. UNPROFOR has no mandate to counter \nthe attacks against civilians. Worse, the presence of UNPROFOR provides \na shield against NATO air strikes. UNPROFOR's presence on the ground \nprevents the one thing that could make the fighting come to an end, and \nbring both sides to the negotiating table--the balance of power.\n  Only if there is a balance of power can there be a political solution \nin Bosnia. This cannot be provided by the United Nations, or the \ncountries of the West. Only the Bosnians themselves, properly armed, \ncan provide a balance of power.\n  The Bosnian Serbs will not negotiate as long as they think they are \nwinning on the battlefield. As long as UNPROFOR remains in Bosnia, one \nside is in a position to use aggression without consequence.\n  Mr. President, we need to change that equation. The Serbs must learn \nthat they cannot wage war on non-combatants in markets and bread lines \nwith impunity. They need to know that they are not going to be \nprotected from the horrendous human rights violations they are \ncommitting.\n  Mr. President, pulling out UNPROFOR and lifting the arms embargo is \nnot without significant risk. These consequences have already been \noutlined on the floor. The President has committed up to 25,000 U.S. \ntroops to help extricate UNPROFOR. Our troops would go into Bosnia for \na short, well-defined mission, under NATO command. The possibility of \ncasualties, however, cannot be underestimated. Removing UNPROFOR will \nleave Moslem refugees at immediate risk. Under this scenario, the \nhumanitarian situation will certainly get worse before it gets better. \nAnd, finally, the increased intensity of the fighting between Serbs and \nMoslems escalates the possibility of a wider regional war.\n  I believe that these serious consequences must be weighed against \nallowing the present situation to continue. The current Serb policy of \ntaking UNPROFOR soldiers hostage, and overrunning safe areas cannot be \nallowed to continue. Two years ago, these actions, in total defiance of \nthe United Nations, might have meant a considerable escalation that the \ninternational community would have wanted to avoid. But today, these \nacts have not only occurred, they have not met any counter force.\n  Mr. President, the UNPROFOR mission is untenable. It does not have \nthe resources or the armaments to enforce peace. It does not have the \nwill to enforce peace. The mission, as it has been mandated, can only \nfunction if all sides are willing to stop fighting. UNPROFOR cannot \nkeep the peace when one side wants war. UNPROFOR cannot protect the \nenclaves from serious assault. UNPROFOR cannot protect women from rape \nor men from disappearing. There is no consensus to turn UNPROFOR into a \nmilitary unit capable of defending the enclaves or the innocents. The \nonly conclusion is to lift the arms embargo.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, in considering the legislation pending \nbefore the Senate today which requires the President to unilaterally \nlift the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina, I am struck by \nthe following question: What is our goal?\n  My colleagues have stated that we can no longer stand by and watch \nthe Bosnians continue to be slaughtered by the Serbian army. By lifting \nthe embargo, we are giving the Bosnians the means to stand up and fight \nthe Serbs on an even footing. In their minds, we are helping to prevent \nfurther killing of Bosnians. But are we really doing that or are we \ncontributing to more bloodshed, more killing, and more ethnic \ncleansing?\n  As I have said several times in the past when the Senate has been \nfaced with this issue, lifting the arms embargo will not guarantee \npeace. It will only widen the war and guarantee more deaths on both \nsides. Lifting the arms embargo contingent on the removal of United \nNations Protective Forces does not take into consideration humanitarian \nconcerns. It will not lead to greater protection of civilians and \nrefugees in the safe areas. Rather it will lead to further violence \nagainst them.\n  While I agree that the international efforts of the United Nations \nhave faltered in recent months, I do not believe that lifting the arms \nembargo is the appropriate response. To be honest, short of full scale \nmilitary intervention, no one in the international community has a \ncomprehensive solution to ending the conflict in Bosnia. Although some \nmay see lifting the arms embargo as the only solution right now, it \ndoes not get us any closer to finding a comprehensive solution or to \nbringing the war to a close.\n  It is still my opinion that the only way to end the war in Bosnia is \nto bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear against the Serbs and \ntheir allies. We must begin by making a greater effort to cut off \nSerbian access to arms. Only by choking off their ability to conduct \nthe war in Bosnia will we be able to bring them to the negotiating \ntable.\n  Again, I return to my original question: What is our goal in lifting \nthe arms embargo? What are we trying to achieve? I do not believe \nanyone in this body truly believes that any kind of humanitarian or \npeace-bringing goal is accomplished by this ill-fated action. For that \nreason, I will once again oppose this legislation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10603-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10648-S10649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, let me describe for our colleagues \nbriefly what this unanimous-consent agreement entails so everyone has a \nclear understanding of what the situation is.\n  We will come in at 8:30 in the morning. At that time, we will have \ndebate for 2 hours and 10 minutes, to be equally divided. We will then \nrecess to attend the joint meeting to hear the speech from the \nPresident of South Korea, reconvene at noon, and have an additional 90 \nminutes of debate, again to be equally divided, followed then by \nrecognition of the two leaders for one-half hour under which leadership \ntime will be used, and with the completion of that time, an immediate \nvote first on the Cohen amendment, and then on the Nunn amendment, and \nthen finally on final passage.\n  So there will be two blocks of time, an hour on either side \napproximately in the morning, 45 minutes on either side beginning at \nnoon.\n  What that means is that there is very limited time, and I encourage \nmy colleagues to keep their remarks brief. We have already had a number \nof requests for time tomorrow morning on this side. I urge my \ncolleagues to be accommodating and to take into account the fact that a \nnumber of Senators will wish to be recognized and to be heard. It is \nnot my intent to allocate any time beyond 10 minutes tomorrow morning \nto any Senator except Senator Nunn, who has an amendment pending or \nduring that period beginning tomorrow noon.\n  So this accommodates a number of concerns raised and certainly allows \nus to reach a time for final passage sometime in early afternoon, and I \nappreciate the cooperation of the Senators on both sides.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10649-5", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10649-S10652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA SELF-DEFENSE ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me make a few comments tonight--I \nhave waited to allow other Senators to be heard--and I intend again to \nspeak briefly tomorrow prior to the vote, but I wish to take some time \nthis evening to express my personal position with regard to this issue \nand explain why I will be voting as I will tomorrow afternoon.\n  We are again, as others have indicated, in a crisis in Bosnia. Just \ntoday, as was reported several hours ago, in open violation of the \nUnited Nations mandates, the Bosnian Serbs have seized another safe \narea, Zepa, under the protection of UNPROFOR, the United Nations \nprotection forces.\n  This despicable act of aggression by the Bosnian Serbs is now being \nfollowed by a brutal wave of ethnic cleansing that is forcing thousands \nof Bosnian women and children and elderly to flee for their lives. \nUnited Nations peacekeepers now find themselves under attack in a land \nwhere there is little peace to keep.\n  This is not the first time the Senate has debated whether to \nterminate the arms embargo in Bosnia. In the 103d Congress, the Senate \nvoted on the matter seven different times.\n  Less than a year ago, on August 11, 1994, the Senate adopted two \ncompeting amendments to the fiscal year 1995 Department of Defense \nappropriations bill. The first of those amendments was offered by \nSenators Dole and Lieberman. It set a deadline of November 15 of last \nyear for the President to break with our NATO allies and unilaterally \nend the arms embargo on the Bosnian Government. It passed by a vote of \n58 to 42.\n  The second amendment, offered by Senators Mitchell and Nunn, proposed \na different scenario for lifting the arms embargo. It said first that \nif the Bosnian Serbs refused to accept a peace plan developed by the \nfive-member contact group by October 15, 1994, then the United States \nwould introduce and support a resolution in the United Nations to end \nthe embargo completely.\n  Second, the Nunn-Mitchell amendment said that if the United Nations \nfailed to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia by November 15 of 1994, \nand if the Bosnian Serbs continued to reject the peace plan developed \nby the contact group, then no Department of Defense funds could be used \nto enforce the arms embargo against Bosnia. In addition, the President \nwould be required to submit a plan to equip and train the Bosnian armed \nforces and consult with Congress regarding that specific plan.\n  The Nunn-Mitchell language was included in the 1995 defense \nappropriations bill and signed into law on October 5 of last year.\n  The administration has been unable, unfortunately, to convince the \nUnited Nations Security Council to lift the arms embargo \nmultilaterally. But in keeping with the congressional mandate, the \nUnited States last November ceased participation in the enforcement of \nthe arms embargo against the \n\n[[Page S 10650]]\nBosnian Government. The administration also prepared and briefed the \nCongress on a plan to equip and train Bosnian armed forces. That is the \nhistorical context for the debate we are now experiencing here on the \nSenate floor.\n  Today, as this Senate once again debates whether to lift the arms \nembargo against Bosnia, the credibility of UNPROFOR as peacekeepers has \nseriously eroded. What has not eroded is the overwhelming desire by the \nAmerican people to see the bloodshed in Bosnia ended without committing \nUnited States ground troops to the Bosnian conflict.\n  Yet, the Dole-Lieberman amendment would make this all the more likely \nby requiring the President to unilaterally lift the arms embargo \nagainst Bosnia. This amendment will place United States ground troops \nin peril by intensifying the conflict at the time when United States \ntroops were assisting our NATO allies in the difficult and dangerous \nmission of withdrawing their scattered forces from Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, today I received a letter from the President \nexplaining his reasons for strongly opposing S. 21, which he believes \n``could lead to an escalation of the conflict there, including the \npossible Americanization of the conflict itself.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the President's letter be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks and urge all of my colleagues to \nconsider carefully the President's concerns as we debate this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. In contrast to those concerns, some of the sponsors of \nthis amendment believe that by lifting the arms embargo, we can avoid \nthe awful possibility of sending United States ground forces to Bosnia \nor we will let the Bosnians fight their own war. But it is not that \nsimple, and we know that. We have a responsibility in this Senate to \nspeak honestly to the American people, to tell them the potential \nconsequences of lifting the arms embargo at this time and in this \nmanner.\n  The Dole-Lieberman amendment requires the amendment to lift the \nembargo upon completion of the withdrawal of the United Nations \nprotection forces or 12 weeks after the Bosnian Government requests the \nwithdrawal of U.N. troops.\n  While the President may extend the deadline for lifting the embargo \nfor up to 30 days, if he determines and reports in advance that the \nsafety, security and successful completion of the withdrawal of \nUNPROFOR requires more time, the fundamental problem remains the same. \nUnder this resolution, America's military and diplomatic policy in the \nBalkans conflict will be determined not by the President and not by the \nCongress, but by the actions of the Bosnian Government. Let me restate \nthat, Mr. President, because it is so critical to an appreciation of \nwhat this vote is all about. America's military and diplomatic policy \nin the Balkans will be determined not by the President, not by the \nCongress, but by the actions of the Bosnian Government.\n  What is not addressed in the bill is what happens when the U.N. \nforces, including substantial forces of our NATO allies, begin to \nwithdraw from Bosnia. What happens? As we all know, the President has \npromised our NATO allies that the United States will provide up to \n25,000 ground combat and logistic troops to assist in the safe \nevacuation of the U.N. peacekeepers from Bosnia. It could very well \nmean that we will be forced to send U.S. troops into a situation of \nheightened conflict that would risk American lives.\n  There is no question that the long nightmare in Bosnia must end. \nThere is no question that the United States must play a role in \nresolving the nightmare. But let us be fully cognizant of what is truly \nat stake. Let us not pretend that there is an easy way out, because \nthere is not. There should be no confusion in the minds of any of my \ncolleagues regarding what a vote for this bill actually means. What it \nmeans is that the President of the United States, the Commander in \nChief of our Armed Forces, will be required by law to act in response \nto actions taken by a foreign government, the Government of Bosnia.\n  It means, by design, by this legislation itself, not only are we \nresponding for the first time to a foreign government, required to \nrespond in a way that may not be in our best interest, but we will have \nto ignore our closest allies and unilaterally lift the embargo to do \nso. It means this Nation will very likely be forced to assume sole \nresponsibility for arming and training the Bosnian army. That is what \nthis means.\n  And it means almost certainly--it means almost certainly--that in all \nof this, U.S. troops will die. This is a very slippery and treacherous \nslope we would embark on with the passage of this bill. And I would \nremind my colleagues that, if we enact it, we have got to be prepared \nto face the almost certain consequence of U.S. involvement of U.S. \nground troops in Bosnia sometime very soon.\n  No one can read the accounts of ethnic cleansing, no one can look at \nthose images of terrified refugees trudging a trail of tears from one \nBosnian city to another in search of safety and not be horrified. I \nunderstand the arguments of those who say we cannot stand by and allow \ngenocide to occur unchecked and unchallenged. I understand those \narguments and agree with the moral concerns of those who advance them. \nBut let us be clear, forcing U.N. protection forces to withdraw from \nBosnia, which is the most likely effect of the bill, can only increase, \nnot decrease, the horrifying acts of genocide in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, what happens then? What happens when the U.N. forces \nare gone? What happens when NATO forces are gone? What happens when we \ncontinue to see night after night on the televisions across this land \nthat genocide, the horrific acts that we have seen so far, and there is \nno one there to protect them? What will we do? Do we continue to say it \nis unacceptable and we will keep sending arms? And then watch this \nspread to Kosovo and Macedonia and other parts of this region? Is that \nwhat we are allowed to do?\n  What happens? We are left with the untenable choice after all our \nallies have washed their hands of this situation to accept one of two \nthings: either to accept the horrific acts that we will continue to \nsee, Serbians rolling over the Bosnians, with or without additional \narms; or some unilateral insertion of American troops to stop this from \nspreading and to stop the holocaust that we see already. That is the \nuntenable choice we are going to be given if our allies leave.\n  The very best case scenario, Mr. President, assumes that it will take \n2 to 3 months to arm and train the Bosnian army. That scenario also \nassumes the arms will actually reach the Bosnian army and that they \nwill not be captured by Bosnian Serbs and that the Croatian Government \nwill allow all of the arms to be transported through their ports and \nacross their land. That is what we are assuming, that somehow the \nCroatian Government will say, ``OK. We will subject ourselves to \nwhatever may come, all of the repercussions that may come with opening \nour ports to the Bosnians so that the Bosnians can ship tanks and heavy \nweaponry through our ports, through our land, to fight the Serbs.'' How \nmany people really believe that is what is going to happen?\n  Mr. President, to suggest that the Bosnian Serbs will simply wait \npatiently and peacefully to decide what the Croatian Government is \ngoing to do, to decide whether or not the Bosnian army is being armed, \nseems to me to be very naive. We are talking about a regime that shells \nunarmed women and children as they wait in line in safe areas to \ncollect their daily ration of water, a regime that is committed to \nethnic cleansing. Should we really believe that this regime will hold \nits fire while the U.S. troops are training the Bosnian army to defend \nits own people? Can we, without endangering U.S. or allied troops, \ncounter their fire? We know the answers. I have grave doubts.\n  The likelihood is that the Bosnian Government will escalate its \ncampaign of genocide, will overrun the remaining safe areas quickly \nwhile it still has the ability to do so with little resistance. And it \nis entirely possible that this escalation could occur while U.S. troops \nare on the ground in Bosnia.\n  Then what? Those who would vote for this bill must also be concerned \nabout \n\n[[Page S 10651]]\nthe very real possibility that withdrawing U.N. troops from Bosnia now \nand unilateral lifting of the embargo will greatly increase the risk \nthat the war in Bosnia will spread. While the United States may have no \ndirect national security interest in Bosnia itself, we certainly would \nhave security interests at risk in fighting that would go south to the \nregion in Kosovo, in Macedonia, where 500 U.S. troops are now stationed \nand involve our NATO allies of Greece and Turkey.\n  I believe that every Member of this Senate is deeply concerned about \nthe tragic events that are taking place in Bosnia. And I believe that \nevery Member of this Senate would like to see an end to the fighting \nthat has left thousands of innocent people dead, millions of people \ndisplaced, torn from their homes, torn from their families. And I do \nnot believe there is any disagreement about the goal we all share: to \nend the aggression and the atrocities born in the Bosnian conflict. The \nonly disagreement is over how we can best achieve that goal. And the \nquestion is again before the Senate, should the United States on our \nown, against the wishes of our allies, end the arms embargo,\n or should we continue to act in concert with our allies and the United \nNations to end the arms embargo? Considering this question, let us \nremember that Bosnia is not the only Nation in which the United States \nis engaged in a multinational effort to impose sanctions or take other \ncollective measures. There is a collective action to impose sanctions \nagainst Iraq, against Cuba, against Libya, and it may become necessary \nto impose sanctions against others to control the spread of nuclear \nweapons, or for other reasons. All of these collective efforts are of \ngreat importance to this country.\n\n  Mr. President, if we unilaterally terminate the arms embargo, then \nwhat is to prevent our allies from doing the same on collective actions \nwith which they disagree? What do we tell them? What standing do we \nhave to suggest to them that they must comply but we will not?\n  We cannot have it both ways. We cannot expect our allies to support \nus on collective actions that suit us if we refuse to support other \ncollective actions that may make us uncomfortable.\n  Senator Exon and others have raised important questions about the \nconsequences that lifting the arms embargo could have on NATO. Fifty \nyears ago this summer, the NATO alliance freed Europe, freed the world \nactually, from the great evil of Nazism. And for nearly 50 years, until \nthe start of the Serbian aggression 40 months ago, NATO has kept peace \nin all of Europe. The NATO alliance was essentially there to end the \ncold war, and now it is essential to the continued stability of both \nEurope, as well as the United States.\n  Our NATO allies are imploring us not to lift the arms embargo \nunilaterally while they have troops in Bosnia. They are imploring us to \nstand with them as they continue to seek a negotiated settlement \nagainst the odds, recognizing the difficulty, knowing there are no easy \nanswers, appealing to us to help them as they have helped us.\n  What will happen if NATO chooses at some point in the future to \nignore us? What will happen to NATO if we ignore the urgent pleas of \nour allies now? Those are questions we must all ask ourselves, Mr. \nPresident, before we cast this crucial vote tomorrow.\n  The end of the cold war and the resurgence of ethnic conflict and \nnationalism have created flashpoints all over this world. As the only \nremaining superpower, the United States is going to be asked again and \nagain to send troops to resolve conflicts. Maybe these conflicts will \nhave long histories and maybe they will be intractable, but we will be \nasked and, in some cases, we will commit, and as we make those \ndecisions, we, by ourselves, must recognize that we cannot solve every \nproblem in the world. We are going to need the help of our allies in \ndealing with these problems, and the only way we can deal with them \nwithout resorting to unilateral action is in those difficult times, as \nwe see right now, we recognize the implications of breaking out from \nmultilateral efforts and taking upon ourselves the responsibilities \nthat come with the actions that we are now contemplating.\n  I understand and, frankly, I empathize with the motivations of my \ncolleagues who have introduced and supported this bill. The carnage in \nBosnia cries out for decisive action to end the suffering of helpless \nmen, women and children who daily are abused, killed by Bosnian Serb \ngunmen. But we must not, we must not allow our frustration over the \nfailure to reach a settlement of the Bosnian crisis to force us into \nactions that will only worsen the situation. We must not lose sight of \nthe fact that breaking with our allies carries with it the risk of \nlong-term consequences, and we must not pretend we are decreasing the \nchances that U.S. ground troops will be sent to fight in Bosnia when, \nin fact, the very opposite is likely to happen.\n  So as we debate this proposal, let us consider carefully what is in \nour Nation's best interest, in the best interest of the Bosnian people \nnow and in the future. Let us recognize that this is an issue beyond \nBosnia, in spite of our outrage, in spite of our frustration, in spite \nof our desire to respond in some way. We must also recognize the \ncommitments, the long-term ramification and the extraordinary nature of \nthe decision that we will be making tomorrow afternoon.\n  Mr. President, we will have more time to talk about this tomorrow. I \ncertainly hope that we will not allow our decision to be made by \nemotion, rather by objective calculation of what is best for the \neffort, what is best for our long-term alliances, what is best for this \ncountry, what is best for the men and women we will be called upon to \nsend to Bosnia should this situation worsen and should the need for \nU.S. forces be more evident as the weeks and months unfold.\n  Mr. President, I now yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                               The White House\n\n                                        Washington, July 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I am writing to express my strong \n     opposition to S. 21, the ``Bosnia and Herzegovina Self-\n     Defense Act of 1995''. While I fully understand the \n     frustration that the bill's supporters feel, I nonetheless am \n     firmly convinced that in passing this legislation Congress \n     would undermine efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement in \n     Bosnia and could lead to an escalation of the conflict there, \n     including the possible Americanization of the conflict.\n       There are no simple or risk-free answers in Bosnia. \n     Unilaterally lifting the arms embargo has serious \n     consequences. Our allies in UNPROFOR have made it clear that \n     a unilateral U.S. action to lift the arms embargo, which \n     would place their troops in greater danger, will result in \n     their early withdrawal from UNPROFOR, leading to its \n     collapse. I believe the United States, as the leader of NATO, \n     would have an obligation under these circumstances to assist \n     in that withdrawal, involving thousands of U.S. troops in a \n     difficult mission. Consequently, at the least, unilateral \n     lift by the U.S. drives our European allies out of Bosnia and \n     pulls the U.S. in, even if for a temporary and defined \n     mission.\n       I agree that UNPROFOR, in its current mission, has reached \n     a crossroads. As you know, we are working intensively with \n     our allies on concrete measures to strengthen UNPROFOR and \n     enable it to continue to make a significant difference in \n     Bosnia, as it has--for all its deficiencies--over the past \n     three years. Let us not forget that UNPROFOR has been \n     critical to an unprecedented humanitarian operation that \n     feeds and helps keep alive over two million people in Bosnia; \n     until recently, the number of civilian casualties has been a \n     fraction of what they were before UNPROFOR arrived; much of \n     central Bosnia is at peace; and the Bosnian-Croat Federation \n     is holding. UNPROFOR has contributed to each of these \n     significant results.\n       Nonetheless, the Serb assaults in recent days make clear \n     that UNPROFOR must be strengthened if it is to continue to \n     contribute to peace. I am determined to make every effort to \n     provide, with our allies, for more robust and meaningful \n     UNPROFOR action. We are now working to implement the \n     agreement reached last Friday in London to threaten \n     substantial and decisive use of NATO air power if the Bosnian \n     Serbs attack Gorazde and to strengthen protection of Sarajevo \n     using the Rapid Reaction Force. These actions lay the \n     foundation for stronger measures to protect the other safe \n     areas. Congressional passage of unilateral lift at this \n     delicate moment will undermine those efforts. It will provide \n     our allies a rationale for doing less, not more. It will \n     provide the pretext for absolving themselves of \n     responsibility in Bosnia, rather than assuming a stronger \n     role at this critical moment.\n       It is important to face squarely the consequences of a U.S. \n     action that forces UNPROFOR departure. First, as I have \n     noted, we immediately would be part of a costly NATO \n     operation to withdraw UNPROFOR. Second, after that operation \n     is \n\n[[Page S 10652]]\n     complete, there will be an intensification of the fighting in Bosnia. \n     It is unlikely the Bosnian Serbs would stand by waiting until \n     the Bosnian government is armed by others. Under assault, the \n     Bosnian government will look to the U.S. to provide arms, air \n     support and if that fails, more active military support. At \n     that stage, the U.S. will have broken with our NATO allies as \n     a result of unilateral lift. The U.S. will be asked to fill \n     the void--in military support, humanitarian aid and in \n     response to refugee crises. Third, intensified fighting will \n     risk a wider conflict in the Balkans with far-reaching \n     implications for regional peace. Finally, UNPROFOR's \n     withdrawal will set back prospects for a peaceful, negotiated \n     solution for the foreseeable future.\n       In short, unilateral lift means unilateral responsibility. \n     We are in this with our allies now. We would be in it by \n     ourselves if we unilaterally lifted the embargo. The NATO \n     Alliance has stood strong for almost five decades. We should \n     not damage it in a futile effort to find an easy fix to the \n     Balkan conflict.\n       I am prepared to veto any resolution or bill that may \n     require the United States to lift unilaterally the arms \n     embargo. It will make a bad situation worse. I ask that you \n     not support the pending legislation, S. 21.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10649-6", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \ncelebrating the 30th anniversary of the Medicare program. In light of \nrecent Republican attacks on the program, it is particularly important \nthat we take the time to recognize the value of the Medicare program to \nso many of our Nation's senior citizens and their families.\n  For decades, Democratic leaders have supported and reinforced the \ngenerally accepted proposition that health care is a fundamental human \nneed and that, in a just society, there ought to be a way to provide \nfor it. Since it was signed into law by President Johnson in July 1965 \nthe Medicare program has succeeded where many had thought it would \nfail. The world's largest health care program, Medicare currently \nprovides quality health services for more than 37 million American \nsenior and disabled citizens at an administrative cost of just two \npercent.\n  In my State of Maryland alone, more than 604,000 seniors receive \nvital medical services through the Medicare program. Just yesterday, I \nvisited a number of these individuals at the Parkville Senior Center in \nBaltimore County. Like a vast majority of seniors across the country, \nthey too are concerned about the future of Medicare and how decisions \nnow being made in Congress will effect the quality and availability of \nhealth care services for their generation. Quite frankly, Mr. \nPresident, I share their concerns.\n  For these senior citizens and the more than 37 million elderly \nAmericans nationwide, the Republican budget cuts will be devastating. \nThe Republican Budget Resolution cuts Medicare by $270 billion over the \nnext 7 years. I know it is asserted that the actual dollar amounts for \nMedicare will not drop, but rather will increase gradually over the \nnext 7 years. However, if the proposed dollar increases are not \nproportional to increases in Medicare enrollees and increases in the \ncosts of medical care, the end result is massive cost-shifting and cuts \nin services for beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, in my view, it is essential that we recognize that \nMedicare is not a system unto itself. The Medicare program is instead a \nlarge component of our Nation's health care system and it is illogical \nto assume that isolated cuts in Medicare will not adversely effect all \nAmericans.\n  The Health Care Finance Administration [HCFA] estimates that Medicare \npayments account for 45 percent of health care spending by our Nation's \nelderly. Under the Republican budget plan, out-of-pocket costs to \nseniors are expected to increase by an average of $900 per person year \nby the year 2002. Over a 7-year period, the typical beneficiary would \npay an estimated $3,200 in additional out-of-pocket costs. While this \nmight not sound like much to some, these numbers become more \nsignificant when you factor in statistics that indicate that 60 percent \nof program spending was incurred on behalf of those with incomes less \nthan twice the poverty level, and 83 percent of program spending was on \nbehalf of those with annual incomes of less than $25,000.\n  Clearly, when we talk about Medicare recipients, we are not talking \nabout our Nation's wealthiest citizens. Many seniors live on fixed \nincomes. In fact, a large number of Medicare recipients depend on \nSocial Security benefits for much of their income. According to HCFA, \nabout 60 percent of the elderly rely on Social Security benefits for 50 \npercent or more of their income and 32 percent of the elderly rely on \nSocial Security for 80 percent or more of their income. It is also \nestimated that as many as 2 million seniors can expect to see the value \nof their Social Security COLA's decline as increased Medicare costs \nconsume 40 to 50 percent of Social Security COLA's by 2002. Requiring \nthese individuals to pay more for their health care will directly \nundercut their standard of living. In my view, it is simply \nunacceptable to create a situation in which more and more seniors will \nsee their resources stretched to the extent that they will have to \nchoose between food and health care.\n  Mr. President, what I find most troubling is that Congressional \nRepublicans are seeking to enact draconian spending cuts, the burden of \nwhich will fall primarily on the shoulders of the most vulnerable of \nour society, in order to provide a significant tax cut for the very \nwealthy. The future health security of our Nation's seniors should not \nbe jeopardized in order to create a pool of funds for a tax break which \nalmost \n\n[[Page S 10653]]\nsolely benefits upper income individuals.\n  As we commemorate the signing of this important measure into law, I \nthink it is appropriate that we all take time to reflect upon the \nhistory of the Medicare program and the principles upon which it was \nfounded. Before the Medicare program, many of our elderly could not \nafford health care or were forced to watch their life savings dissolve \nunder the weight of ever-increasing health care costs.\n  Mr. President, those involved in crafting the Medicare program \nrecognized that providing health care to some of our Nation's most \nvulnerable individuals lays the foundation upon which to build a decent \nsociety. As Democrats we must continue to embrace this principle today, \nas we have for the past 30 years.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10652-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10653-S10654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF MEDICARE\n\n\n                      a turning point for medicare\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in 1965--30 years ago this week--in \nIndependence, MO, Medicare was signed by President Lyndon Johnson, with \nHarry Truman looking on.\n  Over the last 30 years, Medicare has become one of the largest public \nhealth insurance systems in the world, having grown from 19 million \nseniors at a cost of $3 billion to 37 billion seniors costing over $159 \nbillion last year.\n  In 1995--30 years later--Medicare is at a turning point.\n  In fact, some would say the Medicare is under attack, because \nMedicare is slated for $270 million in cuts over the next 7 years under \nplans which are scheduled to be enacted later this year.\n  This proposed 14 percent cut in Medicare spending is the largest \nMedicare ever proposed and makes up over 20 percent of the $1.2 billion \nin cuts in the Republican resolution.\n\n\n                        the benefits of medicare\n\n  While there are many disagreements about which direction Medicare \nshould go in the future, there is no doubt about the benefits and \nachievements of the current program.\n  Before Medicare was enacted in 1965, health care for seniors was \nexpensive and often unavailable, due to the lack of insurers willing to \ncover seniors and the fact that, even with Social Security, seniors \nhave been one of the highest-poverty age groups in America.\n  Only 50 percent of seniors had health insurance, and so an illness \ncould quickly force a senior into a charity ward or consume a lifetime \nof family savings.\n  In comparison, the benefits of the current Medicare program are clear \nto millions of individuals and the families of those who are enrolled; \nhealth coverage is provided for 37 million seniors--including 3.6 \nmillion Californians.\n  Ninety-nine percent of the elderly population is covered through \nMedicare, giving seniors the highest rate of health coverage for any \nage group in the United States;\n  The average lifespan for older Americans has increased 3 years since \nMedicare began, and quality of life has been improved by procedures and \ntreatments such as hip replacements developed through Medicare.\n\n\n                        problems facing medicare\n\n  Nonetheless, there are some clear problems with Medicare that must be \naddressed, including; the anticipated bankruptcy of the Medicare Part A \nHospital Trust Fund, which is projected to occur in the year 2002 at \ncurrent spending rates; high annual increases in spending of 10 \npercent, which have helped cause the program to go from $3 billion in \n1965 to $160 billion in 1994; fraud and abuse that eat up $44 billion \nin total health care costs annually, according to a GAO report, and \nresult in $140 million in excess charges paid by consumers each year; \nthe lack of potentially cost-saving managed Medicare, which enrolls \nonly 10 percent of Medicare participants even though additional dental \nand prescription drug benefits are sometimes\n available (the rate is 25 percent in California).\n\n  In short, the current Medicare Program pays out much more in benefits \nthan it is taking in from premiums and payroll contributions. Without \nreform, Medicare will continue to grow out of control. Costs for new \ntechnologies and procedures continue to increase rapidly, and about 1 \nmillion additional Medicare participants each year will add to costs.\n\n\n                      reasonable medicare reforms\n\n  To address these problems and lower Federal spending, I support a \nnumber of tough-minded Medicare reforms, including tightening controls \nand preventing fraud in Medicare; using successful State and Federal \nmodels such as the California Public Employee Retirement System \n[CalPERS] and the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan as a basis for \ncooperative, market-based systems. I support asking the wealthiest \nMedicare recipients to pay more into the system than they do now; \nmaking managed care plans more beneficial to the Federal Government and \nmore easily available to seniors, only 10 percent of whom are currently \nenrolled in HMO's.\n  To help solve these problems, I voted in favor of $54 billion in \nMedicare cuts and reforms contained in the 1993 budget reconciliation \nbill, and I supported national health care reform such as the \nmainstream coalition proposal.\n\n\n       republican budget proposals cut medicare too far, too fast\n\n  However, I strongly oppose destructive Medicare reform proposals that \ngo too far, too fast, without any certainty as to the results, \nincluding those that would force all Medicare enrollees to change \ndoctors, give up their choice of doctors, or join HMO's involuntarily; \nsteeply raise Medicare cots to participants, who already spend a \nnational average of 21 percent of their incomes on health costs; rely \nalmost entirely on appealing but untested changes to the current \nMedicare system, such as private vouchers and medical savings accounts; \ntarget the 3.6 million Californians who participate in Medicare for an \nunfair share of the deficit-reduction burden.\n  As a result, I voted against the Republican budget resolution, which \ncuts $270 billion from the current baseline for Medicare over the next \n7 years.\n\n\n                    unknown effects of medicare cuts\n\n  What exactly do health care cuts of this size really mean? Well, no \none really knows, but health care experts tell us that the options for \ncuts of this size are few, and estimates by the Health Care Finance \nAgency, which runs these programs, have projected dramatic effects.\n  Under the Republican budget proposal--and the initiatives that are \nbeing considered for enactment later this fall--more will be taken out \nof seniors' Social Security checks, because that is where the Medicare \npart B premium is deducted. Medicare premiums and Social Security \nchecks are linked together because under the integrated Social Security \ncheck-issuing system, Medicare premiums are automatically taken out of \nSocial Security checks.\n  Cuts to Californians on Medicare would total over $36 billion over \nthe next 7 years--13 percent of the $270 billion total cut despite the \nfact that California only has 9.5 percent of the total population--\nHealth Care Finance Administration.\n  Costs to seniors will have to be steeply increased, even though over \n80 percent of Medicare goes to seniors with less than $25,000 in \nincome, who already pay over 20 percent of their income for health \ncosts.\n  Managed care could be implemented on a large scale without any real \nassurance that there will be more benefits to seniors and increased \nsavings to the Federal Government. The current demonstration of managed \nMedicare has not yielded savings to the Federal Government, according \nto recent studies.\n  Popular but untested ideas such as private voucher systems and \nmedical savings accounts, which have not been tried at anywhere near \nthis scale, could once again allow insurance companies to discriminate \nagainst older, sicker seniors, or force families to spend their savings \nin order to provide care.\n  Relatively small-scale purchasing pools, such as the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan, which covers only 9 million people \nnationwise, will be expanded enormously without any clear knowledge of \nthe potential effects on care for the elderly.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  There is no argument that Medicare needs to be strengthened and \nimproved, and I have supported reasonable Medicare reform in the past. \nBut cutting $270 billion out of the program and implementing reforms \nthat have yet to be \n\n[[Page S 10654]]\ntested is not really reform, it's dismantling the program.\n  The effects of cuts on this scale may not be felt immediately, and \nthe plans for how to achieve them are certainly being kept under wraps \nuntil the last minute, but sooner or later it will be clear that \ncutting $270 billion out of Medicare goes too far, too fast.\n  I only hope it is not too late to save the program before the \nAmerican people realize it, and that 30 years from now this Congress is \nknown for having reformed but not reduced the Medicare Program that has \ngotten us so far.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10653-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  PROCLAMATION HONORING THE SERVICE AND LEADERSHIP OF SHERIFF JOHN T. \n                                PIERPONT\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \ntoday to salute a good friend whose leadership in the field of law \nenforcement is exemplary. John T. Pierpont is currently serving his \nfourth term as Sheriff of Greene County, MO, which includes my hometown \nof Springfield, MO. John was first elected to serve Greene County in \n1981 and is overseeing an office of 140 employees in seven different \ndivisions, all dedicated to helping and protecting the people of Greene \nCounty and Southwest Missouri. Prior to serving Greene County, John was \nU.S. Marshal for the Western District of Missouri for 8 years. As U.S. \nMarshal for the Western District, John oversaw a jurisdiction of more \nthan 66 counties.\n  While successfully leading law enforcement efforts throughout \nsouthwest Missouri, John Pierpont also has been an active leader within \nthe Missouri and national law enforcement communities. Sheriff Pierpont \nis a former President of the Missouri Sheriffs' Association, the \nMissouri Peace Officers' Association, and the Retired U.S. Marshals. \nJohn was first elected to a leadership position in the 26,000 member \nNational Sheriffs' Association in 1989 as Sergeant-at-Arms and moved up \nfrom Seventh Vice President to the position of First Vice President \nwhich he held in 1994. I am pleased to salute John Pierpont for his \nJune 14, 1995 election as the National President of the National \nSheriffs' Association.\n  Through his years of selfless service and dedication to his chosen \nprofession of law enforcement, John Pierpont has displayed principled \nleadership and a devotion to the principles of justice, hard work, and \nfamily. His standard of leadership is an example to his colleagues in \nlaw enforcement and all other areas of public and private service.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10654-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      THE LOBBYING DISCLOSURE ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1060, the Lobbying \nDisclosure Act of 1995, as amended last night by the compromise \nlanguage developed by our distinguished colleagues, Senators McConnell \nand Levin. I am pleased that the McConnell-Levin amendment solves both \nof the principal problems with lobbying reform legislation that caused \nme to vote against it last year.\n  First, the McConnell-Levin amendment assures that this legislation is \nnot directed at grassroots lobbying. Grassroots lobbyists will not be \nrequired to report their activities or disclose their contributors. \nUnlike last year's bill, moreover, S. 1060 does not threaten to make \ngrass roots lobbyists divulge their entire mailing lists.\n  Second, the McConnell-Levin amendment removes from S. 1060 the \nprovisions that would have created a new government agency, which would \nhave been called the Office of Lobbying Registration and Public \nDisclosure. It replaces those provisions with language that establishes \nadministrative enforcement by the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk \nof the House of Representatives. Those officers, and not a new \ngovernment agency, will receive the lobbying reports that will be \nrequired if S. 1060 becomes law.\n  Mr. President, S. 1060 represents a reasonable compromise that \nproperly balances the first amendment rights of the people against the \ndemand of the public for meaningful reform of the way in which \nWashington does business. I remain convinced that last year's bill went \ntoo far and threatened to abridge the first amendment rights of \ngrassroots lobbyists. Moreover, last year's bill made the age-old \nmistake of attempting to address a problem by creating yet another new \ngovernment agency. I am pleased that last year's bill was defeated and \nthat, this year, the opposing sides in that battle have come together \nto produce this bill.\n  Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, \nSenator McConnell, for his able leadership with respect to this bill. \nHe has done an outstanding job in achieving the imminent overwhelming \napproval of the Senate for this bill.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10654-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10654-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10654-4", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10654-S10655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1226.

A bill to amend chapter 30 of title 35, United States Code, \nto afford third parties an opportunity for greater participation in \nreexamination proceedings before the Patent and Trademark Office, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the patent reexamination reform act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Patent \nReexamination Reform Act of 1995. This legislation will significantly \nimprove the patent reexamination process, making it an inexpensive and \nexpeditious alternative to patent validity litigation. More \nimportantly, this legislation will not unreasonably increase the cost, \ncomplexity, or duration of a reexamination proceeding, nor will it \nimpose an unreasonable burden on the Patent and Trademark Office, who \nmust ultimately process and reexamine the patents. Individual inventors \nand small businesses alike will benefit from this legislation because \ncostly and time consuming litigation can now be avoided through the use \nof a more fair reexamination process.\n  There are five key elements of this proposed legislation. First, the \nlegislation would simplify and shorten procedures governing initiation \nor reexamination proceedings. Second, the legislation would \nsignificantly increase the opportunity for a third party requester to \nmeaningfully participate in a reexamination proceeding. Third, it would \nbroaden the basis and scope of reexamination proceedings before the \nPatent and Trademark Office. Fourth, it would prevent the multiple \nrequests for patent reexamination. Finally, it would provide a third \nparty requester a right to appeal any decisions of the Patent and \nTrademark Office to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n  The patent reexamination process was originally designed to provide a \nlow-cost administrative procedure to \n\n[[Page S 10656]]\nquickly resolve questions regarding the validity of a patent. \nUnfortunately, patent reexamination has become an unattractive vehicle \nfor patent dispute resolution because of the strict limits imposed on \nthird parties who seek reexamination. Many critics of our system argue \nthe existing reexamination process offers only an illusory remedy for \ninventors because of the limits imposed on these third parties and \nsimilarly, the issues that can be considered in reexamination. Many \nthird parties believe that requesting a reexamination actually impairs \ntheir later efforts to challenge a patent, preferring to take their \ncases directly to the courts.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will permit and encourage the \nmeaningful participation by a third party in the reexamination process. \nIn turn, this will make the reexamination system an attractive and \ncost-effective alternative to expensive patent litigation. Likewise, it \nwill bring more fairness to the reexamination process by allowing a \nthird party requestor the right to appeal any decision by the Patent \nand Trademark Office to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. \nHowever, to prevent a third party from unreasonably delaying the \nissuance of a patent by relitigating the same issues following the \nreexamination process, this bill prohibits a third party from \nrelitigating patent validity concerns that were addressed, or from \nlitigating issues that could have been addressed in the reexamination \nproceeding.\n  The legislation also expands the grounds for initiating and \nconducting a reexamination hearing. Current reexamination proceedings \nare limited to consideration of patent invalidity in view of existing \npatents and printed publications. This bill would give the Patent and \nTrademark Office greater authority to consider compliance of a patent \nwith the existing disclosure and claim requirements.\n  There is widespread support in the patent community for this \nlegislation and for our efforts to make patent reexamination a more \nefficient process. Many patent groups have voiced their support for the \nchanges provided by this legislation. Those supporters of these reforms \ninclude: the American Intellectual Property Law Association [AIPLA], \nthe Intellectual Property Owners [IPO], the National Association of \nManufacturers [NAM], the Business Software Alliance, and the Software \nPublishers Association. There is also strong industry and bar support \nfor these proposed changes.\n  Mr. President, my proposed legislation will benefit all patent \nowners, offering them an inexpensive alternative to lengthy and costly \nlitigation. It will encourage fuller participation in the reexamination \nprocess by a third party. I urge my colleagues to support the Patent \nReexamination Reform Act of 1995. I ask unanimous consent that the full \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1070\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to eliminate the National Foundation on the Arts and \nthe Humanities, to establish a National Endowment for Arts, Humanities, \nand Museum Services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n            the national endowment restructuring act of 1995\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the bill that Senator Robert Bennett \nand I are introducing today redefines the Federal role in providing \nassistance to the arts.\n  We believe there is an excellent case to be made for continued \nFederal arts and humanities funding. But past experience has shown \nclearly that the role of the Federal Government in artistic endeavor \nmust be focused on more citizen involvement--and more common sense.\n  At the heart of this bill we have introduced is a belief that culture \ncounts. Mr. President, the students on Tianamen Square in 1989 who \ncreated a statue of freedom in the likeness of our Statue of Liberty \nhad no difficulty identifying the unifying themes of American culture.\n  We Americans, on the other hand, are immersed in--and sometimes \noverexposed to--its more contentious aspects. As a result, we sometimes \nsee it less clearly. We debate whether we have a common culture and if \nso, what it is and who it represents.\n  Federal support for the arts is a case in point. Most federally \nsupported arts projects promote mainstream excellence and the widest \npossible public enjoyment.\n  But by allocating tax dollars to a few outrageous and patently \noffensive projects that claimed to have cornered the market on American \nculture, the National Endowment for the Arts has managed to alienate \nlegions of Americans--voters and policymakers alike. Its excesses have \nled many to conclude that Federal support for the arts should be \nterminated. That, I believe, would be an unfortunate policy, one that \nwould dim the light of American culture to an even greater degree.\n  Committed as I am to a balanced Federal budget, I think that Federal \nfunding for the arts and humanities should be continued as a national \npolicy to preserve an American heritage--if we can return to our \noriginal purpose in creating these programs, and if we can ensure that \nno more Federal funds end up in the hands of those who are willfully \noffensive.\n  Our bill redirects Federal support for the arts, humanities and \nmuseum activities away from the self-indulgently obscene and the safely \nmediocre and toward the creation and support of community-based \nprograms. By this I mean locally and regionally based theater, dance, \nopera, and museums.\n  To accomplish this we propose combining the National Endowment for \nthe Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute \nof Museum Services into one agency. This new joint endowment would \ndevolve as much of its decisionmaking authority as possible to the \nStates--and to the people whose tax dollars support it.\n  The new endowment would continue to make direct grants to support \nnationally significant endeavors in the arts and humanities. However, \nthe bulk of public resources would go directly to the States to promote \ngreater access to the arts in our schools and communities, to continue \nworthy public projects in the humanities, and to strengthen local \nmuseums.\n  The consolidation we propose would streamline the existing endowment \napparatus. This new endowment would be headed by three deputy \ndirectors--one each for the arts, for the humanities and for museum \nservices. The current 52-member advisory board would be replaced by a \nnational council comprised of 18 members selected for their knowledge \nand achievements.\n  One of the primary objectives of this bill is to reduce the size of \nthe existing endowment bureaucracy in Washington, and to return \nresources and decisionmaking responsibilities to cities, regional \ngroups, and currently underserved areas.\n  Our bill provides that no more than 9 percent of appropriated funds \ngo to administrative functions, and it defines two basic grant \ncategories: 40 percent earmarked for grants of national significance \nand 60 percent allocated for grants to the States. A portion of the \nStates' grants would be dedicated to strengthening primary and \nsecondary education in the arts, humanities, and museum activities. We \nput special emphasis on communities which, for geographic or economic \nreasons, cannot otherwise sustain arts education programs.\n\n[[Page S 10658]]\n\n  Let me make this very clear: Our bill prohibits any money \nappropriated under this act from being used to fund projects which \nviolate standards of common decency. Nor may any of these resources be \nused, directly or indirectly, for lobbying.\n  In our bill, we focus on accountability, on ensuring that allocations \nare cost-effective--and that they are made in a way that emphasizes \nmerit and excellence.\n  The thrust of this bill is to conserve and showcase our State and \nNational treasures, those great cultural institutions that are our \nlegacy to our children--our world class museums, libraries, dance \ncompanies, orchestras, theater companies, and university presses. With \nthe financial support of private donors, and of the States and the \nFederal Government, these intellectual and cultural power centers will \nhave the potential to spin off a host of other creative activities that \nwill enrich the lives of all of our people.\n  Our country will benefit, culturally, spiritually and economically, \nfrom appropriately delineated Federal support for the arts. Americans \nrightly demand an end to obscenity and outrage, but not withdrawal of \nall Government support for the cream of our culture.\n  There are those who argue that all cultures, and all levels of \nculture, are equal, and that there is no real American culture at all, \nbut rather only an amalgam of diverse cultures.\n  But this deliberate balkanization of American culture ignores our \nsingular heritage which has drawn from many sources to create a body of \nAmerican arts and letters what is uniquely our own. E pluribus unum--\nout of many, one. It is a living tradition worth sustaining.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the bill we have presented today \ncontains a formula for arts funding, and the encouragement of our \nnative culture, that can regain the confidence and support of the \nAmerican people.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 1072. A bill to redefine ``extortion'' for purposes of the Hobbs \nAct; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                freedom from union violence act of 1995\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \namend the Hobbs Anti-Racketeering Act to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court \ndecision in United States versus Enmons, and to address a serious, long \nterm, festering problem under our Nation's labor laws. The United \nStates regulates labor relations on a national basis and our labor-\nmanagement policies are national policies. These policies and \nregulations are enforced by laws such as the National Labor Relations \nAct that Congress designed to preempt comparable State laws.\n  Although labor violence is a widespread problem in labor management \nrelations today, the Federal Government has not moved in a meaningful \nway to address this issue. I believe it is time for the Government to \nact and respond to what the Supreme Court did when it rendered its \ndecision in the case of United States versus Enmons in 1973. It is this \ndecision's unfortunate result which this bill is intended to rectify.\n  The Enmons decision involved the Hobbs Anti-Racketeering Act which is \nintended to prohibit extortion by labor unions. It provides that: \n``Whoever in any way * * * obstructs, delays, or affects commerce in \nthe movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or \nextortion or attempts or conspires to do so or commits or threatens \nphysical violence to any person or property * * *'' commits a criminal \nact. This language is very clear. It outlaws extortion by labor unions. \nIt outlaws violence by labor unions.\n  Although this language is very clear, the Supreme Court in Enmons \ncreated an exemption to the law which says that as long as a labor \nunion commits extortion and violence in furtherance of legitimate \ncollective bargaining objectives, no violation of the Act will be \nfound. Simply put, the Court held that if the ends are correct, the \nmeans to that end, no matter how horrible or reprehensible, will not \nresult in a violation of the Act.\n  The Enmons decision is wrong. This bill will make it clear that the \nHobbs Act is intended to punish the actual or threatened use of force \nor violence to obtain property irrespective of the legitimacy of the \nextortionist's claim to such property and irrespective of the existence \nof a labor-management dispute.\n  Let me discuss the Enmons case.\n  In that case, the defendants were indicted for firing high-powered \nrifles at property, causing extensive damage to the property, owned by \na utility company--all done in an effort to obtain higher wages and \nother benefits from the company for striking employees. The indictment \nwas, however, dismissed by the district court on the theory that the \nHobbs Act did not prohibit the use of violence in obtaining \n``legitimate'' union objectives. On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed.\n  The Supreme Court held that the Hobbs Act does not proscribe violence \ncommitted during a lawful strike for the purpose of achieving \nlegitimate collective bargaining objectives, like higher wages. By its \nfocus upon the motives and objectives of the property claimant, who \nuses violence or force to achieve his\n goals, the Enmons decision has had several unfortunate results. It has \ndeprived the Federal Government of the ability to punish significant \nacts of extortionate violence when they occur in a labor-management \ncontext. Although other Federal statutes prohibit the use of specific \ndevices or the use of channels of commerce in accomplishing the \nunderlying act of extortionate violence, only the Hobbs Act proscribes \na localized act of extortionate violence whose economic effect is to \ndisrupt the channels of commerce. Other Federal statutes are not \nadequate to address the full effect of the Enmons decision.\n\n  The Enmons decision affords parties to labor-management disputes an \nexemption from the statute's broad proscription against violence which \nis not available to any other group in society. This bill would make it \nclear that the Hobbs Act punishes the actual or threatened use of force \nand violence which is calculated to obtain property without regard to \nwhether the extortionist has a colorable claim to such property, and \nwithout regard to his status as a labor representative, businessman, or \nprivate citizen.\n  Mr. President, attempts to rectify the injustice of the Enmons \ndecision have been before the Senate on several occasions. Shortly \nafter the decision was handed down, a bill was introduced which was \nintended to repudiate the decision. Over the next several years, \nattempts were made to come up with language which was acceptable to \norganized labor and at the same time restored the original intent of \nthe Hobbs Act.\n  In 1978, S. 1437, a bill which was substantially the same as the bill \nI am introducing today, passed the Senate; however, the bill died in \nthe House. In the 100th Congress, I introduced S. 2036, a bill which is \nidentical to this legislation, yet no substantial action was taken on \nthe bill. It is time for the Senate to re-examine this issue and to \nrestate its opposition to violence in labor disputes. Encouraged by \ntheir special exemption from prosecution for acts of violence committed \nin pursuit of ``legitimate'' union objectives, union officials who are \ncorrupt routinely use terror tactics to achieve their goals.\n  From January 1975 to December 1993, the National Right to Work \nCommittee has documented more than 7,800 reported cases of union \nviolence. This chilling statistic gives clear testimony to the \nexistence of a pervasive national problem.\n  Mr. President, violence has no place in our society, regardless of \nthe setting. Our national labor policy has always been directed toward \nthe peaceful resolution of labor disputes. It is ironic that the Hobbs \nAct, which was enacted in large part to accomplish this worthy goal, \nhas been virtually emasculated. The time has come to change that. I \nthink that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle share a common \nconcern that violence in labor disputes, whatever the source, should be \neliminated. Government has been unwilling to deal with this program for \ntoo long. It is time for this Congress to act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1072\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     \n[[Page S 10659]]\n\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as the chairman of the Senate \nSubcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, I would like to call my \ncolleagues' attention today to three important milestones in our \nrelationship with the people of Korea which we will commemorate this \nweek: The 45th anniversary of the end of the Korean war, the dedication \nof the Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the state visit of the \nRepublic of Korea's first democratically elected President in 32 years, \nKim Young-sam.\n  Forty-five years ago this June, the North Korean military--with the \nbacking of Chinese troops and funding and materiel from the former \nSoviet Union--surged south across the 38th parallel in a headlong rush \ntowards the Korea Strait. More than 33,000 Americans lost their lives, \nand over 103,000 were wounded, pushing back the surge of communism and \nmaking at least the southern half of the peninsula safe for democracy. \nIt was a tremendous loss of lives and resources, but as is inscribed on \nthe new Korean Veterans War Memorial: ``Freedom Is Not Free.'' Today, \nsome 45 million Koreans live free and prosperous as a result of the \ndedication and sacrifice of our valient fighting men..\n  In my mind, there is no clearer or more illustrative example in the \nworld of the stark differences between communism and democracy than \nNorth and South Korea. South Korea is a powerful and vibrant player on \nthe world stage. South Korea has the 11th largest economy in the world, \nwith a growth last year of around 8 percent. Just after the war, yearly \nper capita income in Korea was around $82; today it is just over \n$10,000. Perhaps more importantly from our point of view, the ROK has \ngrown to be our eighth largest trading partner, and our fourth largest \nmarket for agricultural products. Unlike most countries in Asia, South \nKorea actually runs a trade deficit, not a surplus, with the United \nStates. On the political front, despite the ever-present threat from \nthe North and an occasional step backward, the ROK has steadily marched \ntoward true democracy. After decades of military rule, President Kim \nrepresents the first civilian elected government since 1962, and the \ncountry recently concluded the first round of local elections since \n1960. All these developments are due solely to the hard work, \nsacrifice, and dedication of the South Korean people.\n  In contrast Mr. President, North Korea, the ``Showcase of Communism'' \nis a morally and economically bankrupt dictatorship teetering on the \nbrink of implosion. Where South Korea is governed by elected leaders, \nthe North is ruled from beyond the grave by the lingering personality \ncult of a leader who died over 1 year ago. While filling the airwaves \nwith announcements of the triumph of the Communist juche ideal in \nleading their economy into self-sufficiency, the North is forced to \nimport vast quantities of rice from the South and Japan to stave off \nwidespread famine--requiring that the rice be shipped in unmarked bags \naboard ships that do not fly their foreign flags from the stern so as \nto hide the truth from its own people. Instead of taking a responsible \nplace in the brotherhood of nations, the North continually allies \nitself with the forces of subversion and terrorism. Rather than \ndiplomacy it prefers violence; who can forget the North's assassination \nattack on the Presidential Residence is Seoul in 1962, its murder of \nmuch of the South Korean Cabinet in a 1983 bombing attack in Burma, its \ndestruction of a civilian airliner with all aboard in 1987, or the \ncountless tunnels the North has dug under the DMZ to prepare the way \nfor an invasion of the South.\n  Mr. President, the difference is like day and night, and it is a \ndifference that thousands and thousands of South Korean and United \nStates soldiers fought and died to protect more than 40 years ago. This \nis why I believe that it is so important to commemorate the 45 years of \nalliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea. President \nKim's visit here this week gives us a chance to honor those who fought \nand died in Korea, to celebrate the historic partnership they forged, \nand to recognize the ROK's tremendous achievements and growth as a \ndemocracy since 1950. It also affords us the opportunity to honor \nPresident Kim himself. President Kim is dedicated to the ideals we \nfought to protect; in 1993, he received the W. Averell Harriman \nDemocracy Award and the 1994 Martin Luther King, Jr. Nonviolent Peace \nPrize in recognition of his work.\n  The ROK has made tremendous progress over the past 45 years and has \naccelerated its pace under the leadership of President Kim. But there \nare still some areas in which it needs to take concrete and important \nsteps before it can be considered to have arrived at true democracy: \nfor example increasing media freedom, and phasing out of some of the \ndraconian legal vestiges of military rule such as the Labor Dispute \nAdjustment Act, the Trade Union Act, and the National Security. \nNevertheless, I know without a doubt the Republic of Korea will arrive. \nIt will take hard work and dedication, but no more than that which the \nKorean people have already shown themselves capable.\n  Mr. President, the challenges we face in the future--the changes in \nthe world economy, the continued threat of an unstable North Korea--\nwill require the same cooperative spirit we have shared over the last \n45 years. And I am sure that this week, as we dedicate the Korean War \nVeterans Memorial, there will be born a renewed sense of friendship and \nalliance between us and the ROK that will stand us both in good stead \ninto the 21st century.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10660-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10660-S10661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           C. VIVIAN STRINGER\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, like many of my fellow Iowans, I \nwas saddened to learn that one of our most distinguished citizens will \nbe leaving the Hawkeye State.\n  Last week, C. Vivian Stringer, the head coach of the women's \nbasketball team at the University of Iowa announced that she will be \nleaving that post to take over as the women's basketball head coach at \nRutgers University. We will miss her and wish her well.\n  Vivian's accomplishments at Iowa have been remarkable, to say the \nvery least, and are worthy of our recognition.\n  Vivian came to the University of Iowa in 1983, taking over a \nstruggling women's basketball program. Prior to her arrival, the team's \nrecord was a disappointing 88-139. Further, no players had ever been \nnamed to the all Big Ten or academic all Big Ten teams in the history \nof the school.\n  To make things worse, attendance at the women's basketball games was \nextremely poor, as the average attendance at Iowa home games was a mere \n380 fans. The Hawkeyes had only made one national postseason tournament \nappearance in school history, and the program showed few signs of life.\n  This all changed when Vivian became the head coach, and in 12 years, \nshe would make a substantial impact not only on Iowa's athletic \nprogram, but on women's athletics nationally.\n\n[[Page S 10661]]\n\n  As Vivian leaves the university and the State of Iowa behind, she \nleaves a legacy that will live on in the hearts of many, as well as in \nthe record books. Vivian built the Hawkeyes into a national powerhouse, \nlifting the team's overall record to 357-223, and taking them to 10 \nnational postseason tournament appearances.\n  Eight Hawkeye players have been named to the all Big Ten team, and \nseven have been named academic all Big Ten during Vivian's time at \nIowa. By guiding her team to wins in 148 of 173 regular season home \ngames, attendance has risen to an average of 6,147 fans for each game.\n  Iowans will always remember her for leading her team to the NCAA \nFinal Four in 1992-93 for the first time in school history, just months \nafter losing her husband, Bill Stringer, to a heart attack. Her \ntriumphs that year were not just on the basketball court, but they were \ntriumphs of the human spirit.\n  Vivian has meant a lot to women's athletics in general. She has \nbrought her successes at Iowa to a national level, and garnered much \nrespect for women athletes and coaches. In the world of college \nathletics, women have too often taken a backseat to men's athletics, \nand clearly do not receive the level of support that men's athletics \ndoes. Vivian has done much to raise women's athletics to a higher \nlevel, and indeed, she has enjoyed much success.\n  As sorry as the State of Iowa is to see her go, the step she is \ntaking is a giant step forward for women's athletics, as well as an \nimportant step forward for Vivian and her family.\n  Vivian Stringer is truly a remarkable woman. She has triumphed in the \nface of tragedy, and has made a lasting impression on the people of \nIowa, and on women's athletics. She accomplished the goals she set at \nIowa, namely filling Carver-Hawkeye Arena, and taking the Hawkeyes to a \nFinal Four. She successfully put Iowa women's basketball on the \nnational map. She will be missed.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10660-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             INVENT AMERICA\n\n Mr. WARNER, Mr. President, America's hope and America's future \nlies with America's children--the leaders of tomorrow. Our young people \nembody the spirit of the Nation's can-do philosophy. That is why I am \npleased today to honor ``Invent America!'', an outstanding nonprofit \neducation program and invention competition which encourages young \nAmericans to be creative and innovative.\n  ``Invent America!'' has touched the lives of millions of students \nfrom kindergarten through eighth grade, providing schools with the \ntools they need to teach problem-solving skills and strong values, all \nthrough the art of invention. Now funded solely by the private sector, \nthe program provides an exciting opportunity for young Americans to \nbecome young entrepreneurs. It encourages those children to expand the \nhorizons of their knowledge and to dare to achieve.\n  Now celebrating its 10th year of ``bringing bright ideas out of young \nminds,'' the program's successes are numerous. The National ``Think \nLink,'' a brainchild of ``Invent America!'', offered 50,000 teachers \nacross our country simultaneous training via satellite (at no cost) on \nhow best to use the program in the classroom. A 12-year old winner in \nthe program rode an ``Invent America!'' float in the Rose Bowl Parade \nin recognition of her award-winning invention to recycle cardboard. A \nyoung man who created a biodegradable golf tee that also fertilizes \nstarted a brand new business. In fact, several of the new ideas \ndiscovered through the program are now creating new jobs and new \nindustries in America.\n  This year, one of the national winners, Kristopher Howard, from \nTennessee, has been invited to testify before the subcommittee on \nDisability Policy. He invented the ``Handi-Cuff,'' a special device \nwhich aids the disabled.\n  Designed and administered by the nonprofit United States Patent Model \nFoundation, headquartered in Alexandria, VA, ``Invent America!'' is \nfunded in part by the Chrysler Corp., Magna International, Motorola \nCorp., Black & Decker and Xerox Corp. Those corporate sponsors are \nhosting competition finalists at a special celebration here in the \nNation's Capital. The highlight of that celebration takes place \ntonight: the ``Invention-Reinvention'' event at the Smithsonian's Arts \nand Industries Museum, hosted by the Chrysler Corp. The ten best \nstudent inventors in America will be honored, and their inventions \nexhibited.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to pay tribute to perhaps our Nation's \nmost treasured vision: the future of America as seen through a child's \neyes.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10661-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO JIM FINNEGAN, EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nfriend and New Hampshire institution--Jim Finnegan. Jim is retiring \nthis week as the editorial editor of the Union Leader newspaper in \nManchester, NH.\n  Before moving to New Hampshire to begin writing editorials for the \nUnion Leader 38 years ago, Jim was involved in talk radio in \nPennsylvania where his populist, conservative principles, and \ncommitment to his causes cost him his job. But he found a home at the \nUnion Leader. Late publisher William Loeb and Jim were a perfect \nmatch--both unwavering, bedrock conservatives who used their pens to \npromote the ideals and traditions that reflect New Hampshire values. \nBill Loeb's wife, Nackey, took over the helm after Bill passed away \nand, of course, she and Jim have the same relationship of mutual \nadmiration and respect.\n  Jim was born 65 years ago in Philadelphia. He attended the Milton \nHershey School for boys where the Dickensian regimen instilled strict \ndiscipline and high moral standards in the young Jim. That discipline \nand commitment to excellence is behind the nearly 40,000 editorials Jim \nhas written over the years.\n  Jim's editorials have elicited strong responses from Union Leader \nreaders during his nearly four decade tenure at the paper. The Union \nLeader has the most extensive ``Letters to the Editor'' section in the \nState, largely due to citizens reacting to Jim's outspoken opinions.\n  Jim's editorials have received national awards and helped the paper \nremain in the American political spotlight. He is a leader in the \nnational conservative movement, dedicated to preserving the right-to-\nlife, and a fan of opera and boxing. His love of boxing has helped Jim \n``take the gloves off'' when writing his opinions on the editorial \npages of New Hampshire's largest newspaper.\n  Jim's editorials have run the gamut from heaping praise to fearless \ncriticism. However, he has never used party or personality as a \ncriteria for criticism. His editorials have always been non-partisan, \nnon-personal, and issue-oriented. He has used his pen to promote the \nissues in which he profoundly believes--faith, justice, good \ngovernment, individual liberty, and freedom.\n  Victims and beneficiaries of his words agree on one thing: Jim \nFinnegan is a man of integrity, wisdom, wit, and principle.\n  On Tuesday August 1, 1995, Jim Finnegan will celebrate his 65th \nbirthday and his final day as Editorial Editor of the Union Leader \nnewspaper. I would like to join his family, friends, and colleagues in \nwishing him the happiness he so richly deserves. He will be missed by \nall of us who read the unique and thought-provoking editorial pages of \nthe Union Leader.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10661-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10661-S10662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                               THE V-CHIP\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today, I would like to share with my \ncolleagues a Chicago Tribune editorial which makes a compelling \nargument against the Senate's V-chip proposal. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to review it.\n  I ask that the full text of the article be printed at this point in \nthe Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, July 14, 1995]\n\n                  Power to the Parents on TV Violence\n\n       The good news on the TV violence front is that a national \n     consensus seems to have developed that something must be done \n     to control the messages and images reaching American \n     children.\n       The bad news is that some of the methods Congress is \n     considering to achieve that control would do violence to the \n     constitutional right to free expression--and that is \n     intolerable.\n       There is, however, a way that promises effective control \n     and respects the Constitution. But it will require restraint \n     by Congress, cooperation by the TV industry and--\n\n[[Page S 10662]]\n     indispensably--determination by parents to actively monitor their \n     children's viewing.\n       The Senate this week held hearings on a proposal by Sen. \n     Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) to regulate the hours at which \n     programs deemed unacceptable for children could be broadcast.\n       This plan, though well-intentioned, is objectionable on two \n     accounts. Not only does it involve the government in \n     evaluating the acceptability of ideas--the very thing the 1st \n     Amendment was created to prevent--but it also lets the \n     government decide when those ideas may be expressed. Good \n     intentions cannot dispel the odor of censorship emitted by \n     this proposal.\n       Another idea, already incorporated in the Senate's \n     comprehensive telecommunications legislation, is for the so-\n     called V-chip. This is an electronic device that would be \n     built into TV sets and would react to a broadcast signal or \n     tag, blocking reception of programs identified as too violent \n     or otherwise objectionable.\n       Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), sponsor of the V-chip proposal, \n     would require manufacturers to begin installing such chips in \n     new TV sets and would order the broadcasting industry to \n     ``voluntarily'' develop a system for rating their programs \n     for excessive violence and other objectionable content. If \n     the industry didn't comply within a year, then a government \n     panel would be empowered to create the ratings, which \n     broadcasters would be required to use in tagging their \n     programs to work with the interactive chip.\n       The 1st Amendment hazard in Conrad's measure ought to be \n     obvious. There can be no truly voluntary rating system under \n     the sort of duress that this legislation implies. What's \n     more, for the government to require broadcasters to label \n     their programs as too violent or too salacious is intolerable \n     interference with the right to free expression.\n       New television sets ought to come with blocking devices; \n     Congress ought to require them if manufacturers do not \n     voluntarily include them.\n       But decisions as to what to block ought to remain in the \n     hands of parents, finding their guidance wherever they \n     choose. There is no shortage of groups--religious, artistic, \n     others--offering views on what is worthy children's TV fare. \n     Let them provide the information and give power to the \n     parents.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10661-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         HONORING FRANK GAYLORD\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Frank \nGaylord, the sculptor of the Korean War Veterans Memorial which will be \nformally dedicated and unveiled this Thursday, July 27. It will be \nlocated adjacent to the Lincoln Memorial and commemorate 5.7 million \nAmericans who often feel forgotten. These men and women fought \nvaliantly to defend Korea from Communist forces during the Korean War \nwhich lasted from 1950-1953.\n  This memorial will surely be Frank Gaylord's masterpiece and gain \nenormous acclaim. The acclaim, however, is not what Gaylord, a \nClarksburg, WV native, seeks. He sculpted this memorial because he is \ntruly a patriot. A World War II veteran himself, he knows about the \njoy, agony, and countless other emotions soldiers feel every day. I, \nlike many of my colleagues, can only imagine what it would be like to \nbe a soldier in a heated war. Gaylord knows these emotions, and coupled \nwith his artistic talent, has used them to create a moving memorial \nwhich will do much to make Korean War veterans more remembered and less \nforgotten.\n  The memorial has three parts. The first part consists of 19 soldiers \nwhich Gaylord sculpted, who represent the Army, Navy, Air Force, and \nMarines. Since the Korean war was the first time U.S. Armed Forces \ncombat units were fully integrated, the statues are ethnically diverse \nand remind us of our own Nation's strengths. The second part of the \nmemorial is an enormous granite mural which has the faces of over 2,400 \nsupport personnel etched into it. The third part is a pool of \nremembrance which pays homage to all of the soldiers who were killed, \ncaptured, or wounded. Also, along the side of the entrance to the \nmemorial is a slab of smoothed granite which recognizes each of the 22 \nnations which fought Communist aggression in Korea more than 40 years \nago.\n  In 1950, the United States sent troops to Korea to defend South \nKorea. Three years later, on July 27, 1953, they emerged victorious. \nThe Korean war veterans who fought are rarely mentioned along side \nthose from other wars, such as World War II and Viet Nam. Many who did \nnot serve in Korea or have family who served there either do not know \nmuch about the war or do not remember it. However, thanks to the \ndedicated work, time, and talents of Frank Gaylord and other U.S. \nveterans, this memorial will generate a lasting image of the bravery \nand honor of Korean war veterans. No longer shall the courageous men \nand women of the Korean war feel forgotten. Their sacrifices are now \nofficially recognized as this week we dedicate this incredibly \nimpressive Korean War Veterans Memorial.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10662-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10662-S10663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                DUAL EDUCATION TEACHES STUDENTS TO WORK\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I was proud to be the chief Senate \nsponsor of the School-to-Work Opportunities Act, signed into law by \nPresident Clinton in April 1994. The act provides venture capital for \nthe coordination, integration, merger, streamlining, and performance-\nbased accountability of education and vocational programs. The \nDepartment of Labor estimates that 116,351 students, 41,772 employers, \nand 2,730 schools are involved in state and local school-to-work \nventures.\n  Recently, I came across an insightful article by Hedrick Smith on why \nschool to work is so important to the education of our young people and \nthe economic competitiveness of our Nation. I ask that the article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n           [From the St. Louis Post Dispatch, July 14, 1995]\n\n                Dual Education Teaches Students To Work\n\n                           (By Hedrick Smith)\n\n       With corporate profits and stock prices soaring, Wall \n     Street has a lot to cheer about. The World Economic Forum of \n     Switzerland now rates the United States as the world's most \n     competitive economy.\n       But the Forum mixed praise with the warning that America \n     would lose its No. 1 status unless it develops better \n     education for its high school students.\n       Thoughtful business leaders echo the concern about the high \n     cost of America's educational shortfall. Lou Gerstner, chief \n     executive of IBM, says corporate America spends $30 billion a \n     year on remedial education for new workers.\n       Gerstner says American businesses lose another $30 billion \n     each year, unable to upgrade their operations and products \n     ``because their employees can't learn the necessary skills.''\n       ``We can't squander $60 billion and remain competitive,'' \n     Gerstner declares.\n       America is justifiably proud of its college-level education \n     and its college-prep track. But high economic performance \n     also requires a world-class education for our average teen-\n     agers.\n       Seventy percent of the jobs in the American economy do not \n     require a bachelor's degree, and 70 percent of America's \n     young people do not complete four years of college.\n       They are the backbone of our future work force.\n       Industry and the service sector needs hundreds of thousands \n     of paralegals, radiologists, engineering technicians, graphic \n     illustrators, medical technicians and research workers, plus \n     a more flexible, computer-literate generation for banking, \n     insurance and other service industries.\n       But America lacks a nationwide educational strategy to meet \n     the mushrooming needs of modern industry. The most innovative \n     businesses, educators and communities have discovered that \n     one solution lies in rethinking education and forging a close \n     partnership between business and high schools.\n       Some innovators have found a model in Germany. Two-thirds \n     of Germany's teen-agers take ``dual education,'' which \n     combines classroom learning with half-time training on the \n     job.\n       This is not mere vocational training in a school shop class \n     with outmoded technology. German teenagers are trained right \n     in the modern workplace--the factory, bank, hospital, \n     newspaper, insurance company and electronics giant. Business \n     involvement drives classroom educational standards higher.\n       In 400 career fields, German businesses and public schools \n     deliver a world-class education: physics classes that help \n     future auto workers understand electronics and computer-run \n     automation; economics and finance classes that match the \n     needs of modern banking; chemistry classes that prepare young \n     printers to design and print complex illustrations on many \n     surfaces.\n       Several American states and cities have adapted the German \n     model.\n       In 1991, Wisconsin began a dual-education, apprenticeship-\n     style program for high school students in its high-tech \n     printing industry. So successful was the program that it \n     moved into banking, insurance, health care, electronics, \n     engineering, tourism, auto technology and manufacturing. From \n     two communities in 1991, Wisconsin's youth apprenticeship \n     program has spread to 200 businesses training 450 students \n     from 85 high schools across the state.\n       Pennsylvania, Maine, Arkansas, Maryland and upstate New \n     York have begun similar programs. In Boston, hospitals and \n     the financial industry are working with inner-city high \n     schools. In Tulsa, Okla., the lead has been taken by the \n     Chamber of Commerce and the machine-tool industry.\n\n[[Page S 10663]]\n\n       These programs are generating great enthusiasm among \n     businesses, parents, teachers and students. The results are \n     dramatic: Student motivation and performance have soared.\n       So a business-education partnership is taking root, but it \n     is slow going. The gulf between business and education is \n     still vast. They speak different languages and go their \n     separate ways.\n       Rethinking America's educational strategy requires \n     overcoming suspicions, accepting joint responsibility and \n     sitting down together to find the common ground.\n       Business and education have to rewrite school courses, \n     train industry mentors, retrain teachers and devise \n     industrial and educational standards that meet the test of \n     global competition.\n       German industry spends about $15 billion a year on dual \n     education. To match that commitment, American industry would \n     have to spend $60 billion a year.\n       Impossible, you say?\n       But remember, Gerstner says that American industry is \n     already spending or losing $60 billion because of our \n     educational shortfall. So why not spend the money upfront on \n     a world-class, dual-education system?\n       In 1993, Congress passed the School-to-Work Act, \n     authorizing $250 million a year in seed money for seven years \n     to develop this new strategy for high school education.\n       States had to compete for federal ``venture capital'' to \n     help them gear up for this new approach.\n       In 1994, grants went to eight leading-edge states and 36 \n     local areas. More are lined up this year--that is, unless \n     Congress kills this wise investment in America's future.\n       That would shortchange both our economy and the next \n     generation.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10662-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HONORING BRUCE A. PERCELAY\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, Bruce Percelay celebrated his 40th \nbirthday yesterday, and I ask my colleagues to join me in extending him \nour deepest congratulations and our sincere best wishes for the future.\n  Mr. President, Bruce Percelay is a special person. He is a man who \nhas made a difference to Massachusetts. He is one of those rare \nindividuals who has enjoyed personal success, but takes time to give \nsomething back. He is one of the most respected and appreciated civic \nleaders of greater Boston, and his charitable works are of enormous \nconsequence to our community.\n  Some in my State know Bruce Percelay because of his dedication and \nhard work to his profession. He is a recognized expert in real estate \ninvestment, renovation, and marketing, and, in fact, has written a book \nbased on his real estate experience which made the list of Boston's top \nselling business books. He has appeared on television and has been \nquoted in magazines and newspapers around the country for his wit and \nwisdom.\n  But, others know Bruce Percelay for something perhaps more important. \nThey know him for the work he has done to give young people a chance. \nThey know him for what he has done to make a difference in the lives of \npeople, and in the life of our community.\n  As President of the Boston chapter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation, \nBruce has, through his creativity and hard work, made sure that the \nFoundation is strong enough to survive for years to come. He has \nincreased the Foundation's financial reserves by 400 percent, and found \nit a permanent home in a new, prime, downtown office location.\n  He has overseen the development of a permanent charter and a 5-year \nstrategic plan, expanded the board of directors, improved the quality \nof the foundation's special events and was successful in recruiting \nanother well-known Massachusetts native to serve as chairperson, Carly \nSimon.\n  Mr. President, Bruce Percelay is a very special human being who cares \ndeeply for his community and for people who need a helping hand. Let me \ntell Bruce's greatest achievement as president of Make-A-Wish, and a \ntouching story that has affected all of us in Massachusetts. Bruce was \nsingle-handedly responsible for granting the largest of all wishes ever \ngranted by Make-A-Wish worldwide.\n  He arranged, Mr. President, for a family with two terminally ill \nchildren and no father to own there own home without a mortgage. The \nchildren have since died, and the mother is raising her two remaining \nchildren in the home.\n  Bruce worked and worked and worked to grant the wish of the oldest \nchild for his mother to have a place to live after he died; and he made \nit happen.\n  Because of Bruce Percelay, Mr. President, the Boston chapter of Make-\nA-Wish is one of the fastest growing of the 80 chapters in the United \nStates. And I would ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the \nextraordinary contribution Bruce has made to Make-A-Wish, but that's \nnot all he has done.\n  A program near and dear to my heart, as you well know, Mr. President, \nhas also benefitted from the community spirit of Bruce Percelay. \nBecause of his efforts YouthBuild Boston is an extraordinarily \nsuccessful inner-city youth development program that has helped \nhundreds of at-risk kids become self-sufficient through education and \npersonal character development.\n  Bruce first became involved with YouthBuild in February, 1993, just \nabout 2\\1/2\\ years ago. Since then Bruce has been the driving force \nbehind a critical fund-raising component that may ultimately provide 50 \npercent of YouthBuild's financial support reducing its dependence on \nFederal funding-though successful and proven programs like YouthBuild \nshould never lose the support of this Congress.\n  What Bruce did was not easy, and, in fact, it was it was an \ninnovative and persuasive approach that assured community participation \nand a partnership for success.\n  Through his persistence and his perseverance he brought YouthBuild \ntogether with Boston's banking community and established a board of \nadvisors who agreed to become sponsors of the organization, and \ntogether they have raised $500,000 to buy and renovate a site that will \nbe YouthBuild's permanent home.\n  Because of Bruce's hands-on participation and commitment, a recent \nevent for YouthBuild at the Kennedy Library in Boston had an \nunprecedented turnout of over 500 business people to launch this major \nfund-raising effort.\n  Mr. President, Bruce Percelay knows what citizenship means. He values \nservice and has a commitment to creating the kind of partnerships \nnecessary to make community programs succeed and grow. He is a worker, \na giver, a doer, and, perhaps, a little bit of a dreamer who has helped \nto rekindle the flame of hope and restore the spirit of community in \neach of us in Massachusetts.\n  His good-will and good deeds should be an example for all of us, in \nevery state, in every community who believe in giving something back \nand trying to make a difference in the lives of those who need a hand.\n  Mr. President, on this, his 40th birthday, I think it is fitting for \nthe United States Senate to recognize, congratulate, and honor Bruce \nPercelay, and to wish him continued personal success, good health, and \nmany, many more years in which to enjoy them.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/25/senate-section/article/S10663-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
