Mr. President, the business of the Senate has been \nconsuming and demanding this year. The debate over the balanced budget \namendment and the debate over the achievement of a budget which will \nprotect the fiscal integrity of this country and bring us into balance \nin the next 7 years has been an important one and it is a necessary \none. It has consumed much of our energy and the opportunity of this \nSenate.\n  I think it is important for us to understand while this is a task \nwhich must compel and will compel our attention, it must not do so to \nthe exclusion of another important agenda that is essential to the \nprogress that the American people sent us here to make. The American \npeople not only sent us here to protect the fiscal health and integrity \nof the economics of the United States of America, but they expect us \n\n[[Page S876]]\nto protect the physical health and the integrity of the people of \nAmerica, in particular of the people who have been the victims of a \nwelfare system the consequences of which have been tragic, to say the \nleast.\n  The welfare reform debate is not a debate about a revolution for a \nchange. It is literally a debate about a revolution for survival. If we \ndo not reform the welfare system there are going to be continuing \nnumbers of individuals who simply will not survive in America because \nour welfare system not only dehumanizes and devalues them, but it \nliterally threatens their continuing existence.\n  The welfare reform debate is not just about change, it is about \nrestoring hope, restoring dignity to the lives of individuals where \nhope and dignity have been destroyed. The missing ingredient in the \ncurrent welfare system is the ingredient of hope, and the recipe for \nrecovery must reinstitute hope. There is a structural problem with the \ncurrent exclusively governmental system which precludes hope, which \nmust exist if people are to get back on their feet.\n  This is a matter of human survival and national sustenance and \nsurvivability. If our society is to be sustained, to survive to be \nsuccessful in the next century, we must end the current welfare \ntragedy. It is tragic, indeed, that the Congress, which has acted to \nhelp end this tragedy, has been met with a Presidential tragedy: That \nis, the President has vetoed the effort of the Congress to stop this \nhuman cost of America's greatest tragedy, our welfare system.\n  The President had the opportunity to reform the system but he vetoed \nit. Congress acted to stop rewarding illegitimacy, and the President \nvetoed it. Congress acted to stop penalizing marriage, undermining \nfamilies, and the President vetoed it. Congress acted to stop the \nculture of entitlement, where individuals are conditioned to expect \nfrom Government rather than to work within themselves to solve \nproblems, and the President vetoed it.\n  The tragedy of our welfare system is borne out in the lives of the \nchildren of America, in the horror stories of opportunities that have \nbeen dashed, futures that have been destroyed. I will not burden you \nwith a litany that is all too familiar, but I think of one of the \nchildren, little Ariel Hill, who was less than a year old when she \ndied, weighing only 7 pounds at her death. Her mother was an addict \nsustained by a system which makes no judgment about behavior, but just \ncontinues to reinforce behavior regardless of its counterproductivity. \nHer mother, irritated with Ariel's crying one afternoon, scalded her in \na sink of hot water. When the investigators came to the apartment after \nAriel's death, they found a list of the children in the household and \nthe amount of welfare that each child brought to the family.\n  That is the tragedy of the welfare system where children, the most \nvaluable resource of a society, develop a value only in the devaluing \nchecks of an entitlement system. It is time we reform that system. We \nhad an opportunity to do so and the President vetoed it. We cannot \nleave this task undone because the President vetoed welfare reform \nmeasures. We must proceed to change the system.\n\n  Our system has been rewarding the wrong values. We have rewarded \ndecadence--the out-of-wedlock birth rate has exploded from 5.3 percent \nin 1960 to 33 percent in 1995. That is up to 80 percent in some of the \ncities of this country. We need to replace that system, which values \ndecadence and rewards it with checks, with a system that values and \nrewards decency.\n  Our system has rewarded dependence. More than 3 million of the 5 \nmillion welfare recipients will be on the rolls for more than 8 years. \nThe average length of time a person is on the welfare system is 13 \nyears. It is a system that rewards dependence rather than discipline. \nIt is time for our system to be changed. The opportunity that we had, \nand that we capitalized on to reform the system, would have substituted \ndiscipline for dependence. It is time for our system to reward \ndiscipline.\n  We have established, as the way of operating in Government, a system \nof debt. We need to replace that system of debt with a system of \ndignity, of integrity, of paying for the things we consume rather than \ndisplacing the costs of what we consume to the next generation. But the \ndevaluing system of welfare dependence and decadence has been a system \nwhich has driven the debt.\n  We simply have to make a commitment within ourselves that we are not \ngoing to let this issue die. We are not going to walk away from the \nmandate of the American people to wage a war on poverty. We cannot \nleave in place a system that subsidizes decadence, that subsidizes \ndependence, that encourages debt--no. Our war on poverty will have to \nhave a fundamental element of hope and will have to replace decadence \nwith decency, replace dependence with integrity, independence and work, \nand replace debt with discipline.\n  The welfare reform measure which Congress passed provided us with an \nopportunity to change our current system--an opportunity that was \nextinguished at the hand of a President who vetoed welfare reform. We \nmust reform a system which is not only costing children in many cases \ntheir lives and their futures, but is undermining a set of values upon \nwhich this country must march forward.\n  We must not turn our backs on this tragedy. We can ill afford to \nthink that because there is a controversy on the budget that we can \nexclusively focus on it. We must address it. We must continue to be \ninvolved. But this war, this opportunity for change, cannot be confined \nto a single front. The budget is important, but we have an operation on \nthe right, an operation on the left, and we have a revolution to wage \nin terms of rescuing what we believe is the greatest of all the \ncultures that have ever graced this planet, the free culture in the \nUnited States of America. We cannot turn our backs on the tragedy of \nwelfare.\n  So, today I rise, grateful for this opportunity to say we must look \nagain to the responsibility that we have, to the call which we have \nreceived, to the demand which the American people are making upon us, \nto the expectation of this culture and to the duty we owe young people. \nIt is a duty to protect, yes, their fiscal integrity and their \nfinancial futures, but it is also a duty to protect the very lives and \nthe values and the potentials which they have. When we subsidize \ndecadence as opposed to decency, when we subsidize debt as opposed to \ndignity, and when we subsidize dependence as opposed to integrity and \nindustry, I believe we have to change that system and change it \ndramatically.\n  So, I thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity to speak, to \nremind the U.S. Senate that its obligation is substantial, its \nopportunity is significant, and the consequences of inaction could be \nas tragic as the system which is the status quo, because, unless we act \nto reform and to change it, we will have to live with it. And living \nwith it has had deadly consequences.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S875-4", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S876-S877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            OF POLLS, POLITICIANS, PROMISES, AND PRINCIPLES\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues made time last week to \nstudy a poll printed in the Washington Post. It took a close look at \nthe American people and their relationship with the political process, \nand it was, at the same time, both enlightening and frightening.\n  Mr. President, 40 percent of those responding to the poll did not \nknow the name of the current Vice President; 40 percent of Americans \nwere not aware that Republicans control both Chambers of Congress; 56 \npercent of the people surveyed could not name even one of their \nRepresentatives in the Senate; and 74 percent were not aware that we \nserve 6-year terms.\n  Fully 67 percent of the people who answered the survey did not know \nthat the U.S. Senate had passed a plan to balance the Federal budget.\n  The newspaper makes the argument that the problem lies in education--\nthat the more knowledge an individual has about the political process, \nthe more likely they are to care about what we are doing here in \nWashington. But I think an equally compelling case can be made that \nafter decades of broken political promises, the voters have been \nconditioned to tune us out. They do not care about us because they \nbelieve that, deep down, we really do not care about them, either. \n\n[[Page S877]]\n\n  We should not be concerned that the people do not know our names or \nthe length of our terms or who controls which Chamber. But we ought to \nbe deeply troubled that so many people seem to have lost faith in us. \nAnd we should be especially concerned that the poll reflects these \nthings at a time when Congress has made promises, kept them, and has \ndemonstrated a sincere commitment to turning this Government around.\n  Mr. President, when the 104th Congress was gaveled into session a \nyear ago, there were high expectations. There had been a dramatic \ntransfer of power. People called it a sea change, a revolution.\n  There was a radical, new message that had begun to break through the \nnoise of the usual political rhetoric. We talked about new solutions. \nWe talked about Government as a service provider, not our national \nnanny, or caretaker. We talked about making Washington more accountable \nto the taxpayers, and a more efficient consumer of taxpayer dollars. We \ntalked about shifting the focus of the Federal Government from advocacy \non behalf of tax recipients to advocacy on behalf of the Nation's \ntaxpayers.\n  We talked every day about our children and grandchildren, and what \nkind of future we would be leaving them if we turned our backs and did \nnothing.\n  One year later, our message has not changed, and we have passed a \ngreat deal of legislation in the last year to put real muscle behind \nour promises. But we did not count on running headlong into an \nobstructionist President, gunning for reelection, who was willing to \ndeny the people a better tomorrow in order to preserve the status quo.\n  Mr. President, up until last year, I believed wholeheartedly in a \nmathematical absolute I first learned in high school geometry--that the \nshortest distance between two points is a straight line. The idea has \nbeen around for so long--since the time of the ancient Greeks, in \nfact--that I never considered questioning it. But what I learned during \nthe first session of the 104th Congress has forced me to rethink those \nearly geometry lessons.\n  You see, there is no line more straight than the 16-block stretch of \nPennsylvania Avenue that runs between the U.S. Capitol and the front \ndoor of the White House. So when the American people elected a new \nCongress on our pledge to balance the budget, cut taxes, repair the \nwelfare system, and save Medicare, it stood to reason that the road to \nenacting those fundamental reforms, in the shortest amount of time, \nwould be a straight line as well: Congress would pass the laws, we \nwould send them up Pennsylvania Avenue to the President, and he would \nsign them.\n  But this President has managed to distort the laws of mathematics so \nbadly that Pennsylvania Avenue has become not a straight line, but a \ntangled trail culminating in a dead end. Today, those 16 blocks are \nlittered with legislative casualties that never had a chance against \nthe veto pen of a President who is dead set against even the most basic \nreforms.\n  Congress sent the President a balanced budget that acknowledges it is \nmorally wrong to pass the debts of one generation onto the next. He \nvetoed it.\n  We sent the President a tax relief package that offers a $500-per-\nchild tax credit--and a lot of hope--to every middle-class, American \nfamily. He vetoed it.\n  We sent the President a bill that delivers on his promise to ``end \nwelfare as we know it.'' He said he liked it. Then he vetoed it anyway.\n  We sent the President a plan that moves Medicare into the 1990's, \nrescues it from bankruptcy, and reforms the system by offering seniors \nsomething they have never had access to through their Government-\nprovided health care plan and that was real choice. Once again, he \nkilled it with a veto. Given yesterday's troubling news that the \nMedicare trust fund lost money in 1995 for the first time in 23 years, \na full year earlier than expected, and may not survive until 2002, the \nPresident's veto appears even more shortsighted and misguided.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMS. When I am through, I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. FORD. I am sure it was part A, not part B. The Senator went over \nit with a broad brush.\n  Mr. GRAMS. It is part A. Congress delivered tax relief, Medicare and \nwelfare reform, and a balanced budget to the White House just as we \npromised the American people we would, and they were all returned to us \n``V-O-A''--``vetoed on arrival.'' So much for high school geometry.\n  What I have come to realize, Mr. President, is that sometimes, the \nshortest distance between two points is not a straight line at all, but \nthe route with the least congestion. What I want to assure my fellow \nAmericans is that from now on, Congress will follow whatever line takes \nus where we need to go, and if that means bypassing the gridlock on \nPennsylvania Avenue at the White House, so be it. We will not be \ndeterred from pursuing the principles of individual freedom and \nrestraint in Government that have already brought us this far. We moved \nan important step forward recently with the passage of the Balanced \nBudget Downpayment Act. The President may have vetoed our balanced \nbudget plan, but our downpayment on it moves us $30 billion closer to a \nbalanced budget, and keeps our children from going another $30 billion \nin debt, by eliminating a host of wasteful Government programs. It was \nnot what the President wanted. In fact, his latest budget does not make \nany serious reductions in Government spending until the year 2000. But \nCongress controls the Nation's purse strings and in this political \nclimate, Congress must start taking these small steps in order to reach \nour larger goals. One of the papers in my home State interviewed a \nnumber of Minnesotans last week and asked what they thought about \nCongress and the President and our accomplishments of the past year. I \nthought the comments made by the mayor of Woodbury were the most \ninsightful. He said,\n\n       We watch with interest but quite a bit of disappointment. \n     They are more concerned out there with their political one-\n     upmanship, political brinkmanship, political hassle of each \n     other. There is a big gap in quality leadership.\n\n  Those are the very same thoughts being reflected in the kind of polls \nwe saw in the Washington Post. Mr. President, if we are going to begin \nrestoring the people's faith in their Government, we are going to have \nto earn it through quality leadership, and we are going to have to do a \nbetter job of communicating our successes. Every American needs to know \nthat this Senate passed a balanced budget. More importantly, every \nAmerican needs to know that we are not giving up until President \nClinton has signed a balanced budget into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S876-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S877-S878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate will once again \nattempt to wrestle with one of its key responsibilities to American \nagriculture, and that is to pass legislation that will craft new farm \npolicy for our country and send the necessary message as to what we \nexpect American agriculture to do in relation to farm programs directed \nby the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  I found it interesting yesterday that President Clinton has submitted \nhis 1997 budget when we do not even have a 1996 budget, and we find \nourselves here on the floor of the Senate today debating agriculture \nbecause the President vetoed agriculture. So while the President is now \noff campaigning across the country waving a 1997 budget, the Government \ndoes not have a 1996 budget, and we do not have a farm policy.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture has just entered the floor. By the 15th \nof this month, he is going to arrive at a crisis point in having to \ndeal with the implementation of 1949 agricultural policy.\n  Last Friday on the floor of this Senate, the Democrat leader and his \nparty blocked a farm bill. We offered a bipartisan farm bill, Democrats \nand Republicans alike. Senator Leahy of Vermont, who is just about as \nliberal as I am conservative, came together in a bipartisan bill. Once \nagain we were denied the opportunity to vote on that because we were \ntold it would be blocked. \n\n[[Page S878]]\n\n  I hope today that we can deal with a farm bill and send the \nappropriate message to American agriculture. But yesterday, I think \nRobert Shapiro, the president of the Progressive Policy Institute, \nwhich is a centrist Democrat leadership council arm, said it very \nclearly: The President's budget is not about dollars; it is about \npolitics. He said we are now in a political season, and the President \ndid this for politics. The politics that is being played on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate right now may be good for one party or another, but \nit is not good for American agriculture.\n  So, Mr. President, pick up the phone and call your people here in the \nSenate and say let us get an agriculture bill so that the Secretary of \nAgriculture does not have to deal with the kind of draconian things \nthat he may be forced to do to send a shock wave through American \nagriculture by implementation of the 1949 farm policy. That is not good \ngovernment. That is not the kind of government we need to deal with.\n  So I hope we can arrive at a solution this afternoon. But, Mr. \nPresident, in closing, because I know our time is up here at about \n12:30, I am told that there are now 240-plus amendments filed at the \ndesk on the Lugar-Leahy-Craig alternative bipartisan farm bill. That \nsends a very simple message to me. There is not going to be a farm bill \ntoday. It is impossible to deal with it after 6\\1/2\\ months of \nintensive extensive hearings before the Senate Agriculture Committee \nwhen American agriculture, almost per organization, said do not simply \nreinstate farm policy, but reform it and clean it up. And that is what \nwe have done in trying to build this.\n  I am not sure where we go from here. I hope we can get the 60 votes \nthis afternoon so that we can move forward and get the 1996 work done \nbefore our President is off campaigning on 1997 budgets that do not \nbalance while he is President, assuming he might get elected another \nterm. I find it very interesting that his own people are now saying it \nis not policy; it is all politics. Well, we knew that. He knows that. \nBut it is a very dangerous kind of politics, a very dangerous kind of \npolitics for American agriculture.\n  Historically, Mr. President, we have always crafted a bipartisan farm \nbill. I see the Senator from North Dakota on the floor. He has talked \nabout that. I have worked with him. I have worked with other Senators \non the floor to craft a bipartisan approach to farm policy. I hope that \nis what we can accomplish this afternoon before the political season \ngets so hot that we cannot get any work done.\n  If that is the case, we probably lose. But someone else loses, and \nthat is the American farmer and American agriculture.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me.\n  Mr. President, I am stunned listening to my good friend from Idaho \ntalk about the politics of the season. If talking about the politics \nsurrounding the vote this afternoon on a bill that the U.S. Senate \nAgriculture Committee has never had hearings on, has never passed, when \nthe other party has frozen this side of the aisle totally out of any \nnegotiations relative to meeting our commitment to an agriculture bill \nfor the farmers of this country--they come forward with something known \nas the freedom-to-farm-bill. The freedom-to-farm bill, Mr. President, \nfrankly, is a bill that the farmers in France should love. Our \ncompetitors overseas should love the freedom-to-farm bill because what \nit is going to mean is that our farmers are going to be unable to \ncompete in the international and world markets. This bill spells \ndoomsday for the farmers of America. It spells doomsday for the \nagriculture programs in our country that are the envy of the world.\n  Mr. President, I cannot believe that my friend from Idaho is talking \nabout the politics of the moment when it is his party that has \nprevented a real debate on the 1996 agriculture bill to take place. \nThis bill was written by budgeteers. It was not written by the \nAgriculture Committee in the House or in the Senate. It was written by \nthe budget committees, Mr. President. My friend from Idaho knows that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Arkansas if we find \nourselves in the circumstance that for the first time in history the \nfarm bill was stuck in the budget reconciliation bill last year. So \nthere was no farm bill debate on the floor of the Senate. It was \nsupposed to happen last year, but it did not happen.\n  I think that it probably is not very important to talk about what \nhappened yesterday. The question is, what happens today and what \nhappens tomorrow? The issue for us is, what about the future of family \nfarming in this country? Will we have family farmers in the future or \nnot? Will we simply have giant agri-factories farming from California \nto Maine? Do we care about the future of family farmers, or do we not? \nIs that not the real issue before us?\n  This is not about politics. It is about policy and who cares about \nthe future of family farmers.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I will answer my friend from North Dakota by saying that \njust a few months ago, I went before our farm bureau organization down \nin Arkansas. I spent about an hour and a half visiting with them. They \nbegged me and they pled with me to oppose the Freedom to Farm Act. Now, \nsuddenly, they have made a reversal. They say, ``Well, maybe it is the \nbest we can do.''\n  Mr. President, I do not think it is the best we can do. I think that \nwe can do better. I think that we can go back and draft at least an \nextension of the farm bill of the past 5 years and extend it for a year \nand make certain that we do not make the gargantuan mistakes that we \nare likely to make today by enacting the Freedom to Farm Act.\n  Mr. President, I think the appointed hour has arrived, and I \ntherefore yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. FORD. The time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S877-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S878-S880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ADMINISTRATION OF OATH TO RON WYDEN, SENATOR FROM OREGON\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will be very brief. While Senator Wyden \ngreets his new colleagues, let me just say how much we appreciate his \npresence and how delighted we are he has now joined our ranks. My wife, \nLinda, and I want to congratulate his wife, Laurie Wyden, and his \nchildren, Lilly Wyden and Adam Wyden, as they celebrate their father's \nvictory, as well.\n  We are very enthusiastic about the opportunity to serve with Senator \nWyden. We look forward to a long and productive career for him in the \nSenate.\n  Let me thank him for all of his good service in the years he has \nalready served in the House of Representatives, and let me again \nexpress our enthusiasm and our congratulations to him personally.\n  Let me also congratulate the State of Oregon for the fine way with \nwhich it conducted the campaign. They may have set a new marker for the \nrest of us and yet another example of democracy at its finest. We will \nlook with great interest as other States experiment with mail-in \nballoting. If it will produce the same result as the result in Oregon, \nlet me say, I enthusiastically endorse it.\n  [Applause, laughter.]\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The senior Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I am not going to be quite as brief. \nLast week, Oregonians chose Ron Wyden as their new U.S. Senator in a \nspecial vote-by-mail election. This was a closely contested election \nwith Ron Wyden prevailing with 48 percent of the vote.\n  Today, Congressman Wyden becomes Senator Wyden. He brings with him \nalmost 16 years of service to Oregon in the House of Representatives \nand, more important, he brings a keen intellect and an understanding of \nthe important issues facing our State. He also possesses a very gifted \nand able staff, which I am confident will make the transition from the \nHouse of Representatives to the Senate swiftly and with competence.\n  Senator Wyden has proven that he is dedicated to the people of \nOregon. After spending 2 months campaigning across the State, he has \nnow an even better understanding of the unique, independent spirit that \ntypifies the citizens of our State. My overall goal throughout my \nentire tenure in the Senate is to improve the quality of life for all \nOregonians. This is a goal I know is shared by Oregon's new Senator.\n  Oregon's independent traditions have often placed our State at the \ncutting edge of democracy. In 1902, voters created the initiative and \nreferendum. This process allows citizens to propose new laws or change \nin the State's constitution through an election-ballot measure. This \nchange allowed a sharing of power between the State legislature and the \nelectorate.\n  From 1902 to 1994, voters put 272 initiatives on the ballot, of which \n95 passed and became law. This was a historic change in the political \nprocess, and soon many other States followed.\n  Ninety years later, Oregon continues to take the lead in democratic \ninnovations. The special election for the U.S. Senate in which Ron \nWyden was elected was conducted entirely by mail. From the primary to \nthe general, Oregon became the first State to conduct a mail-only \nelection to fill a Federal vacancy. This experiment in democracy was a \ndramatic success. Sixty-six percent of Oregon's 1.8 million registered \nvoters cast ballots in the general election. By comparison, a 1993 \nTexas Senate race only saw a 21-percent turnout. By anybody's count, \nvoting by mail has dramatic, positive impact on voter participation.\n  Voter turnout has reached dismal proportions in this country. People \nhave become disenchanted with the entire political system, and they are \ndeclining to become involved. A recent national survey by the \nWashington Post, Harvard University, and the Kaiser Family Foundation, \nfound a widespread contempt for Government and political leaders. When \nasked how often do you trust the Government in Washington to do the \nright thing, only 25 percent responded that they trust the Government a \nmajority of the time.\n    \n    \n  This conclusion paints a grim picture of the democratic future of \nthis country, and restoring public trust in Government is the greatest \nchallenge confronting each of us who holds elected office. With \npoliticians ranking below dog-catchers in public opinion polls, steps \nneed to be taken to improve the public's perception of our profession.\n  It is my commitment to restoring public confidence in the political \nsystem that undergirds my support for measures that increase voter \nparticipation. Citizens will continue to hold our institutions in ill \nrepute as long as they remain disillusioned with the system. It is when \npeople become a part of the process, when they have a stake in the \noutcome, do they begin to understand and trust their Government.\n  Oregon's experience in voting by mail was a success because it \nbroadened the base of political participation. The same principle \nundergirded our support for the national voter registration, commonly \nknown as motor-voter. That became law during the 103d Congress, and the \nlaw provides national uniformity in access to the electoral process by \nallowing voter registration through the mail and at government agencies \nand at departments of motor vehicles throughout the country. But Oregon \npreceded this national law. Oregon was one of the first States to \nexperiment with motor-voter, and the success we experienced in the \nlaboratory of our State convinced me that our innovation was worthy of \ntrial on the national level. Motor-voter has increased access to the \nvoter registration process. That increased access has benefited both \npolitical parties, not one over the other.\n  The editorial board of the Washington Post yesterday declared that \nOregon's experiment in vote-by-mail elections was a success. The \neditorial continued stating ``a State with a longstanding reformist \ntradition may thus have pointed the way toward expanded political \nparticipation and at a moment when voters are so widely described as \nfed up with (and indifferent to) politics.''\n  Increasing the number of those who take part in the electoral process \nis critical to ensuring the vitality of democracy. The greatness of our \nRepublic was founded on and rooted in a broad base of voter \nparticipation.\n  We are the Government of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople, and if the people cease to participate, then our system is in \ndanger.\n  So I take this occasion to congratulate Ron Wyden in his victory and \nOregon with experimenting with a new innovation.\n  [Applause.]\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, with the oath of office just administered, \nRon Wyden becomes the 1,827th person to have served in the U.S. Senate. \nAnd on behalf of Senate Republicans, I welcome our newest colleague to \nthe Chamber, and I welcome the many Oregonians who join us in the \ngallery for this occasion.\n  Under the Senate rules, Senator Wyden is now our most junior member--\nranking 100th in seniority. That is exactly the same position Senator \nHatfield from Oregon found himself in when he came to the Senate 29 \nyears ago last month.\n  And I think most of my colleagues would agree with Senator Hatfield, \nwho said recently that when he came to this Chamber, he thought the \nseniority system was a bit silly. But the longer he stayed here, the \nmore sense it made.\n  I know that Senator Wyden  has a great deal of respect for Senator \nHatfield, and no doubt about it, there is no better guide in explaining \nthe Senate rules, procedures, and traditions--many of which are very \ndifferent from the House, where Senator Wyden served for the past 15 \nyears.\n  One of the differences is that in the House there are limits on how \nlong Members can speak, while there is no such limit in the Senate. \nSenator Thurmond holds the record, speaking on one occasion for 24 \nhours and 18 minutes. And I would suggest to Senator Wyden that is one \nrecord he might not want to break--especially with all his family and \nfriends present today.\n  Another tradition here is that for the past many decades, Senators \nhave written their name in the drawer of the desks we are assigned here \non the floor.\n  The desk I occupy, for instance, has served as the desk of the \nRepublican leader for over half a century. In fact, the first \nRepublican leader to sign this \n\n[[Page S880]]\ndesk was Senator Charles McNary of Oregon.\n  Senator Wyden's desk also has a long history. And I note that the \nlast 13 Senators to have occupied it were Republicans, and hope that \nsome of that heritage will rub off on Senator Wyden.\n  Finally, let me admit that it is no secret that Senate Republicans \nwere hoping for different results in Oregon's very close election.\n  But I take heart in the fact that even though Senator Wyden is the \n47th Democrat Senator, he is also the fourth Senator in this Chamber to \nhave been born in Kansas, and certainly that will help him a lot here.\n  Senators Kassebaum, Specter, and myself welcome you to the Kansas \ncaucus, Senator Wyden, and we will get back to you later about the time \nand place of our next meeting.\n  [Applause.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S878-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, I support the freedom-to-farm concept. \nMost farmers in South Dakota that I have talked to want the freedom-to-\nfarm concept.\n  The Senate is in a filibuster situation, although the word \n``filibuster'' is not being used. We are not being allowed to proceed \nto the farm bill by the Democrats. We must produce 60 votes in order to \nproceed. We apparently do not have 60 votes, at least not up to this \npoint.\n  People should understand that many of us want to pass a farm bill. If \nwe were permitted to proceed to the bill, we could then start offering \namendments and begin discussion. However, the other side is not \nallowing the farm bill to come up.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to consider supporting S. 1541, \nthe Agricultural Market Transition Act. Should cloture not be invoked \non S. 1541, I urge my colleagues to support the compromise offered by \nthe Senators from Idaho and Vermont, Senator Craig and Senator Leahy. \nTheir amendment incorporates all of S. 1541 and includes a number of \nother reforms. If we do not have the Freedom to Farm Act, we could have \nthe Leahy-Craig substitute, which has the freedom to farm but includes \na number of reforms.\n  Mr. President, I was recently back home in South Dakota and spent \ntime talking to farmers about what needs to be accomplished in future \nfarm programs. The message was loud and clear: flexibility, certainty, \nand less Government involvement. Both S. 1541 and the Craig-Leahy \ncompromise would provide all of those things.\n  Mr. President, S. 1541 would provide greater economic stability to \nproducers. Producers in South Dakota are telling me not to extend the \n1990 farm bill, and by all means do not let the underlying 1949 act be \nthe operative act for 1996. After careful review, many producers say, \nsupport S. 1541.\n  There will be a lot of unwarranted criticism expressed over S. 1541. \nThose opposed to the bill say we need a permanent safety net for \nfarmers. I say there is nothing permanent about Federal farm policy. \nThe past farm bills were not permanent. All generally covered periods \nof 4 or 5 years.\n  Mr. President, S. 1541 would provide a 7-year plan. Unless economic \nconditions warrant an earlier revisitation of Federal farm policy, we \nwill no doubt be putting together a new farm bill in 2002. So S. 1541 \ndoes not eliminate the real safety net for farmers, which, frankly, is \nthe Congress itself. Those people who say there will be no farm \nprograms after 7 years simply are not shooting straight. Past farm \nbills never carried assurance of future farm products except for 1938 \nand 1949 Agricultural Acts.\n  Mr. President, let me summarize my position. Congress should pass a \nfarm bill now. We are ready to act. It is my recommendation if we \ncannot adopt the freedom-to-farm bill, we should adopt the Leahy-Craig \nsubstitute, which is the freedom-to-farm bill with amendments. We \ncannot even adopt amendments to that since there is basically a \nfilibuster going on here. We have to produce 60 votes in order to \nproceed.\n  I implore my colleagues to let us proceed on the farm bill, offer \namendments, as we have in the past in good faith here, in a bipartisan \nway. Let us amend the Craig-Leahy substitute. We are ready to go.\n  Our farmers are ready to go to the fields soon to plant. They are \nmaking their plans with their bankers now. They need certainty.\n  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and others have \nestimated that commodity prices in the next 5 years will be very high \nbecause of demand in China and other demand overseas. The biggest farm \nbill we could adopt is probably a balanced budget, because if we have a \nbalanced budget we will have low-interest rates for farmers and \nbusinessmen. We also will have a stable dollar for international trade. \nI believe we can have a booming agriculture for the next 5 years if we \nhave a balanced budget and if we move toward the concepts in freedom to \nfarm.\n  Mr. President, our farmers want flexibility--that is to be able to \nplant new crops and different crops. If we continue to go with a \nregulated Government system, the Department of Agriculture defines \nwhich crops must be planted. Indeed, it is true that wheat and corn are \nprobably best suited to much of our soil. But who is to say that some \nnew crop might not be experimented with and might come forth.\n  It is said if we have the Freedom to Farm Act that, after 7 years, \nthe farmers will be left on their own. That is not necessarily true. \nJust like with a 5-year farm bill, the Congress does something new \nafterward. If the Congress in 7 years finds that the farmers are in \nneed of it, they can pass a farm bill. They can even reinstitute the \npresent farm bill if they wish. So that is not a good argument.\n  In talking to my farmers in South Dakota, they like freedom to farm. \nMy farmers like the concept of flexibility of crops. The farmers in \nSouth Dakota like the concept of doing away with all the paperwork and \nGovernment regulation that has built up around this program.\n  There are those who would say we should not abolish the 1938 and 1949 \nAgricultural Acts. I disagree. It is time to abolish those acts because \nthey are obsolete. Now is the time for forward thinking reforms. We \nshould not be in a position of carrying forward outdated and \nineffective 50-year-old farm policies as the basis for agricultural \nplanning in the 21st century.\n  Opponents of S. 1541 want to extend existing farm policy for 1 or 2 \nyears. Mr. President, the one thing my producers have made abundantly \nclear is they do not want the Federal Government telling them what they \ncan or cannot plant, and making other decisions for them. They want, \nand deserve, full flexibility. An extension of existing policy means \nthat Government will continue to dictate farming practices. This simply \nis unacceptable.\n  Under S. 1541, producers would have greater planting flexibility. \nProducers would have the opportunity to respond to market conditions. \nThis is vital for their economic survival. Opportunities would be \nendless. Producers would not lose payments if they decided to plant new \nand innovative crops.\n  Mr. President, S. 1541 is supported by the South Dakota Farm Bureau, \nthe South Dakota Corn Growers, and many farmers throughout South \nDakota. They see great opportunities for them in their operations. A \nrecent study by the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute \nshowed that S. 1541 would bring higher prices for corn, soybeans, and \nall livestock over the next 10 years. Current high prices for wheat \nalso would be maintained.\n  Under S. 1541, net farm income is estimated to increase from $38 to \n$50.4 billion in 10 years. In addition, farm program payments would be \nreduced from $6.4 billion in 1995 to $5.04 billion in 2005. In short, \nS. 1541 would increase farm incomes while lowering farm program costs \nto our taxpayers. That is a great deal. \n\n[[Page S881]]\n\n  The last point is important if we are to reach our primary goal of a \nbalanced budget. Mr. President, farmers and ranchers are some of the \nstrongest supporters of balancing the Federal budget.\n  A balanced budget would be great news for South Dakota farmers and \nranchers and their families. It would mean lower interest rates and a \ngrowing economy. A balanced budget would reduce interest rates by at \nleast 1.5 percent. A reduction in interest rates of that size would \nhelp raise farm income by more than $2 billion per year.\n  So, to conclude and to summarize, I support this Congress going \nforward on legislation on the farm bill now. I am weary of the \nfilibuster that has kept us from dealing with amendments. If we cannot \nhave the freedom-to-farm bill, let us have a modification of it, which \nthe Leahy-Craig offer encompasses. This will mean more prosperity to \nfarmers and also less costs to the taxpayers. It will mean \nstrengthening our position in international trade, which will help our \ncountry in general.\n  We cannot delay any longer. Our farmers are meeting with their \nbankers at this hour, trying to work out their financial plans. In the \nsouthern part of our country, they are prepared to plant. The Congress \nseems to be dilly-dallying. Let people understand what is going on \nhere. We, on this side of the aisle, are ready to legislate. We are \ngoing to have a cloture vote today. I plead with my colleagues, let us \ngo and legislate and offer amendments and we will have a farm bill \nworked out. But let there be no misunderstanding out in the country. We \nare not holding this farm bill up. We are here, ready to legislate. The \ncloture vote this afternoon, if we fail, it will hold us up again.\n  I want to make it very clear to my farmers where this delay is coming \nfrom. My farmers, generally speaking, want freedom to farm. Let us get \nthe truth out. Let us have a farm bill now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of other \nSenators. My intention was that if we have some morning business that \nwe have it on both sides. I want to be able to discuss for a bit the \nsubject of agriculture and where we find ourselves. My specific \ninterest in doing so is that I think there is some confusion about \nexactly where we are.\n  First of all, the farm bill is not now pending. We are in morning \nbusiness. The farm bill will be pending when we finish morning business \nand bring it back to the floor of the Senate. But contrary to previous \nassertions, no one has prevented the farm bill from coming to the \nfloor. It is on the floor. It is and will be the pending business \nbefore the Senate. There is not an effort and there has not been an \neffort by anyone to prevent the farm bill from coming to the floor. \nThose who suggest that are misstating where we are.\n  The farm bill will be on the floor of the Senate this afternoon. It \nis correct to state we have had a cloture vote and will likely have a \nsecond cloture vote this afternoon. To suggest we should invoke cloture \nso we can get on to amendments, however, is a suggestion that does not \nconform with the Rules of the Senate.\n  In fact, in order to offer many of the amendments that have been sent \nto the desk, you would have to avoid cloture so the amendments would be \nable to be offered as being germane. After cloture they would not be \nruled as being germane.\n  The farm bill has been on the floor of the Senate a very short amount \nof time. So, a vote for cloture at this point, would be a vote to cut \noff the opportunity to offer amendments and have them considered. Many \nof us feel that would be inappropriate.\n  Let me emphasize this because it is very important. This is not a \ndebate between those in the U.S. Senate who believe farmers ought to \nhave more planting flexibility and those who believe they should not \nhave more planting flexibility. That is what this debate is being \nportrayed as. But, that is not the case.\n  I have offered a couple of amendments that are sitting at the desk. I \nhave previously offered unanimous consent requests about extension of \ncurrent law. In every case with the amendments that are at the desk and \nthe unanimous-consent requests that I have offered, we suggest that \nfarmers be given planting flexibility on their base acres. Let the \nfarmers decide what they want to plant, not the Federal Government.\n  When people stand up and say this is a choice between those who want \nto put you in a straitjacket on planting decisions and those of us who \nwant freedom to farm, where you get flexibility, that is not the fact. \nIt is a false choice.\n  No farm program proposal that I know of before this body would \nrequire that we be in that circumstance. Nobody is offering a choice in \nwhich farmers will be required to be told by the Federal Government \nwhat their planting decisions might or might not be. Everyone here, \nmyself and others, believes that we ought to have substantial planting \nflexibility on base acres for farmers.\n  There is not any differences either, in my judgment, with respect to \nthe issue of repayment of advance deficiency payments for those who \nsuffered crop losses.\n  Everything I have offered through unanimous-consent requests, as well \nas the two amendments to the freedom-to-farm bill that are now at the \ndesk, would do basically the same thing. We would forgive advance \ndeficiency payments for those who have suffered crop losses. So, that \nis not what this debate is about either. If people stand up and say \nthat is what this debate is about, that is a false set of choices.\n  I just heard a discussion, and I heard it previously, that this is \nnot about whether there should be permanent farm law. They say, ``Of \ncourse, there will be a farm program.'' Or they say, ``There will \nlikely be a farm program.'' That is not the case at all.\n  The freedom-to-farm bill has some attractive features which I hope we \ncan capture and put into compromise and move forward. But it also has \nsomething which, in my judgment, is a bad feature for rural America. \nMost notably this is a bill that pays a severance payment. It gives \nseverance pay to farmers for the purpose of transitioning them away \nfrom any sort of farm program at all.\n  Why do I say that? Because the freedom-to-farm bill itself says there \nshall be no more permanent farm law. This bill is going to repeal the \nunderlying farm law. Why would they do that? Because they do not want \npermanent farm law.\n  They could rectify that easily, if they wanted to modify their \nproposal. But, they do not intend to modify it. These really are \nseverance payments, paid up front, for the purpose of providing that \nthere will be no further farm programs. That is what it is about. It is \nvery simple and, in my judgment, cannot be misrepresented. I know \npeople try, but it cannot be. There will no longer be a permanent farm \nlaw. That is the purpose of repealing it in this proposal.\n  The reason I care about this, as well as the reason that others care, \nis that we care whether there is a network of family farm yard lights \nout in rural America. In my judgment, if a farm bill is not designed to \ntry to help family farmers, then let us not even talk about a farm \nbill. Then, let us not have a farm bill. Then, let us not have a U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, which was started under Abe Lincoln with \nnine \n\n[[Page S882]]\nemployees and has become this behemoth down there. We do not need USDA \nand a farm bill if they are not designed to help protect family-sized \nfarmers.\n  When you have international price depressions and prices drop, family \nfarmers get washed away. They are too small to have much of a financial \nbase to withstand declining international prices over which they have \nno control.\n  Will this country be farmed by giant agrifactories from California to \nMaine? If you think that is fine, then we do not need to debate this \nfarm law. If that is what you decide then we do not need a farm \nprogram. However, if you think we ought to encourage and nurture a \nnetwork of family farms in this country, have yard lights dotting the \nprairies, and have family farms that become the blood vessels that \nprovide nourishment and economic health to rural areas and small towns, \nthen you would care about the kind of farm program we enact.\n\n  Some of what has been suggested in the freedom-to-farm bill makes \nsense. Some of it makes no sense at all. Where we ought to find \nourselves, in my judgment, is in a compromise in which we take the best \nof what both sides have to offer.\n  We had a compromise similar to that over the weekend. It has been \ndiscussed at some length. It is one that I would support and one that \nmakes sense, in my judgment. It retains current permanent farm law. It \nsubstantially changes the up-front payments. It substantially increases \nflexibility on planning for farmers. It forgives advanced deficiency \npayments for those who have suffered crop losses. It does a lot of \nthings which together represent the best features of what has been \noffered from both sides.\n  Yet we are told by some, ``Either you invoke cloture and cut off \ndebate and cut off amendments on the freedom-to-farm bill or we are not \ngoing to play; we will go home, and we will blame it on you all.''\n  We are way beyond the issue of blame. This is February 1996. In the \nmiddle of last year there should have been a debate on the floor of the \nSenate about a farm bill, and there was not. Everybody in this Chamber \nknows that. We failed.\n  Now in February 1996, if we are going to construct farm legislation, \nlet us not do it by holding a club to somebody's head. Let us do it by \ndeciding that we will put together farm legislation the way it has \nalways been put together in the U.S. Senate. That is, let's do it in a \nbipartisan way, taking the good ideas that come from both sides.\n  Senator Grassley is on the floor. I expect he will want to speak \nnext. He knows as much about agriculture as almost anybody in this \nChamber and cares a lot about it. We may have different views of \nexactly how these cloture votes work and exactly what we ought to do \nfor the future of family farming. But, we do not disagree, in my \njudgment, at all about the importance of agriculture in Iowa and North \nDakota and the importance of family farmers in Iowa and North Dakota. \nWe need to find a way to provide a bridge over the differences in this \nfarm bill. We need to decide that at the end of today, or at the end of \ntomorrow, this Senate will have advanced a compromise into a conference \ncommittee that will benefit family-sized farms in this country.\n  I do not have the magic answer on how to do that. But there have been \ncompromise talks over the weekend and last week that make a lot of \nsense to me. We should take the best features of several different \nproposals, put them together, and advance a plan that retains permanent \nfarm law. That is very important. It does not pull the safety net out \nfrom under family farmers in the long term. It is not a severance pay \nproposal saying we are going to transition you. Any time somebody from \nWashington talks about transitioning, it is time to fasten your \nseatbelt.\n  I do not want to transition farmers. I want a new family farm program \nthat recognizes the worth and the value of family farmers and this \ncountry's future. I want more flexibility. I want up-front advanced \npayments to help recapitalize family farms. I want all of the things \nthat many of you want in this Chamber. But I want them put in the \ncontext of a compact of sorts for the future. I want a compact that \nsays we care about the long-term health of family farms in America.\n\n  I took the floor only because I wanted to correct some of the things \nthat have been said. It has been said people have objected to the \ndebate on the farm bill last week and this week. That is not true at \nall. The farm bill is on the floor. The Senator from Indiana will call \nit back up. Right now we are in morning business. But the minute the \nSenator from Indiana or the majority leader comes to the floor, they \nwill call up the farm bill, and it will be pending.\n  So those who say the farm bill is not before us because people have \nobjected to bringing the bill to the floor do not understand the \nprocedure. The farm bill is pending. The cloture vote is a vote about \nwhether or not we should cut off the amendments that would provide \nalternatives, including a compromise of the type I have just discussed.\n  I hope that by the end of today, or tomorrow, no matter what happens \non this cloture vote, that all of us, Republicans and Democrats, can do \nwhat we have done for 30 or 40 years in this Chamber. I hope we can \nfinish our work by having fashioned a bipartisan compromise. I hope \nthat we have created a farm bill that will work for the advantage and \nthe betterment of family farms and our country's future. If we do that, \nwe will all have done something worthwhile for rural America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I hold up two volumes of legislation \nbecause when Congress says it does something, the public at large is \ncynical about our doing anything, particularly anything that is very \ncomplicated, and particularly not just when we finish talking about \naction on a farm bill. I hold up the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, a \n1,800-page document that was put together over a period of about 8 \nmonths by 13 different committees--those committees are listed here--in \nthe U.S. Senate to fulfill a promise that the majority party, the \nRepublican Party, made to the people in the 1994 election that we would \nbalance the budget.\n\n  This document, scored by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, \nbalances the budget--1,800 pages. It includes welfare reform, saving \n$58 billion. It includes the saving of Medicare--the saving of it, the \nstrengthening of it, giving people choice for the first time in that \nGovernment program. It has very good tax programs in here. Just \nbalancing this budget will save agriculture 2 percentage points, and \nany loan in the United States about 2 percentage points, on interest.\n  This also includes the agriculture bill that would have been a 7-year \nagriculture program. If the President had not vetoed this bill in early \nDecember last year, we would not be debating farm legislation, and we \nwould not only have a farm bill that would be good for agriculture, but \nwe would also have a lot of other tax policies and interest policies \nthat would be even more beneficial to agriculture--and to the entire \ncountry, for that matter--than even maybe the farm bill would be \nbeneficial to agriculture.\n  So here is last year's product to balance the budget--1,800 pages. \nThe President vetoed it. He has a constitutional right to veto it. But \none person stood in the way last year of our having a farm program, and \nthat was the \n\n[[Page S883]]\nPresident who vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  I wanted to hold that up because maybe people do not really believe \nwe passed a comprehensive piece of legislation to balance the budget, \nand maybe the farmers do not know that we passed provisions in here for \nthe Freedom-To-Farm Act so that we would be able to transition farm \nprograms from the Government regulated and dominated environment of the \nlast 50 years to the free trade environment and the export environment \nthat we are going to have under GATT into the next century.\n  My good friend from North Dakota spoke eloquently about his point of \nview on the farm bill, and he and I can speak in a friendly fashion \nabout agriculture. We do that all the time. It may not appear on the \nfloor of the Senate that we do that, but we can sit down and discuss \nfarm legislation.\n  I do not take the floor in opposition to what he said but just to \npoint out to some people, to the public at large, not just to the \nfarmers of America, what sometimes drives legislation in the Congress.\n  I wish to read from the Congressional Record a letter that the Senate \nminority leader, Mr. Daschle, put in during his debate last week. This \nletter that he inserted lists a lot of organizations that were against \nthe compromise that was worked out.\n  By the way, we had a compromise worked out last week with what we \nthought were enough Democrats so we would get enough votes to have \ncloture and move forward. It happens that we did not get enough \nDemocrat votes to do that. But anyway, quoting from a paragraph which \nis part of Senator Daschle's speech, he says:\n\n       I am very pleased by a letter that we received just this \n     morning from a large number of very reputable organizations \n     including the National Audubon Society, the Environmental \n     Working Group, Henry A. Wallace Institute for Alternative \n     Agriculture, Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, National \n     Resource Defense Council, the National Rural Housing \n     Coalition, who are saying that even with the Leahy \n     improvements--\n\n  Those were the amendments that we had accepted last week.\n\n     they are strongly in opposition to passing the so-called \n     freedom to farm.\n\n  I would like to read a list of organizations in a letter I did not \nread last week who are in support of what we are doing, because I think \nthere is an extreme contrast here. A lot of the organizations that the \nSenator from South Dakota listed are all very reputable organizations. \nThere is nothing I wish to say that detracts from the good work they do \nin Washington, DC, for the interests they have. But the question I wish \nto raise as I read a list of organizations supporting what we are \ntrying to do today and what we were trying to do last week, is the \nextent to which the groups driving the debate on the other side are not \nsolely interested just in agriculture but are having more dominance in \nthe debate than farm organizations like this that support what we are \ntrying to do: the American Farm Bureau, the Cotton Council, the \nAmerican Cotton Shippers, National Feed and Grain Association, National \nGrain Sorghum Association, United Egg Producers, the National Barley \nGrowers, National Cattlemen's, National Corn Growers, the Fertilizer \nInstitute, the National Potato Council, the National Pork Producers, \nNational Turkey Federation, the National Broilers Council, the North \nAmerican Export Grain Association, and the United Fresh Fruits and \nVegetables Association. I could name their affiliates in the State of \nIowa that are supporting this legislation, and I would imagine most of \nthe State affiliates are supporting it.\n\n  So it is probably unfair to say that what groups want in this town \ndrive what individual Members want. But I think there is a stark \ncontrast between the organizations that were listed by Senator Daschle \nand those I just listed. Those listed by Senator Daschle mostly lean \ntoward the environmental point of view on agriculture. Although it is \nlegitimate to have environmental groups with an interest in what \nagricultural legislation is going to be, we ought to ask whether or not \nthese groups ought to have primary consideration in opposition to the \nchanges in the farm program. These changes will direct agricultural \npolicy toward the next century as opposed to keeping the agriculture \npolicy of this century and the last 50 years, which in the new \nenvironment we are currently in, is obviously outdated. We ought to be \nlooking to these organizations I just read that support what we are \ntrying to do because they are forward looking, to make sure we are \nproducing for the future and the global trade environment of the \nfuture.\n  I hope that we do spend our time in consideration of what we ought to \nhave for a farm program that is free of Government regulation to the \ngreatest extent possible, even having a safety net, but have that \nsafety net be a cooperative effort between the private sector and the \npublic sector that can guarantee income as well as production and have \nincome support for agriculture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to have 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, every once in a while, when we take \ndefeat after defeat because of a Presidential veto--and I think the \nPresident has vetoed half of the appropriations bills that we have \npassed this year. Oddly enough, most Presidents veto appropriations \nbills because the Congress is wasting money. This is the first \nPresident I know who is vetoing appropriations bills because we are not \nspending enough money. And yet he is talking to the Governors' \nassociation this morning about how he is going to balance the budget, \nand he vetoes the appropriations bills that are balancing the budget. \nBut anyway, once in a while we get an opportunity to say we were right. \nIn this particular case, this Balanced Budget Act of 1995 was right \nbecause one of the major provisions of this Balanced Budget Act of \n1995, which we would have had to do unrelated to balancing the budget \nor even unrelated to tax decreases, was to save Medicare from \nbankruptcy. This document not only saved Medicare from bankruptcy, it \nstrengthened Medicare, and it also gave for the first time the elderly \npeople of America, the senior citizens of America, the retired people \nof America, those who rely upon Medicare as their primary health \ninsurance group, an opportunity to have something different than just a \nGovernment-run program.\n  They could have had medical savings accounts. They could have had \ncontinued a union or association plan where they last worked. They \ncould have bought into managed care, and they would be able to go from \ntraditional Medicare to a medical savings account and back next year if \nthey wanted to. They could go from traditional Medicare to a managed \ncare plan and try that for a year and go back and not cost them \nanything, but have that option through a voucher of having Medicare pay \nfor whatever their option is.\n  It is the same thing that we have in the Congress. Every December we \nhave what is called--I do not remember the terminology--but we have a \nseason that we can change from one program to another. We are giving \nthem the same thing Congress has, the same thing Federal civil servants \nhave.\n  Once again, the President vetoed this in early December 1995. So our \nefforts to save, our efforts to strengthen and our efforts to give \nseniors choice for the first time went down the drain.\n  We did it because the trustees in April said Medicare was going to be \nbusted, bankrupt in the year 2002, 7 years from now. That is why we did \nwhat we did in this. I do not know why the President vetoed it. Does he \nwant it to go bankrupt, or does he want a political issue? I do not \nknow why, but he did.\n  Yesterday, we had in the New York Times something that should have \nprobably been released to the public back in October. Why it was not \nuntil now I do not know. I hope there was no coverup on the part of the \nadministration to keep it from being published.\n  We have a report from HCFA's chief actuary that Medicare lost money \nin 1995 for the first time in 23 years. It is a 29-year-old program. So \nearly on, it had another period of 1 year when it spent more than it \ntook in.\n  But now for the first time in 24 years, Medicare is spending out more \nthan it is bringing in in taxes, which emphasizes what the trustees \nsaid in April of \n\n[[Page S884]]\nlast year. They pleaded with Congress. They pleaded with the Republican \nCongress: ``Take action right now because it is going to be easier to \ndo it now than it will be in the year 2001 or 2002 when it is just \nabout ready to go under.'' This had not been anticipated to occur until \n1997.\n  What we learn now through the newspapers, the chief actuary giving \nthis report last year, is the Medicare hospital trust fund lost $35.7 \nmillion. In other words, it took in that much less than we had \nanticipated.\n  He was not sure when part A would be depleted, but he did say that it \ncould be earlier than 2002.\n  In any case, according to the actuary, this recent finding does not \nhelp the trust fund. It gives more insecurity to the people on Social \nSecurity and it, of course, emphasizes what we were trying to say when \nwe passed this Balanced Budget Act of 1995 which saved Medicare.\n  So I hope that the President comes around to a point of view of \ncooperating with the Congress to a greater extent than he has on the \nsaving of Medicare, because this is one time the Republican Congress is \nway ahead of the White House.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, the Senate was compelled to \npass H.R. 2880, the Balanced Budget and Downpayment Act, to avert \nanother Governmental shutdown. As I observed on the day of \nconsideration, we did so under great duress, being forced to set aside \nour right and duty to amend the legislation.\n  Of particular concern to me remains the harsh treatment given to the \nAgency for International Development's family planning program. Though \nit was known at the time that the formulation of this account was \nnearly calamitous, closer examination of the provision has revealed \nthat the situation is far worse than had been imagined at that time.\n  The provisions that passed the Senate and the House halts family \nplanning assistance programs until July 1 of this year. Following July \n1, funding may be provided at 65 percent of the fiscal year 1995 level, \napportioned on a monthly basis for 15 months.\n  What this means is that only 14 percent of what was available for \nobligation in fiscal year 1995 for family planning will be available \nfor obligation this entire fiscal year--14 percent. None of us would \nnormally tolerate a cut of this magnitude, made without the benefit of \nany debate, particularly on a program which enjoys such strong \nbipartisan support. And yet we did it.\n  Stated differently, and more important, what we did is bar access to \nfamily planning services to approximately 17 million couples, most of \nthem living in unimaginable poverty. We opened the door to the \nprobability of at least 14 million unintended pregnancies every year, \ntens of thousands of deaths among women and nearly a million deaths \namong infants and young children annually. Indeed, we embrace the \nprobability of at least 4 million more abortions that could have been \naverted if access to voluntary family planning services had been \nmaintained. This is what we did.\n  These numbers, which are calculated through statistics from \norganizations like UNICEF and the World Health Organization are as \ndisturbing as they are astounding, particularly to those of us who are \nfaithfully and assertively pro-life. To doubt these numbers may bring \ntemporary relief to people of conscience, but doubters should consider \nthe experience of families in the former Soviet Union where family \nplanning services have been unavailable for decades.\n  The abortion rate in Russia spans from a conservative estimate of 4 \nabortions per woman to a shocking high of 12 abortions for some women \nover their reproductive years. Since there have been virtually no, and \nI suggest that you underscore when you are listening as well as when I \nspeak, no planning services available in Russia, abortion has become \nthe chief method of birth control.\n  The framers of the family planning language in H.R. 2880 ensured, \nperhaps unintentionally, that the gruesome experience of Russian women \nand families will be replicated throughout the world starting now.\n  In each of the last two foreign operations appropriations bills, I \nhave made sure that adequate money has been devoted to starting family \nplanning programs in Russia. Similar programs in Hungary have shown a \n60-percent reduction in the abortion rate there, 8 years after the \nintroduction of family planning. We had hoped for such success in \nRussia, but now the future is uncertain.\n  The family planning language in H.R. 2880 is not prolife, it is not \nprowoman, it is not prochild, it is not prohealth, and it is not \nprofamily planning. It inflicts the harm of a profound misconception on \nvery poor families overseas who only ask for help in spacing their \nchildren through contraception, not abortion.\n  Some of our colleagues appear unaware that the prohibition on funding \nabortions with U.S. foreign aid money has been in place since 1973. \nAID's excellent family planning program, widely recognized as the most \nefficiently run in the world, has taken a strict and conservative \ninterpretation of this prohibition, and seeks instead to prevent \nabortions by offering alternatives. Demand has always exceeded supply, \nand unmet needs continue to grow.\n  We urgently need to correct the mistake we made in H.R. 2880. We need \nto restore, with rhetoric and with resources, support to AID's family \nplanning program. For those of us who take a prolife position, this is \nthe most effective way to reiterate our profound opposition to the \npractice of abortion. All the antiabortion speech this Chamber can \ntolerate will not reduce the number of unintended pregnancies as \nswiftly or as surely as our support for voluntary family planning.\n  I intend to do what I can to rectify this situation as soon as \npossible, and urge my colleagues to join in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S884-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S884-S885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AGRICULTURAL MARKET TRANSITION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as the Nation's farmers look ahead to the \nnew planting season, I rise today in support of moving forward on much-\nneeded farm bill legislation.\n  Over the past year, I have met with farmers, businesses, bankers, and \ncommunity leaders across Minnesota. They have told me of the urgent \nneed to develop a farm bill which will show them the direction farm \npolicy will move over the next couple of years.\n  Clearly, our farmers and agribusinesses deserve a reasonable and \nresponsible roadmap of the Nation's long-term agricultural policy. If \nWashington continues to delay action, decisions about planting, \nequipment purchases, fertilizer and seed sales, and credit hang in the \nbalance. And as a result, our agricultural economy will suffer.\n  This current predicament is a perfect example of how Government \ninterference in the area of agriculture has taken its toll on the \nproductivity of our farmers, agribusinesses, and the other sectors of \nour economy which depend on them.\n  By expanding the role of Government so deeply into the business of \nfarming, Washington has taken much of the decisionmaking authority away \nfrom the real experts--those who have planted, plowed, and harvested \nfor generations--and handed it over to bureaucrats, some of whom are \nthousands of miles away from America's heartland.\n  I have always said with pride that Minnesota's farmers are among the \nmost productive in the world. Historically, Minnesota agriculture has \nranked first in sugarbeet production, third in spring wheat and \nsunflower production, fourth in barley and oat production, sixth in \ncorn production, third in swine products, and second in turkey \nprocessing. Of course, Minnesota has always been among the Nation's \nleaders in milk and cheese production. It is also quickly becoming a \nleading exporter of raw and value-added products. \n\n[[Page S885]]\n\n  But there is so much more that our farmers can do, if only we would \nfree them from the burdens of inflexible regulations, high taxes, and \nthe overreaching arm of Government. Government should not get in the \nway of farmers. It should set a level playing field so that farmers \nfrom across the country can compete fairly with each other, regardless \nof geographic region or commodity item. We owe it to our farmers to do \nnothing less--and nothing more.\n  We also owe it to the American taxpayers--the people who pay for the \njumbled agricultural policy Washington has created--to fix the failed \npolicies of the past and ensure that their tax dollars are put to work \nmost efficiently.\n  First and foremost, we must provide greater flexibility for our \nfarmers. Current Federal policies dictate decades-old planting patterns \nset by Washington and require every farmer to visit USDA annually to \ncomply with its seemingly endless paperwork requirements.\n  Today, the Senate can help alleviate some of those burdens by passing \na bold, new approach called the Agricultural Market Transition Act.\n  This innovative plan, initially crafted by Majority Leader Dole, \nAgriculture Committee Chairman Lugar and other members of the \nAgriculture Committee, offers farmers the flexibility they will need to \nremain strong into the next century.\n  Under this proposal, farmers can plant for what the marketplace \ndemands, not what traditional Government crop subsidies have dictated. \nIt would give farmers in Minnesota additional flexibility in meeting \nthe needs of value-added cooperatives and their customers who use \nproducts like ethanol.\n  This bill also simplifies paperwork requirements for farmers. Instead \nof the current annual paperwork load they face today, passage of this \nlegislation means many farmers may only need to visit the local CFSA \nonce as part of a 7-year contract.\n  The Agricultural Marketing Transition Act also gives farmers the \nneeded certainty of a fixed, 7-year payment with fixed parameters. Many \nfarmers in Minnesota, especially in the younger generation, need this \ncertainty for long-term loans and other financial decisions.\n  For these and other reasons, farm groups in Minnesota, such as the \nwheat growers, barley growers, corn growers, bean growers, the \nMinnesota Farm Bureau, and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture have \nendorsed passage of this bill. They know it will give them the \nflexibility and the opportunity for long-term growth potential in farm \nincome.\n  But while I enthusiastically support much of this bill because it \nhelps both Minnesota's farm community and the American taxpayer, I must \nraise my strong concerns about its failure to enact substantial \nprogress in the area of dairy reform.\n  Having sought the counsel of Minnesota's dairy industry, I am well \naware of the problems caused for milk producers, taxpayers, and \nconsumers by our archaic dairy program. For instance, Federal milk \nmarketing orders have helped cause the loss of thousands of dairy farms \nin Minnesota alone over the last decade.\n  Under this troubled business climate, Minnesota continues to lose an \naverage of nearly three dairy farms per day.\n  In addition, the Minnesota dairy industry is adamantly opposed to the \nNortheast Dairy Compact. I firmly believe this well-intentioned \nproposal will lead to a regional balkanization of the dairy industry \nand threatens to make our dairy program even more unwieldy for the \ndairy processors and producers that I represent.\n  Instead of letting protectionism get in the way of our dairy \nproducers, we should begin enacting long-term, common-sense reforms \nthat deregulate the Federal Dairy Program.\n  I understand that the regional politics currently tying up this bill \nprevent us from making these long-term dairy reforms. At the very \nleast, however, I believe we should consolidate milk marketing orders, \neliminate costly producer assessments, and reduce the price supports \nfor dairy commodities to a reasonable level.\n  By establishing a level playing field for dairy producers, we can \ndramatically improve and preserve a vital segment of our agriculture \nindustry as a whole. I hope to have the commitment of the chairman and \nthe ranking member of the Agriculture Committee to work with me in the \nfuture on these and other reforms.\n  Enacting a more productive farm policy must be our goal, and we can \nbegin this process by freeing farmers from Government interference, \nencouraging the use of market discipline in farm decision-making, while \nat the same time protecting the American taxpayers.\n  This bill makes that important first step and gives our farmers, \nsmall business owners, and lenders what they need--a roadmap to guide \nthem in the important decisions ahead.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and the cloture \nmotion before us today.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to ask my colleagues to support \nthe cloture vote so we can enact a farm bill not only this year, but in \ntime for farmers to make the decision about what they are going to \nplant. Right now, our farmers are in a most precarious position. In my \nState of Texas, it is planting season, and yet they do not know if the \nfreedom-to-farm provisions are going to be available to them, or \nwhether they are going to have a 1949 law to comply with.\n  Mr. President, that is not reasonable, and it is not responsible for \nMembers of Congress not to take up this bill and offer their \namendments, but to refuse to take up the bill is irresponsible. I urge \nmy colleagues not to do that to the farmers of America. Their lives are \ntough enough. The last thing they need is to make the wrong guess and \nhave a disastrous year.\n  That is what is going to happen. The bill is very clear. It is a \nfreedom-to-farm bill, so that you will have the ability to make your \nown decisions based on your soil and what you think is your best \nability to farm the commodity that you like the best. That is new and \nit is very important.\n  It also eliminates the costly, timely paperwork required to comply \nwith current regulations. It eliminates the need for most of the \nregulations now necessary to govern current programs. The freedom-to-\nfarm portions contribute to the deficit reduction by reducing \nagriculture spending by more than $12 billion over 7 years.\n  What happens, Mr. President, if we do not invoke cloture and pass \nthis bill today? Reversion to the permanent law, which is what will \nhappen if we do not enact this bill, would be disastrous. First, it \nwould give farmers a parity price based on 1914 economic conditions. \nThat would result in domestic prices double or triple the world price, \nwhich would, of course, erode our carefully cultivated export markets. \nWe have just passed GATT, which is supposed to break down the barriers \nin our agriculture exports, and yet this bill would be a reversion. \nThat is, if we do not pass this bill, it will be a reversion to the old \nways of doing things which are not best for today.\n  It would mean that the USDA would have to buy all the excess wheat \nthat was not taken up on the world market. It would obliterate our \nability to have a balanced budget. Reversion to permanent law, by \nUSDA's account, would cost taxpayers an additional $2.3 billion in the \nfirst year alone.\n  I share the concerns that my colleague from Minnesota has just stated \nabout the dairy portions of this bill. I do not like it. That Northeast \ncompact is going to hurt other dairy markets around the country. I do \nnot think that is right. We will have a chance to vote on that because \namendments will be in order if we invoke cloture.\n  There is no reason that I can see that a Member of this body can \nresponsibly vote against cloture to allow us to debate this bill and \npass something that will give our farmers the ability to plant \naccording to their own needs in \n\n[[Page S886]]\ntime for them to do it. It would be just like Washington, DC, which is \nout of touch with everything else, to finally pass this bill in March \nor April when the planting season has passed for many of the farmers in \nour country. Mr. President, we cannot do that. It is not responsible. I \nam speaking for the farmers, the hard-working small business people of \nmy State and all the States for which agriculture is so important for \ntheir economies and for their families.\n  I urge my colleagues, vote for cloture. There is no reason to fear \ndebate on this bill. There is every reason for us to do the responsible \nthing so that our farmers and ranchers have the ability to make the \ndecisions that they need to make in a responsible way. It is the least \nthey can expect from the U.S. Congress. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S885-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S886-S888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will depart from the subject matter and just call to \nour attention and to the American people's attention a situation with \nreference to the President's so-called submission of a balanced budget.\n  First, as chairman of the Budget Committee, I was advised last week \nby the White House that they were going to submit this kind of \ndocument. Of course, I cannot do anything about whether they should \nsubmit this 20-page brochure in lieu of a balanced budget, but I \nsuggested that it would not be a budget. The response was that it would \nbe submitted in this manner.\n  I want everybody to know that the February 5 deadline for the \nsubmission of a budget which can be reached--I am not suggesting that \nit cannot be delayed, but to tell the American people that the \nPresident has submitted a balanced budget in compliance with the \nrequirements of the law is just not true. This is 15 pages of political \nprose and advertisements and 5 pages of technical economic assumptions \nand the like. It is as if there really is nothing formal and specific \nabout the Nation's budget.\n  Some may recall in the past when budget directors submitted their \nbudgets, they were more than a few hundred pages. They had supplements \nto amend. That is because every item in the Federal budget was itemized \nin terms of expenditure. This budget is 15 pages of prose, 5 pages of \ntables. It says nothing about how the President proposes to spend the \n$12.2 trillion he has proposed to expend over the next 7 years.\n  I want the Senate and the people to know that this is not just a \nSenator speaking. There is a law about budgets. The law says in 31 \nU.S.C. 1105 that there are 31 specific requirements for a budget to be \na budget. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record for \nanyone who would like to peruse this, the 31 requirements of a budget.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Sec. 1105.

Mr. President, I submit, and my quick analysis is, that \nthe President has complied with none of them. Again, I repeat, if the \nPresident wanted to tell the American people he sent a vision statement \nup here, or if he wanted to say, ``I sent a sunshine brochure up \nhere''--it is in yellow and looks like sunshine--if he wanted to say \nthat, that is fine. But to suggest that he sent a budget up here is \nclearly, clearly, a statement without any ability behind the White \nHouse to prove it. There is no budget.\n  Why do I say this and why do I come to the floor? First, some are \nsaying, we should have a budget hearing on the budget. I say to my \nfriend--two are here on the Budget Committee--there is no budget to \nhave a hearing about. We could perhaps have a hearing about the \nnonbudget if some would like to have that.\n  Second, it is very easy to submit a budget with bulk numbers if you \ndo not have to tell the public what you are going to do, so that in all \nthe appropriated accounts, you do not have to tell them what you will \nspend money on and what you will not spend money on. It is another \neffort on the part of the White House to make everybody feel good and \nto make sure you feel good about the President's proposals because he \nhas not yet told you what he will and will not do.\n  I submitted the 31 requirements, and I merely ask the White House and \nthe President to submit a budget at the earliest possible time. I think \nthe public deserves it. I think we deserve it. Again, I say to the \nWhite House, you have not submitted one. We understand that perhaps \nthere is a lot of pressure this year and a shortage of time, but it \nwould have been better if you would not have told the public you \nsubmitted one when you did not. Make sure when you do submit one that \nit is a budget, and then we can have hearings on it and let the \nAmerican people know what is in it.\n  Mr. BOND.

We had the last budget, I guess it was called No. 5, that \npurported to reach balance by making somewhere between 90 and 95 \npercent of the cuts in appropriated accounts in the 6th and 7th years. \nI traveled around my State the last couple of weeks and asked how many \npeople believed the budget was honest if you said you would get to \nbalance by making all the cuts in the 6th and 7th years.

Let me move on to another item that was included in that \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995 that was vetoed by the President and that \nhas been addressed already today on the floor. That is a new farm bill.\n  During the last several days, when farmers and all the rest of us \ncame inside, I had the opportunity to talk to and hear from and answer \na lot of questions from farmers in my State. They said, ``Why don't we \nhave a farm bill?''\n  I said, simply, the President vetoed the first one and we were \nunsuccessful in getting the votes to end the filibuster.\n  They said, ``What are they filibustering?''\n  I said that is the difficult point. They do not have an alternative.\n  These people said, ``We cannot go back to the old farm bills. What \nare we going to do?''\n  I said, ``Well, we are going to try again to break the filibuster so \nthe farmers of America and the people who depend on and work with the \nagricultural sector will know what the ground rules are.''\n  These people who talk to me said, ``We want flexibility. It is a lot \nbetter for our land. It is a lot better for the environment. It is a \nlot better for us if we can rotate our crops and we are not locked in \nto planting corn to keep our corn base,'' or other crops in which they \nhave a base. They said, ``We need to be able to choose what is right \nfor our farming operation, our land, and what we think is best for the \nmarket.''\n  I said, ``Basically, that is the Freedom To Farm Act.''\n  I think the Leahy-Craig substitute amendment represents the \nopportunity that the people of America, certainly the farmers in my \nState, have been looking for: to move forward in a bipartisan way to \nshape policy on behalf of our Nation's farmers and consumers. The \nmodified freedom-to-farm legislation offers reform, opportunity, \nflexibility and predictability in a fiscally responsible way and with \nthe growing support of Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  I have said farmers in my State have supported the bill. We have \nreform groups, such as Citizens Against Government Waste, who support \nthis because it does save money. We have the Farm Bureau, corn growers, \nCotton Council, cattlemen, pork producers, and the many others who have \nalready been named by my colleagues who have spoken before. I concede \nwe do not have all of the fringe groups who are working to come up with \nsomething that fits their particular interest.\n  I know there is apprehension by some, simply because the reform \nmeasure represents change. But I will tell my colleagues, the young \nfarmers, the men and women who are going to be providing food and fiber \nfor the future are ready for change. They want to move away from \nfarming for the mailbox to farming for the marketplace. They want to be \nable to determine what is best for their operations and get their \nreturns from the marketplace.\n\n  We all know this reform package is the only show in town. There have \nbeen some good ideas. Others have come up with things. But there is \nsimply no consensus alternative that has been offered by those who are \nfilibustering. There is no constituency for these alternative ideas \nthat spring up and disappear. Neither producers nor farmers that I know \nof are supporting it.\n  I must say, I am deeply troubled by one proposal opponents have \noffered, which would cut farm payments by 60 percent. Some have said on \nthis floor that farmers have high prices, are making money, and having \nhigh income. Mr. President, my farmers are not in that situation. My \nfarmers have been hit by flood, by drought, by frost. They have no crop \nto sell in some instances. They are faced with a refund of last year's \nadvance deficiency payments.\n  It does not matter if the crops are bringing high prices if you do \nnot have anything to sell. Farmers want and deserve predictability, \nflexibility, and simplicity associated with a 7-year contract. A known \nstream of payments will provide certainty to farmers, lenders, and the \ntaxpaying public. It will promote security during difficult economic \ntimes, and I think farmers can manage a predictable income stream to \nmitigate economic risks better than Washington can.\n  I applaud Senator Dole, Senator Lugar, and Senator Leahy for bringing \nthis bipartisan approach together. We need the votes to end the \nfilibuster. I urge my colleagues to support the cloture motion.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in connection with the issue that is \nbefore \n\n[[Page S889]]\nthe Senate today, I hope Senators will be able to support the petition \nto invoke cloture so we can have a vote on the merits of amendments to \nand the farm bill itself, that will put in place a farm program for \nthis and later years. This farm bill that is being presented to the \nSenate, and which we will reach if we are able to invoke cloture today, \nis a compromise that has been developed to resolve the current impasse \nbetween the Congress and the administration about the content of farm \nlegislation.\n  As Senators remember, we included in the Balanced Budget Act the \nprovisions of farm legislation that would be in effect over the 7-year \nperiod that was covered by the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. The \nCongress passed that and sent it to the President and he vetoed it.\n\n  Because of that veto, we are now forced to go back and reexamine \nthose provisions relating to agriculture and to pull them out and put \nthem together in a freestanding bill so we can pass that legislation. \nIf we do not, laws that have been on the books since 1938--and 1949, in \nsome cases--will govern the agriculture programs that would be in place \nfor this crop year. These provisions are so out of date it is \nludicrous. The price support for wheat farmers would go up to about $7-\nsomething a bushel. In order to qualify, you would have had to have had \nallotments that were based on your planting experience prior to 1950.\n  It is unthinkable that this Congress is dragging its feet and making \nit difficult to enact farm legislation that would give producers of \nAmerican agriculture products the certainty of the laws that govern the \nplanting and the production of those crops. But that is what is \nhappening. It is a disgrace. We need to put a stop to it, and to put a \nstop to it we are going to have to vote for cloture to limit debate of \nthis issue so we can get to votes on the merits of amendments and the \nbill itself, and to pass the legislation, send it to the House, meet in \nconference, and get a bill to the President. This has to be done as \nsoon as possible.\n  Farmers are confronted right now with the inevitability of a planting \nseason that is here, whether we legislate it or not. We cannot slow \ndown the planting season by simply not enacting farm legislation. \nLenders are going to have to extend credit based on some idea of what \nthe returns will be in this production year for wheat and corn farmers \nand others who are covered by these laws.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will recognize our solemn responsibility \nto be fair with farmers and to undertake our obligation to legislate in \na serious manner and stop the partisan squabbling back and forth on who \nhas the better program, the Democrats or the Republicans. Forget it. \nThis bill before the Senate is a bipartisan substitute for the previous \nprovisions that were before the Senate last week when the Senate failed \nto invoke cloture, when only 53 Senators voted for cloture.\n  Now we have another chance. We need 60 Senators to vote to permit us \nto reach the amendments and then the merits of this bill. I urge \nSenators to look at the fact that we have made some fundamental changes \nto attract a large majority of support here in the Senate. There is a \nreauthorization of food and nutrition programs in this bill. There is a \nreauthorization of the Conservation Reserve Program in this bill. There \nare revisions and a reauthorization of a wetlands reserve program that \nhas support from many sectors of this country. And there are other \nprovisions--an authorization for a compact of New England States to \njoin together to provide for themselves a new dairy program. There are \nother items in this bill that reflect an effort to reach out and \nbroaden the base of support for this legislation. I hope Senators will \nvote for cloture so we can get on with the discussion of amendments and \nthe vote on final passage.\n  If Senators do not like some of these provisions, they can offer \namendments to them to strike them, and we can have up-or-down votes on \nthem. But let us get past this point in the debate and vote for cloture \non this bill.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to continue part of the discussion \nthat occurred earlier which was carried forward by the fine Senator \nfrom Iowa, Senator Grassley, and to a certain extent by Senator \nDomenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee, which involves the \nissue of where we stand in this whole budget process, because a very \nimportant fact has been confirmed.\n  About 6 months ago we on the Republican side said that the Medicare \ntrust fund was in serious trouble, that the senior citizens of this \ncountry were at risk for their health insurance because the Medicare \ntrust fund was going broke. Now, we did not arbitrarily come up with \nthat statement. We took that statement from the fact that the Medicare \ntrustees, three of whom are appointed by the President and serve in his \nCabinet, stated in their report of April 3, 1995, that the Medicare \ntrust fund was going to go broke in the year 2002 if something was not \ndone to fundamentally repair it. So we made the tough decisions of the \nparty. We stepped forward, and we made proposals which made the \nMedicare trust fund solvent. Our proposals were included in the \nBalanced Budget Act, which gave this country for the first time in 25 \nyears a balanced budget and which gave our senior citizens a solvent \nMedicare system.\n  What happened? The President of the United States and his legions \ndemagogued that act, claimed that we were attacking senior citizens, \nand used every scare tactic they could on senior citizens. The \nfundraising powerhouses here in Washington who scare seniors regularly \ngot their machines of paper cranked up and sent out letters to seniors \nacross this country representing that the Republicans were \nmisrepresenting what was happening with the Medicare trust fund and \nwere trying arbitrarily and inappropriately to take on the Medicare \ntrust fund, when, in fact, what we were proposing would bring solvency \nto the trust fund.\n  A couple of days ago, the chickens came home to roost for this \nadministration because now, not only do their trustees have a report \nfiled which says that the trust fund is going to go broke, we find that \nthe track for the trust fund to go broke, to go bankrupt, has been \naccelerated, and that it is unfortunately ahead of schedule.\n\n  A report by the Medicare trust fund actuary states, ``Things turned \nout a little worse than we expected. We had projected that 1997 would \nbe the first fiscal year with a deficit when, in fact, this year \nbecomes the first fiscal year with a deficit.''\n  What does that mean? That means, for the first time in the history of \nthe Medicare trust fund, since 1972, this will be the first year when \nmore money goes out of the trust fund than comes into the trust fund. \nThat is a bankruptcy spiral that we have begun.\n  I have a chart here which we have used before. It looks like a plane \ncrash. In fact, it is called the plane crash chart, which shows what is \nhappening with the Medicare trust fund. This chart assumed what the \ntrustees originally told us, which was the trust fund would go broke in \nthe year 2002, that it would start to run a deficit in the year 1997. \nWe have to change this chart now. The trust fund now has a track that \nis something like this. It goes to the negative this year, and \nsomewhere out here before the year 2002 it goes broke.\n  If this administration does not step up and stop demagoging the issue \nand scaring seniors, what they are going to deliver to seniors is a \ntrust fund that is broke.\n  What right does this administration have to abuse the senior citizens \nin this manner? What right do they have to stand in one room at one \nmicrophone and say, ``Republicans are harassing and inappropriately \nattacking the trust fund and Medicare,'' while at the same time the \nfacts show that, if a correction does not occur, the trust fund goes \nbroke?\n  A higher level of irresponsibility in managing this country and \nmanaging the finances and managing the future of our seniors probably \nhas not been seen in recent times than what has \n\n[[Page S890]]\nhappened over the issue of Medicare over the past 6 months as this \nadministration and this President specifically have consistently \nmisrepresented the Republican position and have failed to step up to \nthe plate to address what is a critical issue for seniors. Basically \nthis administration can no longer hide on the issue. The fact is their \ntrustees have said it is going to happen, and now their actuary has \nsaid it is not only going to happen, but it is happening. It is \nhappening in reality. We are now into a bankruptcy spiral in the \nMedicare trust fund.\n  So, Mr. President, I suggest you stop running for reelection and that \nyou sit down and do the job you are paid for, which is to come forward \nwith a proposal which puts the Medicare trust fund back in balance or, \nalternatively, accept ours.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your time.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to salute my colleague from \nMontana, Congressman Pat Williams.\n  Pat surprised all of us last month when he announced he would not \nseek his 10th term in the U.S. House of Representatives. Pat says he \nwants to get back to Montana to do a little fishing and hiking. Well, \nfew people know better than me what it is like to miss Montana, so his \nannoucement--although unexpected--was understandable.\n  Mr. President, it is no secret that Pat Williams and I come down on \nopposite sides of just about every issue. He is a New Deal liberal and \nproud of it. While I may not always like where he stands, at least I \nknow where he stands. I respect him for that and I think the people of \nMontana do too.\n  Despite the differences between us, I think there is a unique \ncivility in the Montana congressional delegation. Our debates over the \nyears have been passionate and heated, but I believe they have never \nbeen personal. Pat has been a worthy adversary during my 7 years in the \nU.S. Senate, and I will miss that relationship.\n  This does not mean that Pat and I were not able to come together on \nsome issues. In fact, when outsiders tried to impose there will on \nMontana, I would bet that Pat and I were on the same side more often \nthan not.\n  We both agree that fair trade does not always mean that our neighbors \nto the north can run roughshod over the Montana farmers and businesses. \nWe both agree that NAFTA and GATT are bad news for Montana. Any State \nthat is on the border feels the effect of that. We both agree that our \nNation's job-training programs need to be streamlined and consolidated. \nWe both agree in the need to repeal a federally mandated speed limit, \nof which my State caught a little criticism. And even though he \nsupported his President, he broke ranks with his Democrat colleagues by \nopposing the Brady bill and the President's crime bill.\n  So, Mr. President, I commend Pat for his service to my home State of \nMontana. In addition to his legislative duties, he has been a servant \nof our constituents. Montanans of all stripes could count on Pat to \nanswer their questions. They might not have liked the answers all of \nthe time, but he always answered them. And when they had problems with \nthe Federal Government, he was there, too. So for 18 years he has \ntraveled one of the largest congressional districts--both the western \ndistrict when he first came to Congress, and then, of course, the full \nState in the last two terms. So I think he will be missed by the State \nof Montana.\n  This kind of public service can take its toll on a person. Pat would \nshow up at countless meetings, and I can remember them. There might be \n5 or 500; it did not make any difference, Pat was always there.\n  So I wish him the best as he chooses retirement. If you come across \nhim fishing in one of our prized trout streams in Montana or hiking a \nscenic trail, I hope you tip your hat and say, ``Thanks, Pat, for a job \nwell done here in the House of Representatives of the U.S. Congress.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S890-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S890-S891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about the \nproblem before us; that is, trying to get a farm bill through this \nCongress. We are not very far away, even though the snowflakes are \nflying around us in the northern part of the hemisphere, it will be \nsoon that we will see the combines starting to roll in Texas. We are \njust finishing planting our spring wheat in Montana when the combines \nstart in Texas. We still do not have a farm bill or a farm policy.\n  A lot more people live in urban areas than farm, but it is pretty \nimportant to us in this country because the first obligation of any \nsociety is to feed itself. I have always made the speech that the \nsecond thing we do every day is eat. I do not know the first thing you \ndo. You have a lot of options the first thing in the morning, but the \nsecond thing is you eat. We do a pretty good job of it in this country, \nbut the main challenge for all of us, both in Government and in our \ncommodity groups that represent the livestock industry or the grain \nindustry or the fresh vegetable industry or the nut industry or the \nfruits and vegetables that are grown in this great and plentiful Nation \nis to make sure that we get at least a fair share of the consumer \ndollar back on the land.\n\n  Would it surprise you to know that only 3 cents out of every consumer \ndollar spent for food is all that gets back to the farmer? We are to \nthe point where we cannot hardly make it on 3 cents out of every \ndollar. There is a little imbalance here--$3.46 a pound for Wheaties in \nthe grocery store, and up until this year we were having a hard time \ngetting $3.46 for a bushel of wheat of which there is 60 pounds. I have \na hard time relating $5 T-bone steaks to $60 fat cattle. Maybe I am in \nthe wrong business, or I understand the other business, but it is about \ntime our processors, purveyors, our distributors, and our retailers \nunderstand that we have to give something back to the man who produces \nthe raw product.\n  There are a lot of automobiles and a lot of boats and a lot of \nvacations that are paid for because we only expend about 16 percent of \nour expendable income on food in our homes to feed this society. We are \ntruly a blessed Nation, but we still need policy for food and fiber in \nthis country. And, of course, with 1 farmer feeding 120 other folks \nboth in this country and abroad, it makes it a very large industry. \nThis bill changes the direction and the culture of farm programs.\n  In the Freedom to Farm Act, yes, there are some areas I would like to \nchange. Nobody ever gets a perfect bill. But nonetheless, we have to \ntake a look at it and see what it really does, if it gives our business \npeople who live on our farms and ranches the flexibility to operate \ntheir farms and ranches the way they think they should and also at a \nprofitable level.\n  I know if I had to go back to agriculture, where I was raised--on 160 \nacres of 2 parts rock and and 1 part dirt in northwest Missouri--I \nprobably could not make a living now, but I know some people are trying \nto and it is a struggle. This particular bill helps out those folks. It \nmoves us into a marketing mode and takes us away from a program that is \ndependent on the Government. We are not going to take the full step all \nat once. And to my critics who say this does not go far enough to \neliminate guaranteed subsidies to agriculture, I say we have to take it \nmaybe one step at a time. At least let us change the structure. Let us \nchange the structure in which our farmers and ranches can operate and \nstill provide food and fiber for this Nation.\n  Foreign market development is a good investment just like education \nis a good investment. As for ARS, the Agriculture Research Service, I \nhappen to think we must never stop doing research in food production. \nMaybe a lot of folks do not know this either, but for the first time in \nthe history of agriculture production in this country yields of wheat \nare declining just a little bit. Why? Because we do not have the plant \nbreeders and the scientists \n\n[[Page S891]]\ndeveloping strains that are disease resistant. We have to continue to \ndo that in order to keep our production up. The same thing is true in \nour corn, soybeans, barley, and some other feedgrains. So we need to \nmake that investment in the Agriculture Research Service.\n  The Export Enhancement Program, I am not a great fan of that, but it \nis retained in this bill. That is to ward off unfair competition in the \ninternational market. I think those dollars ought to go directly to the \npeople who produce the grain, not the people who handle the grain or \nthe big grain companies. It should get back to the farmer some way or \nother.\n\n  So, no, it is not a perfect bill. On the conservation end of it, the \nCRP is very successful, taking marginal land out of production, the \ndevelopment of wetlands. I know in Montana our bird population, our \nwildlife numbers have increased since CRP, the Conservation Reserve \nProgram, has been put into effect. That is very good in taking some \nmarginal land out of production that should never have been in \nproduction in the first place. We have noticed that. It has great \nsupport.\n  So here is a program that is supported by agriculture. Farmers are \ntelling me, ``Let's go with it.'' It sends us in a new direction. But \nwe are also talking about a time when agriculture commodities are doing \nvery well with the exception of the cattle business. And there is some \nroom for development here in our part of the country.\n  So I urge a ``yes'' on this cloture vote. Let us proceed with this \nbill and debate it like it should be debated and pass those programs \nthat can be passed, but let us at least give agriculture a program to \nwhich we can pin our future.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, the job of a news photographer is not an \neasy one. For every picture of a child enjoying building a snow man \nwith her parents--there is a picture of a crime scene or a picture of a \ncar wreck. Only the photographers themselves truly understand how tough \nthis job is, with the long hours and never knowing when or where they \nwill have to go to do their job.\n  I rise today to honor one of the best news photographers our country \nhas--Gene Fischer of the Helena Independent-Record--who retires today \nafter 35 years to the day of chronicling the lives of Helenans and \nMontanans on the front page and sports pages of our newspapers.\n  My home town is Helena. Gene is the type of hard-working Montanan I \nhave in mind when I say that we in public service need to focus on \nevery day folks who work hard to make a living and serve their \ncommunity. From his first job stuffing papers for the Billings Gazette \nin 1951, to his promotion to chief photographer for the Independent \nRecord in 1974--Gene has kept his nose to the grind stone and worked \nhard.\n  He has achieved goals and worked hard to become the best he can be. \nHis career and his drive are excellent examples for our children and \nstudents as they search for their mission and role in their lives.\n  It has become a popular thing to criticize the news media these days. \nWhether it be the hype of the O.J. Simpson trial, the goofy scandal-\nsheet shows, the Mc-News newspapers or hate-radio talk shows--I myself \nhave been critical and remain critical of certain folks in the so-\ncalled news media.\n  But Gene Fischer is a newsman like few in the journalism and news \nindustry of today. He is solid. He is compassionate. And he understands \nthat the picture he takes and the images he publishes are those of his \nneighbors, friends, and family. It is a tough job, and he does it \nfairly and professionally.\n  When a Gene Fischer photograph publishes in the Helena Independent \nRecord, Gene's name is very small--printed at the very bottom, almost \nunreadable. But in Montana journalism, Gene Fischer is a giant name. \nAnd I thank him for his years of dedication and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S891-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HONORING THE WEISS' FOR CELEBRATING THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, these are trying times for the family in \nAmerica. Unfortunately, too many broken homes have become part of our \nnational culture. It is tragic that nearly half of all couples married \ntoday will see their union dissolve into divorce. The effects of \ndivorce on families and particularly the children of broken families \nare devastating. In such an era, I believe it is both instructive and \nimportant to honor those who have taken the commitment of ``til death \nus do part'' seriously and have successfully demonstrated the timeless \nprinciples of love, honor, and fidelity, to build a strong family. \nThese qualities make our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Donald and Mattie \nBell Weiss who on January 20 celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary \nand will renew their wedding vows. My wife, Janet, and I look forward \nto the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. Don and Mattie's \ncommitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to \nbe saluted and recognized. I wish them and their family all the best as \nthey celebrate this substantial marker on their journey together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S891-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S891-S894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AMERICA'S WORKFORCE IN THE 21ST CENTURY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Markley Roberts, the Assistant Director of \nthe Economic Research Department of the American Federation of Labor \nand Congress of Industrial Organizations, recently gave the last of the \n1995 Benedum Lectures on the subject ``America's Workforce in the 21st \nCentury'' at West Virginia University.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of his remarks, along with \nbiographical material, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Remarks by Markley Roberts, Assistant Director of Economic Research, \n    AFL-CIO, in the 1995 Benedum Lecture Series, University of West \n         Virginia, Morgantown, West Virginia--December 6, 1995\n\n\n                  american workers in the 21st century\n\n       I appreciate this opportunity to talk with you about \n     American workers in the 21st Century. I bring to this \n     discussion 40 years as a union member, elected union officer, \n     and speaker for the AFL-CIO, a federation of 79 unions \n     representing 13 million workers. So it's obvious that I have \n     pro-worker, pro-union instincts.\n       We all share a common concern for political democracy, even \n     though we may have differing views on how political democracy \n     should affect social and economic justice. I hope you share \n     these concerns, and also my concern for human rights and \n     human welfare generally, as well as worker rights and \n     workers' welfare.\n       We are blessed in the United States of America with \n     wonderful traditions of freedom, democracy, and a drive for \n     justice. Let me assure you that I appreciate what we have in \n     America--but there's no resting place, there's no stopping \n     the endless search for freedom, democracy, and justice, no \n     stopping the endless battle against injustice.\n       It's not easy to define justice. I envy the judge who said \n     ``I can't define pornography, but I know it when I see it.'' \n     Well, you have to look at a lot of pornography to know it \n     when you see it--and you have to look at a lot of injustice--\n     political, economic, and social injustice--so you can \n     recognize justice when you see it.\n\n\n                        labor force projections\n\n       Our search for justice is endless because America is always \n     changing. The racial \n\n[[Page S892]]\n     make-up of our population and our labor force is changing. Diversity, \n     civil rights, and equal opportunity are continuing challenges \n     in our search for justice.\n       Let me lay out some projections on the American labor force \n     in the 21st Century.\n       Population growth, labor force participation, and \n     immigration are key factors in determining the size of our \n     labor force.\n       White, non-Hispanic people will be a smaller part of our \n     total population in the 21st Century (they have lower \n     fertility rates)--and blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Pacific \n     Islanders, and American Indians will have a bigger share of \n     America's population.\n       By the year 2005 our total labor force will be well over \n     150 million. This is men and women 16 years and older who are \n     working or looking for work.\n       Four out of five workers will be white--(82%).\n       One out of eight will be black--(12%).\n       One out of 16 will be Asian, Pacific Islander, or American \n     Indian--(6%).\n       One out of 9 workers will be Hispanic, (11%)--but Hispanics \n     also appear in white, black, and other categories.\n       The labor force participation of women has gone up so much \n     over the past 30 years that the numbers of men and women in \n     the labor force are already very nearly equal. But the Bureau \n     of Labor Statistics expects a continuing increase in women's \n     labor force participation (to 63%)--and a slight drop in \n     men's labor force participation (to 75%).\n       Immigration is a big question mark for the future. There is \n     now an unfortunate tendency to scapegoat legal as well as \n     illegal immigrants for some of America's economic and \n     social problems. There are proposals in Congress to cut \n     back legal immigration and to deny various benefits to \n     legal immigrants. My guess is that legal immigration will \n     drop from 800,000 a year now to about 600,000. No one \n     knows exactly how much illegal immigration there is. It \n     may be 1 million a year. But immigration--past, present, \n     and future--legal and illegal--will continue to add more \n     Hispanics and Asians to America's labor force.\n       The message I draw from all this--more women permanently in \n     the labor force, more diversified racial composition of the \n     labor force, continuing legal immigration----\n       Diversity and equal opportunity issues are here to stay in \n     the 21st Century--and they will continue to challenge our \n     sense of justice.\n\n\n                          where are the jobs?\n\n       A healthy economy and a healthy society should be creating \n     enough good-paying jobs for every American who needs a job \n     and wants to work. The Employment Act of 1946 and the \n     Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act of 1978 reflect \n     America's belief that the opportunity to work at a decent-\n     paying job is an important component of economic justice.\n       What jobs will be available in the 21st Century? Where are \n     the jobs going to be? Who will get available jobs?\n       Most of the new jobs are going to be in the service-\n     producing sector of the American economy. Already 70 percent \n     of jobs are in the service sector--but 95 percent of the new \n     jobs created in the next 15 or 20 years will be in the \n     service sector.\n       Most of the job creation will come in health care, business \n     services, retail trade, government, and FIRE (finance, \n     insurance, and real estate).\n       Goods-producing industries--manufacturing, mining, and \n     construction--will have no job growth. In fact, the Bureau of \n     Labor Statistics projects fewer and fewer jobs in coal \n     mining--in spite of growing foreign demand for coal from the \n     U.S.A.--Why so? Because technology and high productivity in \n     coal mining go up even faster than demand for coal is going \n     up.\n       The best jobs in the 21st Century--as in the 1990s--will be \n     the high-skill, high-pay jobs that require more and more \n     education and training. There will be more of these jobs. The \n     biggest rewards will go to the symbol analysts and symbol \n     manipulators, the people who can manipulate words and ideas \n     and computer systems and financial systems.\n       Does that sound like politicians, computer whiz kids and \n     Wall Street buccaneers? I think so.\n       Unfortunately, although the high-skill, high-pay, symbol \n     manipulator jobs have the fastest percentage growth, in fact \n     the biggest number of jobs opening up are low-skill, low-pay \n     jobs--janitors and cleaners, waiters and busboys, food \n     preparation jobs, security guards, nursing aides and \n     orderlies and other low-paid hospital and health service \n     workers.\n       Many of these janitors and security guards will have high \n     school diplomas and some will have college degrees because \n     they can't find higher-level, higher-pay jobs. It will take \n     more education and training to get a job--but there's no \n     guarantee it will be a high-level, high-pay job.\n       Unfortunately, it is a polarized occupational distribution \n     that is developing--more high-skill, high-pay, professional \n     jobs at the top--but many more low-skill, low-pay jobs at the \n     bottom, and fewer and fewer middle-range, middle-class jobs--\n     jobs which have been a solid foundation for a mass production \n     economy based on widely dispersed mass buying power, the \n     foundation for a stable middle-class society, the foundation \n     for a stable democratic political system.\n       Polarization in our distribution of job skills and \n     polarization in earnings from work will continue to challenge \n     our sense of justice in the 21st Century.\n\n\n                              unemployment\n\n       Some years ago Dr. Harvey Brenner of the Johns Hopkins \n     School of Public Health did a very scholarly study which \n     showed that increases in unemployment have a clear negative \n     effect on workers and their families and on local \n     communities--more murders, more suicides, more heart \n     ailments, more mental illness, more drug abuse, more family \n     violence, more family breakdown, more community crime. (1% \n     UE, 2% heart, 5.6% homicide)\n       Unemployment is a personal tragedy, a human tragedy for the \n     workers without a job and for their families. Most workers \n     are paying on a mortgage, paying on a car, paying for their \n     children's dental care, paying for food on the table. When \n     they lose their jobs, they often lose also their medical care \n     plan and their pension rights. This violates our sense of \n     justice.\n       The human costs of unemployment are huge. It's almost \n     impossible to quantify the human costs and human hardship. \n     That's why I am so grateful for Dr. Brenner's study. But the \n     economic costs are also huge. Economists have estimated \n     unemployment costs at hundreds of billions of dollars, the \n     difference between actual output and potential output. The \n     Congressional Budget Office has estimated that each 1 percent \n     of unemployment costs the American economy $150 billion--$100 \n     billion in lost output and another $50 billion in extra costs \n     of unemployment compensation and welfare payments. And this \n     does not take into account the extra health and crime costs \n     that Harvey Brenner found.\n       Economists often distinguish different kinds of \n     unemployment: frictional unemployment when you are just \n     between jobs; seasonal unemployment related to the time of \n     year; cyclical unemployment related to ups and downs of the \n     business cycle; and structural unemployment related to such \n     problems as changing technology, changing education \n     requirements, discrimination based on age, race, sex; and \n     trade policies that wipe out American jobs.\n       Whatever the reasons for unemployment--and there are many \n     of them--the key policy-makers in the American economy seem \n     to be tolerating higher and higher levels of unemployment. A \n     misguided and excessive fear of inflation lies behind the \n     powerful economic judgments and decisions of the banker-\n     dominated Federal Reserve Board which makes key decisions on \n     interest rates and money supply. Inflation is not the \n     problem. It's the Federal Reserve that's the problem.\n       The Federal Reserve wrongly operates on the discredited \n     theory that there is some ``natural rate of unemployment'' \n     and if unemployment goes below the so-called ``natural rate'' \n     then inflation will mess up the economy. This is [a] wrong \n     view of how the American economy operates, and it deserves a \n     thorough critique--but I am going to spare you what is a very \n     abstract, abstruse argument and simply say that there are \n     some very distinguished economists--including Nobel prize-\n     winners James Tobin and Robert Solow--who disagree with the \n     theory of a ``natural rate of unemployment.''\n       Unfortunately, unless we have a major, catastrophic \n     economic breakdown, the anti-inflation zealots at the Federal \n     Reserve will continue to use their money-and-interest-rate \n     power to hold back job-creating economic growth. Why so? \n     Because the general public and most political leaders don't \n     understand monetary policy--and because the banker interests \n     that dominate the Federal Reserve are more concerned about \n     having a stable dollar than they are about having full \n     employment.\n       This violates my sense of justice--even if it doesn't \n     bother the bankers.\n\n\n                           workers in poverty\n\n       Poverty in America is another challenge to our sense of \n     justice. Michael Harrington and Hubert Humphrey deserve a lot \n     of credit for awakening America's conscience on poverty. \n     Humphrey gave an education to Jack Kennedy in West Virginia's \n     1960 primary campaign and laid the groundwork for Lyndon \n     Johnson's War on Poverty.\n       But poverty is still here. Most poverty is related to \n     unemployment and low wages. We have in the United States \n     almost 40 million Americans in poverty, about 15 percent of \n     the population. That's one out of seven Americans living in \n     poverty--and one out of every five children in America lives \n     in poverty.\n       Unemployment compensation and welfare payments are part of \n     the social safety net system that we have put together to \n     protect Americans who need help--but training and decent-pay \n     jobs are also necessary. The so-called welfare reform bills \n     now before Congress will do little or nothing to relieve \n     poverty--and may even increase poverty by forcing more and \n     more welfare recipients into low-wage labor markets where \n     they will drive down [the] wages and earnings of America's \n     working poor.\n       Census figures show 10 million working poor--people who \n     work at least part of the year, but cannot find full-time, \n     year-round work to lift themselves and their families out of \n     poverty.\n       But what I find even more outrageous is the fact that two-\n     and-half million Americans work full-time year-round at such \n     low wages that they still cannot pull their families up out \n     of poverty. This is a powerful argument for raising and \n     indexing the minimum wage.\n       Raising the minimum wage helps reduce poverty. So do \n     employment and training programs, Medicaid, food stamps, the \n     Earned Income Tax Credit, and other safety-net programs that \n     help low-income people and many \n\n[[Page S893]]\n     middle-income people. But I remind you--in a non-partisan way--that the \n     Republican-dominated Congress is cutting and killing most of \n     these programs that help poor people rise up out of \n     poverty.\n       Is this social or economic justice? I think not.\n       The result of these slash-and-burn tactics is that poverty \n     will remain a challenge to our sense of justice well into the \n     21st Century.\n\n\n                    inequality in income and wealth\n\n       Let me turn now to America's widening gaps in income and \n     wealth. The rich are getting richer. The poor are getting \n     poorer. And our middle class is getting smaller. Is this \n     economic justice?\n       The richest 5 percent of America's families got real income \n     gains of 40 percent between 1979 and 1993. Families in the \n     middle lost 2.6 percent in real income--and the poorest 20 \n     percent of American families lost 15 percent in real income.\n       This is not news. You can read about it in Time or \n     Newsweek, in Forbes, Fortune, or Business Week. It is the \n     subject of concerned editorials, especially now that Congress \n     is cutting programs that help middle-class and low-income \n     people and preparing to heap $240 billion in tax cuts on rich \n     folks and big corporations.\n       The distribution of wealth is even more unequal than the \n     distribution of income--and it has become more unequal in the \n     last 15 years. The top 1 percent, the richest in the country, \n     own 40 percent of all wealth and 50 percent of all financial \n     wealth in the United States. For most of us, our biggest \n     wealth holding is in our home--but for the top 1 percent most \n     of their wealth is in stocks and bonds.\n       Between 1983 and 1989, the richest 1 percent got more than \n     60 percent of the nation's entire increase in financial \n     wealth--and between 1989 and 1992 the top 1 percent got 68 \n     percent of the nation's increase in financial wealth.\n       In fact, America has never been an egalitarian society--but \n     the last 15 years have produced more and more economic, \n     social, and political polarization--polarization that will \n     bring social and political troubles in the 21st Century.\n       Is this economic justice? I think not.\n\n\n                           big business power\n\n       Let me turn to big business. Americans are ambivalent about \n     big business. We want the benefits of bigness--but we are \n     right to fear the concentration of economic power.\n       It's no secret that the decisions of giant multinational \n     corporations and big banks dominate huge sectors of the \n     American economy, dominate much of our politics, dominate \n     much of economic policy-making.\n       If you take the top 10 companies in banking, energy, \n     manufacturing, telecommunications, retail and service, or \n     transportation, you will find a tremendous concentration of \n     economic power--and a lot of overlapping, interlocking \n     controls through banks and board of directors.\n       Big business decisions affect the nation's prosperity and \n     the jobs and earnings and living standards of all Americans--\n     but there's little or no accountability to the general \n     public.\n       The Mine Workers learned this in their fight with Pittston. \n     The Steelworkers learned this in their fight with Ravenswood. \n     And thousands of laid-off bank workers learned this after the \n     Chase-Chemical bank merger.\n       Is this economic justice?\n       Suppose your employer decides to be lean and mean, to \n     downsize and layoff workers or shift production from West \n     Virginia to Mississippi--or to Mexico. Unless you have a \n     union to represent you there's not much you can do about it. \n     When Congress passed the WARN law requiring 60 days advance \n     notice of plant closing, big business fought tooth-and-nail \n     to get weakening loopholes in the law--even though some of \n     those same companies have union contracts requiring even more \n     advance notice.\n       Top executive pay in big corporations is out-of-sight to \n     the average American worker. Business Week reports these top \n     executives averaged $3 million last year--120 times the \n     $25,000 earned by the average factory worker--and often \n     executive pay raises bear no relation to company profits.\n       Is this economic justice? Do we want the American economy, \n     American society, and American politics in the 21st Century \n     to be so heavily dominated by unaccountable, overpaid \n     corporate executives who are out of touch with the hopes and \n     fears and living standards of average American families. I \n     think not.\n\n\n                       unions in the 21st century\n\n       I turn now to the role of American labor unions in the 21st \n     Century. With or without labor law reform, unions are here to \n     stay because they meet a basic human need, the need to \n     participate in the decisions that shape your life and your \n     future, the need to have justice on the job.\n       That's why almost all union-management agreements require \n     fair treatment on pay and benefits and job security, and due \n     process for grievances, including outside arbitration.\n       Our national labor policy is supposed to guarantee working \n     men and women the right to organize and the right to bargain \n     collectively so that workers, acting through freely chosen, \n     independent labor unions, can jointly negotiate the terms and \n     conditions of their employment.\n       This is the way we achieve some degree of democracy in the \n     workplace. This is the way we have built up a system of \n     industrial jurisprudence, a way of making labor-management \n     relations more civilized.\n       Unfortunately, the reality too often is that these basic \n     worker rights are violated by anti-union employers determined \n     to thwart workers' efforts to form a union and bargain \n     collectively.\n       The business of union-busting--and it is big business--is a \n     major part of the explanation for the decline of union \n     membership in the U.S.A. from a 1955 high of 35 percent of \n     the labor force to the current rate of 16 or 17 percent.\n       There are additional reasons, of course. Trade policy and \n     imports have decimated union jobs in manufacturing. The big \n     increase of jobs has been in state and local government and \n     in the hard-to-organize service-sector industries. John \n     Sweeney, the new President of the AFL-CIO, was formerly \n     President of the fast-expanding Service Employees Union, so I \n     expect a heavy emphasis in the future on Union organizing in \n     the service sector and growth of white-collar and pink-\n     collar unionism.\n       Why do I expect unions to grow in the 21st Century? One \n     reason is what I have described as the human need to \n     participate in the decisions that shape your working life. I \n     see this as a basic human right.\n       Also, with more and more women and minorities and older \n     workers there will be more and more need for on-the-job quick \n     response to discrimination and harassment based on sex, age, \n     and race. A union in the workplace can help defend workers \n     with this quick response.\n       Most important, perhaps, is the self-interest of \n     enlightened employers who will empower their workers and \n     enlist their unions in raising quality, raising efficiency \n     and productivity, lowering costs, and raising profits.\n       The first and foremost role of unions in the U.S.A. is to \n     represent their members in bargaining with management for \n     better wages and working conditions. To many people this \n     looks like an adversary relationship between unions and \n     management, and in some respects it is just that during the \n     negotiation of a contract as unions try to get more for the \n     workers.\n       But most contracts run for two to three years. During the \n     life of the contract, the union will be protecting its \n     members from arbitrary or unfair actions by management, \n     protecting the safety and health of workers--but the job \n     security and economic security of the workers depends on the \n     employer's profitability and continued existence.\n       That's why you find more and more enlightened employers and \n     unions working together in joint labor-management committees \n     in a wide variety of worker training and ``mutual gain'' \n     productivity-raising programs, with more and more emphasis on \n     restructuring work and empowering workers to participate in \n     the decisions that affect their working lives and affect \n     profitability of the employer.\n       Co-operation of this kind is not a one-way street. It \n     depends on trust and mutual commitment. Management cannot \n     attack unions and expect co-operation.\n       Many management people feel threatened by the idea of \n     giving workers more information about company production and \n     financial affairs. They feel threatened by shared decision-\n     making. But there's a lot of evidence that ``empowering \n     workers'' not only increases democracy in the workplace--it \n     also raises workers' commitment and motivation, raises \n     quality of the product or service, raises efficiency, \n     productivity, and profits.\n       Justice on the job includes a unionized workplace--and a \n     unionized workplace can raise productivity and profits.\n\n\n                      politics in the 21st Century\n\n       I suggested earlier that big business dominates the \n     democratic political process in America, but that's only a \n     partial truth. In addition to the big money of big business, \n     in addition to our two major political parties, we have a lot \n     of political activity by organized labor at the local, state, \n     and national level.\n       I want to pay my respects here to one of labor's most \n     respected, most effective leaders, Joe Powell, President of \n     the West Virginia AFL-CIO Labor Federation. I have know him \n     for many years. He is a tower of strength in America's \n     labor movement.\n       The labor movement can never come close to matching the \n     huge flow of political money from big business disguised as \n     personal contributions from business executives and their \n     spouses and children. But fortunately we have among our 13 \n     million union members thousands and thousands of political \n     activists who distribute voting records, who punch doorbells \n     to get out the vote, who are committed to the democratic \n     process, who are committed to bringing more democracy and \n     more justice to America.\n       Unions and union members will be there in the 21st Century, \n     pushing for democracy and justice in city and county \n     councils, in the halls of the state legislatures and in the \n     halls of Congress.\n       And unions and union workers will be there in the 21st \n     Century at the ballot box, at the bargaining table and in the \n     workplace, pushing for justice on the job and for more \n     justice in all aspects of American life.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      Biography of Markley Roberts\n\n       Markley Roberts is a distinguished economist at the ALF-CIO \n     labor union federation with a long list of professional \n     accomplishments and publications.

Mr. President, today was a very special day at the Senate \nRepublican policy lunch, as we spoke with President Reagan on the \nphone, and wished him a very happy 85th birthday.\n  Last week, the Senate passed a resolution paying tribute to President \nReagan on this occasion, and I have seen a variety of other salutes in \nrecent newspapers.\n  One of the best of these was written by long time White House \ncorrespondent Trude Feldman, and is published in today's Wall Street \nJournal.\n  Trude first met Ronald Reagan when, as the then-president of the \nScreen Actors Guild, he signed her SAG card. She also covered the \nReagan presidency, as she has so many others. And her portrait of him \nis rich in personal recollections and fond memories. In short, it \ncaptures the essence of this remarkable man.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article by Trude \nFeldman be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From The Wall Street Journal, Feb. 5, 1996]\n\n                Ronald Reagan at 85: A Birthday Tribute\n\n                         (By Trude B. Feldman)\n\n       Tomorrow Ronald Reagan celebrates his 85th birthday, thus \n     becoming the fifth American president to reach that \n     milestone. ``The anniversaries of my birth aren't \n     important,'' he once told me. ``What is important is that \n     I've tried to lead a meaningful life, and I think I have.''\n       The meaning of his extraordinary life goes beyond his \n     various achievements as our 40th president. Those \n     achievements would not have been possible were it not for a \n     moral fiber and affability that most Americans expect but \n     seldom get from their presidents. While Ronald Reagan's \n     ethics and principles played a major role in his efforts to \n     balance economic growth with true human needs, his courage \n     and steadfast convictions helped set a new, positive \n     direction for America--lifting it from a feeling of \n     discouragement, and giving the people renewed confidence and \n     pride in their nation. His commitment also served as the \n     necessary catalyst in developments that led to the end of the \n     Cold War.\n       In an era of cynicism about the character and veracity of \n     political leaders, Mr. Reagan's integrity and vision warrant \n     particular attention on this, the 85th anniversary of his \n     birth.\n\n\n                       the ``great communicator''\n\n       His courage as the ``Great Communicator'' was evident in \n     his dramatic open letter 15 months ago in which he revealed \n     that he had been diagnosed with the early stages of \n     Alzheimer's disease. His handwritten letter was poignant, and \n     vintage Reagan. Afflicted with the irreversible neurological \n     disorder, he wrote that ``In sharing the news, it might \n     promote greater awareness of this condition. . . I intend to \n     live the remainder of the years God gives me, doing the \n     things I've always done. I now begin the journey that will \n     lead me into the sunset of my life.''\n       Colin Powell is among the millions who were moved by Mr. \n     Reagan's gesture. ``It was a beautiful personal letter to \n     everyone,'' Gen. Powell told me. ``Frankly, that action made \n     it easier for me to deal with my wife's depression when it \n     became public.''\n       During a conversation I had with Ronald Reagan last year, \n     he wondered aloud whether he had inherited the illness from \n     his mother. Alzheimer's may have somewhat diminished his \n     spark, but Mr. Reagan's genuineness and charisma still shine \n     through. Away from the Oval Office for seven years now, he \n     still looks presidential. Routinely working in his office, he \n     continues to captivate visitors with his inimitable \n     personality and attentiveness.\n       His dark brown hair is now tinged with a bit of gray, and \n     he remains the model of good grooming and fashion. One day \n     last week, he was his old handsome self attired in a blue \n     pinstripe suit and blue tie, accentuated by a gold tie clip \n     in the shape of the state of California, where he served \n     eight years as governor. ``The reason I'm doing as well as I \n     am,'' he says, ``is because of loving support from Nancy [his \n     wife of 44 years]. She is my comfort, and has enhanced my \n     life just by being a part of it. She has made it so natural \n     for us to be as one that we never face anything alone.''\n       Mr. Reagan's close brush with death 15 years ago changed \n     his attitude toward life and death. It was on his 69th day as \n     president when, from a distance of 13 feet, I saw him shot by \n     a would-be assassin. Mr. Reagan told me the traumatic \n     experience had given him a greater appreciation of life that \n     he had previously taken for granted. ``My survival was a \n     miracle,'' he said. ``The ordeal strengthened my belief in \n     God and made me realize anew that His hand was on my \n     shoulder, that He has the say-so over my life. I often feel \n     as though I'm living on the extra time God has given me.\n       When Ronald Wilson Reagan was born in Tampico, Ill., his \n     delivery was so complicated that his mother was cautioned not \n     to bear more children. So she doted on him and soon became \n     the primary influence in his life. From her, he acquired the \n     stability and confidence that later enabled him to weather \n     personal and political storms with equanimity. She fostered \n     in him and his brother an incentive to work hard, and to live \n     by the Ten Commandments and by the Golden Rule.\n       ``My parents were rich in their love and wisdom, and \n     endowed us with spiritual strength and the confidence that \n     comes with a parent's affection and guidance,'' the former \n     president told me. ``The Reagans of Illinois had little in \n     material terms, but we were emotionally healthy.''\n       The Rev. Billy Graham describes Ronald Reagan as a man of \n     compassion and devotion, a president whom America will \n     remember with pride. ``He is one of the cleanest, most moral \n     and spiritual men I know,'' Mr. Graham told me. ``In the \n     scores of times we were together, he has always wanted to \n     talk about spiritual things.''\n       On many occasions over the past 21 years, Mr. Reagan shared \n     with me his philosophies and his views on politics, foreign \n     affairs, religion and human nature. ``I believe that each \n     person is innately good,'' he observed. ``But those who act \n     immorally do so because they allow greed and ambition to \n     overtake their basic goodness.''\n       These beliefs, while the source of many of his greatest \n     triumphs, also set the stage for some of his disappointments. \n     One regret was that he did not demand greater accountability \n     from his staff--``especially those who abused their power \n     with arrogance.'' He acknowledged that the tendency not to \n     fire anyone had serious ramifications. ``For instance, any \n     errors in our dialogues with Iran resulted because some of my \n     subordinates exceeded their instructions without reporting \n     back to me,'' he stressed. ``When I read the Tower Commission \n     Report, it looked as if some staff members had taken off on \n     their own.''\n       Another issue that troubled him was the public perception \n     that he was prejudiced against minority groups and not \n     concerned about the poor. He maintains that he had fought for \n     legislation that would make welfare programs more effective. \n     ``My economic program was based on encouraging businessmen to \n     create more jobs and to better the conditions of their \n     employees,'' he noted. ``I think I succeeded.''\n       On the day before his presidency ended, Mr. Reagan granted \n     me his last interview in the Oval Office. He told me that the \n     saddest day of his eight-year tenure was on Oct. 23, 1983, \n     when 241 U.S. servicemen died in a terrorist bombing in \n     Beirut, Lebanon. ``To save our men from being killed by \n     snipers from private armies that were causing trouble in \n     Lebanon, it was decided to shelter them in a concrete-\n     reinforced building,'' he recalled. ``But no one foresaw that \n     a suicide driver with a truckload of explosives would drive \n     into the building and blow it up.''\n       At the close of that Oval Office interview, I asked him to \n     describe his presidency in one line. ``We won the Cold War,'' \n     he said without hesitation. ``That phrase didn't originate \n     with me, but I'll settle for it. What counts is that there is \n     an end to the Cold War, and I now feel justified in my theme \n     of `Peace Through Strength.' ''\n       Former President George Bush adds: ``Ronald Reagan's \n     foresight put us in a position to change our relationship \n     with the Soviet Union and to make it possible for the changes \n     that took place in Eastern Europe. And he certainly helped \n     bring democracy to our hemisphere.\n       Mr. Bush, having worked closely with Mr. Reagan as his vice \n     president, also told me: ``True, he was a man of principle on \n     the issues. But, even more than that, the American people \n     loved him for his genuine decency, his unfailing kindness and \n     his great sense of humor. He is a true believer in the \n     goodness of America.''\n     \n[[Page S895]]\n\n\n\n                            the finest gift\n\n       Edwin Meese III, former attorney general, notes that Mr. \n     Reagan's legacy to America continues to this day. ``Many are \n     calling the congressional leadership's agenda the Second \n     Reagan Revolution,'' he says. ``More importantly, Mr. Reagan \n     continues to inspire Americans of all ages to value the \n     patriotism and leadership which he so splendidly \n     demonstrated.''\n       Longtime Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger concurs, adding: \n     ``History will surely record that the finest birthday gift \n     already given to Mr. Reagan by Americans is a Republican \n     House and Senate that are determined to carry on the Reagan \n     Revolution.''\n       Yet Mr. Reagan says that the best birthday gift for him \n     this year would be that scientists receive the support they \n     need to find a treatment and a cure for Alzheimer's so that \n     others will be spared the anguish that the illness causes.\n       Ever the altruist, Ronald Reagan--even for his birthday \n     wish--places the welfare of others above his own. It is a \n     characteristic that has served him faithfully until now, and \n     is one that will sustain him on his ``journey into the \n     sunset'' of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S894-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today because I cannot in good \nconscience remain silent. As we all know, for many years, the Medicare \nboard of trustees has warned of the impending bankruptcy of the \nMedicare trust funds. Many in Congress and in the administration \ndismiss these annual warnings, preferring to spend blindly, counting on \na wish and a prayer for our children and grandchildren. They say they \ndo not believe that Medicare will really go bankrupt. They continue to \nsay this, despite all evidence to the contrary. They have accused those \nof us who want to save Medicare of destroying one of the most popular \nprograms in American history. But this time, Mr. President, history and \nthe hard data, prove them wrong.\n  The front page of yesterday's New York Times proclaimed: ``Shortfall \nPosted by Medicare Fund Two Years Early''. What that means is that--for \nthe first time in its history--Medicare spent more money than it took \nin through payroll taxes. Mr. President, those of us who have been \ntelling the truth about Medicare knew the situation was serious. But, \nthis article tells us that it is even worse than we knew. Experts had \npredicted in good faith that the Medicare trust fund would grow, but \ndespite their best efforts, they were off by nearly $5 billion. And we \nknow for certain that once the trust fund begins to lose money, it is \non a rapid path to depletion. Richard Foster, the Health Care Financing \nAdministration's chief actuary, is quoted as saying, ``Obviously, you \ncan't continue very long with a situation in which the expenditures of \nthe program are significantly greater than the income. * * * Once the \nassets of the trust fund are depleted, there is no way to pay all the \nbenefits that are due.'' Within less than six years, Mr. President, \nthere will be no money to pay for any hospital services, for any senior \ncitizen in this country. This is not expected to occur in the distant \nfuture. Again, this will happen within the next 6 years, perhaps even \nbefore the end of my Senate term.\n  There are no signs of improvement in the near future. Mr. Foster, \npoints out the causes of the shortfall: First, income to the trust fund \nthrough dedicated payroll taxes was less than expected; second, \nhospital admissions increased; third, patients were sicker; and fourth, \nhospitals filed claims more quickly. Projections are never going to be \nperfect, but the important thing is that most of the prediction error \nwas that Medicare spending grew faster than was projected. Without \nfundamental restructuring of the Medicare Program, bankruptcy is \ncertain, and increasingly swift.\n  The reaction of the Health Care Financing Administration in the past \nhas been to analyze and attempt to figure out the problem. Once again, \nthat has been HCFA's response to the latest reports. Historically, the \nFederal Government is far slower than the private sector to respond \nwith action to such problems. We must learn from the private sector \nabout the value of prudent and decisive action. The 1996 trustees \nreport is due out in less than 2 months. We cannot wait around for \nanother report that promises bankruptcy, meanwhile wringing our hands. \nMedicare must be restructured to build on the experience of the private \nsector. Proposals to reform the Medicare Program have been proposed in \nCongress for more than a decade. The key fundamental change was to \nallow Medicare beneficiaries a limited choice of private health plans--\nrestricted to federally qualified health maintenance organizations \n[HMOs]--thus by definition, omitting the many plans available today. \nYet, where available, these plans are delivering more health care \nbenefits and greater out of pocket protection to seniors and the \ndisabled than are available from the current Medicare Program.\n  I urge my colleagues and the American public to call for bipartisan \naction to preserve, protect and strengthen Medicare. Saving Medicare in \nthe short term--the next 10 years--should be the easy part. We must \nrevisit the issue as we prepare for the future and the enrollment of \nthe baby boomer generation. Changes must be made now to protect our \nseniors and the disabled. If we fail to act now, a much higher price \nwill eventually be paid by our children and grandchildren.\n  The irresponsible approach is to think of Medicare as a non-evolving \nprogram. It must keep pace with the times. It must be cost-effective \nand deliver quality care to our seniors and our disabled. Only \nfundamental restructuring of the Medicare Program offers stability for \nthe future. We must not fall back on the traditional approach of \nraising payroll taxes and ratcheting down provider fees. We must \nreintroduce the private sector principles into this public program. \nRestructuring does not result in a fundamental dismantling of the \nprogram. Rather, it offers beneficiaries the same choice of high \nquality health care available to younger Americans. It offers greater \nout-of-pocket protection, more choice of benefits and services and \ngreater continuity of care. It brings Medicare from a pretty good \nprogram based on the 1965 health care market to a great program ready \nto meet the needs of the next century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S895-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S895-S897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                A CELEBRATION OF THE LIFE OF ERNIE BOYER\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on Sunday, January 21, 1996, over 500 \npeople from across the country and world, gathered at the Princeton \nUniversity Chapel in New Jersey to share their memories of one of the \ngiants of American education, Ernie Boyer, who died on December 8, \n1995.\n  Ernie was a great friend to me, and many others in Congress, and a \ngreat champion of education. Millions of people have better lives today \nbecause of Ernie. I believe that the tributes given at the memorial \nservice will be of interest to all of us in Congress, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the following remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                  Remarks by Senator Edward M. Kennedy\n\n       Ernie once said that ``knowledge has, without question, \n     become our most precious resource.'' He believed so strongly \n     in the value and importance of knowledge that he devoted his \n     life to searching for it, sharing it with others, and \n     summoning--and sometimes even shaming--the nation to \n     guarantee that more Americans have the opportunity to achieve \n     it.\n       Ernie began to quench his thirst of knowledge before most \n     children can drink from a glass. On his first day of school, \n     he walked \n\n[[Page S896]]\n     hand-in-hand with his mother. When they reached the school, he asked, \n     ``Will I learn to read today?''\n       ``No,'' his mother said, ``You won't learn to read today, \n     but you will before the year is out.''\n       But Ernie was vindicated a few moments later--because on \n     that first day of school, his teacher greeted her students by \n     saying, ``Good morning class, today we learn to read.''\n       Before he ever stepped into a classroom, Ernie understood \n     the urgency of obtaining an education. He mastered the art of \n     learning and embarked on a journey that has literally changed \n     the lives of millions of Americans.\n       He encouraged even the greatest centers of learning to \n     remember that teaching is important too--as important as \n     research. He counseled Congress about how to improve schools, \n     and he reminded us all to value good teaching. His \n     contributions to the art and science of the effective \n     transmission of learning were unsurpassed.\n       But he did not stop there. He wrestled with how best to \n     help all children come to school ready to learn. He never \n     forgot the difference it made to him that he arrived for his \n     first day of school ready to learn. And he tried to make \n     America see that difference too. If Ernie had his way, \n     everyone would have a good breakfast and a warm hand to hold \n     on their way to school.\n       More than anyone of his time, he taught us that it is \n     children, not just the schools, that should be the focus of \n     our concern--that education is a community-wide effort which \n     begins with the birth of a child--that supporting education \n     is, more than any other challenge, not an expenditure, but an \n     investment--that failure to act now will surely later mean \n     higher costs, wasted lives, promises unfulfilled.\n       If Paul Simon and Dick Riley and I and many others see \n     farther on these issues today, it is because we stand on the \n     shoulders of giants like Ernie Boyer.\n       Ernie believed that the knowledge he gained and continued \n     to gain himself was a call to the service of others. As he \n     once said, ``there's reason for optimism--if we can get the \n     right kind of leadership to help clarify and energize what is \n     still a huge public commitment to education.''\n       Ernie kept Congress on its toes. He was a constant \n     counselor and a dear friend to many of us. Long ago, those of \n     us who care about education wore out the tab in our address \n     books under ``B''.\n       Ernie's greatest gift to the nation was his unwavering \n     commitment to education and to keeping all children at the \n     heart of the nation's agenda. And when Ernie said all \n     children, he meant all children, so that none would be left \n     out or left behind.\n       Any time we planned a hearing on education in the Committee \n     on Labor and Human Resources and Ernie testified, he brought \n     a series of new ideas to improve schools and reach out to \n     children. He was the formative thinker behind the modern \n     movement for school reform.\n       He felt the most important thing we could do for very young \n     children was to create television shows that prepare them for \n     school. Ernie had the idea, and it was one of his best. We \n     turned it into legislation, and now there is strong support \n     for improved children's television.\n       He brought an endless fountain of creativity to American \n     life. His breadth of knowledge and depth of commitment to \n     education inspired awe, respect, and humility. In Ernie's \n     presence, we were learning from the master.\n       Ernie believed the pursuit of knowledge was a lifelong \n     journey of profound importance to the nation. As he once \n     wrote, ``commitment to education will help all students to be \n     involved in the civic future of the nation--to vote in \n     elections to serve on juries, to be concerned about the \n     health of their communities--to ensure that democracy will, \n     with vitality, succeed.''\n       Kay once told me that Ernie wished he could live to be 200, \n     because he had so many projects to complete. But he \n     accomplished more for the nation's students, parents, and \n     teachers, in his 67 years than anyone else could have done in \n     200 years. They may not know his name, but millions of \n     Americans, young and old, in every city, town, and village in \n     the nation have better lives today because of Ernie Boyer. To \n     all of us who know him and love him, he was the North, South, \n     East, and West of education. And now, education has lost its \n     best friend.\n       There is an old New England saying that all men are dust, \n     but some are dust of gold. That's the way I felt about Ernie \n     Boyer.\n       As the poet Stephen Spender wrote:\n     I think continually of those who were truly great . . .\n     The names of those who in their lives fought for life,\n     Who wore at their hearts the fire's centre.\n     Born of the sun, they travelled a short while towards the \n           sun,\n     And left the vivid air signed with their honour.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n        Remarks of Richard W. Riley, U.S. Secretary of Education\n\n       On behalf of President and Mrs. Clinton and the American \n     people, I want to extend to Kay Boyer, her children and \n     grandchildren the many thanks of this nation for giving us \n     Dr. Ernest L. Boyer--and my personal thanks for the honor of \n     speaking at this memorial service.\n       You family members knew and loved Ernie as a husband, \n     father and grandfather. We came to know, love and admire him \n     as a teacher, reformer and friend, a wonderful and cheerful \n     advocate of children and of the advancement of American \n     education.\n       Ernie was, in many ways, education's best friend. He had an \n     intellectual rigor about him and a wonderful capacity to \n     speak plain English. He moved people to act. He was unwilling \n     to accept mediocrity and his body of policy recommendations--\n     which span the waterfront--remain to this day the sturdy \n     foundation for our continuing efforts to improve American \n     education.\n       Ernie did many things for education.\n       He urged and prodded higher education to return teaching to \n     its primacy of place at the core of the college experience, \n     and he never let us forget the importance of service to the \n     learning experience.\n       He reminded us, with the wonderful support of his wife Kay, \n     that an unhealthy child could not be much of a learner.\n       Above all, he captured the imagination of countless parents \n     and teachers because he gave hope to the real possibility \n     that we could educate all of America's children.\n       Ernie was education's own ``Mr. Fix It.'' For Ernie \n     believed in solutions--believed that with hard work, a sense \n     of optimism and unlimited energy--all problems could be \n     solved if we stayed focused on the children.\n       Ernie once wrote that, ``America is losing sight of its \n     children.'' This must have been a difficult sentence for \n     Ernie to write because he never lost sight of the children. \n     And, that was one of his unique gifts--his tenacious capacity \n     to stay focused, to inspire everyone he came in contact with \n     to keep at it even when the task seemed daunting.\n       For Ernie, you see, believed in excellence and knew that \n     excellence and equity went hand in hand. He did not suggest \n     to you that the connection was easy to sustain. But he was \n     not daunted.\n       He told us to start early, to strengthen the connection \n     between parent and child. He urged us to fit our schools to \n     the needs of our children instead of the other way around. \n     And, then he went on to give us the blueprints for basic \n     schools of excellence and how to improve teaching--and how to \n     infuse the arts into education.\n       Ernie, with his energy, wisdom and passion, conveyed to us \n     the possibility that we could get the job done--that we could \n     raise standards and make America's schools, colleges and \n     universities bastions of hope, creativity and learning.\n       Ernie's mind, you see, never rested and he had an idea for \n     just about everything. Good ideas--solid ideas--forward \n     thinking ideas--positive solutions that made a difference. \n     Until his very last breath, Ernie was a worker. In a few \n     short weeks we will see the wisdom of another one of his good \n     ideas--how to reform the American high school.\n       His work on this plan defines for me not only his talent \n     and foresight but, more than anything else, his quiet \n     integrity. He could have produced, as so many have before, \n     one more scathing report about America's high schools--a \n     headline grabber, to be sure, but a report that would not \n     have helped anyone.\n       Instead, Doctor Boyer encouraged and supported the work of \n     this nation's high school principals and teachers in their \n     effort to find concrete examples of what is working and what \n     is not. He looked for solutions that challenged the very best \n     in each of us.\n       It seems fitting, then, to ask all of us what we will do to \n     carry on Ernie's legacy. This is not easy. For we are in \n     troubled times. Too often the debate about education is \n     distorted and driven to the limits of ideological certitude. \n     What seems missing is Ernie's capacity to listen and learn, \n     his spirit of generosity, and his enduring efforts to build \n     consensus around achievable goals rooted in the basic \n     principles of good education.\n       In many ways, the future of public education is at stake. \n     For there are some who would have us believe that public \n     education, as an institution, has outlived its usefulness. \n     They do not believe in its value, see no point in reforming \n     it, and quite literally seek to abolish it as an institution.\n       I am deeply troubled by this growing intellectual retreat \n     from the democratic spirit that has always defined American \n     public education at its best. And, I am sure that Ernie would \n     have none of it. For Ernie's life work was about building up \n     public education, not tearing it down. He was a leader by \n     example, positively engaging Americans to come together for \n     the good of the children. Today, we could use a lot more \n     Ernie Boyer's to help us move into our knowledge-based future \n     with confidence.\n       So I ask you to celebrate the good work of our friend Ernie \n     Boyer. We all have wonderful stories to share. Stories that \n     celebrate the joy of education and the generosity of Ernie's \n     spirit.\n       But when you go home, I urge each and everyone of you to \n     roll up your sleeves--to fight as Ernie would fight for \n     better public education--to stay focused on the essentials of \n     effective teaching and learning--to be high-minded, positive, \n     and even enthusiastic--but to get on with the job of making \n     Ernie's positive vision of education a reality for future \n     generations of children.\n       Thank you.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                          Stating the Obvious\n\n                         (By Ernest Boyer, Jr.)\n\n       It must be among the most elusive of all accomplishments--\n     public acclaim joined with private fulfillment, the respect \n     and esteem of colleagues and associates balanced \n\n[[Page S897]]\n     with the equally rich love and admiration of family and friends. This \n     is what my father achieved. Measured in terms of years, his \n     life seems all too short. But measured according to what he \n     managed to accomplish in those years not even ten lifetimes \n     seems sufficient to account for it at all. More significant, \n     though, to those of us who knew him as husband, father, \n     father-in-law, grandfather, brother, or uncle was his \n     extraordinary capacity for love. My mother likes to say that \n     he had been given an extra gift of love. It seemed so true. \n     This was not a love that called attention to itself or in \n     anyway placed expectations on those it sheltered. And it \n     certainly never sought to control or to direct, or to tell \n     others what was best. It was, rather, a love that could be so \n     unobtrusive, so quiet--and yet so intense--that it became \n     simply impossible to separate that love from the man who give \n     it. His was, then, a rare double talent--extraordinary public \n     accomplishments coupled with the even more extraordinary \n     personal qualities of a gentle but very warm humanity, an \n     unhesitating kindness, and an unqualified love.\n       It is, however, not on his accomplishments nor even on his \n     love which I wish to focus--not on his accomplishments \n     because there are so many others far more qualified than I to \n     speak of those, and not on his love because in the end there \n     is so little that can be said of it. It was in many ways so \n     much a part of his presence that for anyone who ever met him \n     no further explanation is necessary, and for those who never \n     had a chance to meet him, no explanation is really possible.\n       Instead, I would like to examine the one among his \n     qualities which, it seems to me, most fully links those \n     accomplishments together with that love. This was his wisdom. \n     Among the many things my father's life was for me, it became \n     eventually also a study of wisdom. Wisdom is not merely an \n     uncommon virtue. It is also a rather peculiar one. Contrary \n     to popular opinion wisdom has very little to do with \n     intelligence, for example. And although my father had a \n     brilliant mind, it was not from his intellect that his wisdom \n     came. Intelligence revels in complexity and in subtlety, both \n     of which can occasionally be helpful, but which just as often \n     can obscure and even confuse solutions. Complexity for its \n     own sake held no interest for my father. He preferred \n     simplicity, clarity.\n       No, this wisdom came from another place entirely, and as I \n     watched over the years I have come to more fully appreciate \n     the nature of wisdom itself. Wisdom, I have decided, is \n     nothing more and nothing less than the ability to state the \n     obvious.\n       Describing it this way may at first seem to cheapen it, to \n     dismiss it, or possibly to degrade it into something rather \n     ordinary. It does none of these. The fact is, the ability to \n     state the obvious is remarkably rare. It is rare in part, \n     because to do so requires its own manager of courage. It is \n     rare, too, because, strangely enough, the obvious is not \n     obvious to very many.\n       The courage that is required is the sort needed in the face \n     of the widespread belief that stating the obvious makes a \n     person appear uninformed, or naive, or even foolish. My \n     father was none of these, and so to state the obvious with \n     the consistency with which he did so demanded not only a \n     profound self-confidence but an even more profound conviction \n     that how he himself appeared was in the long run incidental \n     to the main task to be done, which was to make the world a \n     better place. One of the things he was fond of saying was, \n     ``First decide what is the right thing to do. Then figure \n     out how you are going to do it.'' He was convinced that \n     this process should never be reversed. You should never \n     let what you think you can do try to convince you what you \n     ought to do. Start with what is right and work from there. \n     And for my father, to say that you should start with what \n     is right was to state the obvious.\n       There were many other things similar.\n       It was also obvious to him, for example, that there is far, \n     far more that unifies all of us as human beings than that \n     separates us. There are differences, of course, but there are \n     no differences so significant that they cancel out the far \n     more basic needs and infinitely more important hopes that all \n     people share simply by the fact of being human. Nearly every \n     problem we have, he was convinced, is the result of \n     forgetting how much each of us has in common with everyone \n     else on this planet just as nearly every solution must start \n     with the reaffirmation of that fact. Thus it was that his \n     strongest impulse, an impulse that formed a cord that tied \n     together his entire career, was always to make connections. \n     He took it as his daily task to form bridges, bridges between \n     ideas, bridges between institutions, and most important of \n     all, bridges between people. He was persuaded that there \n     could be no greater responsibility for schools, for parents, \n     or for anyone else concerned with the future of the human \n     race than to teach children how much we all have in common \n     and how much depends on the recognition that we are all in \n     this together. For him, to say this was to state the obvious.\n       And simply because we all share so much, and because we are \n     all in this together, it was also obvious to him that no \n     voice should ever be ignored, and it was those least heard \n     that he was most inclined to notice. This was especially true \n     of children. All his life my father was preoccupied with \n     children. He was fully persuaded that children, simply as \n     children, had so much to offer the world. It was for him a \n     point of unwavering conviction that their voices, at least as \n     much as any one else's, had to be included as part of the \n     human solution. To him, it just seemed so obvious that this \n     should be so.\n       Finally, it was for him obvious too that everything we do \n     must contribute to a greater purpose. This meant in part \n     working on a day-to-day basis to make the world a better, \n     more just place, but it also meant for him quite a bit more \n     than that. Central to who my father was was his faith that no \n     matter what any of us do in the course of our lives, it can \n     only ever be but a tiny part of who we are and what we are to \n     become. Some weeks before he died my father said to me, \n     ``I've always known how important what we do here can be, but \n     recently I've come to see so plainly all the ways in which \n     what we do here can also become what I can only describe as \n     holy.'' He told me this as something that he regarded with \n     renewed appreciation but not with surprise. On one level \n     this, too, had always been obvious to him.\n       The thing is, though, that not all of this that was so \n     obvious to my father is equally obvious to everyone else.\n       In a 1978 interview my father said:\n       ``It takes constant awareness to see yourself in relation \n     to others, to see this moment in relation to a day or week or \n     a century, to see this planet in the universe, and to keep \n     rediscovering how important each moment is and, in a sense, \n     how fleeting and almost inconsequential in the broad sweep of \n     human history and divine plan.''\n       My only quarrel would be with the word ``inconsequential.'' \n     A life such as my father's shows just how consequential one \n     person's time on earth can be. We all lose when a voice such \n     as his is silenced. Wisdom such as he offered has grown all \n     too rare. It has even sometimes seemed to me that when my \n     father died wisdom itself died with him, since the only thing \n     obvious to me now is how much I miss him. And yet he himself \n     would have been the first to protest such a thought. He would \n     have pointed out that really nothing has changed: It is still \n     true that people have more uniting them then dividing them, \n     that no voice, least of all that of any child, can ever be \n     ignored, and, most especially, that all that we do is towards \n     a larger purpose.\n       These remain as obvious as they ever were, and obvious \n     especially to us now even if they are still not obvious to \n     all, because we had him to point them out to us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S895-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S897-S898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ERNIE BOYER: A SELF-EFFACING LEADER\n\n  Mr. SIMON.

You would have loved him.''\n  I am submitting the remarks made by several of us at the service and \nhope my colleagues will take the time to read what Ernie Boyer meant to \na lot of very different people.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Remarks By Senator Paul Simon\n\n       William Butler Yeats, the Irish poet and later an Irish \n     Senator, in the mid 1920s wrote in a poem: ``The best lack \n     conviction, while the worst are full of passionate \n     intensity.'' It sounds as if he is writing about today. But \n     Yeats did not know Ernie Boyer.\n       His quiet demeanor, his ready smile and marvelous laughter, \n     his soft response to a hostile question were not indications \n     that he lacked solid conviction. He had backbone and vision \n     and an understanding of humanity that combined to make him \n     superbly effective. The Albany Times Union editorial tribute \n     concluded with this accurate assessment: ``He touched \n     millions of ordinary lives and made them better.''\n       The last time I talked to him by telephone, he spoke from a \n     hospital bed, only I did not know it until after I read the \n     story of his death. He was that kind of self-effacing human \n     being.\n       While we knew each other for a period casually, I first got \n     to really know him when President Carter appointed the \n     Commission on Foreign Languages and International Education, \n     headed by Jim Perkins of this city. Most of us on the \n     Commission did not know each other. Ernie suggested a few \n     names, and the White House added some. It turned out to be \n     one of those rare commissions where everyone worked, and \n     worked together with a common purpose, on a small budget with \n     limited time, and the end result changed the educational \n     climate in our nation--slightly. But slight changes, like one \n     or two votes in the Senate, can ultimately make a huge \n     difference. Ernie Boyer played a key role in the work of that \n     Commission.\n       His work as Chancellor of the State University of New York \n     earned him what I am \n\n[[Page S898]]\n     sure were deserved laurels, but when he became United States \n     Commissioner of Education, then headed the Carnegie Endowment \n     for the Advancement of Teaching, he enriched the nation \n     immensely. In those positions he lifted all of us in ways \n     that never can be calculated fully.\n       Our friend attended Greenville College in Illinois, a small \n     liberal arts college, for his undergraduate work. Greenville \n     is sponsored by the Free Methodists. When he attended, female \n     students could not wear lipstick, and all students had to \n     take a pledge not to attend movies. The Free Methodists were \n     not too free.\n       But Ernie always felt gratitude to that school for the \n     opportunity it gave him. He learned to respect and understand \n     that part of our culture. From there he grew and reached out \n     across all the barriers of religion and race and ethnicity to \n     live a life of concern. He wanted a quality opportunity to be \n     the option for all in this nation and beyond this nation.\n       As we bid a formal farewell to the man, let us honor him by \n     not bidding a formal farewell to his ideas and his ideals. He \n     did not want a nation that has technically superb but useless \n     B-2 bombers and inner-city schools with no books in the \n     library and, too often, no hope in the classroom. He did not \n     want a nation eager to invest in more and grander prisons but \n     unwilling to invest in better schools. He did not want a \n     nation with great sensitivity to the whims of those of us who \n     are more fortunate economically but indifferent to the 24 \n     percent of our children who live in poverty. He did not \n     want a nation of scholars who can carry on great \n     discussions but are unable to carry out great dreams.\n       Ernie Boyer: gentleman, scholar, dreamer, doer.\n       May we be the same.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                       Remarks From Alicia Thomas\n\n       Dr. Ikenberry, Trustees of the Carnegie Foundation, members \n     of Dr. Boyer's family, friends of Dr. Boyer, distinguished \n     guests, ladies and gentlemen. It is my very great honor and \n     privilege today to speak on behalf of all the teachers, \n     students and principals in the Basic School Network. This has \n     been a time of great sadness for us all. We have lost a dear \n     friend. In the two years that we have worked together this \n     group has become very close, very united in our efforts to \n     improve schooling on behalf of this Nation's children. And so \n     for all of us there is a lot of affection, warm affection for \n     Dr. Boyer, much respect for him, and consequently a deep \n     sense of loss and a sense of absence that will always be with \n     those of us who had the privilege to learn from him, and to \n     engage in conversation and discussion. I think his voice and \n     his presence will always be missed, and we will never be \n     quite the same again.\n       But this is also a time of reflection on the richness of a \n     life, and the richness of a legacy. Of all the people I've \n     known, no one's life and legacy could have been richer than \n     Ernest Boyer's. His family was a great source of pride; four \n     wonderful children, grandchildren, a loyal and devoted wife. \n     But beyond family, Ernie Boyer's life was one of service. \n     Service to children, both in highly respected positions in \n     our Nation's government, and as President of the Carnegie \n     Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. His life was very \n     rich. He gave of himself, and in doing so earned the respect \n     and love of all, family, friends and colleagues, and most \n     especially, teachers.\n       To Ernest Boyer there was no nobler profession than \n     teaching. He spoke movingly of the great teachers in his \n     life, including the famed first grade teacher, Miss Rice. And \n     he moved each of us to work with renewed purpose and \n     inspiration, to commit our lives to practice in an exemplary \n     way. Dr. Boyer wanted the best and the brightest in teaching; \n     he wished for loving and supportive first teachers in order \n     that all children succeed. Dr. Boyer felt teachers were part \n     of the strength and solution for our Nation's schools; he \n     knew that a truly great teacher changes lives forever. The \n     teachers at Jackson-Keller said simply, ``He stood up for \n     schools; he stood up for us.'' Kindergarten teacher Kristen \n     Dreyer said ``I just loved it when he told me `you are doing \n     the Lord's work.' '' And so we are.\n       I can't forget to mention Dr. Boyer's wonderful sense of \n     humor. He so enjoyed the funny stories shared about teachers \n     and children. He would dance the chicken dance with a group \n     of second graders, listen intently as Kindergartners \n     explained their drawings, chortle with laughter as Third \n     grade teacher Suzann Westermann sang ``Nothing could be \n     sweller than to be at Jackson Keller.'' Ernie Boyer just \n     loved people, and he believed the best in them. It was the \n     people that linked him to schools. And at Jackson-Keller he \n     was as beloved by the Head Custodian as he was by the \n     children, parents, and teachers.\n       Danal Jimenez, J-K Fifth grader wrote ``If I can quote \n     Shakespeare, `Alas, I knew him well.' Personally, I feel the \n     loss. He came from Princeton and made me feel special when \n     two years ago he gave me his firm handshake, special note on \n     his business card and friendly words. He was like an instant \n     quick friend and I will never forget him. Did you know he \n     loved the arts?\n       Danal's friend Michael Navarro said, ``A few days ago, \n     Jackson-Keller lost a great friend, mentor and thinker. He \n     helped the Basic School exist. You say you don't know who Dr. \n     Boyer was? You never got to know him? TOO BAD! You would have \n     loved him.''\n       Michael continued, ``The Asians had their Sensai, the \n     Indians had their Shaman, and we had our Dr. Boyer. Though he \n     passed away, he will continue to live in our commonalities, \n     and through our community of learners, and definitely in the \n     hearts of the children who knew him.''\n       During their visit to Jackson-Keller last October, Dr. and \n     Mrs. Boyer were serenaded by our third grade students. Our \n     children sang:\n\n     I am a child,\n     I am the future of the world, and just like every boy and \n           girl\n     I have a dream.\n     And when I dream,\n     The only way it will come true is if I'm gently led by you\n     And then set free.\n\n       In the Basic School Network, we have been gently led by the \n     words and the actions of Ernest Boyer, and we do believe in \n     this dream of the Basic School, a school committed to the \n     success of every child. I heard Dr. Boyer say on many, many \n     occasions ``the tragedy is not death. The tragedy is to die \n     with commitments undefined, convictions undeclared and with \n     service unfulfilled.''\n       Proverbs 29 tells us ``A people without vision shall \n     perish.'' But those with vision shall flourish. In the Basic \n     School Network we have each been blessed to learn from the \n     vision and commitment, the conviction and service, of this \n     fine man. We accept the challenge of Dr. Boyer's legacy, The \n     Basic School. It will live on because he taught us schools \n     are not about buildings and budgets, but about building a \n     better world for children. We learned from him that there \n     must be a school of quality and excellence, a place of love \n     and learning in every neighborhood, within the reach of every \n     child. And that the meaning of life is to create a life as if \n     it were a work of art.\n       We are thankful for the life of Ernest Boyer, and that each \n     of us was allowed to touch it, and be touched by it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S897-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S898-S899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I strongly oppose any further reductions in \nfunding the National Endowment for the Humanities. The agency has \nresponded to a 36-percent budget cut for fiscal year 1996 with major \nrestructuring of programs and staff. Using the House appropriations \nfigures contained in the last two continuing resolutions, NEH is now \noperating at a 40-percent reduction--$99.5 million instead of the \nanticipated $110 million.\n  The agency has already eliminated 90 positions from its 260-person \nstaff, streamlined its administrative structure, and cut programs. The \nsuspended programs include: archaeology projects, summer stipends for \nteachers, dissertation grants, the NEH/National Science Foundation \ngrants, the Kettering Foundation partnership, and, most disturbing to \nme, the National Conversation initiative. Further staff reductions are \nnow probable.\n  The recent furlough and uncertainty over its budget is preventing the \nagency from planning, carrying out its mission, and ensuring that the \ntaxpayers dollars are spent wisely. For example, NEH has had to cancel \npeer review panels. As NEH can fund only 18 percent of the more than \n8,500 applications it receives each year, competition for funding is \nfierce. Ensuring that these funds are awarded to the best proposals is \na responsibility that NEH takes seriously. The Humanities Endowment \npeer review system has been heralded as a model for adoption at other \nagencies. The forced cancellation of peer panels as a result of \ngovernment shutdown has weakened that system and prevented the agency \nfrom meeting its high standards of rigorous review.\n  Should funding run out on March 15, NEH will have to cancel its March \n25 round of grant awards. Applicants who have put thousands of hours \nand effort into their grant applications will be denied the opportunity \nfor funding for an entire year.\n  Changing the Humanities Endowment appropriations means that: Work on \nthe George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, Dwight \nEisenhower, and First Federal Congress Papers will be terminated before \ncompletion. Summer seminar programs for teachers will be canceled \nentirely. One hundred fellowships will be eliminated. The widely-read \nHumanities Magazine, already forced to cancel its January issue, will \nhave to cancel more. In July, all grants to film, libraries, and \nmuseums will have to be canceled. This includes a Utah Humanities \nCouncil exhibit scheduled to travel to 32 small, rural museums from \nWest Virginia to Oregon, and a Buffalo Bill Historical Center exhibit \nslated for 10 Western sites. State Humanities Councils, in \n\n[[Page S899]]\naddition to losing anticipated funding for this year, are facing \nenormous difficulties in planning for the next. Technical assistance \nand consultation to hundreds of small- and medium-sized cultural \ninstitutions will be suspended.\n  The drastic effects of government shutdown and budget impasse on \nAmerican scholarship and the entire humanities field is not necessarily \nas obvious as it is in other areas of concentration. This is because \nNEH grants, with their heavy emphasis on research, rarely see results \nfor several years. But continuity in support for research projects is \ncritical, and NEH represents the single largest source of financial \nsupport for the humanities nationwide. The next largest, the Andrew \nMellon Foundation, provides one-third of the amounts granted by NEH.\n  When we eliminate the staff and resources funded by NEH and needed to \npreserve brittle books, the destruction does not stop. We have lost \nvolumes of important manuscripts forever. The same is true for NEH's \nimportant United States Newspaper Preservation project to preserve city \nand small town newspapers on communities in all 50 States.\n  Mr. President, I cannot underestimate the gravity of this situation. \nIf allowed to continue, it will mean that future generations of \nAmericans will be deprived of the knowledge of our Nation's rich \nhistory. We owe it to our people to maintain this legacy, and not to \nlet it slip away. We simply cannot afford to lose artifacts, texts, \nwisdom, and insights that tell where we came from, who we are, and how \nwe might make wise decisions for the generations ahead. I urge my \ncolleagues to consider how very serious this situation is, to \nunderstand the long-term ramifications of cuts in the NEH budget, and \nto join in a bipartisan effort to enable this agency to continue its \ngood, worthwhile, and extremely important endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S898-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1541) to extend, reform, and improve \n     agricultural commodity, trade, conservation, and other \n     programs and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Craig (for Leahy/Lugar) Amendment No. 3184, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3184\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, we will soon have a cloture vote on the \nLeahy substitute to Senate bill 1541, The Freedom To Farm Act, I \nintroduced. We had a cloture vote on that legislation the other day, \ngaining 53 votes, a majority of the Senate but less than the 60 \nrequired to end debate on that occasion.\n  My colleague, Senator Leahy, former chairman of the committee, a man \nwith whom I have worked in the Senate from the time that I started on \nthe Agriculture Committee, has made a number of constructive \nsuggestions. The latest version we are about to vote on is the Freedom \nTo Farm Act but with additional suggestions made by Senator Leahy in \nthe form of a substitute. And I support those additions, Mr. President.\n  I wish to simply recite a few of them for the benefit of Senators who \nare following this debate. Senator Leahy has said, why not take this \noccasion to let producers bid for a permanent easement in the Wetlands \nReserve Program as opposed to bidding for a shorter period of time. I \nthink that is a very constructive suggestion. He has asked that we \nencourage innovative range management techniques to be developed in the \nSouthwest under grazing lands authorization. He suggested to make it \npossible for farmers to serve on State technical committees. So that is \nincorporated in the legislation.\n  A very significant change, Mr. President, is the reauthorization of \nthe Food Stamp Program and other nutrition programs that require \nauthorization at this time in order to continue.\n  Senator Leahy, furthermore, has made an important change by \nsuggesting that we reauthorize the Conservation Reserve Program through \nthe year 2002, allowing new signups and making water quality a high \npriority, that which we have considered at length in our committee with \nextensive hearings and many witnesses strongly in favor of continuation \nof the program and of the priority for high water quality, likewise for \ntrying to save soils that are in a high erosion situation, and, of \ncourse, the preservation of wildlife, supported by conservationists and \nsportsmen throughout the country.\n\n  Senator Leahy has asked that we create a nonprofit foundation to \npromote conservation, a conservation foundation. This idea has passed \nthe Senate earlier in previous legislation.\n  An especially important program, Mr. President, which will now be a \npart of this legislation, is the EQIP program, $100 million per year in \nadditional mandatory funding for crop-oriented conservation cost \nsharing, similar to the Lugar-Leahy conservation bill, S. 854.\n  Let me simply say, these are suggestions that would have come forward \nin other titles of the farm bill. We all appreciate the situation in \nwhich the farm bill was incorporated in the Balanced Budget Act. \nRegretfully, President Clinton vetoed that act and he, therefore, \nvetoed the farm bill.\n  As I explained to Members the other day, literally I picked up the \nfarm bill from the side of the road and put it back into play, and we \ngot 53 votes to stop debate on that situation. We are hopeful of \ngetting 60 votes to end debate by incorporating these additional \nsuggestions of the distinguished Democratic leader of the Agriculture \nCommittee. I will add that many other Members on the other side of the \naisle have shown strong support for Senator Leahy's initiative.\n  Mr. President, other speakers today have mentioned the importance of \ncertainty about farm legislation. Clearly, that is the reason we return \ntoday. We are attempting to provide that certainty so that farmers will \nknow there is a program that has passed one body and have a fairly good \nidea how that meshes with the farm bill that is now about to be \nconsidered on the floor of the House of Representatives, a bill very \nsimilar in terms of all of its freedom to farm aspects.\n  I predict if we are successful today, we will be in a position to \nconfer with the House very promptly upon their return, and farmers will \nhave an idea, at least in framework, of what to anticipate as they try \nto order inputs prior to planting.\n  If we fail to act, two things will occur, one of which has been \npredicted by Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, and that is, he \nfeels a mandate to begin thinking through the allotments for rice, and \nhe will have to begin thinking about payments to certain wheat \nfarmers--who were in the business in 1949--as the Texas wheat crop is \nharvest in the latter part of May. Those events are coming along the \ncalendar.\n  The other thing that will clearly occur is that many farmers will \nsimply adopt their own freedom to farm idea. They will plant for the \nmarket. They will abandon Government programs. I have suggested that \nmay not be a totally bad idea. It might be, in fact, revolutionary if \nfarmers simply took their fate in their own hands and say we are going \nto plant for the market and not wait around for games to be played on \nthe Senate floor, for parliamentary procedural difficulties.\n\n  For those who want certainty and those who want a farm program, this \nis the day and this is the hour at 4:10. If we make progress, I predict \nwe will have a sound program that has a safety net and certainty. If we \ndo not have cloture today, I suggest to farmers all over America, you \nbetter begin thinking about taking your fate in your own hands because \nI do not predict success very soon along the trail.\n  I note on the floor, Mr. President, my distinguished colleague, the \nSenator from Vermont. Therefore, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized. \n  \n[[Page S900]]\n\n  Mr. DOLE. If I can just take a couple minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield the majority leader as much time as he might \nrequire.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nour committee for his effort and also Senator Leahy from Vermont, the \nranking minority member of the committee.\n  As I have indicated in the past, farm bills are always difficult to \npass. They are even more difficult than the House side. I hope today we \ncan demonstrate in a bipartisan way we want to move forward, try to get \nthis to conference. I think American farmers want and deserve \ncertainty, and I assume, as the chairman just indicated, maybe if we do \nnot do anything, they will just do it on their own.\n  It is interesting today, the Governors are in town and this morning, \nby unanimous vote, they passed a resolution calling for us to pass a \nfarm bill without delay no later than February 15. These are Democrats \nand Republicans, but they were unanimous. Nearly every Governor has \nsomeone or many or hundreds or thousands of people in their State who \nrely on agriculture for a living, and they understand the importance of \nagriculture.\n  President Clinton also spoke this morning with the Republican and \nDemocratic Governors. He said we ought to strike while the iron is hot. \nWell, the iron is hot. This is the time to strike because there is not \nany administration farm bill, as far as I know. Somebody even offered a \nreward if anybody can find an administration farm bill. If they are \njust against what we are doing and do not have an alternative or if \nthey have an alternative, vote on both, give them a vote, give us a \nvote, 1-hour debate and we are out of here.\n\n  The farmers will have some certainty. We are prepared to do that this \nafternoon. So the iron is hot and the farmers are hot, and the farmers \nare getting hotter every day. They do not understand why this is being \nmired down in a partisan effort to stall to go to conference. We have \nhad 33 hearings. This bill has been endorsed by nearly every major \nagriculture commodity group. We have had a bumper crop of profarm \nrhetoric, but we do not have a profarm bill.\n  Farmers really do not care what we say on the Senate floor. They are \nnot hanging on every word uttered on the Senate floor, but they would \nlike to have some guidance so they know what they can tell their \nbanker, for example, or their employees.\n  So on behalf of the American farmers, I ask my colleagues to pull the \nplug on the filibuster, because the choice we face is clear. We will \neither adopt a policy that fosters the future growth of America's No. 1 \nindustry or we are going to continue a farm policy that is the \nequivalent of driving a truck while looking in the rear-view mirror.\n  U.S. agriculture is dynamic and growing. It is time for Washington to \nhelp foster this growth by implementing a simpler and more flexible \nmarket-based farm policy.\n  So I think we have a lot of opportunities to offer amendments if \npeople disagree with the farm bill. There are a couple hundred \namendments filed, I understand. So I hope we can adopt a bill that will \nmeet the concerns as we go into the 21st century. I think the future is \nbright for American agriculture. But we have to be prepared, and part \nof the preparation is adopting a farm policy that is growth oriented, \nwhich means eliminating supply controls, providing farmers with full \nplanting flexibility and a program which is simpler and more certain.\n  So I hope we will do what we should have done. The President vetoed \nthe bill. That is his right. As far as I know, there is no alternative \noffered by the President. That is his right. Again, as I said, if there \nare alternatives, why not just have a vote on each today. Vote on the \nfreedom to farm; vote on the Leahy amendment, whatever. There has been \na lot of bipartisanship in putting together the pending substitute.\n  So I hope my colleagues will understand that it is time for action. \nIt is time to strike, as the President said, while the iron is hot. It \nmay not get any warmer. Sooner or later, we will get cloture, because I \nthink the farmers and farm groups are beginning to contact our \ncolleagues and are persuading our colleagues, for the right reasons, to \nmove forward.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues to do what we should have done sometime ago--\npass a farm bill. I am from a winter wheat State. At the end of every \n5-year farm bill, we never know what the farm program is going to be, \nand so farmers do what the chairman said. They go out and sort of plant \neverything and hope that the legislation will let them destroy some of \nit or continue to produce it. So the time is long past due, and I hope \nwe will take positive action today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont controls 11 minutes \nof time, and the time under the control of the Senator from Indiana has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from South Dakota \nwishes to speak. I wish to speak, but, obviously, I yield to the \nSenator from South Dakota and ask him to make sure that I get a couple \nof minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the ranking member, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  I agree with much of what we just heard the majority leader say. He \nsaid we should have passed a farm bill a long time ago. I agree. He \nsaid we should strike while the iron is hot. I agree. He said that we \nneed bipartisanship. I agree. He said the farmers are clamoring for us \nto get something done. I agree.\n  The leader did not explain why it is that we have not been able to \npass a piece of farm legislation in the Senate Agriculture Committee. \nHe did not explain why we have not had this bill pending before us, as \nwe have every 5 years for the last 60 years. He did not indicate, as I \nknow he understands, that we have never sent a bill to President \nClinton as a freestanding piece of farm legislation.\n  Everyone knows the history here, and everyone knows that this \nlegislation was incorporated--a better word is ``buried''--in the \nbudget reconciliation bill. That is where the legislation was, and that \nis what the President vetoed.\n  So we are here this afternoon with the prospect of voting on a farm \nbill that has not been subject to one amendment, has not been subject \nto one day of debate. We would be locking into law, if cloture is \ninvoked, legislation that would eliminate permanent farm law for the \nfirst time in 60 years, that would do things about which most Senators \ntoday still are not completely appreciative. Why? Because we have not \nhad a debate.\n  I agree, as I said, with the leader that now is the time to get the \njob done. But if we are truly going to get the job done, why is it that \nwe would take an all-or-nothing attitude? We had an opportunity to pass \na compromise. I felt very encouraged in the last several days as we \nworked with the distinguished Chair. He is as forthcoming and as \nwilling to work with us as any chairman. I applaud him for his efforts. \nWe worked with the majority leader's staff, and with staff on our side, \nin the expectation that we could break this impasse. I think we were \nwithin reach, within grasp of achieving a meaningful compromise. Why, \nfor some reason, there was a change of heart on the other side of the \naisle, I do not know. All I know is that we missed that opportunity to \nbring a compromise to the floor, to have a good vote, to work through \nthis piece of legislation with an expectation that we could finish by \nthe end of the day tomorrow. I still would like to see us do that.\n  Let us do, for Heaven's sake, what we have always done on a piece of \nlegislation this controversial and this far-reaching. Let us consider \nimportant amendments, and let us deal with this debate in a way that \nwill allow us to make the very best decisions. Let us not take the all-\nor-nothing attitude that is expressed by some on the other side. Let us \nnot ignore the consequences of ending permanent law.\n  All we are asking is an opportunity to offer amendments, not to be \nprecluded from offering them. The majority has a lot of rights around \nhere, but one right should not be to preclude the minority from making \nwhat they consider to be very important improvements in this \nlegislation. We want the rights that we have fought for every day we \nhave come to the Senate floor. \n\n[[Page S901]]\n\n  I must say, Mr. President, that nothing is more important than that. \nPut aside for a moment the issue of farming and all of the serious \npolicy implications of the current farm proposal; put those aside. Just \nremember how critical it is that Senators have the right to offer \namendments and not be impeded by the parliamentary process that could \nbe put in place under cloture. I do not want that to happen on this \nbill, or on any piece of legislation, for which there has been no \ndebate or amendments.\n  There may come a time when we are going to have to invoke cloture--\nwhen I would support it. But not today, not under the circumstances, \nand not without having a good debate and, certainly, not with the \nexpectation that this ultimately will go nowhere.\n  A justified Presidential veto of this legislation would put us right \nback where we started. We do not want that; farmers do not want that. \nLet us work through this and get a compromise that will allow us a \nmeaningful opportunity to come together, and I will predict passage by \nan overwhelming vote, certainly by the end of the day tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes, 27 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, at the \nconclusion of my time, the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia \nbe given 1 minute under his own control.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish we were not in the situation we are \nin. I would like to see a farm bill done in the normal course. In 1990, \nwhen we did the Leahy-Lugar farm bill, it was a comprehensive package \nthat blended the needs and interests of urban and rural America with \nthe need to maintain and reclaim our environmental heritage as well as \nto provide the food and fiber needed in this country.\n  We seem to be operating under a different situation. I hope that the \nfinal package we have here will have a bipartisan nature to it. The \nother body determined that they cannot do that. I believe we are \ndifferent in this body, and I believe that we can. We have always \napproached farm legislation that way, and this is no different.\n  As I approached the farm bill year, I asked myself the following \nquestion, and it is a question that I believe every Member in this body \nneeds to ask him or herself.\n  What is a farm bill?\n  In 1996, a farm bill is no longer just about farm programs. It is not \njust about growing crops or amber waves of grain.\n  The farm bill is about feeding the American people. It is about the \nelimination of hunger in one of the wealthiest nations in the world.\n  The farm bill ensures that children do not go to bed hungry--at home \nand abroad.\n  Congress created the world's most cost-efficient and effective \nnutrition programs.\n  These programs are the lifeline for millions of Americans--especially \nchildren in need of Government assistance.\n  Except for the 26 million Americans on food stamps, most Americans do \nnot realize that food stamps are America's best and largest child \nnutrition program.\n  Most Americans are not aware that the authority for the food stamp \nand other nutrition programs expired last year.\n  Today, we have the opportunity to reauthorize these nutrition \nprograms and maintain this safety net for millions of at-risk \nAmericans.\n  Quite simply, this is a moral question.\n  The farm bill is about safety--knowing that the food supply of our \nchildren and our children's children is safe.\n  When our children drink a glass of water, we know it is free of \npesticides. When our children buy a school lunch or grab a snack after \nschool, their parents and teachers know it is safe to eat.\n  The farm bill is about the environment. It is about responsibility to \nconservation and the legacy we leave to future generations.\n  I have said twice this year on the Senate floor that the historical \nbasis for the present commodity programs has disappeared.\n  And, I know that they are important to the 2 to 3 percent of the \npopulation that they directly serve. But, these programs, as presently \nstructured make less and less sense to the majority of the population.\n  There is a real reason that taxpayers should make payments to farmers \nand ranchers. It is simple and clear justification for commodity \nprograms and Americans understand it.\n  Farmers and ranchers manage half of the land in the United States. \nYes, half of the land in the United States.\n  Farmers and ranchers, however, need the help of taxpayers to \nimplement innovative, valued environmental solutions to maintain this \nland.\n  It is impossible to solve our clean water problems, wetland and \nwildlife problems except through a positive incentive program that \nshould form the basis of the agricultural program of the next century.\n  We have accomplished that in this legislation. For the first time \nthere will be incentives to help all farmers and ranchers be the good \nneighbors that they have always worked to be by allowing them ways to \ncontrol the agricultural-related pollution that affects our rural and \nurban communities.\n  Bottom line, this package will provide a future farm program that \nwill fund conservation-based farm programs that benefit every American \nand it will help all farmers and ranchers who control pollution and \nsteward sensitive lands--not just those who produce major crops.\n  It is a good package. Can we do better? Sure, we could, by going \nthrough the normal course. The last time we had a 5-year farm bill, it \ntook 7 days--an all-time record. These things sometime take a long \ntime. I wish we could have come to agreement with the proposal the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, and I, along with \nSenator Daschle and Senator Dole, made to our respective caucuses last \nThursday. In my mind that was the best of all possible worlds.\n\n  That has not been found acceptable. I think that is unfortunate. I \nthink we could have had more enthusiasm and voted for it had that \nhappened. Now we have what we have.\n  A farm bill should also be responsive to the needs of a region with \nspecial circumstances. This farm bill does that by consenting to the \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact. The compact is State law in the \neach of the six New England States and is strongly supported by New \nEngland's governors.\n  The compact is a grassroots effort designed to set fair and stable \nmilk prices that will benefit farmers and consumers. The New England \nStates are not asking for anything but to go forward with this effort. \nAll year we have heard about the need to give more power back to the \nStates. This is an opportunity for Congress to do just that.\n  Later during this debate there will be an amendment to deal with \nnational dairy policy. It is not perfect but it is a good start, and \ncertain issues will need to be resolved in the House-Senate conference. \nIt eliminates the assessment farmers have to pay for the dairy program, \nand phases down price supports. It saves $80 million over 7 years, not \nbad for a program that cost only $4 million last year.\n  This amendment will also protect and reform the Federal milk \nmarketing orders and allow our dairy producers to compete \ninternationally by fully funding the Dairy Export Incentive Program.\n\n\n                 restoration of the florida everglades\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, included in the farm bill that the Senate \nwill consider today is a provision for $200 million to be used by the \nSecretary of the Department of the Interior to move forward with \nrestoration of the Everglades ecosystem. Some of my colleagues may \nwonder why the farm bill contains such a provision, and I would like to \ntake a few minutes to explain the importance of restoring this unique \necosystem.\n  The Everglades is one of the most unique wetland ecosystems in the \nworld. It is a national treasure that is in peril and deserves the \nimmediate attention of Congress.\n  Prior to the 1940's the Everglades ecosystem covered most of south \nFlorida, from its headwaters in the Kissimmee River basin to the coral \nreefs of Florida Bay. Because of man's alterations, the once ``river of \ngrass'' is now fragmented and deteriorating, threatening not only the \nwildlife of the \n\n[[Page S902]]\nesosystem, but also the water supplies, economy and quality of life for \nthe people who live in Florida.\n  The central and south Florida project, authorized by Congress to \ncontrol flooding and reclaim land in the area, has had unintended and \ndisastrous results. While flood protection in many areas has improved, \nsouth Florida's ecosystem has suffered greatly.\n  On average, more than 500,000 acre feet of water are sent to tide \neach year from Lake Okeechobee. In addition, another 1 million acre \nfeet from the Everglades agricultural area is discharged to tide each \nyear through east coast canals. This water once remained in the system \nand was a primary source of fresh water for wildlife and served to \nreplenish the ground water supplies.\n  Now the water that flows south in the Everglades marshes is diverted \nby canals and polluted by agricultural runoff, primarily from sugarcane \nfields. Water entering the Everglades often has 20-30 times the \nphosphorous levels that are found in unpolluted parts of the \nEverglades. This has led to an explosion of plants that are \ndramatically altering the landscape and the habitat of threatened and \nendangered species. Cattails are overwhelming periphyton, the very base \nof life in the ecosystem, destroying the unique balance of the \nEverglades.\n  Throughout the system, clear, fresh water has been replaced by murky, \nnutrient laden water that does not support native plant and animal \nspecies.\n  The years of water diversion and pollutants affect not only the \nEverglades, but also Florida Bay. The Bay is suffering from a lack of \nfresh water that has led to algal blooms and contributed to the \nextinction of North America's only native coral reef. As a consequence, \nthis once teeming estuary now is closed to commercial fishing, and the \ntourism industry of the region is threatened.\n  We must not let the Everglades die. Although the decline of the \necosystem continues, it is reversible.\n  Current efforts by Federal, State and local governments to restore \nthe system are moving forward. Restoration will involve not only \nprotection of the natural system, but also continued flood protection \nand provisions for adequate water supplies for wildlife and humans. \nThis comprehensive effort could be derailed if sufficient acreage in \nthe southern Everglades agricultural area is not acquired to provide \nstorage and delivery of adequate, fresh water supplies to the natural \nsystem.\n  As explained by the Everglades coalition, a diverse group of more \nthan 30 citizens, environmental and conservation organizations, \nrestoration of the Everglades requires a ``dike to dike'' approach to \nrestore the natural flow of water into the Everglades, preserve and \nclean up polluted waters, reduce flooding and provide more water to a \ngrowing Florida. A ``dike to dike'' water storage and management area \nof approximately 230,000 acres in the southern Everglades agricultural \narea would be used to restore water quality and a more natural \nhydroperiod in the Everglades. Portions of this land are already state \nowned, and are available for Everglades restoration purposes. About \n130,000 additional acres of land currently used for sugarcane \nproduction will need to be acquired in order to complete the necessary \nwater management area.\n  According to the Everglades coalition, significantly increasing water \nstorage will provide a wide array of benefits to all of south Florida \nincluding: The recovery of water now wasted to the ocean; more water \nfor all water users, including the natural Everglades; restoration of \nthe natural timing, distribution and flow into the Everglades; more \nareas to clean polluted water; the amelioration of flooding; and the \nprotection of the Lake Okeechobee, St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee estuary \necosystems.\n  This is an ambitious project, which will cost billions of dollars. \nToday, we are making a small down payment--$200 million for Everglades \nrestoration.\n  Specifically, this provision directs the Secretary of the Treasury to \nprovide $200 million to be used toward the acquisition and modification \nof approximately 130,000 acres in the Everglades agricultural area \nidentified by the agencies to be used for water storage and delivery. \nThis would include the remaining private acreage in townships 46, 47, \nand 48 of the Everglades agricultural area, approximately 52,000 acres \nreferred to as the ``Talisman Tract'' and other restoration activities \nin the ecosystem. When enacted, no further action by Congress will be \nnecessary to authorize the administration to spend these funds. In \naddition, the funds shall not be provided for this program from the \nConservation Reserve, Wetlands Reserve or any other conservation \nprograms.\n  This small down payment will be insufficient for total restoration. \nIt is only part of the Federal Government's share of this coordinated \nrestoration effort. More important, it in no way relieves others--\nparticularly the sugarcane industry that has benefited from the \nalteration of the system and continues to pollute it--of its obligation \nto contribute to restoration costs.\n  These growers benefit from the Federal Sugar Program that guarantees \nthem significant earnings. In the next 5 years alone, some 139 Florida \nsugar producers and processors will make more than $1 billion in \nprofits because Washington inflates the price of sugar, at the expense \nof the consumer\n  Forida sugar producers must contribute their fair share--a 2-cent per \npound assessment on new sugar grown in the Everglades--to pay for both \npast water quality degradation caused by cane farming, and for land \nacquisition vital to Everglades restoration. This would raise $350 \nmillion over 5 years.\n  This proposal has wide spread support in Florida. Poll after poll \nshows that voters there believe polluters should pay and favor the 2-\ncent assessment.\n  I will pursue every effort until Congress or the voters in Florida \nimpose a 2 cent assessment on every new pound of sugar grown in the \nEverglades agricultural area.\n  In addition, today's action should help the Clinton Administration \nwhich is taking significant leadership on restoring the Everglades. In \na January 11, 1996 directive, Vice President Gore ordered key Cabinet \ndepartments to prepare a thorough plan for the President . . . for the \nrestoration of the Everglades and the south Florida ecosystem.\n  The Vice President wrote that ``the Florida sugarcane producing \nindustry must pay their fair share'' of restoration costs. He further \ndirected senior administration officials to develop a plan that: \n``assures that sufficient land now involved in agricultural production \nis returned to its natural function to allow for storage and \npurification of water.''\n  I will do all I can to work with the administration in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of Vice President Gore's \nJanuary 11, 1996, directive and administration's guiding principles be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                 Office of the Vice President,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 1996.\n\n     Memorandum For: Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of Interior,\n     Dan Glickman, Secretary of Agriculture,\n     Carol Browner, Administrator EPA,\n     Alice Rivlin, Director OMB,\n     Katie McGinty, Chair CBQ,\n     Togo West, Secretary of the Army.\n\n     From: The Vice President.\n     Subject: Everglades and South Florida Ecosystem Restoration.\n\n       Recently, the President and I again discussed the issue of \n     restoring the Everglades. We both continue to be deeply \n     concerned about the problems there, and believe that the \n     Administration must continue to provide strong leadership and \n     aggressively build on your collective efforts to date to \n     restore and manage wisely the South Florida ecosystem.\n       During a recent trip to South Florida I pledge to expedite \n     our work. Through this memorandum I am therefore requesting \n     OMB and CBQ to work with the departments and agencies to \n     prepare a thorough plan for the President that builds on our \n     work and the set of principles adopted by the Administration \n     to ensure fairness in funding the restoration of the \n     Everglades and South Florida ecosystem. (A copy of the \n     principles is attached).\n       This plan should accomplish the following objectives:\n       Assure that sufficient land now involved in agricultural \n     production is returned to its natural function to allow for \n     storage and purification of water. I understand that a number \n     of scientists have recommended that 100,000 acres or more \n     will be necessary to achieve a thorough restoration. I would \n     like the Army Corps of Engineers to complete, as quickly as \n     possible, its assessment of this acreage and whether \n     additional acreage will be necessary to accomplish this \n     objective;\n     \n[[Page S903]]\n\n       Ensure a long-term, reliable reverse stream to be put \n     toward land acquisition and other essential activities. \n     Please specifically note continued federal, state, and local \n     government contributions, and economic incentives, and \n     identify and assess mechanisms that can ensure that these \n     responsible for the pollution harming the South Florida \n     ecosystem and those who benefit from the federal flood \n     control and water supply projects, including the Florida \n     sugarcane producing industry, pay their fair share;\n       Identify those measures that must be undertaken in short \n     order, such as, for example, preserving a buffer around the \n     Everglades and increasing water flows to Florida Bay; and\n       Expedite and coordinate the various federal efforts now \n     ongoing for ecosystem restoration including the Army Corps of \n     Engineers ``restudy''.\n       In developing this plan, please work with our state, local \n     and tribal governmental partners. In addition, I would also \n     ask you to consider all potential sources of revenues for \n     such an effort, and to review any mechanisms including, for \n     example, land trades; sales of surplus federal lands; or \n     conservation easements, for acquisition of the necessary \n     properties or development rights.\n       Your timely attention to this matter is very much \n     appreciated. The Administration's continued leadership on \n     this matter is vital and I anticipate with great interest \n     your report on the best means for the Administration to \n     assure the future of the precious natural treasure--the \n     Florida Everglades and Florida Bay--and the health and \n     economic prosperity of the citizens of South Florida. Thank \n     you.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n     Funding Tax Restoration of the Everglades, Guiding Principles\n\n\n                             December 1995\n\n       The restoration and protection of the Everglades and \n     Florida Bay is one of the Clinton Administration's highest \n     environmental priorities. The Everglades is a unique national \n     natural treasure. With Florida Bay, it undergirds the quality \n     of life and the tourism and fishing industries in South \n     Florida.\n       The substantial costs of restoration over decades should be \n     borne by those who have benefitted from activities that \n     profoundly altered the Everglades acosystem, and by those who \n     will potentially benefit by its restoration. Florida \n     sugarcane producers should pay their fair share of the costs. \n     Federal State and local governments also should share in the \n     costs of restoration.\n       Congress should adopt legislation that provides funding to \n     assist in making a substantial down payment on the \n     significant restoration needs that immediately face the \n     Everglades--such as enhancing more natural water deliveries \n     to the Everglades and Florida Bay, acquisition of the \n     Talisman tract, and acquisition and engineering of an East \n     Everglades water preserve buffer zone.\n       Funding proposals should meet clearly defined objectives \n     and be integrated into technical plans for the overall, long-\n     term effort to restore the South Florida ecosystem. \n     Restoration and funding proposals should be evaluated for \n     their effect on the South Florida ecosystem, rather than on \n     any single component of that ecosystem.\n       The proposals should be developed and implemented in \n     consultation with State and local communities and officials.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I congratulate the leadership for trying \nto move this bill forward.\n  My contribution is very short. I have just returned from a wonderful \n2-day visit to the rural areas in my State. I visited yesterday and \nspoke to the Virginia Association of Corn Growers, the Virginia \nAssociation of Soybean Growers. Every one of them said ``Where is this \nbill?''\n  This morning was the most dramatic. I visited a section of my State, \nthe valley which was ravaged by floods, ice, and snow, together with \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency. We were there this morning to \nhelp farmers. Mr. President, 13 counties and 3 municipalities were \nseverely damaged. One old farmer got up, looked at me, and said, \n``Senator, we can dig out from under all this ice and snow. Why can you \nnot dig out from the problems of Washington and pass that farm bill?''\n  I assured him that I would leave instantly to return to Washington to \ncast a vote to do just that.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Gramm \nof Texas and Snowe of Maine be added as cosponsors for the Leahy \nsubstitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my Democratic colleagues say we need a \nfarm bill. They could not be more correct. The simple solution: vote \nfor the Craig-Leahy substitute amendment.\n  Last week the Senate voted on the motion to invoke cloture on S. \n1541, which contained the agriculture provisions included in the \nBalanced Budget Act that, unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues \nopposed and the President vetoed. I am disappointed that the Senate was \nunsuccessful in limiting debate on this legislation, which would have \nmoved this body one step closer to passing a farm bill.\n  Today I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to put \nparty politics aside and vote for farm legislation that has the support \nof both Democrats and Republicans; the Craig/Leahy substitute \namendment.\n  The Craig/Leahy substitute amendment represents a bi-partisan \napproach to farm legislation; farm legislation that will allow our \nfarmers to farm to the marketplace and not to Washington, D.C. \nbureaucrats' farm legislation that will provide flexibility, \npredictability, simplicity, and opportunity for the American farmer; \nand farm legislation that will give certainly to farmers, their \nbankers, and to the taxpaying public. Simply put Mr. President, the \nCraig/Leahy compromise will give U.S. farmers the positive reforms they \nneed in order to respond to the demands of emerging world markets.\n  Members of both parties have debated the need for a farm bill for \nnearly ten months. My advice to my colleagues is simple: by supporting \nthe Craig/Leahy compromise today we can have a farm bill that is \nsupported by farmers across the country; a farm bill that provides \ngenuine flexibility and a smooth transition into the market-responsive \nagriculture of the next century.\n  The alternative, Mr. President, is the status-quo. That, Mr. \nPresident, is simply unacceptable to farmers in my State of Washington \nand across the country. American farmers deserve better--they deserve a \nprogram that will provide certainty and flexibility. It is time to put \nparty politics aside and vote for farm legislation that has support \nfrom both sides of the aisle.\n  Vote for the Craig/Leahy substitute today and give our farmers what \nthey deserve: a farm program will allow them to farm according to the \nmarketplace and stop the Federal government from telling them what crop \nto plant, when to plant, and how much to plant. Washington does NOT \nknow best--these decisions belong to the farmer, not the Federal \nGovernment. Voting for the Craig/Leahy compromise, Mr. President, is \ncommon sense\n  In closing Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a \nletter from Washington State Farm Bureau, representing over 6,000 \nfarmers and ranchers in my State, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 Washington State Farm Bureau,\n\n                                    Olympia, WA, February 5, 1996.\n     Hon. Slade Gorton,\n     Hart Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gorton: This letter is being sent on behalf of \n     the 6,000 farmers and ranchers that the Washington State Farm \n     Bureau represents. We are asking your support for a seven-\n     year farm bill.\n       It is important that you understand that our members are \n     adamantly opposed to a one or two year extension of current \n     law. To do this would exasperate immediate cash flow problems \n     for our farmers. Also, a one or two year extension leaves the \n     long term look very uncertain for our farmers. We are also \n     opposed to reverting back to the Act of 1949. Many problems \n     would result from this approach, especially since the \n     allotments based on the 1950 production patterns are not \n     consistent with where wheat is actually grown today.\n       Our farmers are trying desperately to plan for this year's \n     crop. Further inaction on behalf of the Senate and the House \n     will only continue to disrupt both financing and planting of \n     their 1996 crop. Farm families can't afford to have Congress \n     continue to stop the process of signing a farm bill into law.\n       A Farm Bureau analysis shows that we need a farm bill which \n     guarantees $44 billion in spending on commodity programs. We \n     believe that this spending level reflects a significant \n     contribution to budget deficit reduction by agriculture and \n     is the minimum amount necessary for effective commodity \n     programs.\n       It is our understanding that there will be a cloture vote \n     on Tuesday, February 6th on the Craig/Leahy substitute bill \n     for S. 1541. We urge you to support S. 1541. Please vote for \n     this compromise farm bill and allow our farmers and ranchers \n     to focus on what they do best, feeding the people of our \n     great country and the world.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Steve Appel,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, tremendous changes have occurred in the \nagriculture economy over the last many years.\n\n[[Page S904]]\n\n  The growth of biotechnology, new and dramatic genetic research \napplied at the farm level, new and innovative production techniques, \nbroadened communication and transportation systems, have all \ncontributed to a much different farm and ranch operations today than \njust a decade ago--let alone half a century ago when New Deal \nlegislation put on the books the farm programs we still have today.\n  I remind my colleagues when the Commodity Credit Corporation was \nestablished in 1933 farm households accounted for 25 percent of the \nU.S. population and generated over 10 percent of GDP.\n  Today farm households comprise less than 2 percent of the population \nand generate less than 2 percent of GDP. I know that the total food and \nfiber system beyond the farm gate contributes another 10 to 13 percent \nto GDP.\n  But those factors that helped create the need for farm price support \nprograms in 1933 no longer apply today.\n  That is one reason why I am supportive of the concepts of an \nagriculture market transition program that we included in the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1995.\n  Today an international market has developed for America's farm \nproducts and we need to provide the mechanisms that allow farmers to \nbase decisions on market conditions and not on Government programs.\n  The Market Transition Program moves agriculture in a new direction \nwhich will give farmers the freedom to plant what they want, when they \nwant, so that they will be able to compete in our global market \nenvironment.\n  The Market Transition Program also ends the production control \nprograms of the Depression era and provides a market transition for \nAmerican agriculture.\n  Under our current system, farmers may be required to take land out of \nproduction which allows our foreign competitors to make up the \ndifference in the world markets.\n  The Balanced Budget Act and the Leahy compromise also provides more \nflexibility, which farmers have asked for, less paperwork, and a better \nopportunity for farmers to earn a living from the marketplace.\n  Mr. President, a group of 15 distinguished economists, including the \nchief agricultural economist from the Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, \nNixon, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations, have \nindicated their support for the reforms in the Balanced Budget Act. \nThose concepts are also incorporated in the Leahy compromise bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I support the concept of a spending cap \nwhich were included in the Balanced Budget Act for agriculture and are \nalso included in the bipartisan Leahy compromise.\n  The spending caps as provided through a market transition program \nwill benefit both the taxpayer and the farmer. The taxpayer will not \nend up paying for unforeseen spending and the farmer will know what \nresources he will have in the future.\n  The Market Transition Program puts a cap on total spending for the \nwheat, cotton, feed grain, and rice programs at $35.6 billion over 6 \nyears.\n  Spending for the Commodity Credit Corporation programs has varied \nwidely from $0.6 billion in 1975 to $26 billion in 1986.\n  The spending cap in the Market Transition Program will limit \nunforeseen spending increases which have frequently occurred in past \nyears.\n  It is my hope that the spending restraints included in a market \ntransition program will be retained in the final Senate bill.\n  Mr. President, some have also said that any spending reductions to \nagriculture is unacceptable. However, any reductions will provide a \ndownpayment toward a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Act made reforms to farm programs, \nsaved $4.6 billion and allowed the Department of Agriculture to spend \n$65.1 billion in outlays over the next 7 years for the commodity, \nconservation, export, and crop insurance programs.\n  We also know that modern day agriculture requires significant amounts \nof operating capital. Farmers will be one of the largest beneficiaries \nfrom a balanced budget because interest rates will decrease.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to remind my colleagues that if the \nsavings diminish we will have to make up the difference elsewhere to \nachieve a balanced budget.\n  I cannot end this discussion without talking about agriculture in my \nhome State of New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, in my home State cattle, calves, and dairy dominate \nagriculture receipts--70 percent of total cash receipts in New Mexico \ncame from livestock and dairy operations.\n  In truth, because of the heavy emphasis on livestock and dairy in my \nState, ranchers and dairy operators have a keen interest in farm bill \nchanges.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that none of the bills have been \ndiscussed do not include a dairy title.\n  The New Mexico dairy industry has grown significantly over the past \nseveral years. The number of milk cows has increased by 104 percent \nfrom 1990 to 1994 compared to a decrease of 5 percent for the United \nStates.\n  New Mexico has also led the Nation in milk production per cow in 2 of \nthe last 4 years. New Mexico dairy farmers and manufacturers have made \nsubstantial investments in one of our fastest growing dairy States.\n  In fact, New Mexico will have the largest cheese manufacturing plant \nin the world once construction is completed.\n  For these reasons it is my hope that we can enact policies which are \nfiscally responsible, reduce regulation, reward efficiency, reduce the \nnumber of mandates on the industry, and increase the dairy industries \nability to compete in the international marketplace.\n  Mr. President, the House Agriculture Committee has already reported a \nfarm bill which includes a dairy title.\n  It is my understanding that the bill would consolidate many existing \nmarketing orders to 8 or 13 orders. I believe that is good policy but \nprevious versions of the bill would eliminate all dairy programs if the \nUSDA does not consolidate the orders in 2 years.\n  This type of policy concerns me because outright elimination could be \ndevastating to the stability of the industry.\n  In addition, other policy adjustments provided for in the House bill \nappear to be short-sighted in their approach.\n  It is my hope that we will take every opportunity to provide as many \navenues as possible for our dairy farmers to compete in growing world \nmarket.\n  Looking for long term opportunities for stable and sustained markets \nis far more important than providing for short-sighted fixes that end \nup as burdens on both the dairy industry and the taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, the peanut industry took the initiative early last \nyear to eliminate costs of the program to the taxpayer. The provisions \nin the Balanced Budget Act and the Leahy compromise do eliminate the \ncost to the taxpayer--saves $412 million over the next 7 years.\n  Mr. President, the Leahy substitute bill includes an amendment \nregarding peanuts which is very important to my home State of New \nMexico.\n  Mr. President, as part of the 1985 farm bill, Congress adopted a \nprovision which created an exclusive pool for New Mexico Valencia \npeanuts. The same provision was also retained in the 1990 farm bill.\n  The original intent of the law is to allow only those Valencia \npeanuts grown in the State of New Mexico to enter into the New Mexico \nValencia pool.\n  However, peanut growers in my home State have notified me that \nValencia peanuts grown out of State have been entering the New Mexico \npool. This is being done because of a loophole in existing regulations.\n  This is an issue that is very important to me because it's importance \nto eastern New Mexico.\n  The provision in the bill clarifies that only Valencia peanuts \nphysically grown in the State will be allowed to enter into the pool of \nthe State.\n  Also, the provision would grandfather those individuals who \nparticipated in the New Mexico pool with Valencia peanuts grown out of \nState during the 1995 crop year.\n  These individuals are only allowed to enter out of State grown \npeanuts \n\n[[Page S905]]\nequivalent to those entered into the pool during the 1995 crop year.\n  Some may ask, why is this so important? First, Valencia peanuts fill \na unique niche within the peanut market and New Mexico produces the \nmajority of all Valencia peanuts nationwide.\n  Second, the New Mexico industry uses self-regulation so that all \nquota and additional peanuts are bought back, keeping the pool \nprofitable and costing the Federal Government very little or nothing at \nall.\n  In fact, from 1992 to 1995 the New Mexico pool had positive net \nreceipts of $3.1 million.\n  Third, the New Mexico peanut industry contributes economically to the \nState. The New Mexico peanut commission estimates that the peanut \nindustry has an economic impact of $55.6 million in Roosevelt County \nwhere the majority of the Valencia peanuts are grown.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that some on the other side of the \naisle have charged that Republicans have delayed writing a farm bill \nand that the agriculture portions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 \nwere done without hearings.\n  I would like to say that is simply not the case.\n  First, the Republican budget included commodity provisions in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995 but the President vetoed that bill.\n  The Agriculture Committee held 15 thorough farm bill hearings \ninvolving 157 witnesses. The Budget Committee, which I chair, also had \ntwo hearings involving the budget aspects of the farm bill.\n  In fact, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, Mr. Lugar, and the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, \nMr. Conrad, testified before the Budget Committee.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                December 13, 1995.\n     William J. Clinton,\n     The President of the United States, Executive Office of the \n         President, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In recent statements on the Budget \n     Reconciliation Bill, you cited, among your priorities, the \n     need to ensure the strength of America's farmers. We agree \n     that the health and vitality of America's farm sector is \n     important. The way to ensure this long term vitality is to \n     reform obsolete farm programs, and to adapt farm policy to \n     the new realities of the world market and to farming today.\n       Reforms in the Reconciliation Conference Report offer \n     significant gains for farmers and the nation. We urge that \n     the substance of these reforms be maintained in the budget \n     negotiations between the White House and Congress. It is \n     right, after 60 years, to end government-imposed acreage \n     controls, to provide farmers the flexibility to make their \n     own planting decisions, to keep price supports at competitive \n     levels, and to limit spending on deficiency payments.\n       The proposals in Secretary Glickman's ``Blue Book'' \n     guidance to Congress, together with reductions in deficiency \n     payment acreage that you have since recommended, are steps in \n     the right direction. The further reforms of the Conference \n     Report provide an opportunity to go beyond those improvements \n     in the structure of farm programs to establish a basis for a \n     government role in agriculture that is suitable for the 21st \n     century. The opportunity to do this in a bipartisan way in \n     the current budget negotiations should not be wasted.\n       We are troubled by proposals from some in the agriculture \n     community to roll back the clock by supporting farm prices \n     above long-term market clearing levels. We strongly support \n     authority for the Secretary to insure from year to year that \n     U.S. farm prices are competitive in world markets. High and \n     rigid price supports will either lose export markets, or will \n     again open up an unlimited and untenable pipeline to the \n     Treasury to finance surplus acquisition and disposal.\n       The history of the 1980s should convince anyone that \n     setting U.S. price support levels above long-term market \n     clearing levels is terribly unwise. While the outlook for \n     exports is promising, the Secretary needs to be able to \n     respond to changes in market prospects without waiting for \n     the next farm bill.\n       Advocates of fixed and high price supports argue that \n     marketing loans make such supports workable. Nothing could be \n     further from the truth. Open-ended budget exposure on \n     marketing loans could again lead to exorbitant spending, to \n     the use of acreage controls to limit costs, to lost export \n     markets, and to an eventual public decision to end the farm \n     safety net.\n       If more money becomes available for farm programs as a \n     result of changes in budget assumptions, we urge you to use \n     it for high priority programs of research, conservation, and \n     rural development, and to ease the transition of commercial \n     farmers to a market-based agricultural policy.\n       We urge you not to repeat the mistakes of the past that \n     priced U.S. farm products out of world markets, placed \n     farmers in a production strait-jacket, and raised farm \n     program spending to embarrassing and unsustainable levels.\n           Yours sincerely,\n       Prof. Willard W.

Mr. President, I rise to support the motion to invoke \ncloture on the Farm bill before the Senate today. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this motion so that the Senate may move to \nconsideration of the merits of the bill. Those who crafted this \nlegislation have been working day and night to put together a package \nthat would allow for the farm legislation to proceed. The legislation \noffers flexibility, certainty and opportunity for America's farmers.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that we enact farm legislation soon. \nFailure to act this year leaves us with bleak alternatives. Reversion \nto 1938 and 1949 laws could dramatically increase the cost of running \nthe farm programs. Extending current programs only delays the need to \nmake significant reforms in a 60-year-old farm program.\n  Hoosier farmers, and farmers across America, need payment assurances \nand guidance in planting decisions. The compromise legislation would \nprovide fixed payments to program farmers and allow farmers to plant \nany program crop. The compromise also contains meaningful conservation \nand nutrition proposals. At the same time, this legislation would work \ntoward reducing Federal spending.\n  The Senate should not overlook this opportunity to move forward and \npass farm legislation. We should not miss the opportunity to initiate \nchange and institute reform in the Nation's farm policies.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the cloture \nmotion on the Leahy-Craig substitute to S. 1541, and in support of the \nbill.\n  I am pleased to join my New England colleague, Senator Leahy, and my \nfriend from Idaho, Senator Craig, as a cosponsor of this important \nbill. As everyone realizes, we must pass new farm legislation as \nquickly as possible. Farmers in many parts of the country who rely on \nFederal farm programs are already making planting decisions, and they \nneed some certainty on this matter. But farmers are not the only ones \nwith a stake in the prompt passage of this bill.\n  If we do not pass farm legislation quickly, policy reverts to \nagricultural laws dating to 1949 and 1938. And under these statutes, \nthe cost of our farm programs could skyrocket, adding up to $10 or $12 \nbillion in additional costs to the Treasury in 1996. Obviously, given \nthe continuing fiscal crisis that we have in the Federal Government, \nand given the year-long struggle to pass a 7-year balanced budget plan, \nwe cannot allow that to happen. In fact, our fiscal reality dictates \nthat we make significant additional reductions in current farm spending \nauthorized under the 1990 farm bill, and the Leahy-Craig substitute \nwill generate these additional savings from the present baseline.\n  Mr. President, although the great majority of Maine farmers do not \ndepend on or even use Federal commodity \n\n[[Page S906]]\nprograms, the Leahy-Craig substitute contains a couple of provisions of \ngreat importance to Maine farmers. First, the substitute retains a \nprovision that was included in S. 1541 which preserves the existing \nrestriction on planting fruits and vegetables on what we previously \ncalled flex acres. Both the Leahy-Craig substitute and S. 1541 refer to \nall program acres as contract acres, but we still had a problem in \nearlier versions of S. 1541 whereby commodity crop farmers would have \nbeen able to grow any crop on unpaid contract acreage.\n  This was a problem because it would place nonprogram fruit and \nvegetable growers at a distinct disadvantage in competition with \nprogram farmers who grow the same fruit and vegetable crops. The \ndisadvantage arises from the fact that farmers who grow a program crop \nlike wheat, along with a vegetable like potatoes, can use the \nGovernment support payments for wheat to bolster their potato business. \nPotato farmers in Maine, on the other hand, who do not grow any program \ncrops, do not have a guaranteed source of revenues that they can rely \non to support their farm operations.\n  Senator Lugar, the author of S. 1541, and Senators Leahy and Craig \nhave listened very intently to the concerns of full-time fruit and \nvegetable farmers, and they addressed this matter with an even hand. \nSenator Lugar even met with Maine potato farmers to discuss this \nproblem. The substitute prohibits the planting of most fruits and \nvegetables, including potatoes, on contract acres. Senators Lugar, \nLeahy, and Craig have demonstrated considerable leadership on this \nissue, and they deserve to be commended for it.\n  The other provision in the substitute that I would like to \nspecifically mention concerns dairy farming. Section 108 provides the \nconsent of the Congress to the Northeast Interstate Diary Compact. This \ncompact was drafted, negotiated, and signed between all of the New \nEngland States to help remedy a serious problem throughout that region: \nthe rapid loss of the family dairy farm.\n  The compact creates a regional commission which has the authority to \nset minimum prices paid to farmers for fluid, or class I milk. \nDelegations from each State comprise the voting membership of the \ncommission, and these delegations in turn will include both farmer and \nconsumer representatives. The minimum price established by the \ncommission is the Federal market order price plus a small ``over-\norder'' differential that would be paid by milk processing plants in \nthe region. This over-order price is capped in the compact, and a two-\nthirds voting majority of the commission is required before any over-\norder price can be instituted.\n  Mr. President, we desperately need this dairy compact in New England. \nThe current Federal order price for this region does not come close to \nreflecting the farmers' cost of production. As a result, we are losing \nfamily farms at a consistent and rapid rate, and their loss impacts the \nrural economy and the municipal tax bases of many small New England \ntowns.\n  The people of New England--farmers, consumers, processors, and public \nofficials--devised the compact as a solution to this problem, and it is \nwisely limited in scope. The compact only applies to class I fluid \nmilk, and since we have a largely self-contained fluid milk market in \nour region, the compact will not harm farmers or processors in other \nregions of the country. There is no good reason not to support the \nefforts of the people of New England to solve one of their own \nproblems. We should praise them for their ingenuity and self-reliance. \nI am very pleased that Senators Leahy and Craig have recognized the \nmerits of this proposal, and have agreed to include it in their \nsubstitute.\n  Mr. President, the Leahy-Craig substitute will generate substantial \nsavings for the taxpayers, and it will give farmers more flexibility. \nIt will address the concerns of many fruit and vegetable growers, and \ndairy farmers. Given the fiscal implications of not passing a farm \nbill, all Senators have an important stake in at least the completion \nof debate on the farm bill. Senators Leahy, Craig, Lugar, Dole, and \nmany others have done a tremendous amount of work of the substitute \nbefore us, and the Senate must be allowed to finish action on it. I \nurge my colleagues to vote for cloture and for passage of the Leahy-\nCraig substitute.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Leahy \nsubstitute farm bill.\n  The Leahy substitute farm bill, is at its core, essentially the \nfreedom-to-farm bill. The provisions contained in the Leahy substitute \nwere never debated in committee, were not passed as part of the Senate \nbudget reconciliation bill, but were instead approved in conference.\n  I have some strong reservations regarding the freedom-to-farm bill, \nalthough I too, share the concerns of each Member of this body that \nfarmers need immediate certainty. The farmers in Alabama experienced a \ndisastrous year in 1995 with a drought, insect infestations and even a \nhurricane or two. These farmers have suffered a great deal and the \npayments in freedom to farm appear very attractive. However, the \nguaranteed payments freedom to farm offers are made in exchange for a \nphaseout of farm programs. I disagree strongly with phasing out farm \nprograms.\n  The efforts undertaken by the Department of Agriculture to address \nthe disastrous crop year and subsequent financial hardship provides \nanother option for American agriculture. The USDA has announced its \nintention to allow for extended repayment of advance deficiency \npayments, with the interest waived in some cases. This effort should be \napplauded. I also think that the discussion regarding the forgiveness \nof 1995 advance deficiency payments warrant some merit. I believe that \nwe can provide income stability for our farmers without demanding the \nphaseout of farm programs in return.\n  The core component of sound farm policy should be an adequate and \ncertain safety net, one that provides support when market prices are \nlow, and one that does not need to make payments when the market is up. \nThis is how current farm programs are structured, and they work.\n  I have long stated that I believe that the current structure of farm \nprograms have served rural America, and consumers everywhere, extremely \nwell. Therefore, it is my belief that farm programs should only be fine \ntuned. I do recognize that some of my less fortunate regional \ncolleagues feel that farm programs that affect their States need \ngreater changes than those that affect the South. The ability to \nresolve these differences is the purpose of debate on farm programs. \nwhich to this point has been very little in committee, where farm \nprograms are supposed to be written. Therefore, I recommend that we \nreturn to committee and discuss the farm bill as we always have in the \npast. We would then be able to bring a bill to the floor that addresses \nall of our needs and concerns, and pass a bill that serves our \nagricultural producers, rural America and consumers alike.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S899-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S906-S907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, China is making bellicose statements about \nTaiwan. This morning's Washington Post begins an editorial with these \nwords:\n\n       If it came to that, the United States would have no choice \n     but to help Taiwan--a flourishing free-market democracy--\n     defend itself against attack by Communist China. No treaty or \n     law compels this response, but decency and strategic interest \n     demand it. An American Government that allowed the issue of \n     Taiwan's future be settled by China's force would be in \n     disgrace as well as in error.\n\n  Mr. President, the best way to avoid force or to avoid giving a \ndictator and a dictatorship the appetite that will not be satisfied \nwith conquering one area is to make clear that that will be resisted by \nthe community of nations. I am not talking about the use of American \ntroops, but I think American air power clearly ought to be brought to \nbear if such an eventuality should take place.\n  If China is permitted to grab Taiwan, I think it will be only a \nmatter of time before China takes Mongolia and other areas. I think the \nbest way of maintaining stability in that area of the world is to be \nfirm.\n  I heard my colleague, Senator Feinstein, refer to our policy toward \nChina as one of zigzagging. I think that is a correct analysis of what \nwe are doing. I think we ought to be firm; we ought to be positive. I \nwant to have good relations with China, but China should not think for \na moment that she can invade Taiwan without having serious problems.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to have printed in the Record \nthe Washington Post editorial and also an A.M. Rosenthal op-ed piece in \nthe New York Times, ``Washington Confronts China.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 6, 1996]\n\n                        If China Attacks Taiwan\n\n       If it came to that, the United States would have no choice \n     but to help Taiwan--a flourishing free-market democracy--\n     defend itself against attack by Communist China. No treaty or \n     law compels this response, but decency and strategic interest \n     demand it. An American government that allowed the issue of \n     Taiwan's future to be settled by China's force would be in \n     disgraced as well as in error.\n       This is what the United States should be conveying, and \n     China pondering, as Beijing steps up military pressure on \n     Taiwan. Down that road lies a possible direct confrontation \n     with Washington. Even starting out on that road carries heavy \n     risks for China. Especially dangerous is any possibility that \n     Beijing may be setting out under the dubious and smug \n     impression that the United States will back off and leave \n     China with no heavy costs to pay at all.\n       But, of course, to be faced with an actual decision on \n     rescuing a threatened Taiwan would itself signify a \n     calamitous American policy failure. There is overwhelming \n     national need and also adequate time to keep today's friction \n     from becoming tomorrow's explosion.\n       The ever more glaring contrast between Beijing's \n     totalitarianism and Taipei's American-nursed democracy, and \n     the end of the Cold War, have weakened the 20-year-old \n     international formulas supporting China's peaceful \n     reunification with its wayward province. A significant \n     opposition in Taiwan now favors independence. The government, \n     coming up on Taiwan's first democratic presidential election, \n     has had to bend, in part by seeking official American visas \n     for its leaders, thus provoking Beijing. The Clinton \n     administration has been slow to grant the visas, not wishing \n     to aggravate its other tensions with China. American \n     legislators of different stripes have come to Taiwan's side, \n     further provoking Beijing.\n       Broad, forward-looking ``dialogue'' with China has been out \n     of style in Washington since George Bush imprudently sent \n     secret emissaries to Beijing after the Tiananmen massacre. \n     Fighting fires has been in. This is a fire. The United States \n     needs to encourage calming gestures by Taiwan (suspend the \n     visa provocations) and China (suspend the thuggish threats). \n     At home, it needs to reach a policy consensus with Congress \n     in order to better show China that it cannot squeeze Taipei \n     and to convey to Taiwan that it should not set about \n     deliberately and recklessly on a policy of trying to draw the \n     United States into an escalating showdown with Beijing. Then \n     the two sides can return to the irregular but peaceful \n     relationship they were pursuing before.\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n                       Washington Confronts China\n\n                          (By A.M. Rosenthal)\n\n       Washington has chosen the issue on which it will at last \n     acknowledge and confront Chinese Communist action detrimental \n     to the United States.\n       There was a considerable list to choose from. China \n     threatens daily missile attacks against Taiwan. Beijing sells \n     missiles to Iran and other Mideast dictatorships. At home it \n     increases arrests and jail sentences for dissidents. It \n     allows Internet use to only a relative handful, and from now \n     on only through government-controlled ports.\n       Each act involves the U.S. An attack on Taiwan would force \n     U.S. involvement. Sales of missiles endanger Mideast peace \n     and defy U.S. policy against proliferation of high-tech \n     weapons.\n       Increasing repression and closing access to international \n     information is a slap at the U.S. Washington had assured the \n     world of the opposite--that freedoms would increase in China \n     after the 1994 Clinton Administration decision not to use \n     economic pressure to ease oppression.\n       Well, enough is enough. Washington now says it will show \n     its staunch determination to resist Chinese provocation--\n     about compact disks. If China does not stop counterfeiting \n     these disks, the Administration will increase tariffs on \n     Chinese goods by as much as $1 billion.\n       Any commercial piracy costs manufacturers and artists money \n     and should be opposed. But to appreciate the CD episode fully \n     it helps to have a taste for bitter comedy.\n       1. The Communists will not keep any new promise better than \n     they keep existing ones--or others, like ending slave-labor \n     exports to the U.S.\n       2. If they do camouflage piracy better, they will demand \n     concessions--like even tighter zipping of the U.S. mouth on \n     human rights.\n       3. The U.S. announcement accentuates the moral disaster of \n     Clintonian policy on China. \n\n[[Page S908]]\n     CD's yes, people no. Mr. Clinton broke his promise to use tariff \n     pressure to persuade Beijing to treat its Chinese and Tibetan \n     political victims less viciously--maybe a mite less torture. \n     Beijing answers by increasing, not decreasing, political \n     oppression. He acts surprised.\n       Democrats and Republican politicians talk about the danger \n     of cynicism. But they expect Americans not to see the \n     cynicism of putting CD's above the blood of dissidents in \n     China's gulags.\n       Worse, they may be right. I do not hear American university \n     students or professors mobilizing against Chinese Communist \n     cruelties, or consumers organizing a boycott like the one \n     that helped kill South African apartheid.\n       If war comes to Taiwan, it will not be because Beijing \n     believes its lie that Taiwan is preparing to declare its \n     deserved independence. It will be because 100 miles off \n     China's shore, Chinese people have created a society that is \n     both prosperous and democratic. That so terrifies the \n     perpetually insecure Politburo that it risks war--not only \n     against Taiwanese independence of government but Taiwanese \n     independence of mind.\n       Beijing uses missile threats to intimidate Taiwanese into \n     voting for a party that is running on a pro-China platform \n     and against independent-minded opponents.\n       The Taiwan Relations Act, passed by Congress in 1979, says \n     that U.S. recognition of Communist China rests on the \n     expectation that Taiwan's future will be determined by \n     peaceful means.\n       The law states that any effort to determine Taiwan's future \n     by other than peaceful means--which includes threats of daily \n     missile attacks--are of grave concern to the U.S. and should \n     be ``promptly'' reported by the President to Congress.\n       The President has not done that, promptly or at all. Nor \n     has Congress demanded it, despite some members' attempts. Mr. \n     Gingrich and Mr. Dole, the agenda-setters, become accomplices \n     in the President's decision to ignore U.S. law.\n       Restraint is needed, we are told by U.S. officials and some \n     journalists--we do not want a war over Taiwan, do we? Of \n     course not. That is what facing the possibility is all about.\n       As long as Congress and President ignore their legal \n     obligation to deal with China's threat to Taiwan, decide what \n     steps to take and let China know, Beijing will believe it can \n     attack Taiwan or keep terrorizing it, with no risk.\n       That is not restraint of confrontation that could lead to \n     war. It is the blundering encouragement of both. How terribly \n     many times must we learn?\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I see the majority leader is on the floor, \nand I yield the floor to him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S907-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S908-S912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AGRICULTURAL MARKET TRANSITION ACT OF 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator from Illinois. I want Members to know I \nhave had a brief visit with the distinguished Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle. We have now asked staff on each side to see if they \ncan sit down and work out a series of amendments on each side on the \nfarm bill and work into the evening and work tomorrow and set a time \ncertain for action on something, say 6 o'clock. That means we would \nhave, if there is an agreement--we do not have it yet, we just \nstarted--so if there is an agreement, then there would be votes \ntonight, there would be votes tomorrow.\n  It is my hope that part of that agreement, if in fact one is reached, \nwould be a recess period until the 26th of February, because many, \nincluding many of the staff in the Senate, have been here right around \nthe clock through the Christmas holidays and New Year's.\n  In any event, that is all we can advise our colleagues at this time. \nIf we have any additional information, we will pass it on. So I cannot \nput out the no-vote signs. There could be votes tonight. We will let \nyou know as soon as we can.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota, [Mr. Grams] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise at this time to discuss an amendment \nthat had been filed by Senator Kennedy to S. 1521, the farm bill. Like \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, and also the chairman of the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee, Senator Kassebaum, I do support health care \nreform--specifically, improvements such as health insurance portability \nand putting an end to discrimination against those with preexisting \nconditions.\n  As both a Member of the House and the Senate, I have worked for such \nreforms, and I look forward to supporting such legislation in the near \nfuture. But as they say, timing is everything. There are undoubtedly \nmany people watching the Senate asking themselves what the Senator from \nMassachusetts is up to. I must confess to being one of them.\n  The purpose of the farm bill was to give our Nation's farmers and the \npeople they work with a clear roadmap of Federal farm policy with which \nto make the decisions this year about planting, equipment purchases, \nand loans. Given that that question remains, why would the Senator have \nbeen offering an amendment dealing with health insurance to the farm \nbill? In all honesty, I still do not know. It does not make sense. \nUnfortunately, a lot of what goes on sometimes does not make a lot of \nsense.\n  For example, last Thursday night, a hotline call from the majority \nleader's office was made to find out if there were any objections to \nbringing up for consideration the Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance \nlegislation--the very subject matter of the Senator's amendment filed \nby the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Upon receiving this call, I requested more time to review the \nlegislation.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I have always taken my responsibility to \nstudy the legislation considered by the Senate seriously--to examine \nits implications, to detect any possible unforeseen consequences, and \nto evaluate it on the basis of the needs and concerns of the people I \nrepresent--the taxpayers of Minnesota.\n  This is the way we Minnesotans make our decisions--carefully and \nthoughtfully. We do not have a reputation for simply rubberstamping the \nbills that affect us and the rest of the Nation. When we put our seal \nof approval on something, it is done with the utmost care and thought.\n  Perhaps this is a bigger deal in Minnesota than it is in Washington. \nBut it should not be.\n  As a result, I simply asked that the request for a time agreement \nwait until I had had a chance to conduct my review. But as usual, \nthings have been blown out of proportion, and as a result, we may be \nfaced with the Kennedy amendment--a proposal that should make as little \nsense in Washington as it does in Minnesota.\n  Having studied the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation, I have come to the \nconclusion that it would be counterproductive to take this matter up \nright now at a time when the Federal Government has much unfinished \nbusiness left on its plate.\n  As a taxpayer, I can not understand why the Senate would move to the \nissue of health insurance reform, without some assurances to the \nAmerican people that we and the President will complete the business \nbefore us--balancing the budget, saving Medicare from bankruptcy, \nproviding tax relief to taxpaying families so they can afford \ninsurance, and reforming the welfare system.\n  Before we go on to other issues and other agendas, shouldn't all of \nus--Republicans and Democrats--make every effort possible to carry out \nthe taxpayer's agenda?\n  This question is even more critical, given that the President's own \nhealth care financing administration projects that the Medicare \nProgram, for the first time in 23 years, faces a deficit and will go \nbankrupt sooner than anyone had previously predicted.\n  Does it make any sense to rush ahead on health insurance reform at a \ntime when the Medicare Program faces insolvency? I think not.\n  Back in November, Congress gave President Clinton an opportunity to \naddress this problem--by passing a Medicare reform proposal which would \nhave saved the trust fund from bankruptcy, while expanding health care \noptions available to senior citizens.\n  Now, they say that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure--\nand had the President followed this sound advice and signed the bill, \nwe would not be in this mess in the first place.\n  Well, he did not sign the bill, we are in this mess, and now some \nMembers of the Senate want to move ahead on their agenda without \naddressing the Medicare crisis. These some Members want to move ahead \non their agenda without addressing the primary concerns of the \ntaxpayers, such as the balanced budget, tax relief, and welfare reform. \n\n\n[[Page S909]]\n\n  Former Speaker Sam Rayburn used to say, ``To get along, go along.'' \nWell, I think we have been going along for too long in this Chamber, \nand it has been at the expense of taxpayers and senior citizens. Their \nneeds must be heard.\n  For this reason, I intend to offer a substitute to the Kennedy \namendment--it simply requires that Congress and the President will \nfirst resolve the current Medicare crisis and put the program on a path \ntoward solvency before turning to any other health care legislation.\n  In doing so, we will give our assurance to taxpayers and senior \ncitizens that the Senate will face this crisis directly and not turn \nits back on the people we represent.\n  In addition, I will ask that the unanimous-consent agreement on \nconsideration of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill be amended such that \nconsideration of the bill will not take place until after April 15--tax \nday.\n  At the very least, Congress and the President can use this time to do \nwhat we were elected to do--balance the budget, reform welfare, and \nprovide tax relief for middle-class Americans.\n  To those who say it cannot be done, I say the tools are there--they \nhave been all year. What Washington lacks is the will to do its job. \nMaybe today, we can help turn this around and get back to doing the \npeople's business in a way that makes sense both here in Washington and \nacross the country.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me put a correction in the Record. My \nunderstanding is that in their caucus the majority party handed out a \nlist of amendments that had been filed at the desk and awaiting debate \non the farm bill. In the handout in the majority caucus, on page 3 of \nthe list is an amendment No. 3205, with my name, Senator Dorgan, on \nemergency relief for refiners.\n  Well, I have not offered such an amendment. I have offered amendments \nthat are numbered 3206 and 3207. My office has received calls from \npeople who have gotten hold of this handout and wondered what on Earth \nam I doing. This is a mistake by somebody. I hope they will correct \nthat in their next handout. There is no reason to believe it was \ndeliberate.\n  I have trouble enough defending the record I create around here as it \nexists, let alone defending something I have not introduced nor \noffered, and would not support. I do not know what this amendment is, \nbut I would not be offering amendments dealing with refiners.\n  In any event, I want people to know this is not correct, and I hope \nit will be corrected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair)\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, as Laurel used to say, ``We have gotten \nourselves into a fine fix.''\n  There is something about this whole thing that obviously is eluding \nme. I must confess that a lot of my farmers, or at least the \norganizations, have gone from being violently opposed to the freedom-\nto-farm bill to now favoring it. While I understand that--and I \ncertainly am not in any position to criticize some of the farmers in my \nState who now favor freedom to farm--I still believe that the vast \nmajority of the farmers in my State, particularly rice farmers--and \nthere are thousands of them, as we produce 40 percent of all the rice \nin the country--farmers, in my opinion, would ultimately be devastated \nwhen the freedom-to-farm bill passes. Cotton and wheat are different \nmatters.\n\n  I think the best description of the freedom-to-farm bill I have heard \nwas one that was given in caucus the other day by the senior Senator \nfrom North Dakota, Senator Conrad, when he said the freedom-to-farm \nbill is like the Kool-Aid that Jimmy Jones gave all his devotees when \nthey were drinking poison. It tastes good going down, but it is fatal.\n  The freedom-to-farm bill simply says, and I do not embellish or \nexaggerate, for example, if you plant cotton and the target price that \nhas been set by Congress on cotton is about 72 cents or 74 cents a \npound--I think 74 cents a pound; cotton right now in New York is \nselling for a lot more than that--that means under the existing \nprogram, the taxpayers of this country, because cotton is bringing more \nthan the target price, would not cost the taxpayers one nickel. If you \nare getting 85 cents to 89 cents a pound, you are above the target \nprice. There are a lot of things--from weather to pests--that can cause \nyou not to produce as much cotton as you normally do, but that is true \nin any circumstance.\n  To proceed with the story, we will assume that during the marketing \nperiod this fall during which we determine how much more or less than \nthe target price cotton brought during those 5 months, assume that \ncotton brings substantially more than the target price. Under the \nfreedom-to-farm bill, for purposes of making the point, assume that \nfarmers make a bale and a half to two bales an acre. That is a very \ngood crop, but assume they do. Assume, further, that they get 85 cents \na pound. I promise, under normal circumstances, that is very \nprofitable.\n  What does the freedom-to-farm bill do? It gives them 7 cents a pound \nmore, above that price. That is like that Kool-Aid that tastes so good, \nbut 3 years from now it is not 7 cents, it is something less, and at \nthe end of 7 years it is zero. If cotton has to be selling for 65 or 70 \ncents a pound, do not come crying to the Federal Government for some \nkind of subsidy.\n  Why would we do this at a time when the programs that we have had in \nexistence for many years are working? Madam President, in 1995 \ncommodity prices--wheat, corn and cotton, especially, but other grains, \ntoo--were so high that we came in on farm subsidy expenditures $4 \nbillion less than the baseline. In other words, $4 billion less than we \nthought we would have to pay out.\n  We would think this place would be rhapsodic because we saved $4 \nbillion because commodity prices are good. No, we want to sing this \nsiren song to the farmers saying, ``Go along with us. We will cut your \nthroat down the road, but you will get rich for 2 or 3 years before we \nget around to it.''\n  I gave you the illustration of cotton, but that is true of every \ncommodity. All the commodity prices right now are very good, with the \nexception of rice. If we did not have target prices for rice right now, \nI am not sure what, if any, percent of the 40 percent of the Nation's \nrice crop we produce in Arkansas would be produced. Maybe none. Farmers \nare not known to plant when they know they will lose money on the front \nend. They do not ever intend to lose money. It just happens.\n\n  I have an amendment, if I ever get an opportunity to offer it, which \nwould simply extend the present farm program for 1 year. We ought to \nadopt that amendment right now and then start amending it. If there are \nthings that people want to change about the existing programs, let them \namend it. If there are things about rural development in America, let \nthem add it to that amendment. Do not get out on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate and try to craft a bill that half the Members know nothing \nabout, do not understand, and which, in my opinion, is terrible for the \nAmerican farmer.\n  Madam President, I am dismayed and disheartened and saddened that the \npositions I have just stated are probably not going to prevail. All I \nam saying is it makes imminent good sense to extend the existing \nprogram, which, as I pointed out a moment ago as graphically as I know \nhow, is succeeding. It is doing precisely what those of us in the past \nmany years have said would happen.\n  The present farm program is key to market prices of commodities. The \nfreedom-to-farm bill is not key to anything except the demise of the \nfarmer. They say that it will represent a $12 billion savings over the \nnext 7 years. Maybe yes, maybe no. Who knows? When you talk about \nsaving $12 billion, assume for the sake of art they know exactly what \nthey are talking about, and they do to some extent. You can put this in \na computer and come up with a figure, and they have done it.\n  If we were $4 billion under the baseline in 1995, and commodity \nprices right now are higher than they were in 1995, there is an \nexcellent chance that 1996 will be further under the baseline than 1995 \nwas. At least the farmers have that safety net under them. The farmer \nwho raises cotton is going to get that 7 cents a pound I alluded to a \nmoment ago, regardless of what the market rice is. The farmer who gets \nthat extra 7 cents is going to be pretty well-to-do. \n\n[[Page S910]]\n\n  Another thing about it that drives me up the wall, do not plant your \ncotton. Do not plant anything. We will still give you 7 cents a pound \nwhether you put a plow or a seed in the ground. Come on the floor of \nthe Senate and propose a program like that for 17-year-old poor \npregnant girls and you will have a revolution on your hands here.\n  Farmers are not interested in welfare. I guess they could be bought \noff with this. But it is welfare. You can call it anything you want. \nThat is what it amounts to. We are doing this while we are saying that \nwe hope poor children in this country will get treated under Medicaid, \nbut we are not guaranteeing anything.\n  So, you are going to see ``60 Minutes,'' ``Prime Time Live,'' ``20/\n20.'' They will be scouring all the expensive vacation places in the \ncountry, trying to find farmers who have taken this 7 cents a pound. \nMaybe they planted, maybe they did not. They get the money anyway--\nagain, whether they farm or not. What kind of a farm program is that, \nMadam President?\n  So let me just close by saying something sort of unrelated to this. \nHere we are debating whether or not we are going to give farmers all \nthis money as a gift, for doing nothing, and the big debate going on in \nMedicare and Medicaid is, for example in Medicaid, shall we make it an \nentitlement as it is now or shall we make it a block grant? And what \nare the politics of those two?\n  The other day I spoke to the hospital administrators. This is off the \nsubject of farming, but one of the hospital administrators asked me a \nquestion. What is our policy on something or other? It was a very good \nquestion.\n  I said, you know, you would never make it here. You are not supposed \nto ask what the policy is in regard to the future of the country, or \nwhat our real values are. You are supposed to worry about does this \nhelp Steve Forbes or Bill Clinton? Those are the questions you are \nsupposed to ask around here. So it is with Medicaid. The question \nshould not be, Are we going to make it an entitlement or a block grant? \nThe question ought to be, Are we going to allow children to go without \nhealth care because they are poor? That is the question. It is just \nthat simple. That ought to be the policy first. Then you work out the \ndetails later.\n  So it is with the budget. If I were a youngster running for Governor \nagain, like I was one time, I would say--and as I do now, to my \nconstituents--the values the people of this country cherish do not \nchange very much from year to year. Things change. Health care delivery \nchanges. Highways change. Television programming and movies change. \nEverything changes. But what we profess to believe as our values do not \nchange very much. If I were running for office I would say: Look, \nbalancing the budget is one of our values in this country. All of us \nbelieve in fiscal responsibility. We do not act like it sometimes, but \nif you ask people do you believe in that, the answer is yes.\n  Have you ever heard anybody answer the question, do you want to \nbalance the budget--have you ever heard anybody answer that in the \nnegative? Of course not. You never will. It is a value in this country. \nOnce you get past that value you have to ask yourself what are the \nother values in that budget that we cherish most?\n  Winston Churchill said, you can tell more about a civilization by the \nway they treat their elderly than any other way. So let us just take \nthat first. Everybody believes in Medicare. They believe in Medicaid \nthat provides nursing home care for poor people.\n  I do not mind telling you, Madam President, I get letters from people \nwho chastise me about something I said on the floor, or some value I \narticulated on the floor, and especially sometimes from wealthy people. \nWhy do you not do this? Or why do you not do that? I know, a lot of \ntimes wealthy people have Aunt Lucy in a nursing home on Medicaid. I \nused to have a nursing home many years ago. I know--I know that some of \nthose people who are rabid about cutting Medicaid or something else, if \nyou say we are going to kick Aunt Lucy out of the nursing home you will \nhear a different song. Because we value elderly people. We want them \ntaken care of. We do not want them on the streets. We do not want them \nabused. We want them to have good care and we pay for it at a very, \nvery handsome price.\n\n  And our children. As I said, there is not a soul in this body, I do \nnot think, who, if you said you are going to have to pay more taxes or \nyou are going to see children on the streets desperately in need of a \nhome and of health care, who would not say I will pay it.\n  Then you say, would you be willing to pay more taxes if it went for \neducation? I have never seen a poll that said no to that. If you call \nit welfare that is one thing. If you call it poor children it comes out \nquite differently.\n  So, Madam President, I made sort of a rambling speech. I might say \none other thing just as an aside. I saw in last Friday's Post that some \n20 so-called moderate Republicans in the House said, ``We are willing \nto forgo the tax cut.'' Bully for them. It is an oxymoron, to talk \nabout cutting taxes and balancing the budget.\n  I do not know what kind of condition the Medicare system is in. I saw \nthe story in the New York Times yesterday. It is much worse than any of \nus thought. But I still maintain that if the House Speaker and the \nnegotiators in the Senate and the President would all forgo the tax \ncut, the rest of it will fall into place. You have all the time in the \nworld to cut taxes. You are rolling the dice when you cut taxes because \nyou are betting that everything GAO or CBO said would happen in the \nbudget will come true. Wait 3 years. If it has come true, then cut \ntaxes. Do not do it now and wish you had not.\n  So, I compliment those moderate Republicans over there who have had \nthe courage to defy their leadership and say something which I think is \neminently sensible.\n  So, Madam President, fiscal responsibility, the elderly, our \nchildren, education, the environment--those are our values. I do not \ncare how nasty the mood in this country is, and we all know it is \npretty nasty, I still would not hesitate to run and not ever talk about \nanything but the four things I just mentioned.\n  So, I wish that wise and sane heads would prevail and we could get \nsomething done on this farm bill. For example, extend the present bill. \nWe have no business trying to craft a farm bill on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate. Extend the present bill for a year. If there are parts of \nthat you disagree with, offer an amendment to do something about it. \nChange it, but do not take a bill that was immensely unpopular last \nsummer, with all the farm groups--Chairman Roberts could not even get \nit out of his committee in the House--and all of a sudden it is our \nsalvation.\n  I say, I hope saner heads will prevail and that will happen.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I voted for cloture on the Leahy-Dole \nsubstitute to S. 1541 because I believe it is essential that the \nCongress act on and approve legislation to reform national farm policy \nand to reauthorize vital agricultural conservation and nutrition \nprograms.\n  The existing authorization for the numerous nutrition, conservation \nand commodity programs that comprise the so-called ``omnibus farm \nbill'' expired during 1995. Regrettably, the Republican leadership did \nnot choose to bring reauthorization legislation to the floor prior to \nits expiration, or even in the intervening months since expiration. \nWhile Senators Daschle, Leahy and many others have called repeatedly \nfor a thorough debate of and action on farm policy for nearly a year \nnow, no comprehensive farm bill was brought to the Senate floor for \nconsideration until last week. This is yet another example of the way \nin which the Republican-led Congress is failing to get the people's \nwork done in Washington as it pursues its radical platform.\n  However, with the expiration in 1995 of the 1990 farm reauthorization \nlegislation, the 1949 Agricultural Act, a decades-old and outdated \nstatute authorizing farm commodity programs for wheat and grains \nsubsidies automatically again became the controlling statute. According \nto the Department of Agriculture, the 1949 law could substantially \nincrease, to an estimated $10 billion for 1996 alone, the federal \ntaxpayers' already-mammoth payments to farmers--an outcome that in my \nopinion would be sheer folly, especially at a time when prices for many \nfarm products are at record high levels.\n  Last week, Senator Dole decided to bring before the Senate the \nRepublican version of a farm bill which addresses \n\n[[Page S911]]\nonly commodity reform. I opposed the cloture motion on the Dole bill \nbecause it was not a comprehensive package--it failed to reauthorize \nthe vitally important nutrition programs or the valuable conservation \nprograms that together with farm provisions should form any responsible \ncomprehensive farm legislation.\n  After the failure of the Dole bill, Majority Leader Dole, Democratic \nLeader Daschle, Agriculture Committee Chairman Lugar, and Agriculture \nCommittee Ranking Democrat Leahy met for several hours and crafted an \noutline of a potential bipartisan compromise on farm policy. However, \nafter working for several days and throughout the weekend, the \nnegotiations unfortunately hit a brick wall, and Senator Dole called \nfor a cloture vote on a package that he previously had negotiated with \nSenators Leahy, Craig, and Lugar.\n  The Leahy-Dole substitute is a comprehensive, bipartisan package that \nadds to the Dole bill's farm provisions with the reauthorization of \nimportant nutrition programs upon which millions of poor Americans, \npreponderantly children and the elderly, rely for their health and \nwell-being, and farmland conservation programs on which farmers rely to \nhelp protect their farmlands from degradation.\n  The Leahy-Dole bill--as did the original Dole bill--replaces the \nexisting farm subsidy programs with a reform program geared toward \nweaning farmers off farm subsidies over a seven-year period expiring in \n2002. Few government programs cry as loudly for reform.\n  The subsidy programs for wheat and other grains have paid farmers \nmore than $135 billion in direct income support over the last 10 years. \nIn 1993, this conversion of tax dollars to support payments represented \n26 percent of net farm income. However, these subsidies consistently \nhave failed to bolster the incomes of the neediest farmers. Further, \nfive percent of the subsidies went to farmers whose annual gross \nincomes exceed $1 million. To compound the injury, these outdated \nprograms contribute to soil erosion and overuse of agricultural \nchemicals, retarding environmental progress, with the effect that \nAmericans pay twice for these farm programs: once for the subsidies and \nagain to clean up environmental damage that would be greatly reduced \nwithout the subsidies.\n  The Leahy-Dole proposal also reauthorizes key conservation programs \nlike the Conservation Reserve Program [CRP], with an authority to \nenroll up to 36 million acres. It is critical that the Federal \nGovernment assist farmers with environmental protection given that, as \na point of reference, farmlands constitute twice the acreage of the \nnational wildlife refuge system. The CRP plays an important role in the \nprotection of this rural acreage, contributing greatly to protection of \nsoil, water and wildlife habitat. The Environmental Quality Incentive \nProgram [EQIP] provides further assistance to this effort, making \navailable $200 million a year for technical and financial assistance to \nlivestock and crop producers who wish to address environmental problems \non their farms. The bill also restores the authority, on a voluntary \nbasis, for permanent and 30-year easements to protect wetlands.\n  In my view, no component of a so-called farm bill is more important \nthan the way it addresses national nutrition programs. The Leahy-Dole \npackage reauthorizes several vital nutrition programs for seven years: \nfood stamps, the emergency food assistance program [TEFAP], the \ncommodity supplemental food program--an alternative to the Women, \nInfants, and Children or WIC Nutrition Program in many cities--and the \nfood distribution program on Indian reservations. As just one \nillustration of how extensive is the impact of these nutrition \nprograms, 14 million children depend on food stamps to ensure they have \na minimally adequate diet.\n  Also included in the Leahy-Dole proposal is a provision that grants \nconsent of Congress to the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, using \nthe same language that passed the Senate last year with 65 votes. The \nNew England States want to improve the way milk is priced in their \nregion by creating a commission comprised of both farmers and consumers \nthat would have the authority to adjust and stabilize fluid milk prices \nin the six State area of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, \nConnecticut and Rhode Island. The New England Dairy Compact was \nsupported by all 12 of the region's Senators--from both parties and \nall points on the political spectrum--and would allow New England to \ntake more control of pricing the fluid milk produced there. This \ncompact is also consistent with the National Governors' Association's \nagricultural policy and is strongly supported by the New England \nGovernors' Association.\n\n  Madam President, I do not want my vote for cloture on the Leahy-Dole \nalternative to be mischaracterized as a total endorsement of this \npackage. This legislation is a long way from anything I could consider \neven adequate to meet our Nation's agricultural, economic, and \nnutrition needs, protect taxpayers and consumers, and protect the \nenvironment. I expect to offer at least one amendment to eliminate \nfunding for an unnecessary program that subsidizes foreign marketing of \nU.S. agricultural products, often by wealthy multinational \ncorporations, and will support efforts of other Senators to improve the \nbill.\n  But I concluded that I should support cloture based on the following \nfacts:\n  First, if we do not enact into law--and soon--some replacement for \nthe farm legislation that expired last year, American taxpayers will be \npaying far more than the already much-too-large sums in farm subsidies \nat a time when both our Federal budgetary problems and the farm economy \nindicate the desirability of reductions in those subsidies. I am \ncertain that a better bill could be devised; I have strong doubts it \nwill be devised and passed this year.\n  Second, no farm bill should be passed without strong nutrition and \nconservation components. Yet the Republicans who control both Houses \nhave proven they are entirely willing to do exactly that. Senator \nLeahy, in his negotiations, secured a commitment from Senator Dole and \nSenator Lugar, both men who honor their word, that the nutrition and \nconservation provisions will be retained in conference committee. No \none else has such a commitment for any nutrition or conservation \nprovisions, no matter how strong they might be willing to seek to make \nthose provisions.\n  Third, while I have grave doubts about the structure of the freedom \nto farm approach Republicans are taking toward reforming farm policy--\nthe approach used in the Leahy-Dole bill --I am certain that the farm \nprograms of the past have outlived any usefulness they may have had and \nmust be replaced. No other proposal being discussed comes anywhere \nclose to effecting the kinds and magnitude of reform that ought to take \nplace--to reduce the cost of these programs to taxpayers, to reduce the \nnegative incentives they establish for misuse of farm land and \nenvironmental damage, to reduce the amount of tax dollars that go to \nwealthy corporations and gentlemen farmers, and to focus the program \nresources on assisting needy family farmers.\n  The Leahy-Dole compromise at least contains components I think are \nvital--for nutrition and conservation--and carries with it a commitment \nto protect those provisions through conference. It at least moves away \nfrom a failed or obsolete farm policy and places subsidies on a \ndownward trend through 2002.\n  It is important that I serve notice that I will only vote for this \nlegislation if it is improved sufficiently during Senate action to \nwarrant that support. And I will oppose it if despite the commitments \nto the contrary it returns from conference committee with weaker \nnutrition or conservation provisions.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I hope we can fully debate the farm \nbill soon, and I will have more to say during that debate. Perhaps that \nwill take place this evening and tomorrow. If not, then I hope we \ndebate it very soon.\n  Farmers across the country need a farm bill. We are many months \noverdue. It is unfortunate that we are in this current situation \nbecause farmers need to plan, they need to arrange credit with their \nbankers, and they have a right to know what programs they will be \noperating under.\n  I voted in favor of cloture last week. I did so not because I support \nfreedom-\n\n[[Page S912]]\nto-farm. I don't. I favor long-term policy that would promote family \nagriculture and revitalize our rural economy. This is not that.\n  I believe freedom-to-farm is a dubious carrot followed by a very real \nstick. It would eliminate farm programs, ultimately leaving farmers to \nthe tender mercies of the grain companies and the railroads and the \nChicago Board of Trade during years when prices are low. I think in the \nlong term it could have disastrous effects on family farmers and our \nrural economy.\n  Some farmers believe that freedom-to-farm is the best deal they will \nget from this Congress. I understand that. Many in this Congress oppose \nfarm programs, and those people have made a credible threat to the \nfuture existence of farm programs. This plan offers farmers payments \nthis year even though prices are projected to be strong. And it \npromises to lock in at least some payments for 7 years. For some \nfarmers, even those who know that it is bad policy, that is attractive.\n  In fact, freedom-to-farm is bad policy. I will have more to say on \nthis subject when we get to actual debate on the bill.\n  I voted for cloture last week because I had told Minnesota farmers \nthat I didn't want to block its consideration. I had my amendments \nprepared. I was ready to debate. I still am. My strategy is not to \nblock or obstruct.\n  But I will vote against cloture today. I have very strong reasons for \ndoing so. And I am pleased to say that I do so on behalf of Minnesota \ndairy farmers, as I will explain in a moment.\n  First, I would like to point out that I have supported what I \nconsider to be genuine reform of farm programs. I cosponsored a 7-year \nproposal last year which I wish could have received a closer look from \nthe Senate and from farmers around the country in recent months. I \nstill believe it is the best approach.\n  My colleagues and I, led by the minority leader, proposed a long-\nterm, targeted marketing-loan approach. That plan would provide farmers \nthe planting flexibility they need. But it also would provide needed \nlong-term protection from some of the uncertainties that farmers face--\nuncertainties of weather, and of markets that are dominated by large \nmultinational companies. It also would target farm-program benefits to \nfamily-size farmers. I still hope we can vote on that proposal.\n  I also intend to propose at least one amendment, if not two, to save \nmoney by eliminating loopholes that allow some people to collect the \nmaximum farm payments three times. I want to use savings from that \nreform to raise loan rates for family farmers, or to help family-size \nfarmers to invest in their own value-added processing cooperatives and \nmarketing operations.\n  Now, however, I would like to address the effort represented by this \nsubstitute bill to dress up the freedom-to-farm proposal to attract \nvotes--to attract Democratic votes in order to get cloture. I \nespecially would like to address a provision that has been added which \nI consider to be a poison pill: the Northeast dairy compact.\n  I have to say that I've been working since I got here 5 years ago for \nmeaningful dairy market-order reform. Minnesota dairy farmers suffer \nterrible discrimination under the current Federal order system. I'm \nstrongly opposed to the Northeast dairy compact not only because it \nforestalls reform of that system. But it also cuts a special deal for \none region's dairy farmers to the detriment of farmers in the Upper \nMidwest, and it sets the bad precedent of establishing regional \nbarriers.\n  We need to move to a farm bill. And we need to do it swiftly. But \nthis deal is unacceptable.\n  My office is hearing from Minnesota dairy farmers and their \norganizations. Minnesota's Agriculture Commissioner, a Republican whom \nI respect, also has sent a message. They are urging a vote against \ncloture. I also received a very strong statement of opposition to the \nNortheast dairy compact from the Governor of my State today. I agree \nwith his position, and I appreciate his communication on this issue. \nMadam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter of Minnesota \nGovernor Arne Carlson be printed in the Record immediately following my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I cannot stand by while this deal is made which \nneglects the dairy farmers of my State. I will vote against cloture. I \nbelieve I owe it to Minnesota dairy farmers. And should cloture be \ninvoked, or should the farm bill come up for consideration under some \nother time agreement, I intend to be part of an effort to strike the \nNortheast dairy compact from the bill.\n  Madam President, I hope we can move quickly forward from here to \nconsideration of a viable and acceptable farm bill. I look forward to a \nhealthy debate.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               State of Minnesota,\n\n\n                                            Washington Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 1996.\n\n     Re Opposition to the Northeast interstate dairy compact.\n\n       Dear U.S. Senator. I am writing to ask you to oppose the \n     inclusion of the Northeast Intestate Dairy Compact in the \n     Freedom to Farm Act. My state represents one of the top dairy \n     states in the nation and our dairy farmers are among the \n     smallest on average in the nation.\n       The Compact, if approved by Congress, would be exempt from \n     Commerce Clause challenge and would allow those states \n     participating in the Compact to require a higher price to be \n     paid to their producers than guaranteed by the Federal Milk \n     Marketing Order system.\n       I oppose the Dairy compact for the following reasons:\n       (1) The Compact does nothing to correct the many failings \n     of the archaic 1937 Federal Milk Marketing Order system;\n       (2) Most of the Compact's vital provisions will be left to \n     rulemaking and the rules will be written by those who benefit \n     from the Compact;\n       (3) The Compact Commission will erect trade barriers to \n     less expensive milk coming in from other regions to maintain \n     the higher Compact milk prices and these trade barriers will \n     harm dairy farmers and processors in the rest of the nation;\n       (4) Higher Compact dairy farm prices will likely encourage \n     surplus dairy production in that region, thereby requiring \n     additional federal government purchases and lowering the \n     prices received by struggling producers in other regions due \n     to the dumping of surplus milk into other markets;\n       (5) Higher Compact prices in the Northeast will likely \n     raise the cost of milk to Northeast dairy consumers and make \n     Northeast processors less competitive;\n       (6) Higher Compact prices will benefit only one region of \n     the country, a region that already benefits form some of the \n     nation's highest federally-guaranteed minimum farm Class I \n     milk prices; and\n       (7) Other regions will likely seek to enact dairy compacts \n     as a defensive measure, thereby balkanizing the nation's \n     dairy industry, raising consumer dairy prices nationwide, and \n     encouraging inefficient milk production.\n       If Congress is seeking ways to help the nation's struggling \n     dairy farmers, it should reform or eliminate the archaic \n     Federal Milk Marketing Order system so that the nation's \n     dairy policy is evenhanded and beneficial to all of the \n     nation's dairy farmers. Moreover, we should not protect one \n     region of the nation from competition from outside its \n     borders as we move toward free trade around the world.\n       Please oppose inclusion of the Northeast Interstate Dairy \n     Compact in the Freedom to Farm Act. The future of your \n     state's dairy industry is at stake.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Warmest regards,\n                                                  Arne H. Carlson,\n                                            Governor of Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I may be \npermitted to speak for up to 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S908-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S912-S913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, it seems to me in the last 24 to 48 \nhours, we have taken one or two steps forward in our quest for a truly \nbalanced budget, a balanced budget that will pay great dividends to \nfuture generations of America in lower interest rates, better jobs, and \nhigher incomes. And at the same time, at least one major step backward. \nThat major step backwards, of course, is what the President of the \nUnited States has submitted as a budget for fiscal year 1997. This \nyellow booklet really should not carry that title because it obviously \ndoes not meet the requirements of a budget submission under the law. To \nthe extent that it does give an outline of the President's priorities, \nhowever, it is clearly a status quo document. All of the difficult \ndecisions, the heavy lifting, is left until after the completion of \n\n[[Page S913]]\nthe term of the President who will be elected this fall.\n  So, while it does not represent a step forward on the part of the \nPresident, it also, one must confess, does not represent a step \nbackward either. It consolidates the modest gains that were attained \nthrough five separate budget submissions on the part of the President \nfor the current year. The overwhelmingly significant step forward, \nhowever, was the work by the National Governors Conference, which now \nunanimously has reached a detailed statement of principle on both \nMedicaid and welfare reform, one that has been agreed to by both \nRepublican and Democrat Governors across the country, one that raises \nthe very real possibility of breaking the budget deadlock in which we \nfind ourselves at the present time. I cannot possibly be too laudatory \nof the tremendously difficult task that the Governors have undertaken \nand the great degree of success they have reached.\n  Madam President, we need a balanced budget for our children and for \nour grandchildren. We need reforms in Medicare and Medicaid for our \nseniors and for others who are less fortunate and cannot afford to pay \nfor health care services themselves. We need welfare reform for all \nAmericans for a more just and equitable system. And we need tax cuts \nfor hard-working American families. All of these remain our goal. But \ntwo of the most difficult now are the beneficiaries of intervention on \nthe part of the National Conference of Governors in such a way that the \nentire logjam may now possibly be broken and that, before the end of \nthe current continuing resolution on March 15, there is the very real \npossibility of a wonderfully genuine move toward a budget that will \nlead to a very real balance by the year 2002 without gimmicks and \nwithout postponing all of the hard questions for 4 more years.\n  The final element in this equation was the report yesterday that the \nMedicare part A trust fund is going bankrupt much more rapidly than we \nhad thought during our debate during the course of the last year. \nInstead of being in the black last year, it was in the red, 1 year \nearlier than was predicted just last April. That fact makes more urgent \nthe reform of Medicare and the Medicare trust fund so that this trust \nfund will be there after the turn of the century for all of those over \nthe age of 65 who depend on it. It causes to be even more modest in the \nlong term the reforms in Medicare that were included in the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1995, regrettably vetoed by the President, and makes more \nurgent a set of reforms that will protect Medicare for our seniors in \nthe future and will more equitably distribute the burden for paying for \nMedicare among all of our citizens--both those working and those \nretiring.\n  So, all in all, in spite of the President's refusal to recognize \nthese new facts in this so-called budget document, I believe that this \nweek represents real progress toward an honest balanced budget, a \nbudget that will be good for all Americans, that will lessen the burden \nof debt on future generations and increase their opportunities, their \njobs, and their income.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n[[Page S914]]\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, I did not object to the unanimous-\nconsent request. I have no problem with the Senate considering health \ncare reform prior to the Memorial Day recess.\n  I do have concerns that this bill will raise the cost of health \ninsurance for citizens of my state, particularly for individual health \ncare insurance policies.\n  Additionally, I am skeptical that we can reform health care and lower \ncosts in this country until we tackle medical malpractice reform, \nprovide medical savings accounts for individuals, increase tax \nexemptions for the self employed, and provide other market oriented \nreforms that will increase competition and health carer lower costs. \nThis bill has none of these provisions.\n  I look forward to working with the majority leader to address these \nconcern when the Senate considers S. 1028.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S913-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE READ FOR THE FIRST TIME--S. 1561\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Madam President, I now ask for its second reading and \nobject to my own request on behalf of Senators on the other side of the \naisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The bill will be read on \nthe next legislative day.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today I introduced a bill to address a \ngrave miscarriage of justice--the wrongful investigation prosecution of \nMr. Billy Dale and the other former White House Travel Office \nemployees. Mr. Dale served his country at the pleasure of eight \nPresidents as the Director of the White House Travel Office. During his \n32 years of service, Mr. Dale took on the thankless and often grueling \ntask of ensuring that the national and international media were in a \nposition to cover the movements of the President and thus report to the \nAmerican and worldwide public.\n  As thanks for his numerous years of dedicated service, Mr. Dale was \nsummarily discharged from his post on May 19, 1993, and was thereafter \nindicted and prosecuted for embezzlement. On December 1, 1995, after \n2\\1/2\\ years of being investigated and haunted on a daily basis, Mr. \nDale was tried before a jury of his peers and, in less than 2 hours, \nfound not guilty of all charges.\n  The travesty in this situation is that Mr. Dale simply got caught in \nthe political crossfire of a new administration. He had served eight \nPresidents, both Democratic and Republican, but found himself in a job \nthat, apparently, was an impediment to the ambitious money-making \nschemes of the new President's friends. President Clinton certainly \ncould have dismissed Mr. Dale without cause, but I believe the Clinton \nadministration may have felt the need to justify its actions in firing \nMr. Dale and the other White House Travel Office employees given the \ntremendous media interest in this dismissal. The reputations of Mr. \nDale and his colleagues were discredited and ruined in the process.\n  I have a great deal of respect for the First Lady. But, on April 6, \n1994, in response to questions about the White House Travel Office \nsituation, Mrs. Clinton stated that she ``had no role in the decision \nto terminate the employees.'' (Responses of Hillary Rodham Clinton to \nthe General Accounting Office, Apr. 6, 1994) Moreover, she ``did not \ndirect any action be taken by anyone with regard to the Travel Office, \nother than expressing an interest in receiving information * * *''(Id.)\n  Unfortunately, these statements do not coincide with the evidence we \nhave come to discover in recent months. In fact, it appears as though \nthe First Lady was actively involved in the decision to fire the White \nHouse Travel Office employees. According to notes taken by David \nWatkins--the former Assistant to the President for Management and \nAdministration who oversaw the workings of the Travel Office--during \nhis conversation with the First Lady on May 14, 1993, 5 days before the \nTravel Office employees were dismissed, Mrs. Clinton articulated that \n``Harry [Thomason] says his people can run things better, save money, \netc. And besides we need those people out--we need our people in--we \nneed the slots.'' (GAO report, The White House Travel Office, at 53-54)\n\n  Moreover, according to a recently released memorandum written by Mr. \nWatkins, ``[t]he First Family was anxious to have that situation [the \nWhite House Travel Office] immediately resolved, and the First Lady in \nparticular was extremely upset with the delayed action in that case.'' \n(Draft memorandum from David Watkins, re: ``Response to Internal White \nHouse Travel Office Management Review,'' (undated) at 2.) Mr. Watkins \nalso notes ``that there would be hell to pay if, * * * we failed to \ntake swift and decisive action in conformity with the First Lady's \nwishes.'' (Id. at 1-2.) This memorandum was not released by the White \nHouse for more than 2 years despite subpoenas from Congress and \nWhitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.\n  In May 1993, the Travel Office employees were fired and told to \nvacate the premises. Needing to justify its actions before the \nemployees were terminated, the White House met with and urged the FBI \nto investigate the White House Travel Office using allegations \nconcocted by Catherine Cornelius, President Clinton's cousin who \ndesperately wanted to replace Mr. Dale in running the White House \nTravel Office. Indeed, the FBI helped craft the White House's press \nrelease about the firings. Peat Marwick was hired to do an audit of the \nOffice, but its own report did not substantiate the allegations \nasserted by the White House. Modest financial irregularities are not \nthe same as embezzlement.\n  This story would be tragic enough if it ended here, but it does not. \nThe Department of Justice indicted Mr. Dale, seemingly without concern \nfor their lack of evidence. This is best demonstrated by the fact that \nthe citizens sitting on the jury, who heard the evidence, exonerated \nMr. Dale in less than 2 hours. This inappropriate use of the Federal \ncriminal justice system created a situation for Mr. Dale where he had \nto expend $500,000 and even considered taking a plea when he had \ncommitted no crime.\n  After the jury summarily dismissed the allegations, someone leaked \nthe existence of the plea negotiations to the public in an attempt to \nfurther discredit Mr. Dale's reputation. Not only are plea negotiations \na necessary part of our judicial system, they are intended to remain \nconfidential and are not to be used against a criminal defendant.\n  I cannot, in good conscience, sit quietly when I believe an arrogant \nabuse of power has occurred. The power of the White House was wielded \nto make victims of the inculpable. The targeting of dedicated public \nservants apparently because they held positions coveted by political \nprofiteers demands an appropriate response. Although their muddied \npersonal reputation may never be fully restored, it is only just that \nthe Congress do what it can to rectify this wrong. Accordingly, I \nintroduce this bill to make Mr. Dale and the other former White House \nTravel Office employees whole, at least financially, by providing for \ntheir attorneys fees and expenses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S914-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S914-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S914-S915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT CONCERNING WAIVER OF RESTRICTIONS RELATIVE TO THE CHINASAT \n              PROJECT--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 114\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \n\n[[Page S915]]\n  from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 902(b)(2) of the \nForeign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public \nLaw 101-246), and as President of the United States, I hereby report to \nthe Congress that it is in the national interest of the United States \nto waive the restrictions contained in that Act on the export to the \nPeople's Republic of China of U.S.-origin satellites insofar as such \nrestrictions pertain to the CHINASAT project.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, this bill would require Federal \nagencies to reimburse States, localities, and individuals who donated \nfunds and services to maintain operations at Federal recreational and \ntourist facilities during the recent Government shutdowns. Without \nthese generous donations, attractions such as Grand Canyon National \nPark, Mount Rushmore, Carlsbad Caverns, the National Gallery of Art, \nLiberty Bell, and Independence Hall could not have continued operations \nduring the lengthy Government closures last year. Thanks to the \ngenerosity of private citizens, States, and local governments we were \nable to ensure that innocent people were not turned away at the gates \nand that further economic loss was avoided.\n  Grand Canyon visitors and local businesses particularly benefited \nfrom State and private donations during the most recent Government \nshutdown. As you know, Grand Canyon National Park officially closed for \nthe first time in its 76-year history on November 16, 1995, during the \nfirst Government shutdown last year.\n  The economic impact of the park's closure has been estimated at a \nloss of about $1 million per day in tourism revenue to the park and \nsurrounding areas. By entering into an agreement with the Department of \nthe Interior, the State of Arizona and private individuals donated \nalmost $400,000 to prevent another park closure during the most recent \nGovernment shutdown which began on December 15, 1995, and lasted for \nmore than 3 weeks.\n  It is only right that we reimburse those who so generously donated \ntheir funds and services in order to shoulder the Federal Government's \nresponsibility. I trust that my colleagues agree and that we can pass \nthis bill expeditiously.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Heflin):\n  S. 1559.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nBankruptcy Technical Corrections Act of 1996. This bill will correct \ntechnical errors in the bankruptcy code resulting from the 1994 \nBankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 as well as pre-existing technical errors. \nI am introducing the bill with support of Senator Heflin, my good \nfriend from Alabama and the ranking minority on the Courts \nsubcommittee.\n  Mr. President, with one exception, this bill makes purely technical \nchanges in the Code. It is my hope that the bill will pass this body \nquickly and by unanimous consent.\n  The sole substantive change contained in this bill relates to the \nspecial procedures set up for single asset real estate ventures. These \nprocedures speed up the bankruptcy process in certain unique business \nsituations. The 1994 bankruptcy bill passed the Senate overwhelmingly \nwithout a cap for the value of single asset cases, and the bill I am \nintroducing today does no more than restore that provision.\n  Again, I wish to thank Senator Heflin for expert assistance and help \nwith this bill, and I urge the swift passage of the bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. D'Amato, and Mrs. \n        Feinstein):\n  S. 1560. A bill to require Colombia to meet antinarcotics performance \nstandards for continued assistance and to require a report on the \ncounternarcotics efforts of Colombia; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n                 certification of colombia legislation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in recent weeks we have seen a variety \nof events in Colombia that raise serious doubts about the extent to \nwhich the Government of Colombia is taking the steps necessary to \nensure full cooperation with the United States on the issue of drugs. \nWe are now approaching the annual period for certification. Under U.S. \nlaw, the President is required to certify annually whether major drug \ntrafficking and producing countries are cooperating fully with the \nUnited States to end drug production, trafficking, and related drug \nactivities.\n  Last year, we saw the Government of Colombia--facing the possibility \nof congressional sanctions--take more vigorous action to arrest several \nkey figures in the Cali cocaine empire. Until that point the Government \nof Colombia had done little to arrest or prosecute these individuals. \nThis was true even though their whereabouts was commonly known and they \nwere frequently strutting around the streets of Colombia's major \ncities. I, among others of my colleagues, was encouraged by the steps \ntaken to finally put these thugs behind bars. The courageous actions of \nColombia's prosecutor general and the leading counterdrug police \nofficial--both brave and incorruptible individuals under daily threats \nof death--were welcome signs that despite massive corruption, Colombia \nwas prepared to take effective action.\n\n  But I did not believe then nor do I believe now that these arrests \nare enough. I indicated to the Government of Colombia on several \noccasions when senior officials visited me, that it was follow through \nthat meant everything. I have written the Colombian ambassador and have \nindicated verbally to various cabinet members on state visits to the \nUnited States my concern that arrests were only a beginning.\n  I also asked these various individuals for assurances that the major \ndrug lords were under proper control. That they were not able to \ncontinue to direct their drug empires while living at state expense. \nThat they would face serious punishment. That they would lose their \nstolen fortunes built on selling poison in this country. That they \nwould give up information leading to efforts to dismantle their drug \nempires. And that adequate steps would be taken to deal with the \ncorruption of Colombia's political system. A corruption that gave these \nkingpins freedom to violate Colombian, United States, and international \nlaw with impunity.\n  I was assured that all these things were being done. But in the last \nseveral weeks, what do we see? Just a few weeks ago, one of the major \nCali drug lords simply walked out of prison. It was hours before anyone \neven knew he was gone and steps were taken to find him. It is clear \nthat his escape was arranged by his prison guards in his employment. It \nis also clear that he was never under adequate supervision. He remains \nat large trying to negotiate even better terms for his return to \ncustody. If this is true for Santacruz Londono, it is also true of the \nother drug kingpins. If they can carry on these types of activities in \njail under the very eyes--and often with the cooperation of their \njailers--then what does this say about guarantees that they are not \ncontinuing to direct their business empire while in custody?\n  I must say I have been very disappointed by these developments. But \nthese are not all. In the last several days we have seen a former \ncabinet minister and close friend accuse the President of Colombia of \nknowingly collaborating with drug lords. These accusations come on top \nof similar reports from the former financial manager of the President's \nelection campaign and from some of the Cartel leaders themselves. Tape \nrecorded conversations indicating connections between senior government \nofficials and drug lords are now part of the public record. These come \nin an environment in which our own sources indicate that there is \nextensive corruption of Colombia's legislative process stemming from \nthese same drug lords. Just recently, the Colombian Congress only \nnarrowly defeated a provision that would have given virtual amnesty to \nthe drug lords and a guarantee that they could keep their illegal \nfortunes. In addition, massive shipments of cocaine in cargo jets and \nin commercial traffic continue to flood northward, while money \nlaundering and financial manipulation are commonplace.\n\n  All of these various developments come at a time when the President \nof the United States, as he is required to do by law, is considering \nwhether or not to certify Colombia as fully cooperating with the United \nStates in suppressing the drug trade. I am seriously concerned that the \npresent state of developments in Colombia raises the most serious \ndoubts about that certification. The fate of Colombia's president, \nwhether he resigns or not under a cloud, is a purely Colombian matter. \nI leave that issue in the hands of the good citizens of Colombia. But \nthe issue of certification is purely an \n\n[[Page S917]]\nAmerican matter. It is a policy concern for the President and for this \nbody.\n  Given the history I have just related, I must voice my serious \nconcerns about whether Colombia meets even minimal standards for fully \ncooperating with the United States as is defined in the law. Moreover, \nas evidence accumulates about the degree of official corruption in \nColombia at the highest levels, we must also consider a further \nrequirement of the law that enjoins the President to suspend United \nStates assistance. That is section 487 of the Foreign Assistance Act. \nThis provision requires the United States to suspend assistance to \ninstitutions or governments when there is sufficient reason to believe \nthat the assistance is going to known or suspected drug traffickers or \ntheir confederates.\n  Mr. President, given current developments in Colombia. Given growing \ndoubts about the integrity of the prison system. Given doubts about the \nintegrity of the very political authorities who must receive and \nadminister United States assistance and who are charged with enforcing \nColombia's counterdrug policies. I believe it is time to reexamine our \ncertification of Colombia.\n  Last year, even though there were serious doubts about Colombia's \ncooperation, the President of the United States gave Colombia a \nnational interest waiver. With the arrest of major cartel figures, it \nseemed as if we and Colombia were making progress in restoring \nconfidence in Colombia's seriousness in dealing effectively with the \ndrug cartels. Recent events, however, put all of that progress in \ndoubt. They raise serious questions as to whether any of the arrests, \nas welcome as they are, have any real meaning. In a climate of high-\nlevel corruption, in an environment in which the cartel leaders can \ncome and go as they please, I must admit to a degree of disappointment \nafter the assurances that I received to the contrary.\n  In this regard, I am introducing a bill to limit United States \nassistance to Colombia and to require a thorough review of our \nrelationship. This bill would require the President of the United \nStates to review full decertification of Colombia and to consider what \neconomic steps might be taken to force Columbia to take the steps that \nhave so often promised but that have fallen short so many times. This \nis not a welcome step, but the drugs flowing to this country because of \nthe activities of the Colombia drug lords must be stopped. We and the \nColombians must recognize that promises and half measures are not \nsufficient.\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to commend my \ncolleague from Iowa for introducing this bill that will help to curb \nthe international flow of drugs, particularly into the United States.\n  Narcotics have become a scourge in our country and it is about time \nthat we start to take action to eradicate it at all levels. Since \nillegal drugs found on our streets are most often produced in other \ncountries, foreign nations must also take action to prevent the \nproduction, transportation and distribution of illegal drugs. So far, \nthere has been very little action to make foreign countries accountable \nfor the drugs trafficked in the United States. This bill, which focuses \non Colombia, will do just that.\n  According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, cocaine production, \ntransportation and distribution has been managed primarily by the \nColombian drug cartel, making cocaine available everywhere in the \nUnited States. The Cali cartel controls about 80 percent of the world's \ncocaine trafficking.\n  The Colombian Government has not done enough to put an end to the \ndrug problem. Last year, United States officials expressed \ndisappointment with the cooperation level of the Colombian Government \nin the counternarcotics effort. However, the administration sought to \nwaive the certification for Colombia and permit United States aid to \ncontinue for development in Colombia. In an effort to justify the \nfinancial assistance, this bill would require the President to certify \nto Congress that Colombia has begun to take the appropriate measures to \nlimit the power of the drug traffickers and squash the flow of illegal \ndrugs. Such methods include: the eradication of drug crops, \ninterdiction of drug shipments, and the strengthening of the Colombian \nlaw enforcement and judicial authorities.\n  It is only fair that American taxpayers, who pay for the foreign aid \nto Colombia, receive some assurance that the Colombian Government will \nattempt to reduce the production and distribution of drugs. With the \nrecent disclosure of the ties between the Cali cartel and officials of \nthe Colombia Government, the timing of this bill could not be any \nbetter.\n  Various insiders of the Cali mafia have recounted the influence \nexerted by the Cali mafia on high level Colombian officials, all the \nway to the President of Colombia. A former campaign manager for \nPresident Ernesto Samper Pizano is currently jailed for soliciting \ncontributions from drug traffickers in order to finance the Colombian \npresidential campaign. Fernando Botero Zea, who also served as \nColombia's former defense minister, claims that Colombian President \nSamper knew about the money from the drug traffickers. It is suggested \nthat his presidential campaign accepted $5.9 million from the Cali \ncartel.\n  Colombia should be accountable for its failure to actively \nparticipate in the counternarcotics effort. This bill places pressure \non the Colombian Government government to take steps to control the \ndrug problem in Colombia. Any steps taken will have a direct effect on \nthe flow of narcotics into the United States. But a failure to \nparticipate in the international counternarcotics effort should result \nin the loss of financial assistance provided by the United States.\n  In light of recent developments in Colombia, I am pleased that my \ncolleague is offering this bill and am proud to co-sponsor this \nimportant measure.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                             By Mr. HELMS:\n\n  S. 1562. A bill to require the President to give notice of the \nintention of the United States to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic-\nMissile Treaty, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n   the strategic anti-missile revitalization and security act of 1996\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, there has never been a greater champion of \nballistic missile defense than that great American, Ronald Wilson \nReagan, and today happens to be President Reagan's 85th birthday. I \ndecided this morning to introduce the Strategic Anti-missile \nRevitalization and Security Act of 1996--for short we call it the \n``STARS Act''--legislation proposing to begin the timely and complete \nwithdrawal from the ABM Treaty, and to clear the way for implementing \nPresident Reagan's vision of a national strategic missile defense \nsystem to protect the American people from ballistic missile attack.\n  Today's greatest emerging threat to America's national security lies \nin the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We all know that. \nAccording to the CIA, at this moment more than 30 countries possess \nballistic missiles, and more than 25 others either have, or are in the \nprocess of acquiring, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons.\n  Many of these nations--for example, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and \nNorth Korea--are clearly hostile to the United States. It is indeed \nprobable that in the not-too-distant future a hostile tyrant will \npossess ballistic missiles capable of reaching major population centers \nin the United States.\n  Obviously, Mr. President, with such an ominous threat emerging, one \nwould assume that the United States would be actively developing \ndefensive technology to protect the American people against this \ndanger; and one would assume that the Clinton administration surely is \nworking, in cooperation with a bipartisan majority in Congress, to make \ncertain that the United States is never, never exposed to the danger of \na hostile nuclear attack by a terrorist regime.\n  Well, such assumptions are wrong. The Clinton administration in fact \nhas aggressively blocked every effort by Congress to implement a \nnational missile defense system to protect the American people from \nthis very real threat.\n  Why? Because, the administration argues weakly, developing such \ndefenses would violate an antiquated arms control agreement--a relic of \nthe cold war known as the ABM Treaty.\n  Mr. President, the ABM Treaty is not only out-of-date and \nunnecessary--it \n\n[[Page S918]]\nhas become a threat to America's national security. Like latter-day \nLuddites, the opponents of ballistic missile defense are now using the \nABM Treaty as a tool to obstruct any and all progress toward the \ndeployment of missile defense technology.\n  During debate over the defense authorization bill, for example, the \nopponents of ballistic missile defense stood on the Senate floor and \nused the ABM Treaty in a last-ditch effort to prevent Congress from \npassing legislation to deploy a national system to protect U.S. \ncitizens against weapons of mass destruction. When they lost, President \nClinton then used the ABM Treaty as an excuse to veto the defense \nauthorization bill, thus preventing approval of funding for national \nmissile defense.\n  Mr. President, this treaty has become nothing more than an excuse for \ninaction. But the time for excuses is over. The United States needs a \nnational missile defense. And if the ABM Treaty is preventing us from \nbuilding and deploying essential defenses to protect the American \npeople from even the most limited ballistic missile attack, then the \ntime has come for the United States to withdraw from the ABM Treaty.\n  Mr. President, my legislation will do just that. The STARS Act does \nthree things:\n  First, it directs the President to notify Russia of United States \nintent to withdraw from the ABM Treaty 1 month after enactment of the \nact, as legally permitted by the ABM Treaty.\n  Second, it prohibits the use of Federal funds to enforce the ABM \nTreaty beginning 7 months after the bill's enactment.\n  Finaly, it requires the President to certify to Congress that the \nUnited States has abrogated the ABM Treaty on the date of U.S. \nwithdrawal.\n  Mr. President, through its blind allegiance to this obsolete treaty, \nthe Clinton administration appears to be ready to leave the American \npeople strategically naked as hostile nations rush forward to their \nrelentless pursuit of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. \nIndeed, in their zeal to stop Congress from deploying national missile \ndefenses, this administration seems willing to say or do anything to \nargue that the ballistic missile threat does not exist.\n  I must say I was stunned when I noted the politicization of the most \nrecent National Intelligence Estimate [NIE] to support the \nadministration's position in this regard. The 1996 National \nIntelligence Estimate declared that no country other than the \n``declared nuclear powers'' would threaten the ``continental United \nStates'' with a ballistic missile for 15 years. Note carefully that \nthey said the ``continental United States''. First, this is simply not \nso. The 1995 estimate concluded, for example, that North Korea may be \nable to threaten the United States in 5 years because it is an \nindisputable fact that North Korea is developing a series of missiles \nwith ranges in excess of 3000 kilometers.\n\n  Second, I am astonished that this administration has somehow managed \nto write two of the 50 States of the Union completely out of the Union. \nI cannot understand why this administration draws a distinction in the \n1996 NIE between threats to the United States and threats to the \ncontinental United States. The last time I checked, nearly 2 million \nU.S. citizens live in Alaska and Hawaii. Are these people less \ndeserving of protection than people living in Arkansas, or Michigan for \nthat matter? I think not.\n  Third, it boggles the mind that this administration can make \ndecisions about the ballistic missile threat to this country, while \nexplicitly ignoring the arsenals of declared nuclear powers. Communist \nChina not only fields two dozen submarine launched ballistic missiles, \nseveral hundred heavy bomber warheads, and roughly 24 long- and medium-\nrange ballistic missiles, but has several modernization initiatives \nunderway. China is developing for deployment by the end of the \nmillennium four intermediate-range and long-range ballistic missile \nsystems, and we have unambiguous evidence that China is pursuing MIRV-\ntechnology.\n  Nor can we afford to dismiss Russia's massive nuclear capabilities. \nRussia still has 12,000 nuclear warheads in its arsenal, as it slips \nand slides back down the slippery-slope of political reform. When \nPresident Clinton declared in his State of the Union address that \ntoday, for the first time no Russian nuclear missiles are pointed at \nthe United States, he just happened to omit the fact that it requires \nonly about 8 minutes of reprogramming to turn those Russian missiles \nright back at us.\n  We must not ignore in such cavalier fashion the trends to reinstate \nand restore communism in Russia. It is growing increasingly possible \nthat Russia's massive nuclear arsenal could fall into the hands of \nauthoritarian leaders with uncertain intentions before the end of this \ncentury. We of course hope this will not happen, but we must prepare \nfor the possibility.\n  Even those who unwisely discount the possibility of direct conflict \nwith potentially hostile regimes in Moscow and Beijing, must not \ndiscount the possibility of an accidental launch, nor the cooperation \nand collaboration between countries engaged in the development of \nballistic missiles. We know, for example, that China has sold extensive \nmissile technology to Iran, Syria, and North Korea; we know that Iran \nis working with North Korea and Syria on various missiles. We know that \n14 countries around the globe have the capability to field some type of \nSoviet-made missile, and we know that Russia recently was detected \nshipping ballistic missile parts to Iraq.\n  These are all real threats that the administration would ignore at \nthe peril of the American people, because the fact is, the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile \ntechnology is rampant, the threat of ballistic missile attack on the \nUnited States is a present and growing danger, and nothing is being \ndone to protect the American people from it. The administration has an \nalmost messianic devotion to the ABM Treaty which I find bizarre. There \nis, you see, far more concern about protecting a treaty not worth the \npaper it is written on, than with protecting American citizens against \nhorrible nuclear attacks.\n  So, Mr. President, the STARS Act, which I am introducing today, will \nremove the ABM Treaty as an obstacle, and instead pave the way for the \ndeployment of defenses when necessary to protect American citizens \nagainst weapons of terror. And the sooner, the better. We cannot afford \nto wait until the administration wakes up and opens its eyes. By then, \nit may be too late. It takes years to move from the enactment of \nlegislation in Congress to the deployment of a defensive system.\n  If Congress passes legislation funding such a system this year, it \nmay take as long as eight years before the system is operational.\n  It may, in fact take longer. Think back. Did any Senator predict 8 \nyears ago the advanced stages of North Korea's nuclear program? Did \nanyone here know, before the fact, how close Iraq was to obtaining a \nnuclear weapon just prior to the start of the Gulf War? Is any Senator \nprepared to stake the security of the American people on blind faith? \nThee are questions that we must confront.\n  I am not. We must begin consideration of the STARS Act. Removing the \nABM Treaty is critical to any strategy for protecting U.S. citizens \nagainst chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons mounted on ballistic \nmissiles. In the coming months, I anticipate the introduction, under \nthe auspices of the distinguished majority leader, of a comprehensive \nbill identifying the critical aspects of a ballistic missile defense. \nIn support of this effort, and in connection with the STARS Act, the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, will of which I am chairman, will \nhold hearings as soon as practicable to undertake a comprehensive \nreview of the ABM Treaty. Providing for the defense of America against \nthese weapons must be among our highest priorities during this session \nof Congress.\n  Mr. President, Ronald Reagan said it best back in 1993, in one of his \nlast public speeches--he had learned of the Clinton administration's \ndecision to gut the Strategic Defense Initiative: ``I may not be a \nRhodes Scholar'' he told the graduating cadets at The Citadel, ``but I \ndo know one thing: if we can protect America with a defensive shield \nfrom incoming missiles, we should by all means do so. . . . (And) if \nthe new Administration thinks we are no longer at risk, they need to \nopen their eyes and take a good hard look at the world.''\n\n[[Page S919]]\n\n  Amen, Mr. President, and, again to you, sir, out there in California, \nhappy birthday. It was a joy to hear your voice today on the telephone. \nGod bless you--and as you always used to say--God bless America.\n  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1562\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Strategic Anti-Missile \n     Revitalization and Security Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Constitution vests in the Government of the United \n     States responsibility to provide for the common defense and \n     promote the general welfare of the American people.\n       (2) Due to limitations imposed by the Anti-Ballistic \n     Missile Treaty, the United States is prohibited from \n     deploying a national missile defense capable of defending \n     America against even the most limited of ballistic missile \n     attack.\n       (3) The concept of mutual assured destruction which \n     underlies the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is \n     technologically and geostrategically outdated and cannot \n     serve as a basis for stability in a multipolar world \n     characterized by rampant proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction and ballistic missile technology.\n       (4) The possibility of ballistic missile attack upon the \n     United States by a rogue country constitutes a clear, \n     present, and growing threat to the supreme interests of the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT TO GIVE NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL.\n\n       No later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the President shall give notice to the Russian \n     Federation of the intention of the United States to withdraw \n     from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, as permitted under \n     Article XV of that Treaty.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROHIBITIONS.\n\n       Beginning 210 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, appropriated funds shall not be obligated or expended \n     for the purposes of proscribing, enforcing, or implementing \n     any provision of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\n\n     SEC. 5. ACTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT.\n\n       On the date that is 180 days after the date of the \n     notification of the President to the Russian Federation under \n     section 3, the President shall certify to Congress that the \n     Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is no longer interpreted to \n     apply to the development, deployment, or operation of any \n     missile defense system or air defense system of the United \n     States, including any component of such a system or upgrade \n     of such a system or component.\n\n     SEC. 6. DEFINITION.\n\n       As used in this Act, the term ``Anti-Ballistic Missile \n     Treaty'' means the Treaty Between the United States of \n     America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the \n     Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems, signed at \n     Moscow on May 26, 1972, with related protocol, signed at \n     Moscow on July 3, 1974.\n\n

DESIGNATE SEPTEMBER 23, 1996, AS ``NATIONAL \n                        BASEBALL HERITAGE DAY''\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Moynihan) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 224\n\n       Whereas it is universally accepted that the idea of \n     baseball was created by Abner Doubleday in 1839 in \n     Cooperstown, NY when Doubleday attempted to chase cows out of \n     Elihu Phinney's cow pasture;\n       Whereas, New Yorkers in Manhattan in 1842 witnessed the \n     birth of modern day baseball when `a number of gentlemen . . \n     . casually assembled on a plot of ground in Twenty-seventh \n     street . . . to play ball'' according to Charles A. Peverelly \n     in ``The Book of American Pastimes;''\n       Whereas, these men, led by Alexander Joy Cartwright, Jr. \n     created the set of rules to transform a childhood game into \n     the game of baseball and to provide a model for future early \n     clubs;\n       Whereas, these men played the game because of sheer \n     enjoyment and casually called themselves the ``New York \n     Baseball Club'';\n       Whereas, Harold Peterson, in ``The Man Who Invented \n     Baseball,'' notes that on the historic day of September 23, \n     1845, these men, now numbering more than forty, formally \n     organized themselves into the first ever organized baseball \n     club known as the ``Knickerbocker Baseball Club'';\n       Whereas, the Knickerbockers dedicated their efforts to the \n     creation of regular games on the Twenty-seventh street field \n     so they could play their new game.\n       Whereas, others noticed the games of the Knickerbockers and \n     created teams of their own for inter-club play with Alexander \n     Joy Cartwright, Jr. and the Knickerbockers, according to \n     Cartwright's ``Rules of Play'';\n       Whereas, baseball has grown into America's national pastime \n     and ingratiated itself into the collective heart of America;\n       Whereas, America has cherished baseball and fallen in love \n     with baseball heroes like Mickey Mantle, Jackie Robinson, \n     Willie Mays, and Babe Ruth;\n       Whereas, baseball has given Americans common and shared \n     experience, as well as provide a bond between generations;\n       Whereas, parents and children enjoy baseball together \n     throughout the countless generations.\n       Whereas, baseball has become as much a part of the United \n     States as the hot dogs sold at the games;\n       Whereas, baseball has become a part of our national \n     character,\n       Whereas, the designation of ``National Baseball Heritage \n     Day'' will provide Americans with chance to celebrate the \n     history of the game and reflect on how much it has affected \n     our collective lives and national identity: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate, in recognition of the essential \n     role that baseball has played in the history of the United \n     States and our individual lives, designate September 23, 1996 \n     as ``National Baseball Heritage Day''. The President is \n     authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon \n     the people of the United States to observe such a day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, when asked to describe an image of \nbaseball, the near unanimous and immediate picture painted would be of \na warm summer night sitting in the bleachers with your kids, enjoying a \nhot dog or some peanuts, and rooting for the home team. Similarly when \nasked about the origins of baseball, fans from the youngest to the \noldest will tell you that baseball originates in New York. It is that \nheritage that I wish to memorialize in legislation that I am submitting \ntoday. I am proud to submit the resolution with my friend and \ncolleague, New York's senior Senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n  On a lazy afternoon in 1839, a young man from Cooperstown, Abner \nDoubleday, chased the cows out of Elihu Phinney's pasture and was \nstruck with the inspiration to invent a game that we now know as \nbaseball. In true recognition of Cooperstown's place in history, the \nNational Baseball Hall of Fame is located there.\n  Today, Cooperstown is the mecca for all baseball fans where, in the \nHall of Fame, they can see the unfolding of baseball from its early \nbeginnings to its great modern era. Within the National Baseball Hall \nof Fame outstanding players such as Babe Ruth, Lou Gherig, Cy Young, Ty \nCobb, Joe DiMaggio, and Jackie Robinson are immortalized. In addition \nto plaques celebrating the achievements of baseball's greats, \nCooperstown has the largest collection of game-winning baseballs, \nrecord-breaking bats, and paraphernalia chronicling achievements and \nactivities of all kinds in relation to the game of baseball and \nbaseball's impact on American society.\n  Shortly after Doubleday's inspiration, a group of gentlemen, led by \nAlexander Joy Cartwright, Jr., was meeting in fields all over Manhattan \nin New York City, playing baseball according to rules laid out by \nCartwright. These men began playing baseball as early as 1842 in a \nsmall plot of ground on Twenty-seventh Street--a spot now occupied by \nthe Harlem Railroad depot. Cartwright and his friends were forced to \nplay at three different locations on Manhattan in order to escape the \nencroachment of a growing New York City. On September 23, 1845, they \nfinally formally organized themselves into a baseball club known as the \nKnickerbockers Base Ball Club.\n  Efforts have been attempted in the past to lay claim to \nCooperstown's, and indeed New York's place in baseball history. Such \nefforts continue to this day. But as every little-leaguer knows, New \nYork will always be the true home of baseball. Also, as any baseball \nhistory buff knows, New York City is home to our nation's earliest \norganized baseball team. Baseball fans everywhere will not be fooled by \nthose who would claim otherwise.\n  Therefore, to make sure that all Americans know the rightful role New \nYork holds in the birth of baseball, we are introducing a resolution \ncalling for congressional recognition of this distinction. It is my \nhope that with the Senate's passage of this resolution, we may once and \nfor all dispel all contrary claims to baseball's heritage. We encourage \nall true fans of baseball in the Senate to join in cosponsoring this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S920-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S920-S995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n             THE AGRICULTURAL MARKET TRANSITION ACT OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        GRAMS AMENDMENT NO. 3316\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. GRAMS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \namendment No. 3184 proposed by Mr. Leahy to the bill (S. 1541) to \nextend, reform, and improve agricultural commodity, trade, \nconservation, and other programs, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n                                S. 1541\n\n       Beginning on page 1-73, strike line 12 and all that follows \n     through page 1-75, line 7, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 108.

The Secretary shall transfer to the \n     Treasury those funds collected under paragraph (7) and \n     available for use under this subsection that the Secretary \n     determines are not required to cover losses in area quota \n     pools.\n       (E) Cross compliance.--Further losses in area quota pools, \n     other than losses incurred as a result of transfers from \n     additional loan pools to quota loan pools under section 358-\n     1(b)(2)(B)(v) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (as \n     amended by subsection (c)), shall be offset by any gains or \n     profits from pools in other production areas (other than \n     separate type pools established under paragraph (3)(B)(i) for \n     Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico) in such manner as \n     the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe.\n       (F) Increased assessments.--If use of the authorities \n     provided in the preceding paragraphs is not sufficient to \n     cover losses in an area quota pool, the Secretary shall \n     increase the marketing assessment established under paragraph \n     (7) by such an amount as the Secretary considers necessary to \n     cover the losses. Amounts collected under paragraph (7) as a \n     result of the increased assessment shall be retained by the \n     Secretary to cover losses in that pool.\n       (5) Disapproval of quotas.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, no price support may be made available by \n     the Secretary for any crop of peanuts with respect to which \n     poundage quotas have been disapproved by producers, as \n     provided for in section 358-1(d) of the Agricultural \n     Adjustment Act of 1938 (as amended by subsection (c)).\n       (6) Quality improvement.--\n       (A) Price support peanuts.--With respect to peanuts under \n     price support loan, the Secretary shall--\n       (i) promote the crushing of peanuts at a greater risk of \n     deterioration before peanuts at a lesser risk of \n     deterioration;\n       (ii) ensure that all Commodity Credit Corporation loan \n     stocks of peanuts sold for domestic edible use are shown to \n     have been officially inspected by licensed Department of \n     Agriculture inspectors both as farmer stock and shelled or \n     cleaned in-shell peanuts;\n       (iii) continue to endeavor to operate the peanut price \n     support program so as to improve the quality of domestic \n     peanuts and ensure the coordination of activities under the \n     Peanut Administrative Committee established under Marketing \n     Agreement No. 146, regulating the quality of domestically \n     produced peanuts (under the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 601 et seq.), reenacted with amendments by the \n     Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937); and\n       (iv) ensure that any changes made in the price support \n     program as a result of this paragraph requiring additional \n     production or handling at the farm level are reflected as an \n     upward adjustment in the Department of Agriculture loan \n     schedule.\n       (B) Exports and other peanuts.--The Secretary shall require \n     that all peanuts, including peanuts imported into the United \n     States, meet all United States quality standards under \n     Marketing Agreement No. 146 and that importers of the peanuts \n     fully comply with inspection, handling, storage, and \n     processing requirements implemented under Marketing Agreement \n     No. 146. The Secretary shall ensure that peanuts produced for \n     the export market meet quality, inspection, handling, \n     storage, and processing requirements under Marketing \n     Agreement No. 146.\n       (7) Marketing assessment.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary shall provide, by \n     regulation, for a nonrefundable marketing assessment \n     applicable to each of the 1996 through 2002 crops of peanuts. \n     The assessment shall be made in accordance with this \n     paragraph and shall be on a per pound basis in an amount \n     equal to 1.2 percent of the national average quota or \n     additional peanut support rate per pound, as applicable, for \n     the applicable crop. No peanuts shall be assessed more than \n     1.2 percent of the applicable support rate under this \n     paragraph.\n       (B) First purchasers.--\n     \n[[Page S946]]\n\n       (i) In general.--Except as provided under subparagraphs (C) \n     and (D), the first purchaser of peanuts shall--\n\n       (I) collect from the producer a marketing assessment equal \n     to the quantity of peanuts acquired multiplied by .65 percent \n     of the applicable national average support rate;\n       (II) pay, in addition to the amount collected under \n     subclause (I), a marketing assessment in an amount equal to \n     the quantity of peanuts acquired multiplied by .55 percent of \n     the applicable national average support rate; and\n       (III) remit the amounts required under subclauses (I) and \n     (II) to the Commodity Credit Corporation in a manner \n     specified by the Secretary.\n\n       (ii) Imported peanuts.--In the case of imported peanuts, \n     the first purchaser shall pay to the Commodity Credit \n     Corporation, in a manner specified by the Secretary, a \n     marketing assessment in an amount equal to the quantity of \n     peanuts acquired multiplied by 1.2 percent of the national \n     average support rate for additional peanuts.\n       (iii) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term ``first \n     purchaser'' means a person acquiring peanuts from a producer, \n     except that in the case of peanuts forfeited by a producer to \n     the Commodity Credit Corporation, the term means the person \n     acquiring the peanuts from the Commodity Credit Corporation.\n       (C) Other private marketings.--In the case of a private \n     marketing by a producer directly to a consumer through a \n     retail or wholesale outlet or in the case of a marketing by \n     the producer outside of the continental United States, the \n     producer shall be responsible for the full amount of the \n     assessment and shall remit the assessment by such time as is \n     specified by the Secretary.\n       (D) Loan peanuts.--In the case of peanuts that are pledged \n     as collateral for a price support loan made under this \n     subsection, \\1/2\\ of the assessment shall be deducted from \n     the proceeds of the loan. The remainder of the assessment \n     shall be paid by the first purchaser of the peanuts. For the \n     purposes of computing net gains on peanuts under this \n     subsection, the reduction in loan proceeds shall be treated \n     as having been paid to the producer.\n       (E) Penalties.--If any person fails to collect or remit the \n     reduction required by this paragraph or fails to comply with \n     such requirements for recordkeeping or otherwise as are \n     required by the Secretary to carry out this paragraph, the \n     person shall be liable to the Secretary for a civil penalty \n     up to an amount determined by multiplying--\n       (i) the quantity of peanuts involved in the violation; by\n       (ii) the national average quota peanut price support level \n     for the applicable crop year.\n       (F) Enforcement.--The Secretary may enforce this paragraph \n     in the courts of the United States.\n       (8) Crops.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     this subsection shall be effective only for the 1996 through \n     2002 crops of peanuts.\n       (b) Suspension of Marketing Quotas and Acreage \n     Allotments.--Section 371 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act \n     of 1938 (7 U.S.C. 1371) shall not be applicable to the 1996 \n     through 2002 crops of peanuts.\n       (c) National Poundage Quotas and Acreage Allotments.--\n     Section 358-1 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (7 \n     U.S.C. 1358-1) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 358-1.

TAX PROPOSAL\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I wish to state my support for \nSenate bill 1519, the Prohibition of United Nations Taxation Act of \n1996. This bill was introduced by Senator Dole, and referred to the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  This legislation bars the United States from making any voluntary or \nassessed payments to the United Nations if Secretary-General Boutros \nBoutros-Ghali imposes any tax or fee on United States citizens or \ncontinues to consider any such proposal.\n  I find it outrageous that the United Nations could actually believe \nit has the sovereignty to raise and collect taxes on the people of this \nworld to increase its coffers. The idea of a tax on any international \naction, whether it be a plane ticket, a letter mailed, or a currency \nexchange, is simply beyond my belief.\n  This revenue would then be used by unelected, world bureaucrats to do \nwhat they want under the umbrella of the United Nations. This \norganization has repeatedly attempted to increase its power even as the \nU.S. Congress tries to limit its scope and authority.\n  There are many questions about the U.N.'s responsibilities and its \never-growing role in international relations ranging from peacekeeping \nmissions to international conferences on everything from children's \nrights to the environment.\n  Recently, in my home State of Montana, a U.N. delegation visited \nYellowstone National Park in order to promote a buffer zone that would \nprohibit mineral development in the area. It is bad enough that we have \nallowed the United Nations to set our international role, but now we \nare allowing it to come into our country and set national policy. I ask \nthat the February 1, 1996 Washington Times article entitled ``U.N. \n`intrusion' stirs anger at Yellowstone,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There are many cases that exemplify the degree to which to the United \nNations is full of waste and uncontrolled spending. I cosponsored an \namendment to the 1995 fiscal year State Department authorization bill \nthat would establish the position of inspector general within the \nUnited Nations to seriously address the rampant corruption and \ninefficiency throughout the U.N. system and make it more accountable.\n  While it is true that the United States owes in excess of $1 billion \nin membership contributions, it is also true that we provide a quarter \nto a third of the U.N.'s budget. Compare that to other countries who \nare still assessed membership dues at the same rate as they were when \nthey were developing countries in the sixties.\n  The last thing the United Nations should be given is the ability to \nraise revenue in order to increase its powers. \n\n[[Page S996]]\n I am disgusted with the U.N.'s arrogance in believing it can increase \nits budget by taxing our citizens. This proposal should not be \npermitted to go any further.\n  S. 1519 concludes that the United Nations has no legal authority to \ntax American citizens. It prohibits U.S. payments to the United Nations \nif it attempts to impose any of the taxation schemes. And finally, the \nbill cuts off funds for any U.N. organization which develop or advocate \ntaxation schemes.\n  Once again, I support this bill to bar U.S. contributions to the \nUnited Nations if that organization continues to consider its scheme \nfor taxation without representation.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 1, 1996]\n\n U.N. `Intrusion' Stirs Anger at Yellowstone--Environmental Alarm Seen \n                              as Meddling\n\n                        (By Valerie Richardson)\n\n       Denver.--A United Nations delegation to Yellowstone \n     National Park has spurred outrage among Westerners who accuse \n     the international body of meddling in domestic policy.\n       After a three-day evaluation by international experts, the \n     World Heritage Committee, a bureau of the United Nations \n     Environmental, scientific and Cultural Organization, declared \n     Yellowstone a World Heritage site ``in danger.''\n       Chief among the delegation's concerns was the proposed \n     reopening of the New World Mine, a gold mine located near \n     Yellowstone in Montana. But debate about the mine has been \n     all but overshadowed by the uproar over the delegation \n     itself.\n       In areas of the West where the states'-rights movement is \n     flourishing and distrust of centralized government is at an \n     all-time high, the arrival of a U.N. committee has been \n     viewed as nothing less than an attempt to subvert U.S. \n     sovereignty.\n       ``Will the New World Order sabotage the New World Mine?'' \n     the Montana Standard newspaper in Butte asked in an Aug. 27 \n     editorial. ``Clinton administration officials appear to be \n     scheming to bring that about.''\n       Sen. Alan K. Simpson, Wyoming Republican, called the \n     international delegation's role ``a terrible intrusion.'' He \n     and other Western lawmakers have blasted Interior Assistant \n     Secretary George Frampton for inviting the committee to \n     Yellowstone and urging the panel to lend its voice to those \n     fighting the New World Mine.\n       Mr. Frampton issued the invitation at the request of \n     ``concerned citizens,'' said park spokeswoman Cheryl \n     Matthews. Those citizens include a coalition of 14 \n     environmental groups working to halt the mine, including the \n     Greater Yellowstone Coalition, the Sierra Club and the World \n     Wildlife Fund.\n       ``When we made the request a year ago, we didn't anticipate \n     the black-helicopter arguments,'' said Bob Ekey, spokesman \n     for the Greater Yellowstone Coalition in Bozeman, Mont. \n     ``Frankly, some of our critics have been putting out \n     misinformation--that the U.N. is going to come out, claim the \n     area and run the park.''\n       Other Western leaders have accused Mr. Frampton of badly \n     overstepping his authority by trying to kill the proposed \n     mine before the review process is complete. The U.S. Forest \n     Service and Montana Department of Environmental Quality are \n     now preparing an environmental-impact statement on the \n     project.\n       ``It is astonishing that a group of extreme \n     environmentalists can invite a few folks from the United \n     Nations to circumvent laws that Americans and Montanans have \n     worked hard for and lent their voices to,'' said Sen. Conrad \n     Burns, Montana Republican.\n       ``We have an exhaustive procedure in the books in Montana \n     to decide where mines can and cannot be cited. Why should we \n     allow the U.N. to pick and choose when these laws and rules \n     will be allowed to work?''\n       Rep. Barbara Cubin, Wyoming Republican, noted that Mr. \n     Frampton is ultimately responsible for a ``fair'' review of \n     the project, ``yet he is the very person who requested the \n     United Nations interference within the borders of the United \n     States.''\n       ``Does he want foreigners to determine our environmental \n     requirements?'' she asked. ``Doesn't he know that the United \n     States has the strictest environmental regulations on the \n     planet?''\n       Marvin Jensen, Yellowstone National Park assistant \n     superintendent, stressed that the international delegation \n     has ``no legal authority'' to set domestic policy. ``The only \n     thing the World Heritage Committee can do is list and de-\n     list,'' he said.\n       ``To be listed as `in danger' raises questions about the \n     site's continued listing,'' he explained. ``To be de-listed \n     would be embarrassing to any country.''\n       But some critics worry that the committee may have more \n     power than forest officials acknowledge. By signing the World \n     Heritage Treaty in 1972 and requesting Yellowstone's \n     designation as a World Heritage site in 1978, the United \n     States pledged to manage the park according to treaty \n     requirements, says the committee.\n       The most controversial of those requirements is the \n     establishment of a buffer zone around each World Heritage \n     site. When Yellowstone was listed, officials agreed that the \n     seven national forests surrounding the park would serve as an \n     adequate protection. None of the other 17 listed U.S. sites \n     has a formal buffer zone.\n       Past proposals for a buffer zone called for establishing an \n     18.2-million-acre perimeter around the park in which many \n     economic and recreational activities would be restricted, \n     including ranching, logging, snowmobiling, even auto traffic. \n     Most locals staunchly oppose such a zone.\n       During the delegation's three-day tour in September, \n     however, committee President Adul Wichiencharoen of Thailand \n     fed local fears when he suggested expanding the buffer zone \n     around the 2.3-million-acre park. That recommendation was \n     ultimately dropped from the final report.\n       Those remarks notwithstanding, park officials still insist \n     the committee's role is strictly advisory, and, barring \n     another invitation from the Interior Department, over and \n     done with.\n       Mr. Jensen admitted it's been difficult to convince some \n     local residents of that. ``One local fellow--a gardener--\n     asked me, `So when's the U.N. coming to take over \n     Yellowstone?' '' said Mr. Jensen. ``I talked to him and \n     talked to him and I could not convince him that that wasn't \n     going to happen.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S995-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S996-S997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                CHECHNYA\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the bloody events that took place in \nthe regions of Chechnya and Dagestan in recent months have alarmed us \nall. Terrorist acts by Chechen separatist rebels were answered with \nbrutal shelling of rebel, hostage, and civilian positions by Russian \ntroops. Although it is unclear how many people were killed during the \nfighting, Russian President Boris Yeltsin estimates that 153 Chechen \nseparatists, 42 hostages, and 26 Russian soldiers died during the 10-\nday crisis.\n  In October 1991, Dzhokhar Dudayev, a Moslem Chechen leader, was \nelected president of Chechnya and soon declared independence from \nRussia. This decision was met with immediate resistance from Moscow and \nPresident Yeltsin declared a state of emergency in the region. Over the \npast several years, Russian military forces clashed repeatedly with \nChechen nationalist forces loyal to Dudayev. After considerable \nbloodshed on both sides, a unilateral cease-fire was declared in April \n1995. Unfortunately, it did not last and fighting soon resumed.\n  On January 6, 1996, the fighting in Chechnya again reached the world \nstage. Chechen separatists attacked a Russian airfield in Chechnya and \ndestroyed two helicopter gunships. The rebels, under the command of \nSalam Raduyev, the son-in-law of Dudayev, withdrew from the airfield \nand proceeded to take more than 2,000 innocent men, women, and children \nhostage in a hospital in the town of Kizlyar in the neighboring region \nof Dagestan.\n  After negotiating with the Russians, Raduyev released the majority of \nthe hostages in return for safe passage to Chechnya. The rebels and 120 \nhostages boarded buses bound for Chechnya, but the convoy was stopped a \nshort distance from Chechnya by Russian forces near the town of \nPervomayskoye. Negotiations to end the stalemate failed, and the rebels \ndug in for a siege. Rather than continue to work toward a peaceful \nsolution to the crisis, the Russian military opened fire on the rebel \npositions in the town with tanks, howitzers, rockets, and small arms \nfire. Pervomayskoye is now totally destroyed.\n  I do not condone the terrorist acts employed by the Chechen rebels \nand abhor their use of civilians as shields. Terrorism is never a \nlegitimate negotiating ploy, and I hope that those who are responsible \nfor these acts are brought to justice.\n  I am, however, outraged about the use of excessive force by the \nRussian military against the rebels and the remaining hostages as well \nas the restrictions imposed on humanitarian groups who attempted to \nassist the wounded in Pervomayskoye. Humanitarian groups such as \nDoctors Without Boarders and the International Red Cross were not \nallowed to enter the town to aid injured civilians. At the same time, \nRussian soldiers were helicoptered out of the area to the nearest field \nhospitals.\n  The exact number of casualties remains in doubt because members of \nthe Western press were not allowed near Pervomayskoye and the casualty \nreports from both sides are not reliable. The New York Times reported \nas late as January 21 that Russian soldiers confiscated film from \nWestern photographers that were attempting to photograph the smoldering \nruins of the town. \n\n[[Page S997]]\n\n  In response to the Russian shelling of Pervomayskoye, Turkish \nnationalists sympathetic to the Chechen cause highjacked a Russia-bound \nferry in the Black Sea. The highjackers threatened to kill the more \nthan 200 passengers and blow up the ferry in the Straits of Bosporus if \nthe Chechens were not allowed to go free. After 3 days at sea, Turkish \nnegotiators convinced the highjackers that they had gained the world's \nattention and nothing would be achieved by carrying out their threats. \nThe highjackers then released their hostages and surrendered to Turkish \nauthorities.\n  I applaud the Turkish Government for patiently working to find a \npeaceful solution to this crisis.\n  The United States Government is committed to promoting democracy in \nthe New Independent States of the former Soviet Union and is investing \nmillions of taxpayer dollars to help the NIS on the path toward \ndemocracy. I strongly support this goal. But, the Russian military \ncampaign against the Chechens, especially during the past month, \ndemonstrates to the world that Russia's transition to democracy and \nhuman rights remains fragile and unpredictable, and that Russian \nnationalism is on the rise.\n  The war in Chechnya is far from over and a solution is not likely to \nbe found in the near future unless both sides are willing to abide by a \ncease-fire and negotiate in good faith. President Yeltsin should not \nview the defeat of Raduyev's small force as a victory. All sides \nlost.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S996-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JERI MELLON\n\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nGeraldine M. ``Jeri'' Mellon, who passed away on January 7, 1996 in \nHenderson, NV.\n  Jeri's courage and determination helped to convict Charles Keating, \nthe former owner of Lincoln Savings and Loan, who was responsible for \nthe Nation's worst savings and loan swindle in history. The innocent \nvictims of the savings and loan collapse were mostly elderly \nbondholders who lost their life savings.\n  Jeri testified about the fraud before Los Angeles County Court in \n1991, where she represented 23,000 bondholders. She moved the courtroom \nto applause with her emotional speech about the swindle. In 1993, Jeri \nalso testified against Keating in Federal court, helping to secure his \nconviction.\n  Jeri's efforts to assist the victims of the S scandal went far \nbeyond testifying in court. She helped organize and lead Lincoln-\nAmerican Continental Corp. Bondholders Action Committee, a support \ngroup for the victims. Through the group, a lawsuit was filed against \nKeating and others that resulted in the bondholders' recovery of \napproximately 60 percent of the money they had lost.\n  I had the opportunity to meet this dedicated woman when she came to \nWashington, DC to testify before Congress. Jeri recently helped me lead \nthe fight against a bill in the Senate that would undermine investors' \nrights in cases of fraudulent investment schemes. Unfortunately, the \nlegislation passed.\n  Before her retirement, Jeri was a registered nurse and also served in \nhospital administration. She was extremely active in her field and was \na member of many health organizations. I am certain she was as \nsuccessful and dedicated to her career as she was to her later \nendeavors.\n  Jeri will be remembered and missed by her many family and friends who \nloved her. She will also never be forgotten by the thousands of \nindividuals she stood up for in a most difficult time. I am pleased to \nrecognize Jeri Mellon for her life of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S997-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO WAYNE A. SIMMONS\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a tribute to \na real American hero and a dedicated public servant who recently passed \naway.\n  Gunner's mate first class Wayne A. Simmons, U.S. Navy retired, died \non December 14 at the age of 72 at a hospital in Birmingham, AL, where \nhe was undergoing treatment for a vascular ailment.\n  Mr. Simmons, who lived in College Park, MD, was born in Minnesota and \nmoved to the Washington, DC area as a child. In 1940, he dropped out of \nMcKinley High School in DC to enlist in the Canadian Army to serve in \nWorld War II. When it was discovered that he was underage, he was sent \nhome. On his 17th birthday, with the permission of his parents, Wayne \nSimmons enlisted in the U.S. Navy.\n  Mr. Simmons was stationed at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese force \nattacked the base and ushered the United States into World War II. He \nserved in the Pacific during the war, including service aboard the \nlight cruiser, Reno, and was recognized for his efforts in saving the \nship from sinking after an enemy torpedo attack. Following the war, Mr. \nSimmons served on several more ships and stations until he was \nmedically retired from active duty as a gunner's mate first class in \n1953.\n  Following his Naval career, Mr. Simmons settled back in the \nWashington, DC area, and earned both a bachelor of science and master's \ndegree in accounting from Benjamin Franklin University while working \nfor Gateway Finance in Mount Rainier. He joined the Department of \nAgriculture in 1968, where he was a food program specialist until his \nretirement in 1982.\n  Mr. Simmons attended Berwyn Baptist Church in College Park, MD, for \n40 years and served as a deacon in his church. He was a member of the \nAmerican Legion Post No. 33 in Washington, DC and the Birmingham \nMasonic Lodge in Beltsville, MD.\n  Mr. Simmons's family includes his lovely wife of 46 years, Patricia \nW. Simmons of College Park, MD; two daughters, Patricia S. Bradshaw of \nSilver Spring, MD, and Peggy E. Wagner of Crownsville, MD; two sons, \nWayne S. and Michael L. Simmons, both of Bowie, MD; and eight \ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. President, Wayne Simmons's life was one of service and devotion--\nexemplary service to the U.S. Navy and this great Nation of ours and \nunwavering devotion and love for his wife, his family, and his church. \nHe will be sorely missed by all who knew and loved him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S997-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S997-S998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SMILE WHEN YOU COMPARE US\n\n Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest all Senators will be \ngreatly interested in an article by Robert H. Pines, ``Smile when you \ncompare our countries,'' which appeared in the Toronto Globe and Mail \nseveral weeks ago.\n  While the United States and Canada share many common interests, \nincluding the longest undefended border in the world, they also differ \nin many ways. Bob Pines, who served with distinction as Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of State for Canadian Affairs in the Bush \nadministration, eloquently identifies some of the differences between \nthe United States and our neighbor to the North.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of this article be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n            [From the Toronto Globe and Mail, Nov. 30, 1995]\n\n                  Smile When You Compare Our Countries\n\n                          (By Robert H. Pines)\n\n       Perhaps the holiday season is a good time to dissect a \n     cliche.\n       Earlier this month I attended my fourth biennial conference \n     of the Association for Canadian Studies in the United States \n     (ACSUS). About 40 percent of those in attendance were \n     Canadians. Almost all the rest were Americans who make their \n     living teaching about Canada. There were a few others like \n     myself who have had a long love affair with your country in \n     non-academic pursuits.\n       The Canadian contingent frequently launched into the \n     familiar self-congratulatory litany of differences between \n     the two countries. Heads wagged in reflexive agreement at \n     mention of superior Canadian civility (undoubtedly true), the \n     famed United Nations report about Canada being the world's \n     best place to live (conceivably true if real meaning can be \n     assigned to sociological statistics), and on and on through \n     invidious comparisons of descending degrees of validity. \n     Raymond Chretien, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., orated \n     that ``we have a low crime rate and you have a high crime \n     rate.''\n       As noted, the American contingent numbered few of the Pat \n     Buchanan stripe. One intrepid soul at a symposium was \n     rewarded with icy stares when he diffidently mumbled \n     something about southward emigration dwarfing that from the \n     U.S. to Canada.\n       Another politically incorrect type daringly asked a \n     question approximately along these lines: If your country is \n     so great and ours so awful, how come you are on the verge of \n     breaking up and we are not? (Actually, being an academic, he \n     put it more politely.)\n       Therein lies the point of this essay. I submit to Canadian \n     readers that the American political system (not necessarily \n     American people or American society) holds one enormous \n     advantage over that of Canada; that of decisiveness.\n     \n[[Page S998]]\n\n       There is no ``notwithstanding clause'' in the U.S. \n     Constitution. When the U.S. Supreme Court renders one of its \n     frequent 5-4 decisions, the minority has been known to \n     grumble; however, stare decisis, the decision stands, and by \n     and large the country just goes on to the next problem.\n       Several Canadian speakers patted themselves on the back in \n     reference to the sanguinary American Civil War. To be sure, \n     more than 400,000 people died before their time, and the \n     result nowhere nearly approximated the end of history.\n       However the Civil War was as decisive as history gets: The \n     abomination of human slavery ended. When I visit my \n     grandchildren in Florida I do not go to a foreign country.\n       Well-intentioned monstrosities such as the Charlottetown \n     accord are virtually unknown south of the border. One of my \n     Manitoba political friends characterized it as ``everybody \n     shouting `gimmie gimmie' '' until nothing was left for the \n     country.\n       The ability to respond to special-interest groups with a \n     brusque no is not in the long run destructive of a country's \n     civility and livability. When grievances are genuine, \n     experience shows that the best compromise derives not from \n     liberal guilt but from self-respect, with a fair offer of \n     ``thus far and no further.''\n       A 19th-century American humorist told the story of the \n     fellow who was so kind he amputated his dog's tail by inches. \n     A cruel inability to solve problems is the obverse of \n     mindless kind intent.\n       The usual disclaimer: This somewhat harsh analysis does not \n     presume to offer advice to sovereign Canadians. The only \n     point is that perhaps there is something to be said for the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S997-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOANNA CREECH\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndear friend whose service to Kentucky has been truly amazing. Joanna \nCreech, who was hired during my tenure as Jefferson County judge/\nexecutive 18 years ago, retired December 31 as a transcriber for \nJefferson Fiscal Court.\n  Joanna's service to the fiscal court has been extraordinary. Although \nJoanna has been blind since the age of 15, she recorded nearly 500 \nsessions of court as her companion dog Fitz rested faithfully by her \nside.\n  Born in Leslie County, Joanna was educated at the Kentucky School for \nthe Blind, where she met her first husband. Married twice and widowed \ntwice, Joanna has three wonderful children. For years, she operated a \nmusical instrument store in Louisville with her first husband, Robert \nJohnson. After he passed away in 1977, Joanna was hired at the \nJefferson Fiscal Court under a Federal job program.\n  Known as a diligent and friendly perfectionist, Joanna has lamented \nin recent years that fiscal court meetings have grown ``mundane.'' In a \nrecent article in the Louisville Courier-Journal, she said, ``It was so \nmuch more fun where they were at each other's throats.''\n  In that article, the fiscal court clerk, Mary Bolton, said of Joanna, \n``She sees more with her ears than most people see with their eyes.

Mr. President, it is not often these days that we \nhear good news. It is not often that we hear about people who some \nconsider heroes. And when we do hear about heroes, they are usually \nsports figures who make millions or actors who have access to media \nattention.\n  But I recently heard about a Montanan that is neither an athlete, an \nactor, or any national figure. He has not saved lives or discovered a \nnew drug. In fact, I would venture to bet that most people inside this \nbeltway have never heard of him. And yet, he is a hero just the same.\n  His name is Roger Arpan, he is 39 years old and he lives in Alzada, \nMT. And recently he made such an impact on the life of a man in Alaska, \nthat I received a letter commending him.\n  I would like to read a portion of this letter, because it spells out \nso clearly why Roger is worthy of our attention:\n\n       I met Roger by accident when my nephew and I were in the \n     area in mid-October for an antelope hunt. We were on Highway \n     212 just north of Alzada when we spotted a nice herd of \n     animals well off the road in a very large pasture. We knew it \n     was private property and went to find the owner to ask \n     permission to hunt.\n       After a bit of searching, we found a road that led to the \n     ranch house. A man promptly came out of the house; his arms \n     flaying in the air, his head was bobbing around and he was \n     walking with an irregular gait. Soon he addressed us in a \n     halting fashion. We asked if we could get permission to hunt, \n     and he said, ``Yes, but watch out for livestock, and if you \n     are not successful, come back and I'll help you get some.'' \n     He also said he would be working in a distant back field \n     collecting rolls of hay and stacking them in the field.\n       We returned to the pasture and after laying some careful \n     stalking strategy, we collected a fine buck antelope with \n     15\\1/2\\ inch horns. As a matter of courtesy, we returned to \n     the ranch house to let the owners know of our success. This \n     time Roger was out in the big hay field, but he drove across \n     to meet us at the gate. There he was operating a large farm \n     truck and trailer hauling hay and driving a tractor with a \n     stacker, putting up the hay for winter feed all by himself. \n     His body motions may have seemed erratic to me, but Roger was \n     in complete control of himself and the equipment. I have \n     farmed nearly all my life and understand the requirement for \n     dexterity and alertness when operating heavy farm machinery. \n     I could not restrain myself and had to express my admiration \n     for Roger for his courage and determination in carrying out \n     these farming activities despite obvious and severe physical \n     limitations.\n       It was then that I learned that Roger Arpan was born with \n     cerebral palsy and has suffered the ravages of this disease \n     all his life. His parents determined early on that if Roger \n     was to have any kind of life, he had to learn to take care of \n     himself.\n       Roger suffers every day, now somewhat less than in past \n     years due to a new treatment, but the disease is chronic and \n     will be with him all his life unless a cure is discovered. He \n     carries on with courage and determination, motivated by the \n     love and support of his family. He is disabled in his \n     physical body but his mind is alert and he is out there \n     working and making a contribution to his family and to \n     society. Many people suffering disabilities far less acute \n     than Roger's fall into despair and become burdens on society, \n     but not this man.\n\n  Mr. President, I join with Wilson Gay, this man from Alaska, in \nsaluting Roger Arpan. Though I would like to believe Roger is a typical \nMontanan, I know that he stands out. His strength, his courage, his \ndetermination, his strong character, and yes, even his success, make \nRoger a hero. Keep up the good work, Roger. I tip my hat to you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S998-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INTRALATA TOLL DIALING PARITY\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, when the Senate debated S. 652, \nSenator Leahy from Vermont and I proposed an important provision \nconcerning the obligation of the Bell Operating Companies to provide \ndialing parity for intraLATA toll calls. That provision, which was \naccepted by the Senate, balanced the needs of competitors to have \naccess to 1+dialing capabilities for intraLATA toll calls and the Bell \nCompanies' need to have the opportunity to compete fairly for all long \ndistance traffic.\n  As Senator Leahy has already indicated, the conferees adopted that \nrequirement. The Bell Operating Companies' obligations for providing \ndialing parity for intraLATA toll calls are contained in section \n271(e)(2). It is important to recognize that the provisions in section \n251(c)(3) do not impose any additional obligation to provide intraLATA \ntoll dialing parity on the Bell Operating Companies. Section 251(c)(3) \napplies to BOCs only after they have been authorized to provide \ninterLATA authority in a State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S998-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S998-S999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AGRICULTURAL MARKET TRANSITION ACT OF 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Was it the leader's intention to come in at 7:30 in the \nmorning?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes, 7:30 in the morning. We are looking for a presider.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Just stay here a couple hours. \n  \n[[Page S999]]\n\n  Mr. DOLE. We think maybe those we accommodate later in the day might \nbe available in the morning.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is a good idea.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I do have an interest in the amendment being laid down. \nThere will be no debate on that tonight?\n  Mr. DOLE. Right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, does the Senator object to Senator \nWellstone discussing the amendment? It does not have to be----\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand.\n  Madam President, I told the distinguished leader that my only concern \nis that this is an area where the distinguished Senator from Vermont, \nMr. Jeffords, and I both want to speak in opposition. Because we are \ncurrently both in negotiations on something else, we would not be \nrequired to make any statement on it tonight, but we would have our \ntime tomorrow. That is all.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, if the Senator would yield, to \nfacilitate moving this along, I intend only to send this amendment to \nthe desk.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, if the Senator would just yield for a \nmoment, let me just say with regard to this agreement, while the \nagreement calls for 15 amendments, that does not preclude Senators from \nworking out amendments that may be accepted by the managers.\n  I hope that Senator Lugar, in his normal fashion, who is very \naccommodating and able to work with both sides of the aisle very well, \ncan do that on a number of these issues. It was with that understanding \nthat we have this agreement. There could be a number of these issues \nthat will not require a debate or a vote.\n  I hope throughout the day we could do that. But it is very important \nfor Senators, at least on this side of the aisle, to come down to the \nfloor in the early hours tomorrow morning so we can decide which ones \ncan be accepted and which ones are going to need to be scheduled for \nvotes. So there is no excuse if people have not come down by \nmidmorning.\n  I hope that everybody can be here. We will be here, ready to go. I \nhope that everyone understands we are working under some constraints \nhere, so the sooner they get here the better. And the more we can \naccommodate our managers in coming up with ways with which to offer \nthese amendments that will allow them to accept them, we ought to do \nso.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, if I could just add to that, in other \nwords, we need another amendment ready at 8 o'clock. We need one at \n8:30, and we need one at 9. They may not take 30 minutes. We need \npeople available because we are trying to accommodate some of our \ncolleagues in the afternoon.\n\n  So we will need to be accommodating to the managers, Senator Lugar \nand Senator Leahy, throughout the morning. So, hopefully, the staff, \nbefore we leave tonight, will have at least two or three lined up so \nthere will not be any problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/06/senate-section/article/S998-4", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
