I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields himself 5 minutes. The \nSenator has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the budget deficit for 1996 is estimated \nat $144 billion. It is projected to nearly double by the year 2002 \nunder current budgetary policies and will continue to grow each year \nthereafter. It is growing at an astounding rate, over $335,000 a \nminute. I am sure people are tired of hearing this, but in my opinion, \nwe have to keep repeating it.\n  The average young couple starting life today will pay about $113,200 \nin interest on this debt.\n  I have a number of children, six of them. I have eight grandchildren. \nI am very worried about the future as far as they are concerned in \nterms of what their share of this national debt will be if it continues \nto grow at this astounding rate.\n  It was projected that my youngest granddaughter's share of this debt \nwill increase 25 percent in just the next 5 years, and that she will \npay something like $187,000 in taxes in order to pay the interest on \nthe national debt during her life.\n  I have been impressed by what the leader, Senator Dole has been \nsaying. Interest rates are 2 percent or more higher than they would be \nif the debt and the deficit were under control. It is not a matter of \ntrying to pay down the debt overnight; we cannot. It is over $5 \ntrillion. It is not a matter of trying to eliminate the deficit \novernight; we cannot. The debt is mounting too fast.\n  What we can do is pass House Joint Resolution 1 which would be a \nsymbol to our people and to the world that we are prepared to set a new \nstandard for the Federal Government. The Federal Government of this \ncountry will do exactly what every State in the Union must do, balance \nthe budget annually, bring interest rates under control, and try to \nfind a way to start paying down the debt.\n  That is what this battle is all about. It is not about this \ngeneration and the deficit created under it. It is about\n\n[[Page S5874]]\n\nwhether this generation is going to solve the problem created during \ntheir lifetime, or are we going to pass it on to our children and \ngrandchildren?\n  I do not believe you can have any more graphic example than the \nexperience that Senator Dole shared with some of us the other day. He \ntold us about how he visited with this young couple, and because of the \n1-percent increase in interest rates, they were not able to buy the \nhouse they wanted. It meant $65 more per month. That is getting down \nwhere the rubber hits the road.\n  Many of us remember those days when we had to figure out, to the \npenny, what we were doing as young couples in order to have a home and \nto buy a car and to be able to plan ahead for our family.\n  These higher interest rates are denying young couples today the \naccess to the type of housing they need to raise a family.\n  I think that is the worst part of this situation we are dealing with \nright now, the disincentive for young people to start their families, \nto plan ahead and provide homes for them. That is not only the American \ndream, it is the American lifestyle. We ought to have a way to get back \nto that lifestyle. We ought to not deny it for future generations.\n  I do believe when we look at this problem today, whether or not we \nare going to send this constitutional amendment to our States for \nratification, we ought to think of future generations, not just \nourselves.\n  We need to think of our children and our children's children. Given \nour enormous debt, will their taxes be out of sight? They will be. Will \nthey be paying into Social Security retirement funds that will not be \nthere when they retire? They will be. Will the interest on the debt \nsqueeze out the type of services that ought to be provided by the \nFederal Government? The answer is yes.\n  Interest in the national debt is growing now to the point where it \nwill be 20 percent or more of Federal spending by the year 2002.\n  I support this constitutional amendment. In the past I have \nquestioned whether there was a basic commitment to the discipline that \nis necessary in Congress to carry it out without cutting necessary \ndiscretionary spending. I believe there is a commitment in this \nCongress and we ought to send this constitutional amendment to the \nStates.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how much time do I have under the previous \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is equally divided between the two \nsides.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, today we are once again engaging in an ancient debate \nabout whether or not there ought to be binding constraints on the \nability of the Government to incur debt. I say this is an ancient \ndebate because it actually started at the very beginning of the \nconstitutional process.\n  When Thomas Jefferson first saw the Constitution, he was serving as \nMinister to France and, therefore, was not in the country when it was \nwritten. When he first saw the Constitution, he made, in a letter, the \nfollowing statement: ``I wish it were possible to obtain a single \namendment to our Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that \nalone for the reduction of the administration of our Government to the \ngenuine principles of its Constitution. I mean an additional article \ntaking from the Government the power of borrowing.''\n  Now, I submit, Mr. President, that today we are engaged in the same \ndebate that was initiated the very first moment Jefferson saw the new \nConstitution. It was recognized at that point, by no less a keen \nobserver than Thomas Jefferson himself, that there was a problem in the \nConstitution. Fortunately, at that time, we were on a gold standard and \nthe amount of money in the economy was limited by a requirement that it \nbe converted into gold at the rate of $20.67 an ounce, and except \nduring wartime, when this requirement was suspended, we had a \nrelatively stable situation. Every time this requirement was suspended, \nhowever, we had an explosion in prices, and when we went off the gold \nstandard in the 1930's, this constraint on the amount of money in the \neconomy was totally removed.\n  We now find ourselves in the situation where we have not balanced the \nFederal budget since 1969. Every year since 1969, we have run a \ndeficit. The cumulative debt of the Federal Government, which converts \ninto a debt for each individual citizen, has risen from $1 trillion to \n$2 trillion to $3 trillion.\n  I know throughout this debate we have had charges hurled back and \nforth between the Democratic side of the aisle and the Republican side \nof the aisle as to who is responsible for this situation. I, for one, \ndo not have any trouble saying that the blame can be found on both \nsides of the aisle, both in the Congress and in the White House. The \nplain truth is, our Democratic colleagues who want more Government have \nconsistently underestimated the cost of the Government that they want, \nand in doing so they have planted the seeds for more and more \nGovernment spending without being willing to look the American people \nin the eye and say, ``We are going to have to raise taxes to pay for \nthis additional Government.''\n\n  Might I also say that, on our side of the aisle, we are very generous \nin promising less Government and more freedom--we love to talk about \ncutting taxes. But when it gets down to the bottom line of cutting \nGovernment spending, we have never ever been willing to cast the votes \nneeded to place ourselves in a position where we are living up to the \nhigh commitments we have made.\n  Some of our colleagues have said, ``Well, why do we need a binding \nconstraint on Government?'' They are forgetting, however, what is the \npurpose of the Constitution. If the Founders had trusted Congress to \nrespect freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the \npress, and if the Founding Fathers had trusted Congress to protect \nprivate property, there would never have been a Constitution. The whole \npurpose of the Constitution is to limit the power of Government. In \nfact, the genius of the Constitution is that it actually says there are \ncertain things that Government just cannot do.\n  Does anybody believe that this Congress, this President--that any \nCongress, or any President--can be trusted to balance the Federal \nbudget, to limit the growth of Government spending, or at least have \nthe courage to pay for it by raising taxes? I do not believe this \nCongress can be trusted, and I can not envision any Congress which \ncould be elected that, year in and year out, could be trusted to act in \nthis manner.\n  Let me explain why: Every time we vote on a spending bill, all the \ngroups who want the money are looking over the Congressman's left \nshoulder, sending letters back home, telling people whether their \nRepresentative cares about the old, the poor, the sick, the tired, the \nbicycle rider--the list goes on and on and on. But nobody is looking \nover the Congressman's right shoulder to see if he cares about the \nfuture of the country or the future of our children.\n  What happens, as we vote on these individual bills, is that the \naverage beneficiary may get $1,000, or $1,500 while the average \ntaxpayer may spend only 50 or 75 cents. You do not have to have a Ph.D. \nin economics to know that one person will do much more to get $1,000 or \n$1,500 than a lot of people will do to prevent spending 50 cents. So \nwhat happens on vote after vote after vote, is that we end up spending \nmore and more money.\n  Well, as a result, what has happened to taxes? When I was a boy, 8 \nyears old in 1950, the average family in America with two little \nchildren sent $1 out of $50 it earned to Washington in taxes. Today, \nthe average family with two children is sending $1 out of every $4 it \nearns to Washington in taxes. If we do not create a single new Federal \nprogram in the next 30 years, if we simply pay for the Government we \nhave already committed to, in 20 years the average family will be \nsending $1 out of every $3 to Washington, and in 30 years the average \nfamily will be sending $1 out of every $2 to Washington, DC.\n  This is the cold reality we face. In my opinion, there is only one \nthing we can do, short of a crisis, to change this picture, and that is \nto adopt a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. A \nconstitutional prohibition against deficit spending, which allows\n\n[[Page S5875]]\n\nfor a period of time to come into compliance, will end all of this \nfoolishness. The President will be forced to sit down and work with \nCongress and the Congress will be forced to work with the President, \nbecause under this constitutional constraint we will have no other \nchoice. If we want the games to end, if we want the Government to be \nforced to live on a budget, if we want to stop the explosion of the tax \nburden, if we want to have any real chance of preserving Medicare and \nSocial Security for our parents and for ourselves, and if we really \ncare about the future of our country, the most important single change \nwe could make in America Government is to adopt a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I had a previous agreement for 15 minutes. I yield \nmyself the final 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Jefferson and Adams, after having both served as President \nand after having had one of the most bitter political debates in \nAmerica history, started a correspondence, much of which is now known \nas the ``Jefferson-Adams Debate.'' Adams, ever the pessimist, argued \nthat Americans would discover that they could use Government to \nredistribute wealth, and that in doing so they would tax productive \neffort, reward indolence, and that ultimately democracy would fail. \nJefferson, ever the optimist, agreed that Americans would make the \ndiscovery that they could use Government to redistribute wealth, and \nagreed that all the tendencies that Adams identified would clearly be \npresent, but Jefferson argued that Americans would realize that what \nGovernment could take away from someone else to give them today it \ncould also take away from them and give to someone else tomorrow. \nJefferson believed that opportunity would always be so prevalent in \nAmerica that Americans would ultimately reject Government's \nredistribution of wealth.\n  We are, today, living out the Jefferson-Adams debate, and the future \nof our country is going to depend on the outcome of this dispute.\n  I believe that Jefferson was right. I believe that if America \nunderstood what we are choosing every day by choosing more and more \ngovernment and choosing less and less freedom, I believe that if we \ncould just let Americans look at the end of the path we are following \nand then decide which fork in the road to take, there would not be any \ndoubt as to which path they would choose--they would choose \nJefferson's.\n  The problem is that the whole spending process distorts the view and \nprevents us from seeing clearly the end of the path we are now \nfollowing. Even in the Republican budget which we tout this year, we \nwill spend $17 billion more on discretionary spending than we promised \nto spend last year, and we are the party of fiscal responsibility. The \nDemocrats would start dozens of new programs, that would bankrupt the \ncountry, without ever telling anybody that they would require a massive \nincrease in taxes.\n  There is only one way we can bring this to an end, and that is to \npass a balanced budget constitutional amendment, send it to the States, \nlet the States ratify it, and then have it imposed on Congress. \n``Congress shall make no law which raises the deficit.'' This is the \nconstraint we need.\n  There are those who have argued, ``Well, you are endangering Social \nSecurity by forcing the Government to live on a budget.'' Does anybody \nreally believe that we protect Social Security by going deeper and \ndeeper in debt every single day? Does anybody believe that the \nexplosion of Government programs can ultimately do anything except \ndestroy Social Security? Does anybody believe this continued spending \nspree under Democratic and Republican administrations, under Democratic \nand Republican Congresses, can do anything other than undermine the \ncreative genius of our country?\n  We can cut interest rates, we can expand economic growth, we can \ncreate more jobs, create more growth, and create more opportunity for \nour people, but we can only do it if we stop the deficit and force a \nreal debate, and the real debate is this:\n  Do the Democrats want more Government enough to raise taxes to pay \nfor it? Do Republicans want more freedom enough to cut spending to make \nit possible? Both parties are living a lie today. We could end that by \npassing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  We were one vote short the last time we voted on this because six \nDemocrats, having voted for it in the past, changed their votes when it \nreally counted.\n  I hope today will be the beginning of a change. I hope people see \nthis as a golden opportunity to change America. I doubt they will, \nthough I am confident that some day we are going to pass this \namendment. The sooner we can pass it, the better off the country will \nbe and I continue to hope we will do it today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, why are Federal budget deficits bad? One \nreason is that for every year that we run a deficit we have to borrow \nto pay for the shortfall. In the beginning of our country until today, \nwe have borrowed--this Nation of ours currently is in debt nearly $5 \ntrillion--$5 trillion with the overwhelming majority of that having \noccurred in the past 15 years. The cost of servicing that debt--in \nother words, paying the interest on that debt--is currently $240 \nbillion a year. That is not paying the principal. That is solely paying \nthe interest on the debt.\n  Interest now is the third largest payment that the U.S. Government \nmakes every year. We pay Social Security. We pay defense. And then the \nnext largest item is interest on the debt--$240 billion a year.\n  Suppose we did not have to pay that interest on the debt? Suppose \nthat $240 billion was available instead to improve our education \nsystem, or to do something about better maintenance for our highways, \nor to clean up our environment in a better fashion than we are \ncurrently doing, or to bolster our efforts to combat crime. A whole \nlist of very, very attractive items would be available--potential \nexpenditures to improve our Nation if we were not paying $240 billion a \nyear interest on the debt.\n  The deficit places a tremendous strain on the national economy \nthrough higher interest rates. The interest rates would be far lower. \nAnd this is not just me saying this. This is testimony we have had \nbefore the Finance Committee by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, \nMr. Alan Greenspan. Investors in the United States and borrowers in the \nUnited States are required to pay higher interest because of the \ntremendous national debt that we have and the high interest rates that \nare having to be paid to service that debt.\n  If the interest rates were low, what would happen? People would pay \nless on their mortgages every year, less on their borrowing for a new \nautomobile, and less on the borrowings they have made for their \nchildren's education.\n  The Federal deficit also places a drag on future economic growth. Our \npotential to expand the economy is directly linked to the amount we \ninvest in physical and in human capital--newer and better machinery, a \nbetter trained work force with improved skills, and, thus, higher \nproductivity and a higher standard of living if we had a pool of \nnational savings available for that investment. Regrettably that is not \ntrue. National savings in our country has declined dramatically over \nthe last decade--the last 10 years--in part because the Federal \nGovernment has engaged in a policy of not saving through its deficit \nspending. This is, in part, because now what can we do about all this? \nHow will a constitutional amendment to balance the budget help us? What \nit will do principally is to impose fiscal discipline upon this Nation \nof ours.\n\n  The Federal Government has failed to balance its budget for 26 \nstraight years. With a balanced budget amendment in effect, this Nation \nof ours--and us as elected Senators, and likewise in the House of \nRepresentatives--will be required to balance the budget, would be \nrequired to face up to the tough decisions, and if we want to spend \nmoney, we have to raise the money to pay for it. We cannot borrow.\n  So this balanced budget amendment represents a first and most \nimportant\n\n[[Page S5876]]\n\nstep on a long and difficult journey to fiscal responsibility and to \npassing this Nation on in better condition to our children than we \nreceived it.\n  Mr. President, every previous effort to balance the budget without an \namendment to the Constitution--I previously was not in favor of an \namendment. Instead, I thought we could do it through Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings, or through firewalls, or through caps on discretionary \nspending, or pay-as-you-go rules. All of these we have tried. None of \nthem has succeeded to date. When the targets became too difficult to \nmeet, we simply changed the law. That is the way we did it in the past. \nBut we will not be able to do it once this amendment is in effect.\n  So, Mr. President, it is my earnest hope that this amendment will be \nadopted today.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nneed.\n  Mr. President, let me, first of all, say that I think this proposal \non the floor of the Senate suffers from the same structural problems \nthat have been with it from the very beginning. It is good politics. It \nis easy for everybody to vote for it, even if they are not serious \nabout balancing the budget. It is painless. But I do think there are a \ncouple of problems that are very important problems to the people in my \nState of Minnesota.\n  First of all, there are a number of us who would be interested in \nthis formulation about balancing the budget if, in fact, we had an \namendment that said there could be no raid on the Social Security trust \nfund. That ought not to be a part of the equation of balancing the \nbudget. But we cannot get support for that amendment.\n  So, No. 1, I think the talk about a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget without the ironclad guarantee, not just to senior \ncitizens, but to their children and their grandchildren, that we will \nnot raid the Social Security trust fund, is a proposal that is deeply \nflawed.\n  Why are my colleagues so reluctant to support an amendment on the \nproposition that in balancing the budget between now and 2002, we will \nnot raid the Social Security trust fund? In the absence of that kind of \nguarantee, I am not going to vote for any amendment, constitutional or \notherwise, to balance the budget, unless there is the absolute \nassurance given to senior citizens and their families.\n  I am so tired of this politics that tries to divide the old from the \nyoung, senior citizens from their children and grandchildren. Unless we \nhave that guarantee, this proposal is deeply flawed. There are a number \nof us who want to vote for that alternative, but we do not get the \nsupport for it. People in Minnesota and around the country are not \ninterested in an effort to balance the budget on the backs of senior \ncitizens. They are not interested in an amendment that says we will \nbalance the budget, with no guarantee that we are not going to raid the \nSocial Security trust fund to do it. That is flaw No. 1.\n\n  Flaw No. 2. People in cafes in Minnesota--I think the cafes are the \nbest place to be; I think this is the best focus group. You sit down \nand you talk with people. They say, look, we balance our budget at \nhome--and we do. But when we balance our budget at home, here is how we \ndo it. We make a distinction between investment for the future and our \ndaily or monthly or yearly operating expenses. We do not cash flow a \ncar that we buy. We do not cash flow the home that we buy. It is on the \nbasis of a fairly long-term mortgage, and we do not cash flow our \nchildren's education, higher education. We make an investment. It is a \nvery good family practice and a very good business practice, a sound \nbusiness practice, to make such an investment if you know that it will \npay for itself over and over and over again.\n  We had an amendment last time that said, look, let us talk about a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, but let us make some \ndistinction between the investment budget, investment we make now--\neducation, physical infrastructure, or whatnot--which pays for itself \nover and over again versus our daily operating budgets. That amendment \nwas voted down. Every family in Minnesota and in America knows the \ndistinction between spending money on a vacation during the summer, \nwhen maybe you should not do it, versus spending money on your child's \nhigher education. We had an amendment that wanted to make that \ndistinction. I have talked to one of the coauthors, Senator Simon, \nabout such an amendment. But, no, that amendment also is not part of \nthis.\n  So if you are talking about a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget and (a) you have to guarantee that this does not lead to a \nraiding of the Social Security trust fund, and (b) you have no \ndistinction made between an investment budget and an operating budget, \nyou have a deeply flawed proposal.\n  The third point. We can balance the budget--and should. I voted for \nthe President's proposal to balance the budget by the year 2002--CBO \nscored. I do not think people really know what all this CBO scored \nmeans, but I will say it. Actually, I thought that proposal was by no \nmeans perfect and that we could do much better.\n  Mr. President, you have a proposal that is flawed on several counts. \nThen we get to the sort of--as my children would have said it when they \nwere younger--``get real'' phase of this. We do not need this to \nbalance the budget. We can do it. The question is, how?\n  I will tell you one of the things that I find just more than a little \nbit ironic. At the very time that some of my colleagues, whom I deeply \nrespect, are talking about a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget, they trot out a son-of-star-wars proposal. The Pentagon does \nnot want it, the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not want it, and it is $70 \nbillion more on top of what we are already spending on star wars. We do \nnot know whether it will work. It is not proven. Research has not been \ndone. The Pentagon and the military tell us we need to, first of all, \ndo research to see whether or not this would work and to defend our \ncountry in what ways. But the very people who are talking about a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, no guarantee we will \nnot raid the Social Security trust fund, who will not pass our \namendment that makes it clear that you cannot do that, are the very \npeople that trot out the son of star wars, with $70 billion more for a \nsystem the Pentagon itself does not want in this form right now.\n\n  Mr. President, the very people who are voting for a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget have now in the budget proposal voted \nfor $11 billion more than what the Pentagon wants. The first time in my \nadult life--no, it is the second time; it happened before. This is the \nsecond time around. This is the second time in my adult life where the \nCongress is appropriating more money than the Pentagon says it wants. \nThese are the same people who want to cut financial aid to higher \neducation, cut educational opportunities for children, cut into Head \nStart, cut into job training, and they want to go $70 billion more for \nson of star wars, and they want to spend $11 billion more above and \nbeyond that $70 billion than the Pentagon even wants. And the last time \naround, in the last budget, it was $7 billion more we were going to \nspend. My friends who say they want to balance the budget want to spend \n$7 billion more on the Pentagon than the Pentagon wanted, and I came \nout here with a modest amendment which said, please, could you not take \nhalf of that $7 billion, $3.5 billion, spend $3.5 billion less since \nthe Pentagon said it does not need it and put it into deficit \nreduction, and the amendment was defeated.\n\n  So everybody understand the politics of today. This proposal was \ndefeated before. It will be defeated probably by a wider margin today. \nThe Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] has come out in the Chamber and \nsaid this is absolutely outrageous, because I see what my colleagues \nare doing here; they want to spend more and more and more and then they \nwant to do a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  Well, to use what I think is an old Yiddish proverb, you cannot dance \nat two weddings at the same time. And people in the country are just \ngetting a little tired of it. That is what this proposal is all about. \nYou have people in the Senate who say we are for balancing the budget \nby the year 2002, and\n\n[[Page S5877]]\n\ndo not worry, senior citizens; this will not be done on your backs and \nwe will not raid the Social Security trust fund, although that surplus \nis sitting out there, we can assure you of that. But then when it comes \nto actually voting for that, these folks will not do that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to.\n  Mr. HATCH. It seems to me that is one reason why we need a balanced \nbudget amendment. If there are Senators that will not do that now, then \nunder the balanced budget amendment we are going to have to. We are \ngoing to have to raise taxes and reduce spending or have a \nsupermajority vote to spend more. But if I could just ask one last \nthing, and I do not mean to interrupt my colleague.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is fine.\n  Mr. HATCH. One last thing. And that is that I have heard these \narguments before. I heard President Clinton on the news the other day \nsay as he was walking outside the White House, ``Let's just balance \nit.'' I have heard that for the whole 20 years I have been here: \n``Let's just balance it.'' Both sides have said that over the years.\n  I think both sides have flaws here. I think both sides have spent too \nmuch, both sides have taxed too much, both sides have not done what \nshould be done. That is why we need a balanced budget amendment, \nbecause then the game is over. The Federal Government is going to have \nto live within its means or vote with a high consensus to not live \nwithin them, but at least that vote will be done on the record, in \nfront of the American people, rather than the phony way things are done \ntoday when people just stand up here and say, ``Let's just balance \nit.'' I have to laugh. That is the biggest joke in our history. We have \n60 years of not balancing it very often, and 27 years in a row of not \nbalancing it at all.\n  That is what bothers me. That is why Senator Simon and I and others \nhave fought so hard to try to get this amendment passed, so that the \ngame will be over for both sides.\n  I would also use a Yiddish expression, and that is chutzpah. It takes \nchutzpah to continue to just spend and tax the American people and to \nsell out the future of our children. And frankly, that is what is going \non here. I am willing to blame both sides. I will be happy to say the \nRepublicans are to blame here, too. I will be as bipartisan as I can \nbe, just like Senator Simon has been, but both of us know that if we do \nnot do something about it, it is only a matter of time until we are \ngoing to have to monetize the debt and we will pay it off with devalued \ndollars that roll off the printing press not really worth anything--\nbarrels of dollars that will not be worth anything printed up so the \nGovernment can escape its debt liability. But at that point, the United \nStates will no longer be the great power it has always been. And that \nis what it is coming down to, because we cannot continue to go the way \nwe are.\n  What really bothers me, and I will end----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is fine.\n  Mr. HATCH. What really bothers me is this argument that we have to \npreserve and protect Social Security by defeating the balanced budget \namendment, which is the only way to preserve and protect Social \nSecurity, or at least the current Social Security system. I think if we \npass this amendment, we will not only have to preserve and protect it \nas it is now, we are going to have to find a way of reforming it so \nthat it will last well into the next century and take care of our \nchildren and our grandchildren as well, not just those who are living \ntoday. The only way we are going to do that is if we really get serious \nabout it and force the Congress to do it. And the only way you are \ngoing to do that is by passing a constitutional amendment. I do not \nthink anybody who looks at it sincerely can doubt the wisdom of what I \njust said.\n  The fact is that this amendment has been around for a lot of years. \nIt is a consensus amendment. It is the one amendment that has a chance \nof passing, the first amendment that has ever passed the House of \nRepresentatives, the first one and maybe the only one that will ever \npass the House of Representatives, and yet we in the Senate are going \nto stand and block it.\n  What really hurts me to a great degree is that at least six Senators \nwho have always voted for it are voting against it under the guise that \nthey are protecting Social Security, when in fact the only way you can \nprotect Social Security is to get our spending habits under control, \nand the only way to do it is to give us the fiscal discipline to do it \nin the constitution.\n  I thank my colleague for allowing me to make these comments, but I \nfelt I had to make them in light of what my friend has said.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague may want to make more \ncomments because I just respectfully--parliamentary inquiry. I have the \nfloor, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. First of all, I am always more than \npleased to hear the analysis of my friend from Utah--a lot of times we \nsay in the Chamber ``whom I deeply respect,'' and it sounds like \nflattery, but whom I really do deeply respect. There is just no doubt \nof his ability as a legislator and his expertise in the Senate, but I \nam in profound disagreement with that analysis on two points.\n  First, if in fact we want to make it crystal clear that we are going \nto balance the budget by the year 2002 and in no way, shape or form is \nthe Social Security trust fund money going to be used for that, then \nlet us have the amendment out on the floor and let us vote for it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me just finish if I can. That is my first point. \nThat is, I think, an important reassurance which we must give.\n  My second point is that I am absolutely in agreement with my \ncolleague that when you look to the future, especially around the year \n2030 and you get to a ratio of two workers and only two workers or \nworking people to every one retired person--in that sense demography is \ndestiny--we have our work cut out for us. But I think it is a flawed \neconomic analysis to argue, well, the way we do that is in fact through \na constitutional amendment to balance the budget. The way we do that is \nin a lot of different ways, but one of those ways is to make sure that \nwe have an economy that is producing enough living-wage jobs, that is \nto say, jobs that people can count on that pay a decent wage with \ndecent fringe benefits so that that working generation, which is the \nway the Social Security system works, is able to contribute to those \nwho are retired, and then when we are retired, we hope that also there \nwill be a successful enough economy so that base will be there. That is \na whole different set of issues that have to do with whether or not we \nare going to invest in job training, that have to do with whether or \nnot we are going to invest in education, that have to do with whether \nor not we are going to have an economy that produces high value \nproducts with a skilled labor force--all of which, I would say to my \ncolleague, has much to do with whether or not we make the right \ninvestment decisions in the private sector and in the public sector.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I could just finish--that is my first point.\n  My second point is, I must say that when my colleague talks about the \npast 20 years, I do not have that perspective. Maybe that is the \ndifference. I have not been here that long. I know that in the last 3 \nyears since the President was elected we have halved the deficit. It \nhas gone down. Those facts are irreducible and irrefutable.\n  I know, if we want to talk about the past, there were people here in \nthe early 1980's, starting around 1981--David Stockman has written \nabout this eloquently, as he looks back on those times--who passed what \nwas euphemistically called the ``Economic Recovery Act.'' George Bush, \nPresident Bush, once called it ``voodoo economics.'' We were going to \nhave these massive tax cuts. That was great politics. We could say to \npeople in the country, ``We ask you to make a supreme sacrifice. Will \nyou let us cut your taxes so the economy will grow and everybody will \nbe better off?'' And people said, ``Absolutely.'' So we did that; \ndisproportionate money going to those who had the most income. And, in \naddition, we dramatically increased the Pentagon budget, not to mention \nthe explosion of tax expenditures. By the way, I say to my colleague \nfrom Utah,\n\n[[Page S5878]]\n\nI do not see any evidence that my colleagues here are willing to take \nthat on, all those loopholes in deductions, all those subsidies that go \nto oil companies, tobacco companies, pharmaceutical companies, you name \nit. We do not take any of that on.\n  So what did we have, an overall debt that was about $900-and-some \nbillion? Now what is it, $4, $5 trillion, or thereabouts?\n  I must say, yes, I was not a part of that. I was not a part of the \nclaim for trickle down economics. I never made those claims to people. \nAnd I know if we were not paying the interest off on that debt built up \nduring the 1980's we would have a balanced budget right now.\n  So I am not arguing--I will finish. I have the floor. But I am not \narguing that we not make the tough decisions. I am not arguing that we \nshould not be fiscally responsible. As a matter of fact, I come to the \nfloor with amendments for lots of cuts. What I argue with is some of \nwhat I think are distorted priorities. People want to do more and more \nfor the Pentagon. They now have a son of star wars. But for some \nreason, my colleagues do not seem to believe that a good education is a \nstrong national defense against ignorance, against prejudice, against \nhopelessness, against despair, against children not doing well, against \nnot having skilled workers.\n  So this is a debate about a flawed proposal, structurally, and about \npriorities. That is what this debate is about.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will my friend be kind enough to yield on that point?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield for a question, but I would \nlike to keep the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just say, I believe my friend makes a very good \ncase for the balanced budget amendment. Because even though he \ncriticizes some things that others have done, and compliments some \nthings that he has done, the fact is that the system is running the \nsame as usual. One thing that I would just like to point out and I ask \nthe question, is it not true that the six Democrats who always voted \nfor the balanced budget amendment before--and, perhaps, all Democrats \non that side--who now refuse to support the balanced budget amendment \nunder the guise that they are preserving or protecting Social Security \nby refusing to support a balanced budget amendment that does not \nexclude Social Security from the balanced budget calculation, that all \nsix of those Democrats, and I believe every Democrat who will use the \nSocial Security argument as an excuse for voting against the balanced \nbudget amendment, I would ask my friend, did not every one of them vote \nfor President Clinton's fiscal year 1997 budget which did not exclude \nSocial Security receipts from deficit calculations? And, even though my \ncolleague claims the deficit is going down, the debt since we first \ndebated and voted down the balanced budget amendment has gone up $320 \nbillion in 15 months. While we fiddle around here the Nation is \nburning. We fiddle around on trivialities when, in fact, passing the \nbalanced budget amendment is the only way we are going to get things \nunder control.\n\n  Will my colleague agree the Democrats voted for the Clinton 1997 \nbudget, which itself did not exclude Social Security, and used those \nSocial Security surpluses in their budgetary deficit calculations?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague there is one fundamentally \nimportant distinction. The Democrats did not enshrine in the \nConstitution the potential raiding of the Social Security trust fund. \nIt is that simple. I do not think senior citizens or their children or \ntheir grandchildren want us to do that, nor should we do so.\n  I also would say to my colleague, my critique was not restricted to \njust that one point alone. I argued that this proposal, I think, is \nflawed in two or three fundamental ways, and then went on to discuss \npriorities. So that is the distinction.\n  Mr. President, let me just finish up, because I see my colleague from \nNew Mexico is on the floor. There are others who want to speak.\n  I reiterate what I said earlier. This proposal is deeply flawed, I \nthink on policy grounds, structural grounds. There should be an \nironclad guarantee that we do not enshrine in the Constitution, raiding \nthe Social Security trust fund. We should make a distinction--I have \nsaid this over and over again, I say to my colleague from Utah--between \ninvestment and operating budgets. And we ought to be very careful in \nnot tying our hands so that we do not have, through specifically fiscal \npolicy, the ability in times of economic downturn to do what we need to \ndo to make sure that recessions do not turn into depressions.\n  Those are some of the structural arguments. My other arguments have \nto do with priorities. One more time I will point out to people in the \ncountry the politics of this vote. It is transparent. We had the vote \nbefore. It is not going to pass. Senator Exon has come to the floor, \nwho has voted for it before, and he said this is just outrageous. The \nvery people who are proposing this now bring out son of star wars for \nanother $70 billion. These are the very people who want to spend $7 \nbillion more than the Pentagon even wants. Now they are talking about \nwhat kind of tax cuts they can give. And this just does not add up. It \ndoes not add up at all.\n  So it is wrong on basic policy grounds. It is wrong from the point of \nview of playing politics. And, finally, I have to say, as somebody who \nhas had amendments out here--and a good number of these amendments have \nnot been agreed to, but I actually think these amendments are quite \nconnected to where most of the people in the country are--for the life \nof me I do not understand why this interest in going forward with this \nexpensive son of star wars system, this star wars system, and at the \nsame time colleagues are so eager to cut into job training programs, \neducational opportunity programs, Head Start programs, and \nenvironmental protection programs and all of the rest. When it comes to \ngoing after subsidies for oil companies or tobacco companies or \npharmaceutical companies or big insurance companies and a whole lot of \nothers of these tax expenditures, which are giveaways, a big part of \nthe budget, the silence of my colleagues is deafening. They do not want \nto do it. These are the big players, the heavy hitters. These are the \nfolks who have the clout.\n\n  When it comes to going after the Pentagon contractors some of my \ncolleagues who are pushing this proposal the hardest want to spend more \nmoney than the Pentagon even wants to spend. And they continue with \nthis idea of tax cuts, adding up to a significant amount of money, \ndisproportionately flowing to those people who need it the least, all \nin exchange for reductions in the quality of health care for senior \ncitizens, children, you name it.\n  These are distorted priorities. So we have two sets of issues going \non here, and on all counts this proposal should be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished chairman of \nthe Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hope the American people understand \nall these arguments about what Republicans want to spend money on, what \nDemocrats want to spend money on, who wants to cut taxes, who does not \nwant to cut taxes, have nothing whatsoever to do with a balanced \nbudget. It is an absolute, utter smokescreen. The truth of the matter \nis, you either want a balanced budget built into the Constitution or \nyou do not. For those Democrats and the one Republican who voted \nagainst the balanced budget and never came to the floor, never inserted \nin the Record any excuse, but rather said, ``I am against it as a \nmatter of policy,'' I laud them. I praise them. They just happen to be \nagainst it. They do not think it ought to be done.\n  But for those Senators, and I gather there are none on our side, who \ntake to the floor and make excuses about why they are against it such \nas, ``We are raiding the trust fund for Social Security,'' it is a \ncharade, it is an absolute smokescreen.\n  Senators Daschle and Dorgan and others have produced a constitutional \namendment which would require a balanced budget in the year 2002 \nexcluding the Social Security trust fund. They argue that including \nSocial Security in the balanced budget amendment effectively authorizes \nthe raiding of the Social Security trust fund and its surpluses for \npurposes of balancing the budget.\n\n[[Page S5879]]\n\n  Mr. President and fellow Senators and those who are listening, I \nbelieve this argument and the Daschle-Dorgan proposal, I repeat, is \nnothing more than a smoke screen. It is intended to divert the public's \nattention from the real issue, constitutionally required fiscal \ndiscipline. You either want it or you do not want it. We happen to \nthink it is long overdue. Second, it provides an excuse for some who \nsupported a balanced budget amendment in the past to vote against it \nnow, now that their votes really matter.\n  But I believe the American people will see through this smokescreen \nbecause it is obvious that this is a charade and it is not about Social \nSecurity. Rather, it is plain and simple about defeating the balanced \nbudget amendment. That is what it is all about, defeating the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment.\n  It is obvious--not those Democrats who will vote against it on \nprinciple or our one Republican who votes against it on principle--but \nit is obvious that others are not serious about their constitutional \namendment because it would have one clear result which they adamantly \noppose, deeper spending cuts in domestic programs, or, which they \nallege to be opposed to, tax increases. It will be one or the other \nunder their proposals--huge, deep spending cuts in domestic programs, \nwhich they avow they are not for, or huge increases in taxes, which \nthey run around saying they are not for. One or the other must occur \nunder their balanced budget amendment, which they call pure.\n  Over the next 6 years, from 1997 until 2002, the cumulative unified \nbudget deficit, that is the total receipts less total outlays--a simple \nproposition--will be $1.1 trillion, according to CBO. Over that same \nperiod, Social Security will run a surplus of $520 billion, including \n$104 billion in the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, if we adopt the Daschle-Dorgan approach, we would be \nforced to make much deeper spending reductions than any plan on the \ntable.\n  Let me give you the best estimate I can of what it will require, I \nsay to Senator Hatch.\n  If applied proportionately across the budget, that plan will require \n$92 billion more in Medicare cuts. Of course, they will disavow that. \nThey are not for that. They are for a balanced budget without Social \nSecurity, without that trust fund being in the budget. It will require \n$46 billion more in Medicaid cuts. Of course, they will say that is not \nthe case. They do not want that. It will require $36 billion more in \nwelfare cuts, $62 billion more in mandatory spending, and $38 billion \nmore in the discretionary accounts of the Government. Is that what they \nreally want?\n  Frankly, some will get up and say, ``No. We're going to do it another \nway.'' How? There is only one other way, and that is to dramatically \nincrease taxes. I do not mean a little bit--a huge amount. Is that what \nthey want? Maybe. But they are not saying that.\n  So I conclude that those who are now hiding behind the veil of Social \nSecurity being adversely affected by a unified balanced budget, their \nreal goal is plain and simple and as patent as can be. It is to kill \nthe balanced budget amendment, nothing more, nothing less.\n\n  The sponsors of the Daschle-Dorgan proposal argue that our balanced \nbudget amendment would raid Social Security. If that is the case, then \nthe Democrats who proposed it and the President who talks about that \nare raiding Social Security, too. In fact, every budget plan by the \nPresident and the Democrats in the past 18 months, which claims to \nreach balance in the year 2002, includes Social Security in the deficit \nestimates. They claim balance; and it is a balance which includes \nSocial Security in every single budget produced.\n  Most recently--January 19, 1996; the end of the negotiations--\nSenators Daschle and Dorgan held a press conference with others to \npromote their approach to balancing the budget. Somehow they must have \nforgotten that their plan reached balance in 2002, in their words, \n``raiding Social Security.''\n  Moreover, the President's 1997 budget, although filled with gimmicks, \nlike every other balanced budget presented this year, gets nowhere near \nbalance in the year 2002 if the Social Security trust fund is excluded. \nYet Democrat after Democrat--not those who vote against it as a matter \nof principle; but those who want to tell the American people they are \nfor a constitutional balanced budget--but Democrats of that yoke, one \nafter another, claim that the President's proposal ``balances the \nbudget in 2002.'' Yet 45 Democratic Senators voted for the President's \nbalanced budget plan during the last month of debate on the budget \nresolution. I will wager that almost every one, knowing that the public \nwants a balanced budget, took full credit for it and said, ``We just \nvoted for a balanced budget.'' It was a balanced budget of the exact \ntype that this constitutional amendment will require.\n\n  I mention this only again to highlight the hypocrisy of such \nproposals. They say they cannot support a balanced budget that includes \nSocial Security surpluses and yet every budget they produce and call \nbalanced supports exactly that.\n  This is not about protecting Social Security. Those who claim that it \nis and put a cover over their vote by claiming that it is are trying to \nsuggest that our balanced budget amendment does not protect Social \nSecurity.\n  Let me be clear. We made a promise to our Nation's seniors that we \nwould balance the budget by 2002 without touching Social Security \nbenefits. We kept that promise. Of course, the same cannot be said of \nsome of the other proposals.\n  The President, in 1993, in his $260 billion tax increase, the largest \nin history, raised the portion of Social Security benefits subject to \ntaxes from 50 to 85 percent. This effectively cut benefits for millions \nof middle-class senior citizens by $25 billion over 5 years.\n  In 1995, 19 Democrat Senators voted for a substitute balanced budget \nunder reconciliation that cut the Consumer Price Index and thus Social \nSecurity COLA's. I will admit there was great bipartisan support for \nit. But for those who now say they do not want to touch Social \nSecurity, they do not want to harm it in a constitutional balanced \nbudget, they voted already to harm it to cut the CPI.\n  Indeed, my good friend, Senator Moynihan, known as a defender of \nSocial Security, called for a CPI reduction of 1 percent each year to \nbalance the unified budget by the year 2002.\n  Of course, very recently 46 Senators, 24 Democrats and 22 \nRepublicans, voted for the Chafee-Breaux alternative which included a \nCOLA reduction of five-tenths of 1 percent. This proposal would cut \nSocial Security spending by $40 billion.\n  So, not only did that proposal count the surpluses toward the \nbalanced budget, it increased those surpluses by cutting benefits. I \nhope that no Senator that voted for Chafee-Breaux will vote against the \nbalanced budget amendment using the protection of Social Security as an \nexcuse.\n  Again, I want to repeat, the Republican budget does not touch Social \nSecurity at all. I have said all along that the best way to protect \nSocial Security is to balance the budget so that we have a strong, \ngrowing economy. In legislation implementing the balanced budget \namendment, if it were to pass, we could provide procedural safeguards \nto preclude cutting Social Security benefits or raising Social Security \ntaxes to balance the unified budget. That is not an issue of the \namendment. It is an issue of the will of the Congress as a matter of \npolicy, once it is adopted.\n  When we amend the Constitution, we must be taking the long view. \nAlthough some claim they are worried about raiding the Social Security \nsurpluses, I am concerned about the looming and massive Social Security \ndeficits that are on the horizon. These Social Security deficits \nthreaten to push the unified budget to levels far above those we are \nexperiencing today.\n  Over the period from 2020 to 2030, the Social Security trust fund \nwill run a cumulative deficit of $4 trillion. In 2030 alone, the annual \nSocial Security deficit will be $1 trillion, or $225 billion in \nconstant dollars, which is 56 percent higher than the projected unified \nbudget deficit for all of government.\n  If we adopt the Daschle-Dorgan constitutional amendment approach, the \nConstitution would allow these massive deficits in the unified budget \nto occur even as we would be telling the American people that our \nbudget is\n\n[[Page S5880]]\n\nbalanced in accord with the Constitution.\n  Let me repeat that: If you put something in the Constitution, I \nassume you would hope it would exist until 2020 or 2030. If you adopt \nthe Daschle-Dorgan approach, you will be building into the budget of \nthe United States by the year 2020 an opportunity for us to tell the \nAmerican people we are in balance, even though the Social Security \ntrust fund can be out of balance by hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  The truth of the matter is that not only would that kind of budget \nmake a mockery of the constitutional balanced budget requirement, it \nwould also be devastating to the American economy because--and I want \nto make this point--it is the unified budget deficit, regardless of \nwhat is said here on the floor, it is the unified budget and its \ndeficit, not the deficit excluding Social Security, which tells us how \nmuch Government must borrow from the public each year. That is what we \nwant to know: How much do we have to borrow. The unified budget tells \nus how much Government must borrow. It is this Government borrowing \nthat has real economic consequences for national savings, for \ninvestment, for inflation, for interest rates and for economic growth.\n  Now, to remove any remaining doubt that those who take the coverup of \nSocial Security as their defense against the balanced budget amendment, \nso that they would remove any doubt that they are more interested in \nkilling the balanced budget amendment than in protecting Social \nSecurity, I want to make it known that we were willing to compromise \nwith them to get an agreement. We suggested the idea of revising the \nbalanced budget amendment to require both a balanced unified budget in \n2002 and a balance excluding Social Security in 2006, which I believe \nanyone looking at the flow of expenditures and what is practical would \nsay that is probably where we ought to be.\n  We proposed an amendment to this proposal that would make it such, \n2002, balance under unified; 4 years later, balance excluding Social \nSecurity. There is nothing inconsistent with requiring both. In fact, \nyou get to balance excluding Social Security, you have to first balance \nthe unified budget--no way around it.\n\n  Moreover, I believe we need a permanent requirement regarding unified \nbudget balances to protect against a time when Social Security runs \nlarge deficits. Those who reject this offer are really, once again, \nshowing us they are not interested in getting an agreement on the \nbalanced budget. They are, instead, interested in defeating it.\n  Now, Mr. President, and fellow Senators, what we are talking about is \nthe following. It is the difference between economic prosperity and \nlong-term stagnation. As we look out there among our people, one of the \nthings they are most worried about is stagnation in their economic \ncondition, that wages are not going up as fast as they should, that the \ndream for their children might be less than theirs, which somehow stirs \na strong cord in the hearts and minds of Americans. If we do not build \ninto American policy constitutional fiscal restraint that leads to a \nbalanced budget, the difference is going to be simple. It is going to \nbe whether we have prosperity or whether we have stagnation. No doubt \nabout it.\n  Mr. President, to prove that for you, I want to cite a Congressional \nBudget Office report. According to the Congressional Budget Office, \ntheir so-called base scenario, here is what we can expect in 2030 if we \ndo nothing.\n  Debt held by the public will reach 180 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct. At the end of 1995, our debt stood at 50 percent. In 1945, at \nthe end of the war, it was 114 percent. The budget deficit will reach \n15 percent of gross domestic product. In 1995, it was 2.3 percent. Net \ninterest rate on the cumulative debt will cost 8 percent of the gross \ndomestic product. Net interest rates are only 3 percent now. Social \nSecurity, Medicare and Medicaid will cost 18 percent, all alone, of the \ngross domestic product. These programs cost 9 percent now.\n  It assumes these massive deficits will do no harm to our economy. \nThat is the rosy scenario. CBO states in its report: ``In the end, \nthese deficits will weaken the economy, end long-term upward trends in \nreal GDP per capita that we have enjoyed throughout our history. With \nFederal debt growing so rapidly, the economy will enter a period of \naccelerated decline.''\n  Mr. President, this is a real debate. This is about one of the most \nimportant issues for our future that will come before this body.\n  I went to some length to produce my argument today because I believe \nthose who claim Social Security is the issue and trust funds of Social \nSecurity are the issue are perpetrating a huge smokescreen, at best, \nand, at worst, a monstrous charade. There is no doubt in my mind the \nbest way to help Social Security now and in the future is to balance \nthe budget as prescribed in this constitutional amendment. Without it, \nthe very seniors they attempt to say they are for are put in very \nserious jeopardy, as are their children and grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator is 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me use the remaining time to say I have \nnever heard a more phony argument in my life than the argument that \nthey, the Democrats, are trying to protect Social Security, and yet \nevery time President Clinton's budget comes up here not protecting \nSocial Security the way they say they want to protect it, they vote for \nit. I am not willing to say people are hypocritical on this matter, but \nI am willing to say that it is a lousy argument. It is clearly an \nargument designed to give those who use it an excuse for them to vote \nagainst the balanced budget amendment. I have never heard a more \ndisappointing display than yesterday, as Senator after Senator came on \nthis floor and jumped all over Bob Dole, who has done his best to get a \nbalanced budget amendment through.\n  I think some of the most sordid politics I have seen in years \noccurred in some of the arguments yesterday. And the arguments are \nphony arguments. This is a very, very important opportunity for us to \ntry and get the Congress to be required to do what is right. This is \nthe only chance to get them to do that. I hope people will vote for \nthis amendment--if not today, count on it, it will be back next year.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might \nspeak for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, now maybe we can get to where the rubber \nhits the road. I have been given the grisly task of chairing the \nSubcommittee on Social Security and Medicare and Family Policy. I have \nheard the debate going on about the looting of the Social Security \ntrust fund. Mr. President--and I know they will rush onto the floor. \nThe doors will clatter open in a moment.\n  Let me tell you that there is no Social Security trust fund. It is a \nhuge stack of IOU's. The trustees know that, all thoughtful Americans \nknow that. It is listed in the trustees' report. It is a huge stack of \nIOU's. There is no place in there with your name on it or my name on \nit. When a young person pays in today, it goes out next month to the \nbeneficiary. In the year 2011, there will not be enough payroll tax to \ncover it. There will be a huge accumulated surplus then. And then you \ngo and take the IOU and say, ``I am cashing this in.'' That is the \ndouble hit that is coming.\n  I related this last week. We are all aware that the Social Security \nprogram and its relation to any balanced budget constitutional \namendment will always be an issue of fervent controversy. In fact, many \nindividuals, and the well-organized interests and, oh my, the citizens \nand, oh, my, the AARP--do not miss their work here--have cited the need \nto ``protect'' Social Security as a moral justification for opposing \nany such constitutional amendment. We have heard more of that on the \nSenate floor this week, and we will hear it forever.\n\n[[Page S5881]]\n\n  I trust that my colleagues will pardon me to say that I find this \ncompletely baffling--bizarre and baffling. I see no possible sensible \njustification for using Social Security as an excuse for opposition to \nthe balanced budget amendment--none. It is but an excuse which excites \nthe interest groups, which may be sold as a way to cover a vote against \na balanced budget amendment. ``CYA'' here does not mean corporate youth \nactivity. It is without substantive merit, in my view.\n\n  Let me explain fully that this is my duty as chairman of the Social \nSecurity Subcommittee to try to determine the facts. At least everybody \nis entitled to their own opinion, but no one is entitled to their own \nfacts. How is the Social Security trust fund managed? This is how it is \nrequired under the law to be managed. It is a rather unfortunate that \none would even have to do this, but too many in Congress, and out in \nthe land, do not seem to ``get it,'' I believe is the phrase they use \non us around here.\n  This is an enlargement of an excerpt from section 201(d) of the \nSocial Security Act. Allow me to read from it to you:\n\n       It shall be the duty of the managing trustee to invest such \n     portion of the trust funds as is not, in his judgment, \n     required to meet current withdrawals. Such investments may be \n     made only in interest-bearing obligations of the United \n     States, or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and \n     interest by the United States.\n\n  This section continues later:\n\n       Each obligation issued for purchase by the trust funds \n     under this subsection shall be evidenced by a paper \n     instrument in the form of a bond, note, or certificate of \n     indebtedness issued by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n  We can and we still do call these things T-bills, savings bonds, \nwhatever. But it refers to any such Treasury bond or certificate.\n  Before I continue, allow me to translate this bit of mumbo jumbo. \nWhat this means is what the law requires. It is what the law demands--\nthat when the Social Security payroll taxes come rolling in, most of \nthem are immediately used to pay the benefits to today's recipients. \nThe leftovers are not put in some vault or box, where we keep them, \nsave them, and hold them for tomorrow's retirees. They are used to buy \nGovernment notes now. That is the law, that has always been the \nstructure of Social Security. It is what is required of us. It is not \n``raiding'' anything. It is not ``breaking a promise'' to anyone. That \nis how Social Security currently works, and it is how it was intended \nto work. That is what I mean when I say that the fund holds ``floating \nIOU's.'' It is holding those notes from the U.S. Government, and those \nnotes are promises to pay up at a future date.\n\n  Let me take you to section (f) the Social Security Act. Do not miss \nthis one. This is the section that explains how the future benefits are \ngoing to be paid:\n\n       The interest on and the proceeds from the sale or \n     redemption of any obligations held in the Federal Old-Age and \n     Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability \n     Insurance Trust Fund shall be credited to and form a part of \n     the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and \n     the Disability Insurance Trust Fund respectively.\n\n  Listen closely to this part:\n\n       Payment from the general fund of the Treasury--\n\n  Are you listening?\n\n     to either of the trust funds of any such interest or proceeds \n     shall be in the form of paper checks drawn on such general \n     fund to the order of such trust fund.\n\n  Here we see the obvious. The payment back to Social Security at a \nfuture date will come from general revenue--taxpayers' money. Only from \nthe general fund will it come.\n  The general Government, until the appropriate time, thus holds this \nbig bag of IOU's to Social Security, and then it has to make good on \nthose from the general revenues, not from some separate trust fund. It \ncomes out of general revenue when the IOU's are due. That is how it \nworks, and that is how it was intended to work. There is no way around \nit, no tricks, no gimmicks, no big lump of money in a trunk sitting \nthere that we can emotionally plead to save from raiding if we exclude \nSocial Security from a balanced budget amendment. Those benefits are to \nbe paid with moneys raised from the general revenues--period.\n  Another way of putting it, if I may, is today's workers will support \ntoday's retirees and tomorrow's workers will support tomorrow's \nretirees, period. That is the law. This is how Social Security works. \nAll of this posturing and fear mongering about how somehow a contract \nis being broken and that looting and pillaging, and God knows what \nelse, and other sins are taking place, is so much guff and nonsense. It \nis so much like the old professor of mine. He said, ``Simpson, this is \nopium smoke.'' That old professor was right. The benefits of future \nbeneficiaries were never available to be looted. They are IOU's, and \nall of the cash will be raised from general revenue when those bonds \nbecame due.\n  Let me just show you one final chart. I want you to pay, please, \nstrict attention to this one. These are the annual operating balances \nprojected for Social Security as of last year. You can see that, \nindeed, there is a sizable surplus today, and some are using this as an \nexcuse to oppose the balanced budget amendment. This $60 billion figure \nappears small because--I ask unanimous consent for an additional 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. They are using it as an excuse to oppose the balanced \nbudget amendment. This $60 billion figure appears small because it is \nan annual figure, a consolidated figure which also includes the \ndisability payments and does not represent the total size of the \naccumulated Social Security reserves which are supposed to add up to \nanother $2 trillion. They will get to $2 trillion--everybody needs to \nknow that; we all know that--before the big drawdown, the big meltdown, \ncomes.\n  But you know what we always hear about this surplus. ``We don't want \nthis surplus to be counted toward balancing the budget.'' It is said \nplainly, passionately, and persuasively.\n  I ask you to look at the much larger picture. By the year 2020 we are \nalso facing huge annual operating deficits, meaning that we would have \nto dip into the principal and the interest in this trust fund, the IOU \nstack, which I have already shown you is not there and eventually will \nonly come from general revenues at that time.\n  Look at the size, look at the enormity of these promised obligations, \nall of which we have no possible way of paying unless we raise payroll \ntaxes, and the seniors are telling you to do that to correct the \nprogram because they ``ain't paying'' them. Payroll taxes--that is how \nyou get here, and other taxes, to raise them dramatically when the time \ncomes. There is $7 trillion in unfunded liability in the Social \nSecurity system alone.\n  Does anyone seriously believe that the way to ``protect'' Social \nSecurity is to save it from a balanced budget amendment? Can anyone \nseriously maintain that the fate of Social Security hangs on the \nbudgetary treatment of funds in 1996 when these are the balances \nprojected in the outyears? We all know this. That is no secret to \nanyone. To use Social Security as a pallid excuse to defeat a balanced \nbudget amendment is absurd, hypocritical budget blather of the most \nodious kind. We all know what the real threat to Social Security is. It \nis the situation you see on this chart. It is the threat that we will \ndo nothing. That is the threat. That is the threat--the threat that we \nwill let it go bankrupt on its own. But that is a debate for another \nday. I will not be around when the big bill comes due. But I hope in \nthe year 2030, they will tap on my box and tell me how it all went \nbecause I can tell you where it is going to go.\n\n  My purpose today is to, hopefully, dispense with the idea that there \nis some promise that has been made to save the Social Security surplus \nin some way that we are currently violating. No. We are doing with \nSocial Security precisely what the law demands and commands us to do--\nto buy T bills. If we can be charged with failing to do anything, it is \nfailing to balance the budget. That is what will make it harder to make \ngood on those IOU's when they come due. It will be very hard to raise \nthe general revenue to do that. So as long as we keep blithely adding \ntrillions to the debt--I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, let me close by saying I agree with my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, that the assured \nbest way to protect Social Security is to pass the\n\n[[Page S5882]]\n\nbalanced budget amendment, or if you do not like the balanced budget \namendment, to force ourselves to balance the budget. That is the one \nthing and the only thing that will make it possible to pay off those \nsacred promises to future retirees. I do not see people who like to \ncast those tough votes. They do not show up.\n  But in any event, let me say again that I find it very unseemly that \nanyone who refuses to help in that effort will use the looting of \nSocial Security as an excuse not to impose a balanced budget \nrequirement. I hope that all of you will read the Social Security Act \nfor yourself and the sections of it--section 201--and think it over \nclosely, and then read the trustees' report. If we have a more accurate \npublic understanding of exactly how Social Security does, indeed, work, \nit is my earnest, and yet possibly most naive, belief that the argument \nover the balanced budget amendment can take place on a more honest and \ninformed basis.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Here we are again. One more time, we find ourselves about to cast \nreally a historic vote. In March 1995 the Senate failed by one vote to \npass this measure, a measure that has been demanded by the American \npeople, this measure that is absolutely necessary if we are going to \nrescue America from bankruptcy of our children's or our grandchildren's \ngeneration.\n  It has been pointed out on this floor that the Federal debt is \nalready more than $5 trillion, the figure that is hard to even \ncomprehend. Next year Americans will pay about $240 billion just to \nmeet the interest payment on that debt. That is almost $1,000 for every \nman, woman, and child in this great country. You know, it is really \nmoney for nothing. That money is not just to educate our children or \nfight the drug problem or find a cure for cancer. It is simply a \ntransfer payment from the future to the past. We need to reduce those \ninterest payments. We need to start investing in the future instead of \nthe past. But until the annual budget is in fact balanced, all we are \ndoing every day, every month, and every year is adding to the problem. \nCongresses of both parties, Presidents of both parties, all have \ncompiled a spectacular record of failure in dealing with this \nfundamental issue.\n\n  That is why I believe it is time to make a fundamental change in the \nway we deal with it. I am not one who thinks we should tamper with the \nConstitution. I do not like to amend the Constitution. But I believe in \nthe age-old principle, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' I think it \nis broke this time. I think we have a problem, and we have to have a \nfundamental fix. We have to change the way we do things.\n  Mr. President, there are 5 trillion reasons convincing me that in \nthis case our system is broken and it is time to fix it. The people of \nthis country demand change. People of my home State of Ohio demand \nchange.\n  As I was thinking about this issue, I was reminded of the crusade \nthat a former Member of this body who represented the State of Ohio for \nmany, many years had to say about this. Frank Lausche was and remains a \nlegend in Ohio politics and Ohio government. He served many terms as \nGovernor of the State of Ohio and several terms as U.S. Senator. From \nthe time he was Governor, throughout his career here in the Senate, one \ntheme kept recurring, and that theme was fiscal responsibility. I \nremember, Mr. President, as a young boy hearing grown-ups talk about \nwhat Frank Lausche was doing as Governor. There was a little debate \ngoing on. One of them said, ``It is terrible. They are running a \nsurplus. The Governor is running a surplus this year. He should be \ndistributing that money. We have some projects and things that we need \nto have done.'' That was the kind of person Frank Lausche was. He was a \nperson who believed in fiscal responsibility.\n  Let me cite what Senator Lausche said in 1962 on this floor. In 1962, \nFrank Lausche rose in this Chamber, and this is what he told his \ncolleagues. Remember, this is 1962.\n\n       The sheer size of the extravagant Federal budget has made \n     it impossible in the Chamber of the Senate to guard \n     adequately against extravagant spending. The present debt is \n     too high relative to our general assets. Instead of reducing \n     the debt since World War II, we have raised it from $255 \n     billion to a presently proposed $308 billion. The unabated \n     increase in the national debt is a threat and danger to our \n     security and to our freedom.\n\n  That was Frank Lausche, U.S. Senator from Ohio, in 1962. Mr. \nPresident, the $308 billion that Senator Lausche was talking about was \nnot the interest on the national debt; it was the total national debt \nin 1962. The distinguished Senator from Ohio, Senator Frank Lausche, \nwas right. Unless we make fundamental changes, the problem is only \ngoing to get worse and worse and worse. It is time, long past time that \nwe do something about it. And today is our opportunity to cast a vote \nthat will change the direction of this country and to cast a vote that \nreally will make a difference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, Mr. President, here we are engaging in the same old \npolitical flimflam, talking about a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget while at the same time talking about giving away a big tax \ncut. That is flimflam, pure and simple. It is the very same \nconstitutional amendment that we defeated last year in the month of \nMarch. It was a bad idea then and, unlike a fine wine or an old violin, \nit has gotten no better with age.\n  The advocates of the balanced budget amendment are known to assert \nthat amending the Constitution--here it is, the Constitution of the \nUnited States, right here. I carry it in my shirt pocket. I do not wear \nmy shirt when I am sleeping so I do not have the Constitution that \nclose to me when I am sleeping, but I carry it with me during each day. \nSo they are known to assert that amending the Constitution is the only \nway, the only way, that we can eradicate the recurring budget deficits \nthat have plagued our great Nation for a long time. We in the Congress, \nthey say, lack the fiscal discipline and the moral backbone needed to \nmake the painful and difficult policy choices that will actually bring \nthe budget into balance.\n  What the proponents of this fiscal monstrosity fail to acknowledge is \nthat the amendment itself will make none of these difficult choices. \nThe difficult choices will remain to be made here. There is nothing in \nthis constitutional amendment that tells us how we are supposed to \nbalance the budget. There never has been. On the contrary, we in the \nCongress will still have to make and legislate choices regarding what \nprograms will be cut and which taxes will be raised as a way of \nbringing about a balanced budget.\n  Amazingly, many proponents of the balanced budget amendment continue \nto asseverate their commitment to eliminate the Federal budget deficit \nout of one side of their mouth while supporting substantial tax cuts \nout of the other side. Certainly that remarkable oral dexterity calls \ninto question the real possibility of actually achieving budget \nbalance.\n  Just last year, as I hope we will all remember, the majority in this \nbody voted for a budget resolution that called for approximately $250 \nbillion in tax cuts over a 7-year period. That is money that we will \nhave to borrow. We will have to borrow that money to finance that tax \ncut. And it will be money borrowed at interest.\n\n  We continue to talk about children and grandchildren and how they \nwill bear the burden of our continuing fiscal unwisdom if we do not \nbalance this budget. We voted for a huge tax cut. We have to borrow the \nmoney at interest to finance that tax cut. And who will pay that \ninterest? On whom will that burden be laid? On our children.\n  In hindsight, that figure of $250 billion seemed almost reasonable \nwhen compared to the more than $350 billion in tax cuts approved by the \nother body last year under the aegis of the so-called Contract With \nAmerica--the so-called Contract With America.\n  You do not hear much about that so-called Contract With America these\n\n[[Page S5883]]\n\ndays. The glitter has worn off, and I said on this very floor that the \nworm will turn. The worm will turn. And it did. It has turned.\n  You do not hear much about the so-called Contract With America. Why? \nBecause that so-called Contract With America was not a contract with \nAmerica. This is the real contract with America, the Constitution of \nthe United States--over 200 years old. That is the contract with \nAmerica. That is the contract to which I have sworn an oath to support \nand defend. Many times I have sworn that. That is the real contract. \nAnd here today we are saying, amend it, amend this contract.\n  Simply put, combining huge tax cuts in a deficit reduction package \nwhile at the same time proclaiming the invincibility of the balanced \nbudget amendment is entirely and completely inconsistent. How can \nanyone seriously and with a straight face suggest that the best way to \ndig ourselves out of a massive fiscal hole is to start by digging the \nhole a little deeper? Where is the logic in that? It defies simple \ncommon sense. And yet here we are, after a year of stalemate between \nthe Congress and the President, and once again the majority has \napproved another budget resolution that includes large tax cuts for the \nwealthy. On the surface, the $122 billion in proposed revenue \nreductions may appear modest. In reality, though, a closer reading of \nthe budget resolution reveals that the actual tax cuts may be far \ngreater than $122 billion and could go as high as $180 billion or more. \nSo, Mr. President, we will soon be considering, under fast-track \nreconciliation procedures, Republican tax cuts in the range of $200 \nbillion. Can you believe that? These same Republicans who are \nconstantly touting their courage and their prowess in making the hard \ndecisions to cut the deficit and balance the budget have chosen to use \nthe reconciliation process to enact freestanding tax cuts totaling $200 \nbillion. I have been in politics 50 years. It is easy to vote for a tax \ncut. That is no sweat for anybody. That is the easiest thing, coming or \ngoing. Vote for a tax cut. So they are at it again. And they are doing \nso at the very same time they are trumpeting the merits of a balanced \nbudget amendment. One has to have a nimble mind indeed to perform the \nintellectual gymnastics it takes to reconcile the two positions.\n\n  And now we have presidential politics coming to the fore in a big \nway. The Washington Post reports that sweeping tax cut proposals are \nunder consideration by the Republicans, and one proposal would allow \nworkers to deduct their payroll taxes from their income tax returns. \nThe cost of that proposal to the Treasury over the next 7 years would \nbe a whopping $350 billion. In addition, the Post reports that a 15 \npercent reduction in Federal income tax rates is also being considered. \nThat particular proposal would result in lost revenues to the Treasury \nover the next 7 years of $630 billion.\n  Nor is President Clinton without fault when it comes to proposing tax \ncuts at the same time we are attempting to balance the Federal budget.\n  I voted against the President's budget. I am the only Democrat who \ndid so. And I did so because he was cutting discretionary spending, the \ndiscretionary funding of programs that are so important to the well-\nbeing of our fellow Americans, and because he was advocating a tax cut \nalso.\n  In addition to the President's proposed tax cuts in his 7-year \nbalanced budget plan, as late as Tuesday of this week, in what was \nbilled as a major speech at Princeton University, the President \nunveiled additional tax cuts, so we are going to have more in this \nbidding battle between the Republicans and the Democrats. So he \nproposed additional tax cut measures that would allow tax credits of \n$1,500 to college freshmen and sophomores at a cost of many billions of \ndollars.\n  Not every high school graduate should go to college. I have seen \nstudents in college who had no business being there.\n  How can these frantic revenue reduction efforts by both political \nparties be squared with the florid rhetorical fulminations we \nconstantly hear about the critical necessity for balancing the budget?\n  As I have said many times on this floor, this amendment is nothing \nless than sheer folly, folly, just as the propositions for tax cuts at \nthe present time are sheer folly. It is like getting on two horses and \nstarting off in two different directions at once.\n  This amendment is a sham. It is a charade. And it will not help to \nbalance the budget one whit. As these tax cut proposals show, this \namendment is simply being used as convenient cover for politically \ninspired massive tax giveaways, which will be paid for by our children \nand our grandchildren. The interest on those tax giveaways will be paid \nfor by your children and mine, and your grandchildren and mine.\n\n  To make matters even more unbelievable, just this week, even under \nthe shadow of the balanced budget amendment we saw an attempt to spend \n$60 billion on a missile defense system that the Pentagon does not want \nand that this Nation does not need if we are serious about balancing \nthe budget. I hope all Senators will think very hard about the message \nwe are sending to the American people with these impossibly \ncontradictory actions on the Senate floor. They do not make sense \neconomically, and, unfortunately, when you think about them carefully, \nthey do not even make sense politically. Tax cuts, while always \npopular, become addictive in election years. But I nevertheless believe \nthe American people will clearly understand that these tax cuts \nrepresent nothing more than political pandering--political pandering to \nwin votes at the expense of serious deficit reduction. The American \npeople can see through political pandering. They do not like pandering. \nThey do not like to be pandered to. But it is easy to see through it, \nis it not?\n  To have the same proponents of the balanced budget amendment preach \nthe gospel of tax cuts while we are trying to balance the budget is \nentirely inconsistent with common sense. It reminds me of an Elmer \nGantry revival meeting: Come on in, politicians. Come on in. Walk the \nsawdust trail. Get baptized with the holy water of the balanced budget \namendment. Hallelujah. Come get it and then go on about your business, \nand sin, sin, sin.\n  We do not need a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. We \ndo, however, need discipline and self-restraint. We must not repeat the \nexperience of the 1980's where massive tax cuts were matched by the \ndoubling of a peacetime defense budget from 1981 to 1991.\n  I have come to the mourners' bench many times. I have confessed my \nmistake in voting for both. So I did not come in with clean hands. I \nvoted for that tax cut, the Reagan tax cut. And I voted to increase \nthose deficit budgets. But at least I came to the mourners' bench and \nhave confessed my waywardness in going astray.\n  That is not what the American people want. No one is clamoring for a \nreturn to the fiscal calamities of the last decade. No one, it seems, \nbut those who are bent on irresponsibly trying to claim that a balanced \nbudget, reductions in revenue, and large increases in defense spending \nare all goals which can be achieved.\n  On the contrary, achieving budget balance will take a combination of \nspending cuts in all areas of the budget and some tax increases, \ninstead of tax cuts.\n  If we are really conscientious and sincere, if we really mean that we \ndo not want to foist this great deficit burden upon our children, if we \nreally mean that, if we really love our children that much, then we \nhave to put aside this folly, utter folly, regarding a tax cut at this \ntime. There are times when tax cuts are advisable, but not now.\n  So that is the reality of it. We prefer to pander, pander to the \nAmerican people. And if there is anything that makes me sick as a \npolitician it is a politician who panders. To propose to amend the \nConstitution when we are so obviously unwilling to make those hard \nchoices is to promote a vain hope and to perpetrate a falsehood on the \nAmerican people, on those people who are looking through that \nelectronic eye. This balanced budget amendment should be again \ndefeated. It is little more than a political mirage in a vast, dry \ndesert of empty election-year promises.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5884]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWINE). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself the time that is available \nunder the time originally allocated to Senator Byrd. I understand that \nis another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator has \ncontrol until 11:10.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I heard a generous discussion this morning \non the floor of the Senate by the Senator from New Mexico, the Senator \nfrom Utah, and the Senator from Wyoming. I felt it necessary for a few \nminutes to at least respond to some of those comments. I have great \nrespect for all of those Senators. But I respectfully believe that they \nare wrong on the issue of Social Security and its relationship to the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I observe again the history so that people understand where we are. \nThese facts I expect are not in dispute. In 1983 it was determined that \nSocial Security was going to be in some longer-term difficulty and a \nSocial Security reform package was enacted by the Congress. I was a \npart of that because I was a part of the Ways and Means Committee in \nthe U.S. House that actually originated the legislation.\n  In that legislation we determined to do something very responsible. \nWe determined to trim back some benefits in Social Security, extend the \nage for Social Security recipients from 65 to 67 over a long period of \ntime and raise some payroll taxes, all of that in order to create a \nyearly surplus in the Social Security trust funds to save it for the \nlong term.\n  This year $69 billion more is being collected in the Social Security \ntrust fund than is needed this year for Social Security. Why is that \nthe case? Is that an accident? No. As I said yesterday, we recognized \nthat the war babies were going to retire after the turn of the century. \nAmerica's largest baby crop would hit the retirement rolls. That is \ngoing to cause maximum strain on the Social Security system.\n  I said yesterday, partially tongue in cheek, that the war babies \nresulted from an outpouring of love and affection in this country, \nimmediately following the Second World War, and people getting back \ntogether and reacquainted, and the largest production of babies in the \nrecorded history of this country.\n  After the turn of the century--2005, 2010, 2015--those babies will \nbecome eligible to hit the retirement rolls. At that point we needed to \nhave some planning in the Social Security system for funds to be \navailable to meet those needs.\n  This year $69 billion in excess money is being raised in the Social \nSecurity system. It is not an accident. It is a deliberate, forced \nnational savings to be available to meet the needs after the turn of \nthe century.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle say, ``Well, that is not \nspecial money. That's just regular money. We put it right into the old \noperating budget of the Federal Government and count it as other \nrevenues.'' In fact, they count it as other revenues such so in the \nyear 2002, when they say their budget is in balance, if you took the \nSocial Security money out of their budget, it would be $108 billion in \ndeficit. But they say it does not matter. It is all the same money.\n  It is not the same money. Someone working this morning has a tax \ntaken out of their paycheck, and they are told by this Government that \nis a Social Security FICA tax that is going to be put into a trust fund \nand can only be used for one purpose--not for offsetting against \nbuilding star wars, not as an offset against cutting taxes for the \nwealthy--it can be used only to put in a trust fund to be used for the \nSocial Security needs of the future.\n  But that is not what the majority party wants to do. They want to \ntake that enormous amount of money, raised by a aggressive payroll tax, \nand slide it over here into the operating budget of the Federal \nGovernment and say, ``By the way, now we've got more revenue over here \nso we can build the star wars project for $60 billion. We can have big \ntax cuts. We can do all of these things that we want to do even as we \nclaim to want to balance the budget.''\n  I do not allege that they are not operating in good faith. I only say \nthat they are wrong on the issue of Social Security.\n  One person who spoke this morning said there is no trust fund. One \nwho spoke this morning said there was a trust fund, and we are not \nmisusing it. Another said there is a trust fund, and we are misusing \nit, and we promise to stop by the year 2008. The three stages of Social \nSecurity denial.\n  If we are willing to do what is necessary, what we promised workers \nand retirees we would do in 1983, we will set aside the Social Security \nrevenues in a trust fund, not count them as part of the operating \nrevenue, balance the budget honestly, and move on.\n  That is our job. That is our task. We will offer a unanimous consent \nrequest on the floor of the Senate to allow a constitutional amendment \nto be offered which I voted for previously that is identical in every \nrespect to the one offered by the majority party with one exception. \nThat is, section 7, which will describe that the Social Security \nsurplus funds shall not be counted as part of operating revenues.\n  If they agree to that, they will get 75 votes for their \nconstitutional amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is the only balanced budget amendment \nthat has ever passed the House of Representatives. It is the only one \nthat has a chance of passing both Houses. All of the unanimous consent \nrequests in the world are not going to bring up an amendment that will \nbe acceptable to both Houses, except this amendment. Everybody knows \nthat. For these people to bring up another amendment at this late date \nis just a subterfuge.\n  There have been six Democrats who before have always voted for the \nbalanced budget amendment but have been using the Social Security \npretext as a charade to cover their backs. Last year, every one voted \nfor Clinton's 1997 budget that does not protect Social Security in the \nway they want it protected. I do not think they argued with the \nPresident to get that in there. The fact is, it is a charade. I hope \neverybody knows it.\n  Not only did the Clinton budget of 1997 not balance in the year 2002, \nunder CBO's more cautious economic and technical assumptions. Without \nSocial Security receipts and assets and deficit calculations, it would \nhave been $184.5 billion out of balance in the year 2002. It is just \nphony. Without Social Security's receipts and assets in deficit \ncalculations, the Clinton budgets would never balance. The fact is the \nRepublican budget would be balanced by the year 2005 without Social \nSecurity.\n  These people argue that they want to protect Social Security, yet \nthey make the situation worse for Social Security by not voting for the \nbalanced budget amendment that would protect it. We keep the status quo \nof setting up budgets that do not protect Social Security like they \nwant to protect. How phony can you get?\n  As a matter of fact, let me quote Washington columnist Charles \nKrauthammer, who has exposed twice the Clinton position, the \nadministration's unconscionable human-shield strategy that they are \nprotecting Social Security. In a column entitled, ``Social Security \nTrust Fund Whopper,'' he writes:\n\n       In my 17 years in Washington, this is the single most \n     fraudulent argument I have heard. I don't mean politically \n     fraudulent, which is routine in Washington and a judgment \n     call anyway. I mean logically, demonstrably, mathematically \n     fraudulent, a condition rare even in Washington, and a \n     judgment call not at all.\n\n  Now, when the two Senators from North Dakota replied in print to his \nchart, Krauthammer went further and said this:\n\n       Their response is even more fraudulent than their original \n     argument. Conrad-Dorgan profess indignation with this \n     'pundit' who 'condones the use of the Social Security \n     surpluses' for 'masking the size of the budget deficit.' \n     Well, well. Where is their indignation with a President who \n     does not just condone this practice but has carried it out \n     three years in row? By their own logic, the President, who is \n     of their own party, has looted the Social Security trust fund \n     by $47 billion in 1993, another $56 billion in 1994, and \n     plans to loot another $60 billion in 1995. Makes you wonder \n     about the sincerity of their charge.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I had time, I would yield. Ordinarily, I would.\n\n\n[[Page S5885]]\n\n\n       Conrad-Dorgan's Social Security argument, writes Time \n     magazine, is, to put it politely, ``mendacious nonsense.''\n\n  Now, that is Charles Krauthammer, who generally writes it the way he \nsees it. I have to say I see it that way, too. I really believe that \nthose who claim they are arguing to protect Social Security are not \nprotecting it at all.\n  This is the only balanced budget amendment that could pass. Being the \nonly one that can pass, the fact of the matter is there is going to be \nno protection when it is voted down today, and this President is going \nto continue to put up budgets that literally do not protect it, either. \nTo use the term of my distinguished friends from North Dakota, ``will \ncontinue to loot Social Security.'' Yet, they voted for those budgets.\n  To me, there is something inconsistent here. The only chance in the \nworld, the only chance in the history of this country to have an \namendment that will put some fiscal discipline into the Constitution, \nand they are voting against it under the guise they are protecting \nSocial Security, when, in fact, they make Social Security worse because \nthey put off further doing anything about it. To me, that is absolutely \namazing.\n  Mr. President, I yield a minute and a half to the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment Senator Hatch from \nUtah for his leadership, as well as Senator Craig from Idaho for his \nleadership, as well as Senator Simon, and most of all, Senator Dole, \nfor his leadership, because they strongly support passing a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, as the American people \ndo.\n  Mr. President, I heard my distinguished colleague from West Virginia \npull out the Constitution. I know he has great respect for the \nConstitution, as I do. A statement Thomas Jefferson made in 1798 I will \nquote:\n\n       I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our \n     Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for \n     reduction of the administration of our government to the \n     genuine principles of its Constitution. I mean an additional \n     article taking from the Federal Government the power of \n     borrowing.\n\n  Thomas Jefferson was right. He was right in 1789. It is the right \nthing to do today.\n  Also, Mr. President, I will read a letter from the Governor of \nOklahoma, addressed to the President of the United States.\n\n       Dear Mr. President: On Friday, May 31, at 4:59 p.m., the \n     Legislature of the State of Oklahoma adjourned its 1996 \n     session. Not once during that four-month session was there a \n     moment of discussion about deficit spending. Not one penny \n     was appropriated to pay interest on a state debt. No bill was \n     passed that spent a cent in excess of actual state revenues--\n     all because the Constitution of Oklahoma contains an \n     amendment that requires a balanced budget.\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution will be considered in the Senate this week. I \n     urge you to follow the examples of 49 of our 50 states--\n     including Oklahoma and Arkansas--and support this effort to \n     import common sense from the states to Washington.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Frank Keating.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we need to pass this amendment today. The \nHouse has passed it. The Senate came within one vote last year. We need \nto pass it this year. We need to pass it today and send it to the \nStates for ratification.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 1 minute and 19 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to the distinguished Senator from North Carolina \nand then the balance of the time to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I repeat what has been heard many times here today. I \nbelieve this is the most important vote we are going to cast this \nentire year in Congress. I strongly support the constitutional \namendment to a balanced budget. We need it to save the country.\n  Mr. President, $5 trillion of debt is too much.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the balanced budget \namendment. Last March, as we debated this amendment, I noted the great \nimportance of this issue.\n  I believe that this is more true today than it was last year.\n  Government spending has put the American people $5.1 trillion into \ndebt. In this Chamber, we often speak about the national debt as the \nFederal Government debt, but, of course, this debt will be paid by the \nAmerican people.\n  The American people--not the Federal Government--will work to pay the \ntaxes that go toward these Treasury bonds. The American people--not the \nFederal Government--will manufacture products, raise crops, program \ncomputers, and do the millions of jobs that generate growth in our \neconomy. So, although we are entrusted to spend the money that the \nAmerican people work to earn, we continue to struggle to balance the \nFederal budget.\n  This Congress passed a balanced budget--the first legitimate balanced \nbudget plan in a generation--but the President vetoed it.\n  This Congress made the tough choices, but the President exploited our \ngood work for political advantage, and he demagoged the issues. \nUnfortunately, without the Amendment as an enforcement mechanism, I do \nnot believe that a balanced budget will be passed and signed into law. \nIt stops the posturing and the revolving votes and the other games that \nwill bankrupt the next generations.\n  I am not eager to amend the Constitution. We have done so just 27 \ntimes in over two centuries. It is a serious matter. Senators are right \nto take pause before casting a vote to amend our Constitution. \nUnfortunately, however, I have concluded that this amendment is \nnecessary. The national debt is just too large.\n  In the 1820's, President Andrew Jackson, a North Carolinian by birth, \ncalled the national debt ``a curse to the republic'' and ``incompatible \nwith real independence.'' In the early 19th century, however, the \nFederal Government was disciplined and successfully paid off the \nnational debt.\n  That is no longer true today.\n  The specter of a $5.1 trillion national debt is apparently \ninsufficient to force this Government to bring the budget into balance. \nInterest on the national debt, which we continue to wrack up, is the \nthird largest component of the Federal budget. The average taxpayer \nwill send $882 to the IRS in 1996 just to pay the interest on the \nnational debt. Interest alone will consume 41 percent of the income \ntaxes that the American people send to the Treasury.\n  If these facts do not shock us into support for a balanced budget--\nnot rhetoric, Mr. President, but votes for a balanced budget--then we \nare forced to amend the Constitution. We owe it to the next generation.\n  The average child born today faces a lifetime tax burden of $187,000 \njust to pay the interest on the national debt. In effect, we hand a \n$187,000 bill to every newborn American along with his birth \ncertificate. We do this because the President vetoed the first balanced \nbudget in a some 20 years.\n  In this Chamber, we often speak about obligations to future \ngenerations, but we are imposing trillions of dollars of debt upon our \nchildren and grandchildren. How many of us look forward to explaining \nthis to them?\n  How can we explain this to them? What will we say? Can we really tell \nthem that it is fair to welcome them to the world with a $187,000 bill? \nAll because we do not want to offend the groups that line up for a \npiece of the Federal pie.\n  President Clinton talks about deep cuts and draconian cuts. What cuts \nwill our children make in their family budgets to pay off this $187,000 \nbill? All because the President will lose a campaign issue if we slow \nthe rate of increase in Federal spending. Is that really too much to \nask?\n  There are claims on the other side of the aisle of support for a \nbalanced budget. However, the first balanced budget in a generation \npassed in this Chamber on November 18, 1995, with no Democrat votes, \nand it was vetoed by a Democrat President.\n  The Constitution, as we all know, was amended to permit the \nimposition of an income tax. I hope that few Senators consider the 16th \nAmendment amongst the more high-minded provisions of the Constitution. \nMr. President, if we can amend the Constitution to increase taxes on \nthe American people, I hope that we can amend it to ensure that their \ngovernment spends their hard-earned money responsibly.\n  Thomas Jefferson first read the Constitution upon his return from \nFrance\n\n[[Page S5886]]\n\nand recommended that the Constitution include limitations upon the \npowers of the Federal Government to borrow. Mr. President, if we do not \nimpose a restraint on the power of this government to borrow, we will \nnot balance the budget and ensure that it remains balanced.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and senior Senator from Utah for the tremendous \nleadership he has played in this critical issue of a constitutional \namendment requiring a balanced budget.\n  The record must show, Mr. President, and it must show it clearly, if \nSocial Security is to remain solvent into the next decade and into the \nnext century, the budget of the Federal Government must be balanced. \nThe only security for Social Security is a Government that lives within \nits financial means. If our Federal Government goes bankrupt or if we \ndemand of our citizens that they pay an 85 to 90 percent tax on their \nincome, then Social Security and every other security program for \npeople in our country is in jeopardy.\n  I am sorry the other side of the aisle does not get it, and they do \nnot get it. We have heard one phony argument after another, that \nsomehow balancing a Federal budget in one way or another damages Social \nSecurity. Yet, the very Social Security actuarials, the people who \nwatch the programs, say if you want to save Social Security you balance \nthe Federal budget.\n  Today, we have that opportunity as a U.S. Senate to secure for the \nfuture Social Security by allowing the American people--let me repeat, \nby allowing the American people--the right and the opportunity to vote \non whether they want this Government to balance its budget by passing a \nbalanced budget amendment to our Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the motion to reconsider House \nJoint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n\n\n                Lessons of History versus Blamesmanship\n\n  If the debate this week has shown anything, it is this: the case for \nthe balanced budget amendment is compelling; there is not one good \nargument against it.\n  The worst thing you can say about the amendment is that maybe \nCongresses and Presidents will have the courage to do the right thing \nwithout it.\n  In reality, if the Constitution doesn't require balancing the budget, \nit just won't happen.\n  We've heard a lot of blamesmanship on this floor, disguised as \nhistory lessons.\n  Democrats blame the past debt on Reaganomics. Republicans blame 40 \nyears of free-spending by Democrat Congresses.\n  But this debate isn't about the past. We can't change the past. This \ndebate is about our future.\n  Our economic house is on fire. Instead of arguing over who has the \nmatches in his pocket, let's put out the fire.\n\n\n              The Outlook is Grim--But There's Time to Act\n\n  The greatest threat facing our country is the mounting national debt \nthat drags on our economy and threatens to destroy the American Dream \nfor our children.\n  A new study by the Congressional Budget Office says that, if we do \nnothing:\n\n       In less than two generations, the Federal debt and interest \n     payments on that debt will consume, not the entire Federal \n     budget, but the entire American economy.\n\n  Their words, not mine: The numbers are ``not computable,'' meaning \nthe ``debt would exceed levels that the economy could reasonably \nsupport.''\n  This is not a temporary problem, it is a Constitution-class crisis.\n  This is what the Constitution is all about: protecting the liberties \nof the people by putting limits on a power that the Government is too \ntempted to abuse.\n  The good news is that we still have time to act. That opportunity \nwill not last forever. But if we act now, we can: create 6 million more \njobs by the year 2002; make homes, education, and family necessities \nmore affordable; provide greater security for our senior citizens; and \nraise our children's standard of living by a third.\n  The debt is the threat. The balanced budget amendment is the answer.\n\n\n                            Social Security\n\n  I understand Senator Wyden will try to offer an alternative amendment \nlater today which would exempt Social Security.\n  Several Senators are simply hiding behind this red herring. Former \nSenator Paul Tsongas, a Democrat, has said:\n\n       It is embarrassing to be a Democrat and watch a Democratic \n     President raise the scare tactics of Social Security.\n       Those who vote to exclude Social Security are voting to \n     kill the Balanced Budget Amendment. It is that simple, it is \n     that clean, and should be stated.\n\n  Under every alternative proposed by Senators Wyden, Hollings, \nFeinstein, Reid, Dorgan, or Daschle, the Federal Treasury would \ncontinue to borrow the Social Security surplus. Why don't they tell us \nthis?\n  Ask them. Ask them, Where will Social Security surpluses be invested \nunder their plan?\n  Answer: They change the bookkeeping, not the borrowing.\n  The difference is, their alternative is more loophole than law; their \nalternative would allow unlimited deficit spending, as long as you call \nit Social Security.\n  That would mean more borrowing, more debt, and a bankrupt Social \nSecurity system.\n  Senior citizens understand the debt is the threat to Social Security. \nA bankrupt Federal Government will not be able to send out Social \nSecurity checks.\n\n\n                  The President and the Flip-Floppers\n\n  Last year, President Clinton twisted arms; he made phone calls; he \nsent cabinet secretaries to Capitol Hill; and he got six Senators to \nvote against their previous positions, their consciences, and their \nconstituents.\n  Before then, this issue had always been bipartisan and should have \nstayed that way.\n  But President Clinton and the powerful, liberal, special interest \ngroups realized that the 104th Congress really was ready to send this \namendment to the States.\n  So I say, Mr. President, release your hostages. Let our colleagues \ngo. Free the ``BBA Six.''\n\n\n           Send the BBA to the States--Let the People Decide\n\n  Balanced budget amendment opponents just don't trust the people.\n  Let's remember, Congress doesn't amend the Constitution.\n  We merely propose amendments that the States, that the people, decide \nwhether to ratify.\n  We are saying, let the American people exercise their constitutional \nright to start the debate in earnest--a debate in every State capitol \nand every coffee shop over the very future of this country.\n\n\n                            Acknowledgments\n\n  As we move toward concluding this debate, I would like to thank and \nacknowledge the years of hard work and leadership by several of our \ncolleagues in this effort including:\n  The President pro tempore, Senator Thurmond; the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch; Senator Heflin on the Judiciary \nCommittee; and the distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole; and in \nthe House, Congressmen Charlie Stenholm and Dan Schaefer, with whom I \nhave worked for years on this amendment.\n  I want to pay a special tribute to Senator Paul Simon. The Senate and \nthe nation will suffer a great loss when he retires.\n  It has been said of Ronald Reagan, and I say it of Paul Simon, in an \nage when many are cynical about our political leaders, he is proof that \na great man can also be a good man.\n  When we do eventually pass this amendment, it will be a monument to \nhis years of leadership in putting principle above partisanship.\n  Let the debate go forward to the State capitals of this Nation. That \nis where this issue will go. Vote for this amendment. It is absolutely \ncritical to our Nation.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering one \nof the most important measures that will come before it this Congress--\nthe balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. As I have stated \nbefore, and can't emphasize enough, it is critically important that we \naddress balancing the budget because that is the only way that we will \nbe able to do anything about American priorities.\n\n[[Page S5887]]\n\n  As reluctant as I am to tinker with the Constitution, I believe that \nthe arguments for a balanced budget amendment are compelling. We owe it \nto our children--and their children--to get our fiscal house in order. \nIf we fail to do so, our legacy to future generations will be one of \ngreater problems and diminished opportunities.\n  Passing a balanced budget amendment will not prevent the Government \nfrom acting to help address problems, and working to help create \nexpanded opportunity for Americans. And defeating a balanced budget \namendment will not guarantee the Federal Government's ability to act on \nbehalf of the interests of the American people. The truth is that, \nwhether a balanced budget amendment becomes part of our Constitution or \nnot, the only way to preserve Government's ability to act is to face \nour underlying budget problems--honestly and directly--and to solve \nthem.\n  If we do nothing, the Government's ability to act to address issues \nimportant to the American people will continue to be eroded. Only by \nbalancing the budget will we be able to reclaim the Government's \nability to make important investments in our communities, such as \nfixing crumbling schools, investing in mass transit, providing pension \nsecurity, and ensuring that our airways are safe.\n  Since 1980, we have added more than $4 trillion to the national debt. \nIf we do not eliminate our run-away deficit spending, we will not be \nable to ensure that future generations have the same opportunities we \nenjoyed. We will not be able to ensure that our children and our \nchildren's children will be able to achieve the American dream.\n  As I learned through my work on the Entitlement Commission, unless we \nget the deficit under control, by the year 2003, mandatory spending--\nentitlement, plus interest on the national debt--will account for fully \n72 percent of the total Federal budget. These few program areas already \nconsume almost two-thirds of Federal resources. If we don't act now, if \nwe wait until the country is on the brink of financial ruin, we will \nhave totally failed to meet our obligation to the American people and \nto our country--and our children will pay the price for our failure.\n  For example, current recipients of Social Security and those of us in \nthe baby boom generation who will be collecting checks in the not so \ndistant future, have an absolute expectation that Social Security will \nprovide for our retirement. Social Security, thus far, has been a \nwonderful success, but that success is in danger. In a report released \nJune 5, 1996, the Social Security and Medicare boards of trustees \nstated that, by the year 2012, the Social Security trust fund will \nbegin spending more than it takes in. And by the year 2029, the Trust \nFund will have exhausted all of its resources. And even the current \nSocial Security surpluses will not stave off the coming fiscal crisis \nfor many more years. To meet Social Security's obligations after 2012, \nthe Federal Government will come up with more cash by raising taxes, \nmaking cuts in other parts of the budget, or issuing more debt. Right \nnow, we are using Social Security surpluses to mask the deficits. After \n2012, when there are no more surpluses, Federal deficits will really \nbegin to explode, an explosion fueled by the looming retirement of the \nbaby boom generation. The balanced budget constitutional amendment will \nnot solve these problems, but it will make it much more likely that we \nface them while there is still time.\n  Making the balanced budget amendment part of our Constitution is a \ndemonstration that we are willing to face our long-term fiscal \nproblems, and that we are prepared to act. The amendment will impose on \nCongress the fiscal discipline to do what should have been done years \nago. If we don't act now to stop our run-away deficit spending, there \nwill be nothing left for education, for infrastructure, or even for \nnational defense.\n  We have an obligation to the American people to discharge our debts \nand not leave them with daunting burdens that should have been \naddressed years ago. We need to make the balanced budget amendment part \nof the U.S. Constitution.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have had this debate before. But more \nthan talking about someday in the future balancing the budget we should \nbe balancing is now.\n  Since the last debate, we have had ample opportunity to balance the \nbudget--not just attach our names to a constitutional amendment which \ndoes nothing to get us to balance. We are here arguing about the \nrequirement rather than doing the hard work necessary to succeed in \nthat effort.\n  Mr. President, every Member of this body has voted for one plan or \nanother to balance the Federal budget by the year 2002. We have all \ndone that, Mr. President.\n  Last year, I voted for the Conrad budget and this year, I voted for \nthe President's budget. Both plans brought us to balance by the year \n2002.\n  This amendment will not force differing parties to come together--the \nparties must do that themselves with the same energy with which they \ndebate this issue.\n  Over the past year, I have weighed this issue carefully--I have \nreexamined my opposition to this constitutional amendment as drafted \nand reviewed all the arguments in this debate. I have read and re-read \nhistoric documents, analyzed committee hearings and the report \nlanguage, and carefully assessed the impact of this amendment on \nMassachusetts and the country as a whole.\n  And, Mr. President, after this review, I arrive at the same \nconclusion--we do not need this amendment as drafted to balance the \nbudget. Everything in this debate must be viewed with that truth in \nmind. We do not need this amendment to the constitution. It is \nsuperfluous. And passing it will not magically balance the budget.\n  The proponents of this amendment have said in the Chamber time and \nagain that by constitutionalizing the fiscal principle of a balanced \nbudget, a new moral power will overcome members of Congress. To quote \nthe committee report on this subject: ``The Committee expects fidelity \nto the constitution, as does the American public.''\n  Needless to say, there is an extraordinary statement of pathetic \nadmission in this glorification of a new moral authority.\n  Here are elected officials, already sworn to defend the Constitution \nwhich means defending the general welfare of the nation; already \ngranted, at the highest level of Government, major responsibility to \ncarry out the public trust. We are individually already on record in \ntown meeting after town meeting--in editorial board after editorial \nboard--in campaign promise after campaign promise--in support of a \nbalanced budget.\n  And yet, here we are, being told that words on a piece of paper will \nsomehow provide the moral force to accomplish what nothing but the lack \nof personal moral commitment prevents them from doing today, right now.\n  Tragically, Mr. President, this amendment as drafted is neither fair \nnor neutral. It has been drafted in a way as to create an amendment \nwith an agenda.\n  This amendment goes well beyond fiscal responsibility and \nconstitutionalizes the politics of the moment--the immediate political \nagenda of the current majority--in a way that may ultimately do \nviolence to the genius of our Constitution and our form of democracy.\n  When the veneer is stripped from this amendment, we see a deeply \ntroubling political motive that goes well beyond just balancing the \nbudget--which, by definition, cannot be the only reason for this \namendment since the proponents already have the authority to balance \nthe budget today. They can do it today. And we have voted on plan after \nplan to bring the budget to balance.\n  Mr. President, this amendment goes further than balancing the \nbudget--it goes to the heart of our democratic process.\n  It carries with it a fundamental shift in the exercise of \ndecisionmaking in America.\n  Those who are using this amendment as a weapon in an ideological war \ndo not want the votes of those who think differently to count as much \nas theirs. It's that simple.\n  If there is a possibility you may ever reach a different conclusion \nthan they have, they want to make certain that your vote will not count \nequally by requiring that you must find a super-majority to fight back.\n  This is wrong, Mr. President, it is undemocratic, and fundamentally \nrevolutionary in the worst sense of the word.\n\n[[Page S5888]]\n\n  But, Mr. President, that is not all that is wrong with this amendment \nas drafted--though it would certainly seem to be enough.\n  This amendment as drafted will encourage budget gimmickry. It invites \nthe worst type of cynicism. The experience of States with balanced \nbudget requirements only bears this out. The proponents of this \namendment have argued that the experience of States with balanced \nbudget requirements makes a constitutional amendment obvious--but \nrealities in budgeting demonstrate the exact opposite to be true.\n\n  I take to heart the testimony of the former comptroller of one State: \nEdward Regan of New York told the Congress that many States with \nbalanced budget requirements achieve compliance only with ``dubious \npractices and financial gimmicks.'' These gimmicks include shifting \nexpenditures to off-budget accounts or the financing of certain \nfunctions to so-called independent agencies. These States have been \ncreative with tricks and ploys to mask their deficits.\n  My distinguished colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, has \nillustrated some of the shenanigans in his lucid critique of this \namendment--he talks of States using ``accelerated revenue receipts such \nas tax payments, postponing payments to localities and school district \nsuppliers, delaying refunds to taxpayers and salary and expense \npayments to employees until the next fiscal year, deferring \ncontributions to pension funds or forcing changes in actuarial \nassumptions, and selling States' assets.'' And this amendment does \nnothing to stop the Federal Government from employing the same tactics \nand dozens of others.\n  Mr. President, consider the effects of these gimmicks on the people \nin this country. Postponing payments? Withholding funding for schools? \nDelaying refunds to taxpayers? Deferring pension contributions? Selling \nour national assets?\n  That will be the result of this amendment, Mr. President.\n  I oppose this gimmick. And I do so principally because I have come to \nbelieve this is an ill-advised attempt to memorialize, in the \nfundamental governing document of this democracy, budget gimmicks and \none political party's fiscal agenda.\n  This amendment as drafted, Mr. President, is political dogma \ndisguised as economic policy. It is the continuation of an ongoing \neffort to demonize national interests by demonizing those who promote \nany kind of national programs to protect the American concept of \ncommunity.\n  The gimmicks engendered by this amendment will assist the victory of \nstagnant partisan politics over sound public policy, doing what's smart \npolitically rather than what's good for the American people.\n  The budget process of the U.S. Congress already gives us the means to \nbalance the budget. The Constitution already gives us the authority. We \nhave all voted on plans to balance the budget by the year 2002. Let us \nget on with negotiating a plan that works for the American people--\nbring this budget into balance and protect services the American people \ndepend upon.\n  I stand in strong support of a balanced budget, Mr. President and \nhave voted for balanced budget plans, but I am still opposed to \namending our statement of rights, our Constitution, with this \nparticular resolution.\n  If the majority wants a balanced budget, as I and other Democrats do, \nwe should spend our time balancing the budget. It's axiomatic. It is \nsimple. It is time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, on February 8, 1995, I addressed the \nSenate regarding my views on a constitutional amendment that would \nrequire a balanced Federal budget. I stated at that time that I was \nopposed to an amendment to do something that can be done without a \nchange to the Constitution. My position on this matter, some 13 months \nlater, has not changed.\n  However, I would like to take a few moments to point out some things \nthat have changed over the past 13 months. The first is that the 104th \nCongress, with a majority of Republicans in each Chamber, voted and \npassed legislation which would have balanced the budget by 2002. That \nlegislation contained painful decisions for all Members--Democrats and \nRepublicans. But in the end, Congress was able to do something that few \npeople thought was politically possible, it passed a balanced budget. I \nthink it is important to note that the success in the Senate and House \nof this effort was due in large part to the outstanding leadership of \nMajority Leader Dole, and Speaker Gingrich, as well as Senator Domenici \nand Congressman Kasich as the chairmen of the respective Senate and \nHouse Budget Committees.\n  Despite the achievements by the Congress to pass legislation which \nwould have lead to a balanced budget by 2002, this bill was vetoed by \nthe President. That does not mean that the Congress failed to make \nheadway toward the goal of balancing the budget during the 104th \nCongress. I would like to note that one committee, the Appropriations \nCommittee, was able to cut $23 billion in discretionary spending this \nyear. As members of the Appropriations Committee in the House and the \nSenate know, that process was not a pretty picture. I liken it to major \nsurgery without the benefit of anesthetics. I am happy to report that \nthe Appropriations Committee is ready to do its part again this year.\n  As I have stated here on the floor of the Senate many times before, \nwe should not, we cannot, and we will not balance the budget of the \nFederal Government solely on the back of nondefense discretionary \nspending accounts. I do not wish to slip into Washington language so I \nwill explain what nondefense discretionary accounts actually are. \nEducation funds are discretionary, environmental programs fall under \ndiscretionary spending, crime prevention programs come from \ndiscretionary accounts, and medical research falls under the \ndiscretionary umbrella. Do not forget agriculture programs, the State \nDepartment, housing programs, NASA, and many other programs which touch \neach of our lives every single day. By excluding military spending, \nentitlements and mandatory spending from our calculation to balance the \nbudget--each one of these programs must bear the brunt of any reduction \nin spending.\n  Entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid \nare important and vital programs--but they should not be held above \neverything else that the Federal Government invests in. There have even \nbeen calls by some to take a $348 billion program off the negotiating \ntable as the key to passage of a version of a constitutional balanced \nbudget amendment; $348 billion represented 22 percent of all Federal \noutlays in 1996. Compare that 22-percent program to the 17 percent of \nthe Federal budget that represents all nondefense discretionary \nspending. Is it realistic to take 22 percent of the budget off the \ntable in trying to balance the Federal budget? I do not believe it is \nrealistic. All Federal spending should be on the table, even if it is \nan entitlement program--and even if that program is Social Security.\n  Mr. President, I support balancing the Federal budget, and I will do \nall that I can as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee during \nmy last year in the Senate to see that it is done. What I cannot do is \nsupport a constitutional promise to the people of this country that its \nelected representatives will balance the Federal budget. Congress and \nthe President can and should, with the support of the public, balance \nour budget.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support balancing the budget. That is why \nI supported the President's deficit reduction package in the last \nCongress, which has already cut the deficit in half--reducing it for 4 \nconsecutive years for the first time since World War II. That's why \nI've have voted for five specific balanced budget proposals in this \nCongress.\n  But while I will continue to stand up for real deficit reduction, I \nam not prepared to write into the Constitution language that is more \nlikely to lead to disillusionment and constitutional crisis than to a \nbalanced budget.\n  The proposed amendment, despite its title, would not balance the \nbudget--it would just say that a future Congress has to pass a law to \nenforce a balanced budget. Why wait?\n  The only real way to balance the budget is to make the tough choices. \nMost of us have voted for budgets which balance in the next 6 years. \nThe argument is about how to balance the\n\n[[Page S5889]]\n\nbudget. We should be working toward an agreement that would complete \nthe job and balance the budget. Unless and until we make those tough \nchoices and bridge the remaining gap, settle the disagreement over the \nNation's priorities, we will not have a balanced budget, whether or not \nwe pass the proposed constitutional amendment.\n  In this Congress, both Democrats and Republicans have put proposals \non the table which, as certified by the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office [CBO], would result in a balanced budget by the year \n2002. A bipartisan coalition has put its own budget plan on the table, \nalso certified by CBO to achieve a balance within 7 years. We won't get \nto a balanced budget now by walking away from the table and voting \ninstead on a constitutional amendment. That's a dodge which allows some \nto say we are cured before we have taken the rest of the medicine.\n  In May 1992, Robert Reischauer, then Director of the CBO, testified \nbefore the House Budget Committee that a balanced budget amendment is \nnot a solution, it is ``only a repetition in an even louder voice of an \nintention that has been stated over and over again during the course of \nthe last 50 years.'' Dr. Reischauer stated:\n\n       It would be a cruel hoax to suggest to the American public \n     that one more procedural promise in the form of a \n     constitutional amendment is going to get the job done. The \n     deficit cannot be brought down without making painful \n     decisions. . . A balanced budget amendment in and of itself \n     will neither produce a plan nor allocate responsibility for \n     producing one.\n\n  Dr. Reischauer further stated:\n\n       Without credible legislation for the transition that \n     embodies an effective mechanism for enforcement, government \n     borrowing is not going to be cut. But the transitional \n     legislation and the enforcement mechanism are 95 percent of \n     the battle. If we could get agreement on those, we would not \n     need a constitutional amendment.\n\n  The public understands this. They know the difference between \npromises and action. And, that is why when the Senate considered this \nsame constitutional amendment last year, I offered an amendment to \nrequire enactment of legislation to enforce the provisions of \nthe Constitutional amendment before it went to the States for \nratification. My amendment was tabled 62 to 38.\n\n  Let me tell you what some of the commentators have said about the \nbalanced budget amendment back in my home State. Here is what the \nDetroit Free Press said when we debated the issue last January:\n\n       You wouldn't take seriously any politician who promised to \n     be faithful to his spouse, beginning in 2002, so why do so \n     many people take seriously the proposed balanced-budget \n     amendment?\n       It's the same kind of empty promise to be good--not now, \n     but later. Putting it in the Constitution isn't likely to \n     confer on Congress the spine or the wisdom to fulfill it.\n       . . . [T]he way to cut the budget is to cut the budget, not \n     to promise to do it sometime in the future. . . . Gluing a \n     balanced budget amendment onto the Constitution only \n     postpones the moment of truth.\n\n  And here is what the Battle Creek Enquirer said, also last January:\n\n       If a balanced budget is such a good idea, we say to \n     Congress: Just do it!'' After all, waiting until a \n     constitutional amendment mandates it will just delay a \n     balanced budget--perhaps by years.\n       This Congress isn't likely to give the nation a balanced \n     budget, that's for certain. But, by touting the need for this \n     amendment, it sure can talk like a Congress that already has. \n     . . [I]t's all an illusion.\n\n\n  ``Just do it!'' That's what the American people want. They know the \ndifference between promises and action. A constitutional amendment can \npromise a balanced budget, but it cannot deliver a balanced budget. \nOnly concrete action by the Congress and the President can do that.\n  Mr. President, I am also deeply troubled by the fact that this \namendment, as written, would put the Social Security trust fund at \nrisk. Time after time, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave rejected amendments to protect the Social Security trust fund. \nConsequently, if we enact this amendment, we will continue running \ndeficits of at least $120 billion a year for more than a decade, and \nwill conceal these deficits by using the surplus in the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n  The money in that trust fund should be exactly that--in trust. I \ncannot vote for a constitutional amendment which allows the use of \ntrust fund money to cover up huge deficit spending. That's simply \nwrong.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the proposed amendment provides an \nexcuse for Congress not to act now to reduce the deficit and it doesn't \nforce congressional action later either. It lets us off the hook now, \nand there is no hook later. There is only one way to balance the \nbudget--now or in 2002--and that is with the willpower to make the hard \nchoices. Let's get back to work.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise once again in strong support of the \nmeasure that will soon be before us: a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States. No issue is more critical to the \neconomic future of our Nation--and the economic future of our children \nand grandchildren--than that of balancing the budget.\n  John F. Kennedy once said, ``It is the task of every generation to \nbuild a road for the next generation.'' Well, Mr. President, the road \nwe are building for the next generation is laden with the cavernous \npotholes of deficits and debt that threaten to swallow up our \nchildren's future prosperity. And if we fail to take the bold steps \nnecessary to halt our reckless and irresponsible pattern of deficit \nspending, the road we pass on to the next generation will be nothing \nmore than a dead end.\n  But, Mr. President, we have an opportunity today to alter the \nconstruction of that ``road to nowhere'' * * * and to begin to build a \nsmooth, safe road for our children and grandchildren that will lead \nthem into a bright future of economic security and prosperity that so \nmany of our generation have enjoyed.\n  Today marks yet another historic opportunity for the U.S. Senate and \nfor the American people. Some of us have been working for more than a \ndozen years for a balanced budget amendment--while others have joined \nthe fight more recently. As a Member of the House of Representatives, I \ndedicated myself to passing a balanced budget amendment. Beginning in \n1981, I was one of four original cosponsors of legislation calling for \na balanced budget amendment--and I have cosponsored four similar \nmeasures since that time--including the resolution we are discussing \ntoday.\n  In the 103d Congress, I was once again one of four bipartisan \nsponsors of the amendment in the House, and we worked with my friend, \nthe distinguished Senator from Illinois--Senator Simon--to overcome \ninstitutional opposition to the balanced budget amendment. \nNotwithstanding the opposition of the House leadership in the 103d \nCongress, we nearly reached the requisite two-thirds needed for \npassage, only to have our hopes dashed when the Speaker of the House \nand Democratic leaders whipped their members into line--and urged even \nsome Democrat cosponsors to change their votes on the bill.\n  Well, early in this Congress, a similar event undercut the balanced \nbudget amendment here in the U.S. Senate. Democratic opponents--led by \nthe President--argued that the balanced budget amendment was nothing \nmore than a gimmick. They said balancing the budget requires nothing \nmore than accounting sleights-of-hand. But as I have stated in the \npast, if the balanced budget amendment were a gimmick, Congress would \nhave passed it long ago--because Congress loves gimmicks.\n  Ultimately, the President and his fellow opponents succeeded in \nrejecting the will of 80 percent of the American people who support \nthis amendment and defeated it by a single vote--a single vote that \ncould have been provided by any one of the six Democratic Members that \nhad switched their vote from the previous year.\n  Fortunately, our distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, gave us \nthe opportunity to revisit that short-sighted political decision by \nchanging his vote and vowing that these six Members and other opponents \nwould have the opportunity to reconsider their vote later in the 104th \nCongress. That opportunity is now upon us, and I would hope that these \nMembers would--in the words of the majority leader prior to the last \nvote on this amendment--repent and vote to give the decision to enact \nthis amendment to the citizens of their States.\n  Mr. President, the Senate cannot allow the opportunity to complete \nthe first leg of this journey to pass us by. We cannot allow arrogance \nto triumph over the will of the American people.\n  This is a rare opportunity to do what is right: To set a path for a \nbalanced\n\n[[Page S5890]]\n\nFederal budget amidst a rare common purpose. The American people have \nasked to give them the power to decide if such an amendment is in their \nbest interests--and I believe the Congress has the obligation to do \njust that.\n  The action we take today will not alter the Constitution this week, \nthis month, or even this year. Rather, our adoption of this resolution \nwill simply allow the States to take up this proposal in the years \nahead and--if those who sent us to this body also deem the balanced \nbudget amendment worthy--only then will our Constitution be changed.\n\n  To be sure, we have tried to meet the challenge of a balanced Federal \nbudget through other measures short of an amendment. Mr. President, \nthey have not worked . . . they will not work.\n  Congress has repeatedly tried to balance the budget through statutory \nremedies. Each of these efforts--the 1978 Revenue Act, the 1978 Byrd \namendment, the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings I, \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings II, and the 1990 agreement following the budget \nsummit--ended in failure.\n  And, Mr. President, my confidence in the wisdom of the balanced \nbudget amendment has only been increased in light of our most recent \neffort to balance the budget statutorily.\n  As you will recall, the Republicans moved forward in presenting a \nbold plan to balance the budget despite the narrow defeat of the \nbalanced budget amendment last year. Following 10 months of wrenching \nwork and tough decisionmaking by the Republican majority, President \nClinton--amidst immense demagoguery and obfuscation of the facts--\nultimately vetoed our carefully crafted budget plan that would have set \nour fiscal ship aright. This veto came from the same President who sat \nout the fight during those 10 months and did nothing to move the \nprocess of balancing the budget forward.\n  In fact, President Clinton chose instead to first offer a budget that \npromised deficits in excess of $200 billion per year as far as the eye \ncould see. Several months later, when he realized the political wind \nwas shifting and the tide was turning in favor of a balanced budget, he \npointed his boat in the direction of the wind, put up the spinnaker, \nand claimed that he too could balance the budget--but it would take 10 \nyears.\n  Well, not only did that plan prove to be nothing but a sham that \nproduced annual deficits of $200 billion, but it also demonstrated \nPresident Clinton's willingness to renege on a campaign promise that he \nmade exactly 4 years ago: His commitment to offer a plan to balance the \nbudget in 5 years. Of course, since he took office, the President has \nhad considerable difficulty deciding how long it would take to balance \nthe budget. First it was 5 years, then 10 years, then 7 years, then 8 \nyears, then 9 years. And today--as a result of the vacuum of \nPresidential leadership on this critical issue--we still have no \nbalanced budget agreement.\n  To make a long story short, the President's charade of offering \nbalanced budget plans that did nothing but exacerbate our problems in \ncoming years continued through all of 1995, until he finally crafted a \nplan that reached paper balance on January 6 of this year. The budget \nnegotiations between the President and congressional leaders that had \nbeen undertaken at that time ultimately collapsed in late January, and \nwe are once again faced with the daunting task of crafting a plan to \nbalance the budget on our own with no sign of compromise from the \nPresident.\n  In fact, rather than come forward with a plan that would demonstrate \nhis willingness to reach consensus and provide a real path to balance, \nthe President's fiscal year 1997 budget continued to rely on gimmicks \nsuch as the backloading of fully 60 percent of his spending cuts in the \nfinal 2 years of his plan.\n  And then, less than 2 months ago, CBO told us that the President's \nbudget did not reach balance on its own, and was in fact $81 billion \nout of balance in the year 2002. CBO further stated that the President \nwould not only have to turn off his tax cuts in the year 2001 to reach \nbalance, but discretionary spending--which is used to fund programs \nthat many consider to be vital to our shared commitments to education \nand the environment--would also need to be cut by an additional $68 \nbillion in the years 2001 and 2002 alone.\n  Regrettably, the President has refused to budge from his insistence \non using gimmicks and budgetary sleights-of-hand to reach balance--and \nhis latest budget proposal made no meaningful strides toward gaining \nbipartisan support. In light of these events, I believe we can all \nagree that any hope for a balanced budget agreement prior to the \nNovember election now seems unthinkable.\n\n  If we learned nothing else from the acrimonious debate on the budget \nof the past year and a half, it is that absent a force greater than \npolitics, our ability to agree on a plan to balance the budget will \nalways be held hostage to other short-term considerations. However, the \nenactment of the balanced budget amendment will force the Federal \nGovernment to live within its means because it will compel us to reach \nagreement. A balanced budget would no longer be an option, it would be \nan imperative. The President and the Congress would be forced to \ncompromise or be held accountable for reneging on their sworn \ncommitment to uphold the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, if we pass the balanced budget amendment, our \ngovernment will be forced to break its addiction to deficit spending. \nThe full weight and measure of the Constitution will force us to live \nwithin our means. We will no longer be able to borrow against our \nchildren's future. And we will be required to set priorities among our \nprograms.\n  For 8 years, my husband served as Governor of Maine. During that \ntime, I used to tell him that traveling between Washington and Maine \nwas like going from fiscal fantasyland to fiscal reality for me. \nBecause, like the Governors of 47 other States, he was required to \nbalance the State's budget no matter what the economic conditions, or \nhow much money they were short. That meant wrenching decisions, to be \nsure, but with discipline those decisions were possible.\n  If accountability and discipline work at the State level, we can and \nshould make it work at the Federal level as well. Congress should be \nable to confront the economic realities and challenges that 48 States--\nand every American family--are forced to confront every day.\n  Mr. President, our national debt places a crippling burden on hard-\nworking families in Maine and across our great land. The Concord \nCoalition compiled an analysis that suggests that without the deficit, \nour productivity would be much higher, and that the average American \nfamily income would be $50,000, instead of the current $35,000 a year.\n  How many children, I wonder, go without a proper education because of \nthat missing $15,000? How many couples or single parents forgo proper, \nsafe, child care because of these numbers? Is this what has become of \nthe American dream when, by ignoring the deficit, we deny American \nfamilies the opportunity to prosper financially, or even to survive \neconomically?\n  Mr. President, our constituents deserve--and need--to reap the \nwindfall of a balanced budget.\n  Perhaps the most devastating and alarming impact the deficit has had \non our economy is its effect on economic growth and job creation. The \nNew York Federal Reserve Bank says that from 1979 to 1989, we lost 5 \npercent growth in GNP and in national income because of a drop in \nsavings caused by the deficit. According to the CBO, every percentage \npoint lost in GNP means 650,000 jobs lost in this country. That is a \ndevastating concept: On that basis, the deficit in those years resulted \nin the loss of roughly 3.75 million jobs.\n  Ironically, opposition to the balanced budget amendment is once again \ncoming from a President whose failed fiscal policies resulted in a \ngrowth in real GDP of only 1.4 percent in 1995. Contrary to what the \nadministration would have us believe, this is the weakest economic \nrecovery in 28 years. In fact, job growth following the most recent \nrecession is half of what is typical in a normal recovery.\n  The present recovery has yielded total growth of only 12.2 percent, \nwhile identical periods of recovery following the recessions of 1982 \nand 1975 were 22.6 percent, and 32 percent respectively.\n\n[[Page S5891]]\n\n  Balancing the budget--while not a silver bullet--would have a \ntremendous positive ripple effect across the economy: It has been \nestimated that balancing the budget would not only lead to growth in \nreal GDP of 0.5 percent or more, but would also yield a drop in long-\nterm interest rates of between 2.5 and 4 percent over the next 7 years.\n  This is remarkable, because even a 2-percent decline in \ninterest rates would create an additional 2.5 million jobs, according \nto the Joint Economic Committee. In human terms, that means that \nAmericans would pay less on their home mortgages, car loans, and \nstudent loans for college. When you stop to think about it, the last \ntime we saw interest rates that low, General Eisenhower became \nPresident Eisenhower.\n\n  And while balancing the budget would result in immediate economic \nbenefits, even more compelling reasons can be found in what will happen \nto our economy in the future if we fail to balance the budget. As Herb \nStein of the AEI notes, ``The problem isn't the deficit we have now, \nit's the deficits we will have in the next century.'' You know the \nnumbers:\n  Under current economic policies, our debt--which has grown from $1 \ntrillion in 1980 to more than $4.9 trillion today--will reach $6.4 \ntrillion by the year 2002. And according to estimates from the \nPresident's own Office of Management and Budget, the deficit will \ndouble in 15 years, then double again every 5 years thereafter. And by \nthe year 2025, OMB estimates that the deficit in that year alone will \nbe $2 trillion. OMB also forecasts that if we continue our current \nspending spree, future generations will suffer an 82-percent tax rate \nand a 50-percent reduction in benefits in order to pay the bills we are \nleaving them today.\n  As my colleague, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico [Mr. \nDomenici] has emphasized in the past, our national debt represents the \nmost unfair tax ever imposed.\n  The balanced budget amendment demands that we evaluate every one of \nour programs. It compels us to ask these important questions about \nevery government program:\n  Does it fit within our priorities? Can we afford it? Will it help the \nAmerican people?\n  And, the balanced budget amendment will force those of us in Congress \nto ask ourselves the fundamental question: Can we do our job better?\n  Mr. President, the answer is yes--we can do our job better. And we \nmust do it better. We have skirted the issue of the balanced budget for \nyears now. We cannot continue to pass this onerous debt on to our \nchildren and grandchildren. We can no longer squander their future.\n  I believe that we must also lead by living by the standards that \nevery American must uphold in their daily lives. The American people \nhave learned to live within their means. They balance their checkbooks \neach month, and adjust their spending as their income changes. We must \ndo the same.\n  Passage of the balanced budget amendment will restore accountability \nto the Federal budget process, and force our government to live within \nits means as well.\n  How much proof of the devastating impact of this deficit do we need? \nHow much debt is finally enough? And how much longer do we have to wait \nfor Congress to have the will and the courage to act?\n  Now is the time to pass the amendment, Mr. President. Recent events \nhave proven that even with the passage of a balanced budget plan by a \nmajority of Congress, months of negotiations between the President and \nCongress, and countless calls for compromise by the general public, the \nadoption of a balanced budget can still be thwarted by a force the \naverage American has grown tired of: the force of politics. The passage \nof a constitutional amendment will change all that. We cannot afford to \nsquander this opportunity yet again.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I intend to vote against House Joint \nResolution 1, a joint resolution proposing a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution of the United States. At the same time, I want to \nmake it clear that not only do I support balancing the budget, I have \ndevoted a good deal of my time in the Senate toward achieving that \ngoal.\n  Most recently, I worked with a bipartisan group of Senators to \ndevelop a bipartisan balanced budget package. We spent over 6 months \nputting together a package which set reasonable discretionary spending \nlimits, began the process of entitlement reform, and contained a \nreasonable set of tax initiatives. I was, and continue to be, proud of \nthese efforts. And while we did not win the vote on this package, I am \ndelighted to note that we came pretty close in a 46 to 53 vote, with 24 \nDemocrats and 22 Republicans voting for what has come to be known as \nthe Centrist Coalition plan.\n  I found this vote heartening and I think it speaks well for the \nfuture of balancing the budget. Because if there is one thing we are \nall coming to realize, it is that one political party is not going to \nbe able to do it alone.\n  Rather than heading down the path of amending our Constitution to say \nwe want to balance the budget someday, I hope that Members of this body \nwill consider redoubling our bipartisan efforts to actually balance the \nbudget. It seems to me that we are very close to agreeing on a 7-year \nbalanced budget plan, this year, in this Congress. We ought not to \ndistract from that goal which is tantalizingly within our reach. I hope \nmy colleagues will agree with me and join in a here and now attempt to \nbalance the budget by supporting the budget which has been put forward \nby the Centrist Coalition.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, more than a decade ago, when budget \ndeficits were first becoming a way of life around here, I proposed a \nconstitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. Since then I \nhave voted for several other versions of a balanced budget amendment, \nincluding the one before us today.\n  This is not a commitment I have undertaken lightly. This is the \nultimate step we can take to safeguard future generations from \nirresponsible budget policies. On those grounds, I believe that making \ndeficit finance a more difficult decision is an appropriate issue for \nconsideration as part of our country's fundamental law.\n  But the practical reasons for this amendment are also compelling. The \nthreat to the future of our country, and the damage that accumulating \ndeficits are doing right now, are sufficiently serious to warrant this \nultimate step.\n  The effects of mounting debt and deficits on the future of our \ncountry will be profound. Right now, the Federal debt held by the \npublic--the accumulation of our annual deficits--totals more than $3.6 \ntrillion. This year the interest we will pay on our accumulated \nborrowing will be $240 billion.\n  By the year 2002, the target year for balancing the budget under the \namendment before us, interest alone will total $311 billion, and will \ncost us more than we will spend on the total defense budget, more than \nwe will spend on every domestic function of government, from fighting \ncrime to building roads.\n  Accumulating debt at this pace is simply unsustainable--it will \nradically reduce the choices that future Congresses, representing \nfuture generations of Americans, can make. By continuing to accumulate \ndebt, we are forging chains that will bind those who follow us. We are \nbuying a little extra time to avoid those hard choices by dumping them \ninto the future.\n  At the same time, because concern for the deficit is driving so much \nof our thinking right now, we are short-changing the kinds of programs \nthat may provide long-term payoffs, that could make us all better off \nin the future, but that are increasingly squeezed out of the budget.\n  Just look what is happening to our investments in education, in \nresearch, in cleaner air and water, in safer working conditions. These \nrepresent our legacy to the future; they will determine--for better or \nfor worse--the kind of country we pass along to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  But in the current budget climate, we are slighting these priorities \nin the race to find short-term savings.\n  Mr. President, I have watched for years as accumulating deficits have \nchanged the face of our budget process. I have watched the policies \nthat provide essential support for those who need it the most. They \ninclude my parents' generation, who won a war for us, and built the \ngreatest economy in the\n\n[[Page S5892]]\n\nworld. We have made moral commitments to them, commitments I came to \nWashington to keep.\n  And our children--the future of our country--will be shortchanged by \nbudget policies that cut investments in education, research, health \ncare.\n  Mr. President, there is much merit in the argument that we should \nreturn more authority and responsibility to State and local \ngovernments, that we should return the power to make decisions and the \nresources to carry them out to the neighborhoods and communities that \nknow their problems best.\n  But we cannot lose sight of the reasons that led our Founding Fathers \nto establish a national government--the kinds of issues that cut across \ncity and county lines, that cut across State and regional boundaries, \nissues that affect us all as Americans.\n  Unfortunately, it is also those priorities that are now under attack \nin our deficit-driven budget process.\n  I am talking about the air and water pollution that drifts and flows \nover State lines. I am talking about the safety of food and drugs sold \nby national and multinational corporations. I am talking about the \nsafety and reliability of our rail and airline systems.\n\n  All of these essential functions of our national Government have been \nunder severe spending restrictions--virtually a spending freeze--since \n1990. Under the current budgets of both the administration and the \nRepublican majority in Congress, these priorities will continue under \ntight restraints.\n  Now, Mr. President, over a decade ago I proposed, along with Senators \nKassebaum and Grassley, a freeze on all spending programs, to provide \nsome breathing space for us reconsider the course we were on.\n  Well, of course we did not impose that freeze, and for almost a \ndecade we did not undertake a fundamental change in our budgets--and \nthe results are all too clear.\n  But 3 years ago, Mr. President, we took the first steps toward \nrestoring some balance to our national finances. We passed a $500 \nbillion deficit reduction package that has produced 4 straight years of \ndeficit reduction for the first time since the end of World War II.\n  Unlike so many of the promises made here in Washington, Mr. \nPresident, the benefits of that plan were even greater than advertised. \nBecause of the lower interest rates that serious deficit reduction \npermitted, the economy has grown fast enough to reduce the deficit to \nthe tune of $846 billion less than it would have been.\n  That's right, Mr. President, our national debt would be $846 billion \nhigher if we had listened to those voices who tried to scare us out of \ntaking the first real steps to bring the deficit under control.\n  That experience might have been encouraging--we could accomplish \nreal, significant deficit reduction and be rewarded with lower interest \nrates and stronger economic growth. But instead, the political response \nto that success has been a ceaseless stream of recriminations for those \nof us who voted for that historic budget plan.\n  So in many ways we are worse off than before, Mr. President. The \nlesson many will take away from recent budget debates is that the tough \nchoices to reduce the deficit will get you little credit and a lot of \nblame.\n  And as is increasingly the case, we see that the goal of a balanced \nbudget--years out there, over the horizon--seems dim and vague compared \nto promises to throw tens of billions of dollars on exotic weapons \nsystems, or on continued corporate welfare, or tax breaks for a wealthy \nfew.\n  That is why I am still convinced that we must take the final step to \nclose the door on the era of uncontrolled deficit spending. We must \nsend the balanced budget amendment to the States--to the people of the \nUnited States--for their approval.\n  Without this additional constraint on our budget process, I am afraid \nthat we will find the old ways of doing business too easy, too \nattractive, to give up.\n  It is my belief that only when we have asserted control over our \nbudget once again will we be able to conduct a meaningful debate on our \nreal national priorities. Until then, the short-term, bottom line \ncalculations will continue to drive the budget process.\n  Mr. President, that if we had taken control over the budget before, \nif we had found the discipline to make the tough choices, we would not \nhave seen the erosion in support for those priorities that led me into \npublic life. I want to restore balance to our Nation's finances, Mr. \nPresident, but just as importantly, I want to restore some balance to \nour priorities.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, earlier today, I voted against House \nJoint Resolution 1, the so-called balanced budget amendment. Like last \nyear, this amendment was defeated. And, once again, I want to take a \nminute to tell my colleagues why I voted the way I did.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is nothing more than a feel-good \npolitical gimmick. The balanced budget amendment makes for a good \npolitical sound bite. But, when looked at closely, one can see this \namendment would have serious economic ramifications, tie the hands of \nour children and trivialize our Nation's constitution.\n  I am disappointed--but not completely surprised--the Senate decided \nto vote on this amendment during the height of the Presidential \ncampaign season. We should not use the Nation's fiscal policies to \ncreate divides between our two parties. Rather, we should be working \ntogether to come to agreement on a common-sense balanced-budget plan \nthat reflects American values--the belief we should care for our \nelderly, educate our children and preserve our quality of life.\n  We have made great progress this past year. The difference between \nour two parties has narrowed greatly. Everyone agrees we need to \nbalance this Nation's budget, and we are closer than ever to reaching a \nbudget compromise.\n  In fact, just 2 weeks ago, the so-called centrist balanced budget \nplan came within five votes of passing on this floor. And while I did \nnot like every part of it, I supported it because it was the most \ncredible attempt yet to actually reach a final compromise and get the \njob done.\n  Mr. President, we simply need to stay focused. We must remember a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment will not get the job done for \nus--political courage and tough decisions are the only things that will \nbalance the budget.\n  Let's not forget the progress we have made these past 3 years. Since \n1993, we have cut the deficit in half, and the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates this year's deficit will be as low as $130 billion. \nThat's nothing to cheer about, but it's progress. And it's proof the \nPresident's 1993 deficit reduction plan has worked. And I am proud to \nsay I voted for that plan.\n  So, Mr. President, we know we can balance the budget without tying \nour children's hands in the future. This amendment will make it \nimpossible for future generations to determine our country's spending \nand revenue priorities. We will do that for them. They will be forced \nto live within tight spending constraints and they will be paying much \nhigher taxes than we pay today.\n  And proponents of this amendment fail to explain that it will make it \nmuch more difficult for our country to deal with recessions. Like any \ngood business, the government must invest today in order to succeed \ntomorrow. During recessions, the Government's revenue stream decreases \nand its need to provide unemployment insurance increases. In order to \ncurtail a recession and energize the economy, the Government must \ninvest in capital and its people. Quite simply, the balanced budget \namendment will stifle the Nation's ability to correct economic \ndownturns.\n  And let's not forget the Government oftentimes is needed to help \nStates and local communities deal with the damage that results from \nnatural disasters. Just last winter, my home State suffered severe \nflooding. The floods caused millions of dollars worth of damage and \nupset the local economy. The Federal Government helped Washington State \nresidents cope with this disaster by pitching in $74.5 million. This is \nan important role the Federal Government must play. But, the balanced \nbudget amendment would make this type of assistance impossible in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, balancing the budget requires tough choices. We have \nlearned it takes dramatic spending cuts or tax increases or a \ncombination of both. It cannot be done by cutting taxes. Last year, my \nRepublican colleagues proposed $250 billion worth of\n\n[[Page S5893]]\n\ntax cuts. I ask my colleagues, how would that huge tax cut proposal \nmesh with the constraints of the balanced budget constitutional \namendment? Where would the offsets come from? Does this mean we would \nbalance the budget by cutting important programs to pay for politically \npopular tax cuts?\n  Mr. President, these questions are important. We have already seen \nhow the Republican majority would balance the budget. They would cut \neducation and job training programs, strip environmental protections, \nand reduce payments to Medicare beneficiaries. We need to understand \nthe consequences of passing this amendment, and we need to ask whether \nor not this Nation's most needy will be taken care of appropriately if \nit is passed.\n  Just as we must watch out for our most needy--those who cannot afford \nto buy a high-priced lobbyist to speak on their behalf--we need to \nconsider how this amendment will impact small States. When determining \nhow to make the cuts needed to balance the budget, the States with the \nmost representatives will have the most influence over the decisions \nbeing made. I fear small States, like Washington State, will take a \ndisproportionate hit when Congress determines how to make the cuts \nneeded to balance the budget.\n  And, Mr. President, our wise Founding Fathers wanted Congress to \ncontrol the Nation's purse strings because the legislative branch is \nthe closest branch to the people--we understand the needs and \npriorities of our constituents. The balanced budget amendment could \nshift fiscal responsibility to the courts. If the President and the \nCongress disagree on spending and revenue priorities, the courts could \nbe required to step in and decide the appropriate fiscal plan.\n  Mr. President, Supreme Court Justices are not responsible to the \npeople of my home State. They are not elected, and they are not sent to \nthe Nation's Capital to tend to the needs of my constituents.\n  We have amended the Constitution only 17 times since we adopted the \nBill of Rights. We have never changed the Constitution lightly. Every \nprevious amendment has expanded personal rights and outlined \nresponsibilities. We have never amended the Constitution to insert an \neconomic belief. And, fortunately, we did not do so today.\n  Mr. President, I voted against this amendment because I value the \nConstitution. I chose not to trivialize the importance of the U.S. \nConstitution by making it a forum for our annual fiscal decisions and \nthe politics that accompany those decisions.\n  I have no doubt the Senate will debate this amendment again next \nyear. I look forward to that debate, but I remind my colleagues that \nbetween now and then we can make that debate irrelevant. We can work \ntogether to find compromise, and we can work together to put together a \nsensible balanced budget agreement. And, I say, that would be the best \nthing for our children--that would be the real accomplishment that will \ntruly benefit our children.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to this \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  Let me first say, I am well aware that the notion of balancing the \nbudget and forcing this Government to live within its means is a \npopular idea both in Congress and across the Nation. If working \nfamilies have to do it, why can't the Government?\n  I agree. That's one of the main reasons that I was 1 of 11 Members of \nthe U.S. Senate to vote against the Reagan tax plan of 1981. In case \nwe've all forgotten, it was that plan, which cut taxes for the wealthy, \nincreased spending and exploded the deficit to the heights it reaches \ntoday.\n  It is why I sponsored the first pay-as-you-go plan in 1982. According \nto the CBO, the enactment of that proposal would have brought a budget \nsurplus by 1985, making this entire debate today irrelevant.\n  Additionally, it is why I was the second Member from this side of the \naisle to support the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act.\n  And it is why I supported President Clinton's 1993 deficit reduction \nplan. Because of that plan the latest deficit projections are down to \n$130 billion, from more than $300 billion when the President took \noffice.\n  It is also why I have long been an advocate for real deficit \nreduction and not the various accounting gimmicks that so often tarnish \nour budget cutting efforts here in Congress. But, at the same time, I \nhave also fought for deficit reduction that protects our national \npriorities while forcing Congress to accept fiscal responsibility.\n  But, the measure before us today would meet none of those essential \ncriteria. Instead it would only increase the use of budgetary gimmickry \nby allowing the Congress to avoid making the critical decisions \nnecessary for balancing the budget.\n  What's more, it would not make it any easier for this or any Congress \nto accept our fiscal responsibility. Instead it would include in the \norganic law of our land a constitutional amendment that would remove \nfrom the legislature the historic and mandated role of making budgetary \ndecisions.\n  Contrary to the arguments of its supporters, this amendment is not a \nlightning bolt that would suddenly give the Congress the courage it has \nso often lacked when it comes to cutting the deficit.\n  Instead it would constitutionally mandate possibly massive spending \ncuts in education, the environment, Medicare and Medicaid and other \npriorities that make a real difference in the lives of the American \npeople. And in the end we would have a foolproof excuse for those \ndraconian cuts: ``The Constitution made me do it.''\n  And if Congress could not effectively reach compromise a \nconstitutional amendment could place the budgetary decisionmaking \nprocess squarely in the lap of the Supreme Court.\n  The Supreme Court is an unelected body whose job is to interpret our \nNation's laws, not enforce them. But, if this amendment passes, the \nSupreme Court could be deciding whether the requirement of a balanced \nbudget has been achieved.\n  If the conditions of this amendment were not met then our Federal \njudiciary could be making the decisions on budgetary allocations.\n  For the Congress to go along with such a proposal represents an \nabsolute abdication of our responsibilities and obligations as \nlegislators and elected representatives of the American people.\n  That's no way to balance the budget and it's no way to run the \nFederal Government.\n  But, while there are many reasons why I believe this amendment is \ntruly bad public policy and bad for the American people, I also believe \nthat it is wholly unnecessary.\n  Because, over the past year and a half, Democrats and Republicans \nreached compromise on the means for balancing the Federal budget.\n  Let me repeat that, because I think sometimes it is conveniently \nignored by my Republican colleagues: Both President Clinton and the \nleadership here in Congress are in agreement on balancing the Federal \nbudget in 7 years.\n  Both sides have proposed the necessary spending cuts to put our \nfiscal house in order. And both sides agree that this budget balancing \ncan be done by the year 2002.\n  While I certainly think that the President's plan does a better job \nof protecting our national priorities, the facts remain evident for all \nthose in this body who wish to open their eyes and see: We can work \ntogether to balance the budget. We don't need a constitutional \namendment. We have the outlines for an agreement right here.\n  If my Republican colleagues would simply walk down Pennsylvania \nAvenue, meet with the President and in good faith negotiate a \ncompromise solution there would be absolutely no need for a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  But my colleagues across the aisle seem to prefer making campaign \nspeeches on the Senate floor and embarking upon the momentous act of \namending the Constitution of the United States rather than sitting down \nwith the President and working out a deal.\n  They seem more inclined to avoid compromise and instead use the \nPresident's principled stand against this amendment as a means to score \npolitical points.\n  But, amending the Constitution should not, and must not, be a \npolitical tool. It is one of the most sacred and essential duties of \nour elected office.\n\n[[Page S5894]]\n\n  There is a very good reason why, in the more than 200 years since \nthis Nation adopted the Constitution, we have seen fit to amend it only \n27 times. Twenty-seven times in more than 200 years.\n  In fact, in those 200 or so years, we've seen approximately 11,000 \nproposed amendments to the Constitution. Only 33 passed the Congress. \nAnd the Bill of Rights notwithstanding, only 17 are now part of the \nConstitution.\n  What's more, amending the Constitution remains an incredibly \ndifficult task. Two-thirds of the Congress, and three-fourths of the \nState legislatures must agree before we change the law of the land. Our \nFounding Fathers made clear that amending the Constitution would not be \nan easy or brazen decision.\n  Changing the Constitution is not like adopting a simple statute that \ncan be modified or repealed somewhere down the road. Indeed, the \nlanguage we insert into the Constitution will very likely stay there \nlong after all of us have left this Earth. Generation after generation \nwill live with the consequences of our constitutional decisions.\n  As Henry Clay said 145 years ago, ``The Constitution of the United \nStates was made not merely for the generation that then existed, but \nfor posterity--unlimited, undefined, endless, perpetual posterity.''\n  But frankly, over the last year and a half, the sacrosanct nature of \nour Constitution and the amendment process has been largely ignored by \nthe majority.\n  I fear that the sacred, fundamental nature of our Constitution has \nbeen lost on some of our Republican colleagues. The Congressional \nleadership is advocating one of the most sweeping rewrites of the U.S. \nConstitution since the enactment of the Bill of Rights.\n  The Constitution is not simply a set of fraternity bylaws to be \namended with each new pledge class. It should reflect not the popular \nwinds of the time, but the sacred principles of our republic.\n  Nonetheless, in the 104th Congress alone, several amendments to the \nConstitution, all of which would have an incalculable impact on the \nsocial, political and economic life of our nation have been proposed.\n  First, we have the balanced budget amendment, which we are discussing \ntoday. But, there are also proposed amendments requiring a super \nmajority for raising taxes, limiting the terms of Congressman and \nSenators, providing for a line-item veto, preventing unfunded mandates, \nallowing school prayer, making flag burning a crime, and the list goes \non and on.\n  Other than the Bill of Rights, ratified in 1791, these constitutional \nchanges would be utterly unprecedented in our Nation's history.\n  Unfortunately those changes are an integral part of the Republica \nagenda.\n  Now, I ve heard all the rhetoric from across the aisle about how \nessential this amendment is for protecting our children from a lifetime \nof crushing debt.\n  I've heard the rhetoric about providing opportunity for working \nfamilies. I've heard the rhetoric about cutting the deficit so as to \nincrease economic growth.\n\n  Well to all my colleagues who constantly invoke children when calling \nfor the enactment of this amendment, I ask how do you plan pay for this \nbalanced budget amendment?\n  Will Head Start, Medicare, Medicaid and our environmental safeguards \nescape the budgetary ax? Now my Republican colleagues want to spend an \nadditional $60 billion to build another star wars system. How are they \ngoing to pay for that, while trying to balance the budget?\n  Are they going to raise taxes? Hardly. This body can't even swallow a \n4.3 cents gas tax, which as part of the President's deficit reduction \nplan in 1993 cut the deficit in half. A plan, by the way, that failed \nto receive even a single Republican vote. But that's another story.\n  In 1995, the Federal Government spent more than $1.519 trillion, \nwhile receiving in revenues approximately $1.355 trillion. That \nrepresents a Federal deficit of just over $150 billion.\n  If we passed this amendment tomorrow, this body would have to cut \nmore than $150 billion in 7 years. And if history is any indication, my \nRepublican colleagues would do it by shredding the social safety net. \nThey would enact draconian cuts in education, Medicare, Medicaid, and \nthe environment to name a few. Is that how my Republican colleagues \npropose to protect children? By cutting money for education and health \ncare for children.\n  That is the part of the balanced budget amendment that you don't hear \nabout too often: the part where the Congress would be constitutionally \nmandated to unravel the fabric of America's social safety net.\n  I didn't run for this office to be a party to those kind of spending \ncuts.\n  When I became a U.S. Senator I took an oath of office to uphold and \nprotect the Constitution of the United States. And that is why I'll be \nvoting no on this balanced budget amendment and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, before we vote once again on the balanced \nbudget amendment, let me pay tribute to some of my colleagues who have \ntirelessly and courageously fought for the passage of this crucial \nmeasure. First, let me mention the senator from Illinois, Paul Simon, \nthe primary Democrat sponsor of this bipartisan amendment. His \nleadership on this issue will be missed in the years ahead. Senator \nThurmond and Senator Heflin have been long-time leaders on this issue. \nSenator Craig and Senator Coverdell have also fought long and hard for \nthis measure. I would also especially like to thank the 11 freshman \nRepublican Senators who joined us at the beginning of the Congress, all \nof whom leapt immediately into the fray in support of the amendment \nwhen it came up in the very first month of this 104th Congress.\n  Mr. President, there are many, many others who have worked to send \nthe balanced budget amendment to the States. But one Senator stands \nabove them all in his tenacity, dedication, and commitment to providing \na better future for our children and grandchildren--an America like the \none he grew up in, fought for, and has served all of his life. I am of \ncourse referring to our leader in this effort, Senator Robert Dole. His \neffort on this amendment is consistent with his decades of service on \nbehalf of Americans of this and future generations. The contrast of his \nrecord with President Clinton's is clear.\n  President Clinton has fought the balanced budget amendment every step \nof the way. Last year, President Clinton won and the American people \nlost. The American people will lose again if President Clinton has his \nway this year, and it looks like he will.\n  Mr. President, I would ask, why are President Clinton and his allies \nopposed to the balanced budget amendment? I would suggest that the \nopponents of the balanced budget amendment are simply not ready to \nimpose the kind of fiscal discipline on themselves that a \nconstitutional amendment would require. It's tough to stop spending \nother peoples' money.\n  And they do spend. When we last debated the balanced budget \namendment, the Federal debt was $4.8 trillion. As of Monday of this \nweek, it stood at more than $5.1 trillion. Mr. President, that is an \nincrease of $320 billion. Translated into more understandable terms, \nthat means that the cost of the delay in passing this important \namendment has been more than $1,200 for every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica. Put another way, over the 15 months that have elapsed since \nPresident Clinton helped defeat the balanced budget amendment, the debt \nhas increased, on average, over $650 million a day.\n\n  The enormous size of the national debt, over $5.1 trillion, and the \nunacceptable rate at which it is growing threatens the economic \nstability of this great Nation. We all know this, Mr. President. And we \nknow that the American people overwhelmingly want a balanced budget \namendment.\n  Even so, there are those who oppose the balanced budget amendment and \nkeep spending, and so they need to find a way to justify voting against \nit. President Clinton's chief advisor, Leon Panetta, said as much in \n1994 when he explained the need to provide cover to opponents of this \namendment so that President Clinton could defeat it with their votes. \nHe conceded that ``If you allow people to say, `Are you for or against \na balanced budget,' you'll lose it.''\n  So, we have a parade of excuses of why we do not need the balanced \nbudget amendment or why we need a different, meaning more lax, balanced\n\n[[Page S5895]]\n\nbudget amendment. Capital budgets, automatic stabilizers--the list goes \non and on. The most popular of these false protests is ``protecting \nsocial security'' from the balanced budget amendment--as if balancing \nthe budget would harm a system that depends on the government's \ncreditworthiness. This argument has been called by one commentator in \nthe Washington Post ``the single most fraudulent argument'' he has \nheard in 17 years in Washington, and by Time magazine as ``mendacious \nnonsense.''\n  Mr. President, in less than an hour, the American people will see who \nis on their side and who is on President Clinton's side. I would say to \nmy colleagues, if you really support a balanced budget and not just \ntalk, then cast your vote for the balanced budget amendment.\n  The very future of our country is at stake. I say to my colleagues, \nif not for yourselves, then support the balanced budget amendment for \nyour children and your grandchildren who are almost $20,000 in debt the \nvery moment they are born. Do not condemn them to live in a nation of \neconomic stagnation, suffocating taxes, and hopeless debt. This is what \nis riding on this vote. I urge my colleagues to support a balanced \nbudget requirement today, so that we and our children will have a \nprosperous tomorrow.\n\n\n                     the rise in the debt this year\n\n  Mr. President, the eyes of the Nation are upon us. Today the U.S. \nSenate has the opportunity to keep us on a path to balancing the \nFederal budget. Last year this body narrowly missed another historic \nopportunity by failing to pass the balanced budget amendment. During \nthat debate every Member of this body, whether they were for or against \nthe balanced budget amendment, came to this floor to swear their \nsupport for balancing the budget. Well, the time has come to see who \nreally meant it and who was just defending the status quo of runaway \nGovernment. I urge my colleagues to hold true to their promises, to \nvote for a balanced budget, and to not waste another historic \nopportunity.\n  When we last debated the balanced budget amendment, I gave a daily \nupdate on the debt increase as we debated. By the end of the debate, my \ndebt tracker was becoming unwieldy, so I have brought down a sort of \nsummary debt tracker to bring us up to date on the debt since we began \ndebate on this amendment in January of last year. As my chart here \nshows, when we last began debate on the balanced budget amendment the \nFederal debt was $4.8 trillion. As of Monday of this week, it stands at \nmore than $5.1 trillion. Mr. President, that is an increase of $320 \nbillion. Translated into more understandable terms, that means that the \ncost of the delay in passing this important amendment has been more \nthan $1,200 for every man, woman, and child in America. Put another \nway, over the 15 months that have elapsed since President Clinton \nhelped defeat the balanced budget amendment, the debt has increased, on \naverage, over $650 million a day, over $27 million an hour, over \n$450,000 a minute, and over $7,500 every second. This is the price of \nthe delay caused by President Clinton and his allies.\n  I urge my colleagues to put an end to this wasteful, out of control \nspending by supporting the balanced budget.\n\n\n                    the deficit and increased taxes\n\n  Mr. President, out-of-control Federal spending hurts us all in many \nways. Not the least of which is through increased tax burdens on all \nAmericans.\n  Every year hard-working Americans pay the price for our profligacy. \nThe Tax Foundation has calculated that in 1994, the average American \nworked from January 1 to May 5 just to pay his or her taxes. They did \nnot get to keep one cent of the money they earned until May 6. Put \nanother way, in an 8 hour work day, the average American works the \nfirst 2 hours and 45 minutes just to pay taxes. This is simply \nintolerable, but it is not the end of the story.\n  The National Taxpayer's Union, NTU, has also determined that for \nevery year we endure another $200 billion deficit it costs the average \nchild over $5,000 in extra taxes over his or her lifetime. How many \nmore years will the Government levy another $5,000 fine on our young \npeople?\n  The bad news about the debt does not end there, either. The \nCompetitiveness Policy Council has shown that the rising budget \ndeficits have led to a 15-percent decline in real wages in the last 15 \nyears. And NTU has further calculated that in the 45 years, unless we \nget our spending under control, after-tax incomes will rise by a mere \n$125 for the entire 45-year period. Talk about a middle class squeeze. \nHow can people be expected to bear the burden of stagnating wages and \nhigher tax rates? We simply cannot continue blindly down this road to \neconomic oblivion.\n  Mr. President, we now have the opportunity to make an historic \nchange. We can pass a balanced budget and preserve a future for our \nchildren, our grandchildren, and this country. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport a balanced budget requirement today, so that we will have a \nprosperous tomorrow.\n\n\n           economic benefits of the balanced budget amendment\n\n  Mr. President, apparently some of my colleagues have forgotten not \nonly how dramatically the deficit is hurting our economy, but also how \nmuch a balanced budget will help our economy. I would like to touch \nupon some of those economic benefits which will accrue to working \nAmericans across the country.\n  Last year, DRI/McGraw-Hill analyzed the economic impact of balancing \nthe budget and has concluded that it will result in a significant \nimprovement for the nation's citizens. Here are the results of their \nstudy:\n  As government spending is reduced, resources will be freed up for \nprivate investment and interest rates will drop. Both of these factors \nwill make it easier for businesses to expand, resulting in the creation \nof 2.5 million new jobs by 2002.\n  Further, fueled by the drop in interest rates, private investment \nwill rise and real nonresidential investment could grow by 4-5 percent \nby 2002.\n  Lastly, by the end of the 10-year forecast, real GDP was projected to \nbe up $170 billion from what it would be without a balanced budget. \nThat translates to approximately $1,000 per household in the United \nStates.\n  So when we talk about who is really trying to help American citizens \nof all walks of life, lets remember just how important it is to balance \nthe budget.\n\n\n                 benefits of a constitutional amendment\n\n  The sad history of legislative attempts to balance the budget show \nthe need for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget.\n  Despite our best statutory efforts and the most recent deficit \nreduction plan, a constitutional amendment is required for the \nfollowing reasons:\n  Statutes do not purport to correct the structural bias in favor of \ndeficit spending that would be offset by a constitutional amendment.\n  Statutes are only intended to deal with a temporary crisis, whereas a \nconstitutional amendment corrects a bias that has caused deficits in 55 \nof the past 63 budget cycles. The deficit spending bias is not a \nproblem that has lasted, nor will last, only 5 years. It demands a \npermanent constitutional solution.\n  Ultimately, no Congress can bind a succeeding Congress by simple \nstatute. Any balanced budget statute can be repealed, in whole or in \npart, by the simple expedient of adopting a new statute. Statutory \nlimitations remain effective only as long as no majority coalition \nforms to overcome such statutory constraints. The virtue of a \nconstitutional amendment is that it can invoke a stronger rule to \novercome the spending bias.\n  Our recent history suggest how much we need the strong rule of a \nconstitutional amendment. Gramm-Rudman was to balance the budget by \n1990. It was undone by a series of statutory amendments. Recently, we \nhave fought tooth and nail to get on track towards a balanced budget. \nWithout the balanced budget amendment to keep the Government in line, \nthe budget we fought so hard for can be undone by a simple majority \nvote. Mr. President, the past year's budget battle is not example of \nwhat Congress can do, it is an example of how hard it is for Congress \nto do what it should always do.\n\n\n                         automatic stabilizers\n\n  Some have argued that the reason we should not have a balanced budget \nrule is to keep intact the so-called automatic stabilizers. Their \ncontention is that these so-called stabilizers help minimize the \neffects of the business cycle. Thus, those who support this theory want \nto cycle deficits and surpluses to counteract the business cycle.\n\n[[Page S5896]]\n\nThis claim confuses me for three reasons.\n  First, we have had numerous business cycles since 1969 but have only \nbalanced the budget once. If this theory is right, we should have had a \ncycle of deficits and surpluses.\n  Second, far from cycling, the debt is on a steady increase. The debt \nis growing at a fantastic rate, and is now over $5.1 billion and is \nprojected to exceed $6 trillion in only 4 years.\n  Third, the balanced budget amendment in no way prevents us from \nrunning a small surplus, which could be used to offset the effects of \nan economic downturn.\n  I just do not believe that the facts support this argument.\n\n\n                       protecting social security\n\n  Mr. President, I have listened to the same arguments raised time and \nagain from opponents of the balanced budget amendment that we should \nexempt Social Security from the balanced budget amendment. Some \nopponents have been searching for reasons to vote against the balanced \nbudget amendment or reasons to justify their ``no'' votes. In their \nefforts, they came up with a number of accounts and interests they \nthink we should exempt. Social Security is just the most popular of \nthese favored exemptions from opponents of the balanced budget \namendment. This objection is not merely a red-herring, but a dangerous \none at that. The balanced budget amendment helps protect social \nsecurity by ensuring that when the IOU's in the social security trust \nfund come due, the Federal Government will be able to make the payments \nto the retirees counting on them. The exemptions proposed would \nendanger Social Security, and so does failing to balance the budget.\n  As I argued in the first round of debate on this matter, if we \nexempted Social Security from the balanced budget requirement, Social \nSecurity would be the only part of the budget which could run a \ndeficit. This would create the dangerous incentive to run deficits in \nthe social security account to ease pressure on balancing the rest of \nthe budget, and might even lead to the chicanery of redesignating \nvarious programs as Social Security and thereby allowing deficit \nfinancing for them. This would endanger the solvency of the Social \nSecurity trust fund, leaving it with neither funds nor trust for \nretirees.\n  Now let me be clear about what is at issue. Those who were critical \nof the balanced budget amendment have said that Congress will raid the \ntrust fund to balance the budget. This is confusing, rather than \nenlightening. In essence these critics object that there are not \nseparate accounts set up under the balanced budget amendment for social \nsecurity and other accounts. What is at stake is merely a question of \naccounting.\n  Proponents of the balanced budget amendment say that accounting \nformalities are not as important as substantive economic reality. When \nthe Government takes money from people or gives it to people, it has \nthe same overall economic effect no matter which pocket it puts it in \nor takes it out of. The real numbers, the ones to be concerned about \nare total Federal receipts and outlays. This is the consensus of almost \neveryone who analyzes budget issues, including President Clinton, most \nof Congress, and most private financial analysts.\n  Let me summarize the way the Social Security system works now: Money \ncollected for Social Security comes into the Federal treasury. The \ntreasury issues IOU's for that amount in the form of Government \nsecurities to the Social Security trust fund account and spends the \nmoney on other programs. Then as the IOU's come due, the treasury \ncollects the IOU's from the trust fund and pays out money taken from \nthe Federal treasury. This is the way it works now. And nothing in the \nbalanced budget amendment would change that. And let me just say that \nas of now these IOU's are the most secure in the world: they are U.S. \nGovernment-backed bonds. The primary risk to the Social Security trust \nfund always has been and continues to be the risk that the Government \nmight get so far into debt that it could not pay back these IOU's. \nSince the balanced budget amendment would return fiscal responsibility \nto the Federal Government, it would help protect Social Security by \nhelping the Government always be able to meet its obligations \nto retirees.\n\n  Let me repeat: The real threat to Social Security is a Government \nthat cannot pay its bills because it keeps piling up debt, not the \naccounting method used to count how high the debt is growing. The trust \nfund is not going to be depleted because of the balanced budget \namendment. Indeed only a real balanced budget amendment will protect \nthe financial solvency of the general treasury and of Social Security.\n  There is, however, one other threat to Social Security: a balanced \nbudget amendment with an open-ended exemption for Social Security. \nUnder alternative amendments offered by the other side on this issue, \nthe Government would have to balance all its accounts except one--\nSocial Security. So, all the pressure of balancing would have been \nplaced on that account. The budget would be like a pressure cooker. And \nif steam can only escape through one valve, all the steam and all the \npressure will go through that one outlet--and in balancing the budget \nthere will be a lot of pressure. Social Security was to be that valve, \nand that would have been dangerous to the viability of the trust fund. \nThis would cause the risk of either destroying the trust fund's \nsolvency or creating a loophole in the balanced budget rule which could \nallow the same risk to the solvency of the Federal Treasury, either of \nwhich would betray the trust of those counting on the trust funds.\n  Let me summarize: Rather than protecting Social Security, these \nSocial Security exemption alternatives would have endangered it--to \neffect nothing more than an accounting preference.\n  It is my hope that the balanced budget amendment can be sent on to \nthe States so the country can have a debate about the fiscal future of \nour Nation and our Government. The people can then decide whether they \nwant to ensure themselves of a Government that must act responsibly--\nwith a constitutional safeguard for their children's future.\n\n\n                     constitutional accountability\n\n  Mr. President, I am always loathe to attempt to amend the \nConstitution. It is an undertaking that I approach with the most \nserious reservations and concerns. But it has become clear that a \nbalanced budget amendment is necessary to save this country from \neconomic catastrophe.\n  The Constitution speaks in terms of broad principles and general \ninstructions of how democracy should operate in America. Some \namendments to the Constitution provide people with rights that limit \nGovernment's authority while others provide for people to take part in \nour great democracy. The balanced budget amendment is a little of both.\n  While it is true that much of the enormous growth in Federal \nGovernment spending over the past two decades may be a response to \nevolving notions of the role of the public sector on the part of the \nAmerican citizenry--that is, a genuine shift in the will and desire of \nthe people--it is my contention that a substantial part of this \ngrowth stems from far less benign factors.\n\n  In short, the American political process is skewed toward \nartificially high levels of spending, that is, levels of spending that \ndo not result from a genuine will and desire on the part of the people. \nIt is skewed in this direction because of the characteristics of the \nfiscal order that have developed in this country in recent decades. It \nis a fiscal order in which Members of Congress have every political \nincentive to spend money and almost no incentive to forego such \nspending. It is a fiscal order in which spending decisions have become \nincreasingly divorced from the availability of revenues.\n  The reason for this skew is simple--the future generations who will \nhave to pay the bills for our extravagance have no political voice. \nThose who will join the work force in 20, 30, or 40 years may not even \nbe born yet. But here we are, spending the money that they will need to \nlive on.\n  Mr. President, one of the oldest and most basic appeals to fairness \nin the history of this great Nation is no taxation without \nrepresentation. We teach it to all our children. It is this basic \nfairness that the balanced budget amendment is designed to uphold. \nForecasts are that at current rates of spending our children may be \ncrushed\n\n[[Page S5897]]\n\nwith tax rates of 85 percent. All to pay for what we spend now, without \ntheir consent or even their knowledge. Surely every generation of \nAmericans has the right to manage the country how it sees fit. But this \ngeneration is stealing from the next.\n  In seeking to reduce the spending bias in our present system--fueled \nlargely by the unlimited availability of deficit spending--the major \npurpose of the balanced budget amendment is to ensure that, under \nnormal circumstances, votes by Congress for increased spending will be \naccompanied by votes either to reduce other spending programs or to \nincrease taxes to pay for such programs. For the first time since the \nabandonment of our historical norm of balanced budgets, Congress will \nbe required to cast a politically difficult vote as a precondition to a \npolitically attractive vote to increase spending.\n  The balanced budget amendment seeks to restore Government \naccountability for spending and taxing decisions by forcing Congress to \nprioritize spending projects within the available resources and by \nrequiring tax increases to be done on the record. In this way, Congress \nwill be accountable to the people who pay for the programs and the \nAmerican people--including the future generations who must pay for our \ndebts--will be represented in a way they are not now. Congress will be \nforced to justify its spending and taxing decisions as the Framers \nintended, but as Congress no longer does.\n  This protection of the rights of future generations of Americans is \nsurely the kind of great principle for which our Constitution stands, \nand without it, the Constitution is incomplete.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution.\n  The Constitution of the United States represents the greatest \ndemocratic achievement in the history of human civilization. It--and \nthe self-evident truths which are its basis--has guided the decisions \nand heroic sacrifices of Americans for two centuries. Its precepts are \na shining beacon of hope for millions of people across the globe who \nhunger for the freedoms that democracy guarantees. It has served us and \nthe world extremely well.\n  Indeed, Madam President, this great document should not be amended in \na rush of passion--or in the name of political expediency. It is \nevident from the Constitution itself that its authors intended the \nprocess of amendment to be slow, difficult and laborious--so difficult \nthat it has been attempted with success only 17 times since the Bill of \nRights. This document is not meant to be tampered with in a trivial \nfashion.\n  This proposed 28th amendment to the Constitution is intended to \naffect the behavior of America's congressional representatives. In that \nregard it is unique. Except for the 25th amendment, which addresses the \nissue of transfer of power, other amendments affect the behavior of all \nAmericans by limiting the power of government, protecting public \nfreedoms, prohibiting the majority from infringing on the rights of the \nminority, or regulating the behavior of the States.\n  This would be the only amendment aimed at regulating the behavior of \nCongress--to date only 535 Americans--who, the amendment assumes, is \nincapable of making difficult decisions without the guidance of the \nConstitution's hand. That theory is grounded in the assumption that \nCongress and the public lack the political will be to balance the \nbudget.\n  I reject the argument.\n  Specifically, this amendment would raise the number of votes \nnecessary in Congress for deficit spending from a simple majority to \nthree-fifths and sets a goal of balancing the budget by the year 2002.\n  The amendment empowers Congress to pass legislation detailing how to \nenforce that goal, but does not itself specify enforcement measures. \nBut nobody knows the answer to the question: what will happen if \nCongress and the President fail to balance the budget? The only \nmechanism our country has for enforcing the Constitution is the courts. \nSo the amendment's ambiguity presents the serious possibility of \nprotracted court battles which would given an unelected judiciary \nunwarranted control over budget policy--a power clearly out of the \nrealm of their expertise.\n  The proponents of this amendment sincerely believe our Constitution \nneeds to be changed in order to force Members of Congress to change \ntheir behavior, which, supporters argue, they will not do because they \nare afraid of offending the citizens who have sent them here. However, \non that basis, there is a long list of constitutional changes they \nshould propose, including campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. President, I support the goal of a balanced budget and have \nfought, am fighting and will continue to flight to achieve it. Recently \nmy colleagues and I--Senators Simpson, Brown, Nunn, and Robb--proposed \na provision that would have reformed long-term entitlements. Mind you, \nwe did not dabble on the fringes, but instead took on some serious \nbudgetary dilemmas, and avoided the use of gimmickry as a solution.\n  For our efforts we received 36 bipartisan votes--unprecedented \nsupport for this type of long-term entitlement reform. Our proposed \nchanges to current laws would have caused taxpayers very little concern \nin the short term as these changes would be phased in and have no \neffect on anyone over the age of 50, and would save the Nation billions \nof dollars in the long term.\n  As well, the Senate recently voted on the Centrist Budget plan, that \naddressed a number of budgetary problems including entitlement reform, \nand provided a balanced budget in 7 years. This plan garnered 46 \nbipartisan votes--22 Democrats and 24 Republicans--and is a fundamental \nindication that Congress is waking up to the need to reform our \nnation's budgetary ways and the need to get our economic house in \norder.\n  Four votes away from a bipartisan balanced budget in 7 years, Mr \nPresident--a budget that would have passed had this not been a \nPresidential election year. So why do we need to amend the \nConstitution?\n  The Constitution and its 27 amendments express broadly our values as \na nation. The Constitution does not dictate specific policy, fiscal or \notherwise. We attempted to use the Constitution for that purpose once, \nbanning alcohol in the 18th amendment, and it proved to be a colossal \nfailure. If nothing else, this experience should have taught us that \nthe mere desirability of a goal cannot become the only standard to \nwhich we hold constitutional amendments. Constitutional amendments must \nmeet a higher standard.\n  Fundamentally, we should amend the Constitution to make broad \nstatements of national principle--and, most importantly, Mr. President, \nwe should amend the Constitution as an act of last resort when no other \nmeans are adequate to reach our goals. We do so out of reverence for a \ndocument that we have believed for two centuries should not be changed \nexcept in the most extraordinary circumstances. We have used \nconstitutional amendments to express our preference as a nation for the \nprinciple of free speech, the right to vote and the right of each \nindividual to live free. The question before us today is whether the \nneed to tie Congress' hands on fiscal issues belongs in such \ndistinguished company.\n  While I oppose this amendment, I understand, I understand the \narguments for it. But if the appeal of a balanced budget amendment is \nsimply the legal or political cover it provides for those tough \nchoices, a statutory change could provide the same cover. If the \nassumption behind the amendment is that the political will to balance \nthe budget does not exist, then make no mistake, those who lack that \npolitical will find a way to circumvent this amendment.\n  And beyond all the legal maneuvers, there is no cover for tough \ndecisions but the courage to make them. A vote for this amendment is \nnot a sign of courage--it is more an indication of timidity.\n  The balanced budget amendment assumes there is a structural flaw in \nour Constitution that prevents the 535 Members of Congress from \nbalancing the budget. But if a flaw does exist, it is in the 535 \nMembers of Congress themselves not the document that governs us. The \nfact is that we could balance the budget this year if we wanted to. And \nwe can by statute direct the Congress to balance the budget by 2002, \n2003, or any other date we choose.\n  The inherent weakness of the balanced budget amendment is that it \ntells us what to do over the next 7\n\n[[Page S5898]]\n\nyears but ignores the following 20, the years which ought to command \nour attention. A balanced budget by 2002 still ignores the most \nimportant fiscal challenge we face: the rapid growth in entitlement \nspending over the next 30 years.\n  The year on which we ought to be focused is not 2002, but 2008, when \nthe baby boomer generation begins to reach eligibility age for \nretirement. This will place a severe strain on the Federal budget. Our \nbiggest fiscal challenge is demographic, not constitutional, and the \namendment before us does not and cannot address it.\n  Unfortunately, and conveniently, this demographic challenge is kept \nfrom our view, not by an incomplete Constitution, but by a budgeting \nprocess that discourages long-term planning. The balanced budget \namendment tells us what happens over 7 years. A 7-year span is \ncompletely inadequate when the most difficult budget decisions we need \nto make deal with problems we will face 20, 25, and 30 years down the \nroad, when the aging of our population propels entitlement spending out \nof control. The most important recommendation of the Bipartisan \nCommission on Entitlement and Tax Reform was that we begin to look at \nthe impact of budgets over 30 years rather than just 5 or 7. The reason \nis that our country looks very different, and our current budgets look \nvery different, when viewed over that span.\n\n  We can see the trend even in the short term. Entitlement programs--\nwhich includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal \nretirement--consume 66 percent of the budget this year. By 2002, it \nwill be 73 percent. By 2005, the number is 78 percent. Those numbers \nare straight from CBO, and if we project further, Mr. President, we see \nthat by 2012, mandatory spending and interest on the national debt will \nconsume every dollar we collect in taxes. By 2013, we will be forced to \nbegin dipping into the surplus in the Social Security trust fund to \ncover benefit payments, a practice that will go on for no more than 16 \nyears before the trust fund goes into the red.\n  These trends have nothing to do with the Constitution, political will \nor pork-barrel politics. They have to do with the simple fact that our \nelderly population is growing and living longer while our work force \ngets smaller. My generation did not have as many children as our \nparents expected, and, as a consequence, the system under which each \ngeneration of workers supports the preceding generation of retirees \nsimply will not hold up.\n  Indeed, long-term entitlement reform coupled with a reasonable \nreduction in discretionary spending--including defense--would reduce \ninterest rates dramatically and achieve the goal of this amendment \nwithout tampering with the Constitution.\n  The result is sometimes described as a question of fairness between \ngenerations. Today there are roughly five workers paying taxes to \nsupport the benefits of each retiree. When my generation retires there \nwill be fewer than three. Unless we take action now, the choice we \nforce upon our children will be excruciating: Continue to fund benefits \nat current levels by radically raising taxes on the working population \nor slash benefits dramatically.\n  Finally, I hope we keep our eyes on a larger prize than blind \nreverence to the idea of a balanced budget. Our goal should, in my \nview, be economic prosperity. I support deficit reduction as a means to \nthat end. Deficit reduction is important not as an abstract ideal but \nas an economic imperative.\n  I believe in balancing the budget because it is the most powerful way \nto increase national savings. And increased national savings will lead \nto increased national productivity, which in turn will lead to higher \nstandards of living for the American family. There is no short-cut to \nsavings and no substitute that will get results. Increased national \nsavings mean lower long-term interest rates and increased job growth in \nthe private sector.\n\n  The balanced budget amendment assumes that a balanced budget is \nalways the best economic policy. A balanced budget is usually the best \neconomic strategy, Mr. President, but it is by no means always the best \neconomic strategy. Downward turns in the economy complicate the \npicture. Downward turns result in lower revenues and higher spending, \nso there will be times--although very few of them--when a strict \nrequirement for a balanced budget harms the economy by requiring the \ncollection of more taxes to cover more spending in an economic \nenvironment which makes revenue collection more difficult in the first \nplace. As I say, I believe those times are few and far between, but the \nConstitution is too blunt an instrument to distinguish between good \ntimes and bad. The American people hired us to do that job, not to cede \nit to a legal document that cannot assess the evolving needs of our \neconomy.\n  As my friend and colleague the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee Senator Moynihan has often said, ``We do not need to put \nalgebra into the Constitution.'' Mr. President, I could not agree more.\n  The bottom line for me is whether this amendment moves us toward \nachieving the correct goals and whether, if it does, we need to amend \nthe Constitution to get there.\n  I believe a balanced budget is an important goal, but only as a \ncomponent of an overall economic goal with a strategy that recognizes \nthat skyrocketing entitlement spending is the most serious fiscal \nchallenge we face. But I also believe that once we set those goals we \ncan achieve them by statute or, more importantly, by changing our own \nbehavior rather than changing the Constitution. And my respect for this \ndocument precludes me from voting to tamper with it when I am not \nconvinced that we must. This proposal for a 28th amendment does not \ncommand from me the same reverence in which I hold the 1st amendment, \nor the 13th or the 19th. And therefore, Mr. President, while I will \ncontinue to fight for its admirable goal, I will vote ``no'' on the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Democratic \nleader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I have a chart here that shows, as graphically as \nanything can, the number of times that our Republican colleagues have \nproposed in this Congress to change the U.S. Constitution. Not since \nthe Bill of Rights have so many amendments been proposed all at once. \nNo wonder the rumors of rumblings from gravesites from Monticello to \nMount Vernon have been heard during this Congress. There are those who \nappear to believe that they know better than our Founding Fathers how \nour Constitution should be structured. They now advocate altering the \nU.S. Constitution not once or twice, but, as this chart shows, in 83 \ndifferent ways. There were 83 amendments proposed by our Republican \ncolleagues in this Congress to the U.S. Constitution. One has to \nwonder, Mr. President, whether or not there are those in this body, and \nin the other body, who believe they know better, and that somehow they \nare in a better position than our Founding Fathers to determine the \nadvisability of changes in the Constitution to this degree.\n  I am not averse to constitutional amendments. I have supported some \nin the past. But before we do so, the first question we must ask is, is \nit necessary? We have had debates on the Senate floor in this Congress \non whether or not to amend the Constitution to provide for protection \nof a flag. There are those who propose amendments that would somehow \nrequire the ability for public prayer in schools. In those cases, and \nin many others, I, as well as many of my colleagues, have concluded \nthat indeed it is not in our best interest, that the Founding Fathers \nwere correct that the first amendment rights need to be protected. We \nhave shown the wisdom on those occasions to defeat proposals to amend \nthe Constitution, as our forefathers would have.\n  We did not need a constitutional amendment 4 years ago, Mr. \nPresident, when this administration came to Washington, and the \nPresident decided--rather than talking about it, rather than \nconstitutional amendments, rather than more proposals to modify the \nbudget and bring this Government into balance--``I am going to do \nsomething about it.'' Indeed, he saw the need to do something about it.\n  Everyone recalls that, in 1992, the deficit was $290 billion. In the \nfirst year in office in 1993, this administration, working with the \nDemocratic Congress,\n\n[[Page S5899]]\n\nMr. President, reduced that deficit to $255 billion. In 1993, how well \nI remember the vote taken on this floor with virtually everybody in \ntheir chair, one-by-one, standing up, in one of the most courageous \nacts of deficit reduction since I have been here, and voting for a plan \ncut the deficit. That plan covered not just 1 year or 2 years, but 5 \nyears of massive deficit reduction. And it passed by one vote.\n  As a result, the deficit in 1994 then fell to $203 billion. Last \nyear, in 1995, we did some more, and the deficits fell, not \nsurprisingly, as a result of that action, to $164 billion. Now, this \nyear, we mark 4 years in a row of meaningful deficit reduction. With \nsome courageous votes and real determination, the deficit is expected \nto fall to $130 billion. That is the record over the last 4 years--from \n$292 billion to $130 billion.\n  For the first time since Harry Truman sat in the White House, the \ndeficit has declined for 4 years in a row. The deficit has been cut in \nless than half since President Clinton took office.\n  That is the difference, Mr. President, between rhetoric and results. \nThe only way that these results can continue, the only real way in the \nshort-term that we can build on that record is with an negotiated \nagreement that balanced the budget by 2002.\n  A constitutional amendment, under the best of circumstances, is going \nto take several years to ratify. Who in this body would argue today \nthat we ought to wait that long before we continue further efforts at \ndeficit reduction? We all know we cannot afford to wait. The President \nrealizes that and, for that reason, has held out an open invitation for \nRepublican leadership to join with Democratic leadership and this White \nHouse to build on the record of the last 4 years, to take that $130 \nbillion down to zero, and to do it now. We can do it. We need to do it. \nBut if that is going to happen, we must, in a bipartisan way, come \ntogether, resolve our differences, and put this country on the track to \nultimate success. Not only are we not negotiating, Mr. President, not \nonly may we miss that opportunity to balance the budget, but the very \nsame threats that we faced in the early eighties are back with us \nagain. I can hear them now. The political rhetoric is there. The same \nthreats to the budget are as evident now as they were back then, 15 \nyears ago.\n\n  In the 1980's, proposals for dramatic increases in star wars spending \nand dramatic cuts in taxes became more than just political rhetoric. \nThey became reality. We were told we could do all of that without \nexploding the deficit. I remember how clearly, how persuasively the \nPresident at the time indicated that it indeed was possible. Well, now \nthe reality is here. We are faced with the consequences. And $5 \ntrillion in debt later, some of us have learned, as we should have \nknown back then, that if we follow that path, it will not be $5 \ntrillion in debt. Heavens knows, it could go $10, $15, or $20 trillion.\n  How ironic that similar proposals to those that created massive \ndeficits in the 1980's are now again dominating the Republican \nrhetoric--the $60 billion Defend America Act, and tax cuts ranging from \n$600 billion to $700 billion. The supply-side experiments of 1981 that \ncreated massive deficits are once again the centerpiece of the \nRepublican agenda. To contend with such budget-busting proposals while \ndebating the balanced budget amendment makes one wonder if we are \nfacing historical blindness or gross hypocrisy. So let us recognize, if \ntheir fiscally irresponsible proposals come to fruition, we will be \nright back here all over again with yet more need for courageous \naction, to take this into our hands and to resolve it once and for all. \nWe cannot afford that kind of rhetoric. We cannot afford those starry-\neyed proposals if we are serious about accomplishing what we are \ndebating today, balancing the budget.\n  Mr. President, having the realization that indeed building upon our \n4-year record of deficit reduction is so important, it still begs the \nquestion, is an amendment necessary? Do we see it in our long-term best \ninterests to amend the Constitution, to recognize that somewhere on \nthis list may be an amendment that warrants our support? My answer to \nthat question is yes. Beyond building upon the record that we have \nachieved, beyond the courageous work we have already done, my view is \nif the amendment is written properly, I support a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. In fact, I voted for such a properly \ncrafted amendment last year during the previous debate on the balanced \nbudget amendment, and I hope to vote for it again today.\n  But we must also realize that once it is part of the Constitution, \nthere is no going back. We are not likely to change a clause or a \nphrase next year or the year after. That is not going to happen. Many \nSenate Democrats have offered a proposal which, in our view, does it \nright. Our alternative recognizes very important principles of \nconstitutional law, but also recognizes the commitments on Social \nSecurity that we have made in statute and to the American people for \ngenerations.\n  Doing it right in this case recognizes the importance of protecting \nSocial Security. Our amendment, which has been introduced this year by \nthe Senator from Oregon, Senator Wyden, proposes a firewall between \nSocial Security and the rest of the budget. It is identical to an \namendment crafted last year by the Senator from California, Senator \nFeinstein, and the Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid. Were it to be \nconsidered today, more than enough Senators would support it in order \nfor it to pass.\n  In 1990, Mr. President, we made ourselves very clear on this issue by \na vote of 98 to 2. This body voted for an amendment by Senator Hollings \nto take Social Security off budget. Why did we do that? We did it \nbecause we realized that Social Security has become a sacred trust; \nthat that trust fund is going to be drawn down in the not too distant \nfuture, and we are going to need every dollar of it. We recognize that. \nSo we said we are going to build a firewall. We are going to make \nabsolutely certain that when we need that money, it is going to there. \nThe program is financed by dedicated payroll taxes that were not to be \nraided to pay for general Government expenditures.\n  Mr. President, the pending version of the constitutional amendment \nbreaks that promise. It breaks it. According to CBO's December \nbaseline, the pending amendment anticipates using $603 billion in \nSocial Security trust fund dollars over the next 7 years to reach \nbalance. This year alone, it anticipates $71 billion borrowed from the \ntrust fund. In the year 2002, as we proclaim a balanced budget, the \nfact remains that there will be $103 billion anticipated in Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses that will be counted toward that balance, \nso we will actually be $103 billion in debt to future retirees.\n  So, Mr. President, we are violating public trust, and, in my view, we \nare actually overturning the law laid out on a 98 to 2 vote on the \namendment passed in the Senate offered by Senator Hollings.\n  This means continued reliance on payroll taxes to fund the \nGovernment, as well. Social Security, as everyone knows, is funded by a \n12.4-percent payroll tax. It only applies to the first $62,700 of \nincome. As a result, this tax can be seen as regressive since it falls \nheavily on lower- and middle-income taxpayers. In fact, 58 percent of \nour taxpayers pay more in payroll tax than they do in income tax. We \ncannot allow funding of our Government by these working people, and we \ncannot allow the continued abuse of the Social Security payroll taxes. \nWe should not fund the Government in large measure by a payroll tax \nwhich is regressive, the revenues from which are intended to be set \naside in the Social Security trust funds for the needs of all \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, we have a choice this morning. We have a real choice. \nWe have the opportunity to build on the record of the last 4 years, to \nresolve to deal directly with our differences on budget priorities, and \nto build a balanced budget agreement in a way that will achieve a \nbalanced budget by 2002. We can do that.\n  We also have an opportunity to build the next step, to pass an \namendment that allows us to do it right, to pass an amendment that \nmaintains a firewall between Social Security and the rest of the \nbudget. The Constitution must recognize the critical, absolute \ndependence that we will have on Social Security trust funds in the \nfuture, and must recognize the meaning of a real balanced budget \nwithout the use of Social Security trust funds. It must recognize, too, \nour appreciation of the trust\n\n[[Page S5900]]\n\nof the American people. That is our choice. We can do it right or, once \nagain, we can violate that trust. We can do it in a way that I believe \nundermines the credibility of this Constitution and what it was meant \nto do when our Founding Fathers wrote it 200 years ago.\n  We are not going to pass 83 constitutional amendments. We should not \npass even one if it is not written correctly. We have the opportunity \nthis morning, Mr. President, to approve an amendment that is properly \ncrafted. The Senator from Oregon will seek unanimous consent that the \nSenate today vote upon his thoughtful alternative that accomplishes all \nof the goals of the amendment before us, without enshrining abuse of \nthe Social Security trust funds in the Constitution.\n\n  I now yield to the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Senator Wyden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the minority leader for yielding me \nthis time.\n  I take this time to say that I think this is an historic opportunity \nfor the Senate to get this job done right, to get this job done on a \nbipartisan basis. I do not think anyone doubts how this vote on the \nmajority leader's proposal is going to turn out, today.\n  I believe we could have an alternative ending, however, that would \nbenefit the American people, that would ensure that we get real fiscal \ndiscipline, and at the same time provide long-term security for \ngenerations of Americans to come. That is why I am hopeful that today \nwe will have an opportunity to vote on a measure that is identical to \nthat offered by the majority leader save for one difference. The \nalternative constitutional amendment to balance the budget would simply \nbar the use of the Social Security surplus or Social Security taxes for \nbalancing the Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, and colleagues, it is clear that both political \nparties--let me emphasize--both political parties have in the past used \nthat Social Security surplus to mask the overall Federal deficit. I \nthink that has to end. I think that the amendment, the alternative \ndescribed today, would give us an opportunity on a bipartisan basis to \ntackle this issue responsibly and end it once and for all. It is time \nto close this road show and give the people what they want. Our \nproposal would provide that opportunity.\n  Some of my colleagues apparently believe that you cannot balance the \nFederal budget without cooking the books. They have been trying to \nhighlight various kinds of defects that they allege exist in our \nmeasure. I do not think the American people benefit from all of this. I \ndo not think that the country benefits from this. The country benefits \nfrom an approach that forces both political parties to keep straight \nbooks, to get rid of the accounting fiction, and to make the tough \ncalls with respect to both the Federal budget and the Social Security \nprogram.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I rise now to ask unanimous consent that \nimmediately following the vote on House Joint Resolution 1, the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 54, a balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment that protects Social Security, and that \nthe joint resolution be read a third time, and at the end of that the \nSenate proceed without any intervening action or debate on passage of \nthat joint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I object--at least I reserve the right to \nobject. I will make a comment to my friend and colleague from Oregon. \nLet me ask a question.\n  The essence of the unanimous-consent request is that he wants to have \nplaced before the Senate by unanimous consent a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget with an exception saying we are not \ngoing to count Social Security--Social Security taxes do not count, \nSocial Security spending does not count, Social Security balances do \nnot count--and the Senator wants to have that placed before the Senate \nwithout amendment, without discussion, and for a vote. Is that correct?\n  Mr. WYDEN. If the Senator will yield, the Senate prior to my coming \nhere has debated and voted on this proposition, last year. In fact, in \n1995, there were more than 80 votes on a motion asking the Budget \nCommittee to refashion the leader's amendment to include Social \nSecurity protection. This is not a new issue to the U.S. Senate. More \nthan 80 Members of the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, have voted for \nthe alternative that I would like to offer in the form of a \nconstitutional amendment, today.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am not sure I got an answer, but I \nthink I was correct in stating that the Senator's request--he would \nlike to offer that.\n  I object. I object on the grounds--because Social Security taxes are \ntaxes. Social Security outlays are spending. Constitutionality, in my \nopinion, should not be confused by what I would say is maybe an attempt \nto obstruct or maybe give political coverage for people who are not \nsupporting a real constitutional amendment which says all revenues and \nall expenditures, and you cannot spend more than is received.\n  I object. I respectfully object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will only say that the Senate on a \nbipartisan basis is formally on record with more than 80 Senators in \nsupport of this proposition. We have a choice, as the minority leader \nhas said. We can let this go down once more or we can have a vote on a \nproposal that I offer to my colleagues that will impose real fiscal \ndiscipline and at the same time assure that Social Security is \nprotected for both workers and retirees in the days ahead.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for 30 seconds from the leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have never had a balanced budget \namendment up where 80 percent of the Senators voted for this type of \namendment. At the last minute to have an amendment like that literally \ncreates a complete dislocation in the whole budget process. It would be \nhighly unusual and we believe improper.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might use \nnot to exceed 2 minutes of the time allocated to Senator Dole and that \nI might include in the Record certain documentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have participated before in these \namendments, and have supported them throughout my career in the Senate. \nA balanced budget is essential for the United States. And each time I \ngo back and bring to the attention of the Senate a resolution--this one \nis Senate Resolution 38--by my distinguished former colleague and \nsenior Senator from Virginia, Harry F. Byrd. Each year he would bring \nbefore this body, and we would pass, a resolution which said, in \neffect, Congress shall assure that the total outlays of the Government \nduring any fiscal year do not exceed total receipts for the Government \nduring such fiscal year.\n  That is the essence of a balanced budget. Each year we passed this \nresolution. Each year it became law. And my distinguished colleague \nfrom South Carolina is nodding assent to that fact.\n  And what happened? What Congress does one day it can undo the next, \nand this resolution became worthless each year.\n  Mr. President, that is why we have to go to the Constitution of the \nUnited States to bring about the discipline required to compel the \nCongress of the United States to have a balanced budget. The laws that \nwe pass--and we did I think eight times pass Senator Byrd's \nresolution--are undone the next day.\n  So we have no other recourse than to turn to the constitutional \namendment and send it to the several States and allow the people all \nacross this Nation to support the concept of amending the Constitution \nof the United States to bring about fiscal discipline which this body \nrequires.\n\n[[Page S5901]]\n\n  Mr. President today we are on the floor of the U.S. Senate with an \nopportunity to perform an historical act before the 104th Congress \nconcludes later this year. Today, we are on the verge of ensuring that \nour Nation will have a balanced budget, free of any sleight of hand, as \nour majority leader prepares to depart. The Republicans have been \nworking toward this end for years, and we must continue to stay firm on \nour mission.\n  As we have seen over the past 6 months, America's financial markets \nare showing their support for the Republican effort toward a balanced \nbudget. If we are successful on this vote today, there will be another \nstrong reaction on Wall Street. Wall Street reflects the views of \nmillions of investors in America's future.\n  It is not only the investors in America's future that are behind us, \nbut also Americans--in every walk of life--throughout this Nation. My \nphone lines have been busy, and in my State of Virginia, the calls have \nbeen overwhelmingly in support of our staying the course and finally \nbalancing our Federal budget. The balanced budget constitutional \namendment is supported by 83 percent of Americans, according to a poll \npublished in a recent edition of USA Today. This proposed \nconstitutional amendment, which passed the House by a 300-132 vote in \nJanuary 1995, will enable all Americans, through their State \nlegislature, to participate in the most important long-term decision \nfacing us today.\n  Anything less than 67 votes would be failure, and an abdication of \nour responsibilities to those voters who gave this Congress a mandate \nto clean up our fiscal house. This is not a political issue, although \nthere are those who would make it so. This is for our children, \ngrandchildren and their heirs.\n  When the Senate voted March, 1995, and fell only one vote short, the \nmajority leader said, at that time, that we would have another chance \nto give the American people what they want. Now is the opportunity for \nwhich we have been waiting. This Congress has a remarkable opportunity. \nWe can take action that will benefit generations to come with the \nbalanced budget amendment. It is our mission today, and it will become \nour legacy tomorrow.\n  When the final balanced budget constitutional amendment is passed, \nboth Republicans and Democrats will have participated in the \nreaffirmation of the future of America. I am confident that today will \nprove to be that reaffirmation and I wholeheartedly support this \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of Senate Joint \nResolution 38 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 38\n\n                            (96th Congress)\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     hereby proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States, which shall be valid for all intents and \n     purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the \n     legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within \n     three years after its submission to the States for \n     ratification:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``Section 1. In exercising its powers under article I of \n     the Constitution, and in particular its powers to lay and \n     collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises and to enact laws \n     making appropriations, the Congress shall assure that the \n     total outlays of the Government during any fiscal year do not \n     exceed the total receipts of the Government during such \n     fiscal year.\n       ``Sec. 2. During the fiscal year beginning after the \n     ratification of this article, the total outlays of the \n     Government, not including any outlays for the redemption of \n     bonds, notes, or other obligations of the United States, \n     shall not exceed total receipts, not including receipts \n     derived from the issuance of bonds, notes, or other \n     obligations of the United States\n       ``Sec. 3. In the case of a national emergency, Congress may \n     determine by a concurrent resolution agreed to by a rollcall \n     vote of two-thirds of all the Members of each House of \n     Congress, that total outlays may exceed total receipts.\n       ``Sec. 4. The Congress shall have power to enforce this \n     article by appropriate legislation.''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. HATCH. I withdraw it.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. March 2, 1995 was the last time we were all here talking \nabout the balanced budget amendment. It was a very historic vote. We \nfell one vote short. And so we might reconsider that vote I changed my \nvote to ``no'' and entered a motion to reconsider.\n  That is what we are now doing. And I might confess that I thought--\nwhen I first thought about bringing this vote up, I thought I had to be \nhere to do that; that when I left, it could not be brought up again. \nBut the Parliamentarian properly advised me that once the motion is \nentered anybody can call it up. So I can say to my colleagues when I \nmade my resignation statement, I was under some little misapprehension \nabout whether or not we could do this.\n  But in any event, the point is I think it is the appropriate thing to \ndo. There are fundamental differences. I know some are all over the lot \non why they cannot vote for this. And some just do not believe it is \nthe right thing to do. I understand that, and I do not question \nanybody's motives.\n  We have all talked about a balanced budget, and everybody has one in \ntheir hip pocket. But we have not passed any. We have passed ours and I \nbelieve we voted on the Democrats. The President vetoed a balanced \nbudget--another reason we need an amendment.\n  We are working on a balanced budget through the legislative process \nnow. In fact, I hope we can come to some conclusion on that and get it \ndone before the week is out.\n  There is a lot of talk in politics about children. There should be. \nThey are the future. And what we do here will have a direct impact on \nchildren, on their hopes and their aspirations. I think today's vote \ncertainly, talking about children, talking about their future, talking \nabout the opportunities they may have, ties it all together. Just \nmentioning children does not do much for children. Passing a balanced \nbudget amendment would. We would have a balanced budget. We would see \ninterest rates drop. We would see Government responding not to every \nspecial interest group but to the balanced budget amendment where we \nwould have to say, no, we cannot do it. And we would reorder some \npriorities around here. For all those who make speeches about the \nchildren and their future and crime and drugs and all the problems and \nall the temptations they have, here is an opportunity to stand up for \nchildren.\n  I have believed in this for a long time. Back in 1971 I started to \ntalk about a balanced budget amendment. And they are very difficult to \nput together. You can always find some reason to oppose it--do not \ninclude this, do not include that.\n  So we will have this vote. We will lose, but we will have made the \nstatement. That is the important thing. You made the statement. It will \nbe back next year.\n  Mr. President, perhaps no policy is more important to the economic \nfuture of all Americans and particularly to the future of our children \nthan a balanced budget. And that's why I believe there may be no more \nimportant issue for the U.S. Senate than whether we will finally pass \nthe balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  We take a lot of historical votes here in the Senate, but the vote on \nthe balanced budget amendment is one of the most important in decades. \nIt is a question of trust. Of whether we trust the people, of whether \nwe trust the Constitution, of whether we trust the States. And most \nimportantly, it is a question of whether future generations of \nAmericans can put their trust in us.\n  Will we follow the experience of 49 States that are required by law \nto balance their budgets? Do we trust the people to be able to have the \nright to ratify this amendment through their State legislatures in the \nprocess spelled out by the Constitution?\n  We had 67 votes then to make it a part of the Constitution, as \neverybody knows, it has to go to the States and be ratified by three-\nfourths of the States. A lot of us have talked about returning more \npower to the States, power to the people. Dust off the 10th amendment, \nwhich is 28 words in length, which says in effect, the powers not \ndelegated to the Federal Government by the Constitution nor denied to \nthe States belong to the States and to the people.\n\n[[Page S5902]]\n\n  So I have confidence in the people of Ohio, the legislators in \nKansas, Mississippi, Virginia, Utah, South Carolina, Oregon, North \nDakota, wherever. I have confidence in their judgment. So why not give \nthem an opportunity, those who are closer to the people, to make the \njudgment.\n  Ultimately, this is a question of our values as a nation. Which do we \nvalue more: The fleeting interests of the moment, or our economic \nfutures and destiny.\n  Last year the House of Representatives passed the balanced budget \namendment by a vote of 300 to 132--more than the two-thirds majority \nrequired by the Constitution. We then had several long weeks of debate \nhere in the Senate before the amendment narrowly failed on a vote of 65 \nto 35 on March 2, 1995.\n  We will shortly have our final vote on the motion to reconsider House \nJoint Resolution 1. The vote total may not change much today, but this \nvote is important to place us all on record with the American people on \nan issue of supreme importance to all Americans. So in a few minutes we \nwill have one last vote--one last chance--to do what's right, and send \nthe balanced budget amendment to the States for ratification.\n  When we debated the constitutional amendment last year, I quoted \nThomas Jefferson, who was so concerned about the ability of Democratic \nGovernment to control spending, that in 1789 he wrote:\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, morally bound to pay them \n     ourselves.\n\n  Jefferson's fears of 200 years ago are today's tragic reality. In \n1994, the Federal Government spent $203 billion in interest on the \nnational debt--more than it spent on education, job training, public \nworks, and child nutrition combined. In 1994, Americans paid an average \nof $800 per person in taxes just to service interest on the debt--not \nto pay off the debt or even to reduce the debt just to pay the interest \non the debt.\n  Some say deficits don't matter. But the fact is that the Federal \nbudget deficit is like a tax hike on working families, and one that \nbinds future generations of Americans exactly as Jefferson had warned.\n  The deficit drives up interest rates--and not by a little but by a \nlot. It is a stealth tax that every family with a home, every father \nand mother with a child in college, every young person who buys a car \nmust pay, and pay, and pay.\n  What does this stealth tax cost in dollars? Over $36,000 on a typical \nhome mortgage. More than $1,400 on an ordinary student loan. Nearly \n$700 on a typical car loan.\n  I know around this place we sometimes fail to understand there are \nreal people out there waiting for us to make responsible decisions. I \nhad an experience the other morning with the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, in Virginia, near Richmond. Because of a lack of $65 per \nmonth, this young couple and their young daughter, a baby, could not \nbuy the house they wanted. To us, $65 a month is $65 a month. To them, \nit was a matter of a home. And since the President vetoed the balanced \nbudget, interest rates have risen about one and a quarter percentage \npoints.\n  So that couple and another young man--we visited his home--he did not \nget the home he wanted, the one for $119,000. He took the one for \n$109,000 because of interest rates. So we can make all these great \nspeeches here that we want, but they are real people and they live in \nthe District, they live in our States, where 1 percent of interest rate \ndoes make a difference.\n  We simply cannot continue to mortgage America's future If we continue \ncurrent tax and spending policies, future generations will be saddled \nwith effective tax rates of more than 80 percent. Failure to stem the \nflow of red ink from Washington amounts to taxation without \nrepresentation on our children and grandchildren.\n\n  That's why the question before us today is, as Jefferson said, ``Of \nsuch consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles of \ngovernment.''\n  I don't think the balanced budget amendment is a partisan issue. Many \nDemocrats voted for the amendment last year and we'd certainly like to \nhave a couple more today.\n  It is not a partisan issue. I have said this publicly for a long \ntime. The leader of the balanced budget effort that I have known for a \nlong time is the Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, who is leaving \nthe Senate. You could vote either way if you are leaving and not worry \nabout it, but he is sticking with principle.\n  We are not going to change any votes because this is an election year \nand I happen to be the Republican candidate for President. I respect \nthose on the other side who feel they must reflect the views of the \noccupant of the White House, the President, on it.\n  We had several Senators who had voted for this before, six, in fact, \nwho switched their votes on March 2, 1995. In fact, we were counting \n70-some votes for the amendment.\n  Several Senators who changed their votes last year talked about a \nSocial Security firewall. We tried to reach out to those Senators to \nensure that Social Security surpluses can never again be used to mask \ndeficit spending. I believed that, after a suitable phase-in, the \nFederal budget could be balanced without counting the surpluses in the \nSocial Security trust funds.\n  I still hope that one or two of those six Senators who changed their \nvotes last year can come home again and support the balanced budget \namendment as they have in the past.\n  As I said, the question of whether we saddle posterity with our debts \ndoes not divide us along partisan lines--some Democrats have been a \npart of this effort from the beginning. But the balanced budget \namendment is a critical test of whether we are willing to be \nresponsible for our debts, and to be, in Jefferson's phrase, ``Morally \nbound to pay them ourselves.''\n  And here is where the President has lacked leadership--where it \nmatters most. Unlike his predecessors, he has opposed this amendment. \nThe White House lobbied furiously against it and rounded up enough \nsupport to defeat the amendment last year by one vote.\n  But we always can hope. And I am hopeful. If it does not happen \ntoday, it will happen maybe later this year. Maybe next year the White \nHouse will not lobby against it. Maybe somebody will be there to lobby \nfor it. Maybe we can find the votes, the three or four votes that we \nneed.\n  It is no small accomplishment that almost all of us in this Chamber \nnow agree that the budget should be balanced by the year 2002. That's a \nbig change since last March. It's not just Republicans saying it now, \nbut all of us--from Republicans to blue dog Democrats to the President. \nThat in itself is good news for America. Since we all agree that it \nshould be done by the year 2002, let's pass the amendment that requires \nthat we do it by the year 2002.\n  But talk is not enough. President Clinton had an opportunity to \ndemonstrate serious commitment for a balanced budget by urging his \nDemocratic colleagues to support this amendment. Make no mistake: \nPresident Clinton's opposition continues to be the single largest \nobstacle standing in the way of a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution that 83 percent of the American public want.\n  The Federal budget has not been balanced since 1969. Since that time, \nCongress has passed no less than seven different laws containing \nbalanced budget requirements.\n  But despite all the votes, all the speeches, and all the good \nintentions over the past quarter of a century, the Federal debt has \ngrown each and every year.\n  Last year we passed the first balanced Federal budget in a \ngeneration. But President Clinton vetoed it. The record of the past 25 \nyears is frustratingly clear: We simply cannot rely on statutory \nchanges to get the job done. We need the balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution to guarantee that the job gets done.\n  That's why I first introduced a balanced budget amendment back in \n1971. And that's why I know ultimately someday this amendment will \npass. Maybe not today. Today those of us who for years have been \nbattling for a balanced budget amendment may feel all too much like \nthat ancient Greek philosopher rolling the heavy rock up the hill just \nto have it roll back down again.\n\n[[Page S5903]]\n\n  It is like the line-item veto. It was never going to happen, but it \ndid, thanks to Senator McCain and Coats and others on the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  But this issue is the right one for America. And one day the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution will be passed in accordance with \nthe wishes of the overwhelming majority of Americans. As for today, at \nleast every American will know exactly where each and every one of us \nstands on the issue, and every American will know exactly where \nPresident Clinton stands on the issue.\n  In a few moments, Mr. President, we will have one last vote on \nwhether we can finally pass the balanced budget amendment and send it \nto the States for ratification. Remember, no single action here in the \nU.S. Senate is the end of the line.\n  The final decision about whether or not the balanced budget amendment \nwill go into effect rests with those outside Washington. The Founding \nFathers decided to give the ultimate authority over constitutional \namendments to those who are closest to the people--the men and women \nwho serve in State houses around the country.\n  Let's trust the States and put our faith in the American people. \nLet's go through the constitutional process that our Founding Fathers \nso wisely set up. There's a word for that process.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we knew this was a foregone conclusion. I \njust have to say that today the liberal politicians have won again, and \nthe American people have lost. We knew that was going to happen. We had \nno illusions about it. But it is simply amazing to me that, yesterday, \nsome on the other side spent time attacking Senator Dole, who sincerely \nhas brought this amendment to the floor on a number of occasions. The \nonly time it has ever been brought to the floor with a real chance of \npassing is when Republicans were in the majority of the U.S. Senate.\n  But what happened here is that some have tried to use this critical, \nhistorical debate, which will affect the future of our very children \nand grandchildren, for political ends and personal gain. I feel badly \nabout that. Some have used the phony excuse of protecting Social \nSecurity. Those protectors have now left Social Security and all of our \nsecurity open to the mercy of the big spenders.\n  Look at the current problems we face with Medicare. We said, a few \nyears back, that we had to do something to fix it. Really, there has \nbeen little or no effort by this administration to do it. We told them \nMedicare was going broke. They laughed. Now their people have confirmed \nthat we were right and they were wrong.\n  So when is the charade going to stop? When are the American people \ngoing to realize that the balanced budget amendment was defeated today \nbecause there are taxers and spenders here who do not want to be \nfiscally responsible? They won the day, and the American people, our \nchildren, and our grandchildren have lost.\n  Mr. President, I feel badly that we have lost this today. Knowing \nthat we were going to, it has been somewhat philosophically accepted. \nBut the fact is, it is not going to go away. We are going to have to \nput fiscal discipline into the Constitution if we ever want to get the \nspending practices under control. All Republicans but one voted for the \namendment, and we had 12 Democrats vote for the amendment. I am \npersonally grateful for those 12 Democrats who stood up and voted for \nthis amendment. It means a lot to me personally, but I think it means \nmore to the country. I hope that in the future we will get more on that \nside. This is the last chance to really keep America on sound fiscal \nfooting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5873-5", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5903-S5904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DIFFERENCES IN JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to talk about another matter very \nnear and dear to my heart. For some time now, I have been discussing \nthe differences in judicial philosophy between the judges selected by \nRepublican Presidents and the Presidents from the other side of the \naisle. These differences can have real and profound consequences for \nthe safety of Americans and their neighborhoods, homes, and workplaces. \nThese differences, I might add, have serious consequences.\n  During these various speeches that I have given, I called attention \nto certain Clinton judges who have long track records of being soft-on-\ncrime, liberal activists. One of these judges is Judge H. Lee Sarokin, \na Clinton appointee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. \nJudge Sarokin has displayed an undue and excessive sympathy for \ncriminals and is too willing to impose his own moral beliefs onto the \nlaw and onto our communities.\n  Judge Sarokin is the judge, this body may recall, who, before he was \nelevated by President Clinton to the third circuit, ruled that a \nhomeless man could not be barred from a public library because of his \nbody odor even though it was offending everybody in the library.\n  Judge Sarokin also issued several other activist decisions as a \ndistrict judge, including some released convicted murderers from jail. \nI opposed his elevation to the third circuit because I believed he \nwould continue his own special brand of judicial activism. My \nprediction has been proven true time and time again as Judge Sarokin \nvoted to aggressively expand double jeopardy and to overturn several \nmurderers' convictions.\n  This week Judge Sarokin informed President Clinton that he will \nretire at the end of July after 22 months as a circuit court of appeals \njudge. Judge Sarokin claimed that he was retiring because of the \ncriticism that I and others have made against his activist decisions.\n\n[[Page S5904]]\n\n  In his letter he wrote that he and others on the judiciary were being \n``Willy Hortonized.'' He went on to write, ``I regret that there are \nthose who are willing to sacrifice my life's work and reputation for \ntheir own political gain.'' Judge Sarokin also claimed that he ``had \nintended to remain on the court so long as I was fiscally and mentally \nable. But the constant politicization of my tenure has made that \nlifetime dream impossible for me.''\n  Give me a break. Mr. President, Judge Sarokin has illustrated once \nagain his failure to appreciate the proper role of a judge. As a \nsitting judge he has issued a partisan political screed. But the \npartisanship of Judge Sarokin's letter is also illustrated by what the \njudge fails to mention. As early as March 4, 1996, this year, it was \nreported that Judge Sarokin wished to take senior status and that he \nwanted to move to California so that he could be near his family. Yet \nthis fact is not mentioned by the judge in his letter to President \nClinton. According to a March 4 article in the New Jersey Law Journal \n``Sarokin confirmed through a secretary that he will take senior status \neffective September 1st.'' This article appeared long before my March \n29 floor speech which called attention to Judge Sarokin's activism on \nthe third circuit. In fact, in my speech, I mentioned the judge's plan \nto step down because it had already been announced and articulated. \nEssentially, Judge Sarokin had hoped that he could take senior status \nwhich would have reduced his workload to 25 percent of an active \njudge's caseload and move his chambers to California--In other words, \nfrom the third circuit on the east coast to California on the west \ncoast.\n  In other words, Judge Sarokin wanted quasi-retirement in California, \nthe State of his choice. Unfortunately for Judge Sarokin, his \ncolleagues on the third circuit were not thrilled with his early \nretirement plans, and on the 22d unanimously voted to deny Sarokin's \nrequest to move his chambers to California.\n  I take that out of the Recorder of May 6, 1996.\n  As one unnamed colleague on the court told a reporter, ``It took a \nlot of chutzpah for him to leave after only 22 months on the bench.'' \nBoy, do I agree with that statement. Former law clerks and colleagues \ntold the press that prior to the third circuit's decision Sarokin had \nalready sold his home in New Jersey--in short, prior to his stirring \nannouncement Judge Sarokin wanted to reduce his workload and was intent \non moving to California. Yet, Judge Sarokin failed to make any \nreference to this episode or these matters in his letter to President \nClinton. In fact, Judge Sarokin had the nerve to say that he ``had \nintended to remain on the court so long as he was physically and \nmentally able.'' Bear in mind his request to take senior status had \nbeen denied just 6 weeks ago. Perhaps Judge Sarokin thought he could \nescape scrutiny for this obvious lack of forthrightness.\n  Judge Sarokin's letter, its assertions as well as its omissions, \ndemonstrates how some view Federal judges as philosopher-kings whose \ndecisions and prevarications should never be challenged. I personally \ndo not hold this view, and I do not think anybody in this body does.\n  I have no ill feelings for Judge Sarokin personally, and I wish him \nmuch happiness in his retirement. But it should be pointed out that he \nserved darned little time on the third circuit Court of Appeals, and \nwill receive higher retirement because he went from the district court \nto the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. And we went through an awful \nsituation as he was elevated to that court. Mr. President, but I do not \nwish him any harm, and I wish him happiness in his retirement. But what \nis far more important at this point is not Judge Sarokin's retirement \nbut who will replace him.\n\n  The American people will decide this fall who will be our President, \nand along with that choice comes the choice of the President's judges. \nThe choice this fall will be between judges who will be tough on crime \nand judges who are softer on crime, judges who will apply the law and \nnot legislate from the bench, or judges like Lee Sarokin who have been \nactivists from the day they got on the bench.\n  Mr. President, I just want to mention one other thing. This week \nthere was the very important argument in the Supreme Court by the \nPresident's Solicitor----\n  I ask that we have order. This is very important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. This argument before the Supreme Court was made by the \nPresident's Solicitor General, who I know was pushed into this position \nby others who apparently have enough power in the Solicitor General's \nOffice beneath him to force him into this untenable situation.\n  No sooner--in a little over a month--after enacting the antiterrorism \nbill, with clearly the most part of that bill being habeas corpus \nreform, the Solicitor General walks into the Supreme Court and \nundermines that very reform, with an argument that would create a \ntremendous loophole, by hoping to convince the Supreme Court that they \ncan ignore Marbury versus Madison and grant themselves jurisdiction \nthat the Constitution does not grant and neither does the Congress. \nAnd, frankly, I could not believe it when I heard the Solicitor General \nmake the argument that he did. I feel badly that I did not argue for \nour side in Court but I just did not want to have it look like I was \ngrandstanding, or something like that.\n  The fact of the matter is that, if the Solicitor General's position \nis accepted, there will be a direct appeal to the Supreme Court \nmentioned nowhere in the Constitution, nowhere in statutory law because \nwe are not allowed under Marbury versus Madison to expand the \njurisdiction of the Supreme Court, or to detract from it. I will \nsurprised if the Supreme Court grants that. But there was not an \neffective argument in my opinion against that position in the Supreme \nCourt even though the law is pretty clear. The Constitution is clear. \nThat Marbury versus Madison, the all-time most important, or at least \none of the most important, Supreme Court cases is pretty clear. The \nresult and the effect of that argument by the Solicitor General was \nthat the Solicitor General sided with the convicted murderer in that \ncase, who is now 13 years in prison after he was condemned to death but \nthrough multiple habeas corpus appeals to the Court, and there is \nbasically no reason to believe that he is not the murderer, has avoided \nhis sentence. Naturally, every one of these murderers claim--not every \none, but a great many of them claim--they never did it. But the facts \nbespeak otherwise.\n  It was really something to watch the Solicitor General in there \narguing on behalf of the convicted murderer who has 13 years on death \nrow and multiple appeals. This is precisely what the President told me \nhe wanted to end, and I did end it while still protecting their \nconstitutional rights and giving them a direct appeal all the way up to \nthrough the State courts, a collateral habeas corpus appeal all the way \nup through the States courts, both of them all the way to the Supreme \nCourt, and then a full right to take a separate Federal habeas corpus \nappeal all the way up to the Supreme Court, and then a protective right \nby a three-judge circuit court of appeals panel, if they have newly \ndiscovered evidence that could not otherwise have been recently \nuncovered, or there is some retroactive opinion of the court that \napplies. That is what bothers me.\n  So who picks these judges and who picks these Solicitor Generals? Who \npicks leadership in anticrime in this next Presidential race is \nextremely important. I do not think you need a better example than Lee \nSarokin in this country today to show the importance of that particular \nchoice to all Americans, nor do I think you need a better prime example \nthan the Supreme Court argument of this administration and this \nSolicitor General before the Supreme Court this last week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5903-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5904-S5906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS--H.R. 3103 AND S. 1028\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I seek recognition to propound a unanimous-\nconsent request momentarily. I know the distinguished Democratic leader \nis\n\n[[Page S5905]]\n\nhere to respond. But I would like to just make some comments about why \nwe are doing this now and what we hope for.\n  First of all, this is with regard to the health insurance reform \nlegislation that passed the Senate by a vote of 100 to 0 on May 23, 2 \nfull weeks ago today, and yet we have not been able to appoint \nconferees. Now, we all know that conference activities have been \nunderway. There has been communication from both sides of the aisle, on \nboth sides of the Capitol, and I had the impression yesterday morning \nthat great progress had been made, that maybe we were close to an \nagreement on what would be in the conference report that would come out \nwith regard to health insurance reform.\n  But as a matter of fact, apparently that agreement has not been \nreached. I understand that perhaps the Senator from Massachusetts has \nhad a press conference within the last couple of hours being very \ncritical of what has transpired with regard to this issue, particularly \nas it applies to the medical savings accounts.\n  Conferences are where people give and take. Quite often you get part \nof what you wanted, not all of what you wanted, but I had the \nimpression that concessions had been made or indicated from the Senate \nthat were positive and from the House and that we were very close to an \nagreement, and yet it does not seem to have occurred. Yet we still have \nnot been able to get an agreement to actually have conferees appointed.\n  I do not understand that. I thought that once you pass a bill, you \ncommunicate across the aisle and you appoint conferees, go to \nconference, and they do the job. What has been suggested by the \ndistinguished majority leader is we have conferees appointed, \nappropriate ones after consultation with the Democratic leadership, \nfrom the Education and Labor Committee and from the Finance Committee, \nall those general matters within the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee, and also from the Judiciary Committee since in the House \nthey were going to have Judiciary Committee conferees with regard to \nmedical malpractice.\n\n  If we could surely agree on conferees and get the real conference \nunderway, I think everybody would like to see this issue agreed upon \nand resolved here in the next few days, hopefully.\n  So I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that notwithstanding the \nreceipt of the message from the House regarding the appointment of \nconferees with respect to H.R. 3103, the Senate insist on its amendment \nto H.R. 3103, the Senate agree to a conference with the House, and the \nChair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I share the view \nexpressed by the distinguished majority whip. There is no reason why we \ncannot resolve this matter. It was passed 100 to 0 on a bipartisan \nbasis. Unanimously, this Senate said this legislation should be passed.\n  Mr. President, that was over a month ago now. There is no reason why \nin a month's time we could not have negotiated successfully the \ndifferences with the House. That is all this has been about, finding a \nway with which to resolve our differences.\n  Now, I might tell the distinguished majority whip that it has been of \nincreasing concern to us that as these negotiations are going on, \nDemocrats have been excluded from the real conferencing and the \nnegotiations as they have gone on, and we do not understand why that \nwould have to be, why we cannot have bipartisan cooperation and \nconsideration of the problems that we are facing in both versions of \nthe bill.\n  To be locked out, in our view, is unacceptable. We also recognize--\nand I know that the distinguished majority whip recognizes as well--\nthat as you negotiate a conference with representatives for that \nconference, there has to be some accommodation on both sides of the \naisle with regard to the numerical representation as well as the \ncommittee representation. He knows very well that in this case that has \nnot been done. So we have not been able to come to some resolution with \nregard to this representation in the conference and so have been \nrelegated to these negotiations that have been ongoing.\n  We were told as late as yesterday that progress was being made, and \nit was for that reason I withheld offering a unanimous-consent \nagreement that I, frankly, believe we ought to put on record. There is \nno reason why we cannot restate the unanimity which we feel about this \nlegislation.\n  So having reserved the right to object, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1028, the \nKassebaum-Kennedy health care portability bill, the language of which \nwas passed by the Senate on April 23 by a unanimous vote, that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid \non the table.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. I object to that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could respond before Senator Daschle has \nan opportunity to respond to my unanimous consent, I have two points.\n\n  First, I want the record to be clear that a vote actually did occur \non April 23, not May 23, so it has been well over a month since that \naction occurred.\n  As to having Democrats involved in the negotiations, I believe that \nthey have been involved in talking back and forth, but the reason why \nthey have not been formally involved is because we have not been able \nto get an agreement to appoint conferees. That is the way it works. You \nappoint conferees and the conferees meet, Republicans, Democrats, \nHouse, Senate. That is the way to get an active, direct, normal, formal \nconference underway. Let us appoint conferees. Let them meet this \nafternoon and pass this thing out and then we can move it forward. We \nwould love to have Senator Kennedy, Senator Pell, Senator Moynihan, \nSenator Biden, or a different mix of Democrats on behalf of the Senate \nin a formal conference meeting with the House, and that is why we are \ntrying to seek this unanimous-consent request at this time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, again----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair understands that objection was heard \nto the unanimous-consent request of the minority leader. Unanimous \nconsent was not agreed to on the request of the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, again reserving the right to object, I \nyielded for purposes of response on the part of the distinguished \nmajority whip. But let me simply say that, unfortunately, it used to be \nthe case that Republicans and Democrats got together formally and \nresolved their differences in conference agreements. I would only cite \nas the most recent illustration of how that is no longer the case the \nbudget agreement. To my knowledge, not one meeting was held where \nDemocrats were included in that conference, not one. So I hope we can \nget back to the time when Democrats and Republicans can formally sit \ndown and work through all of these differences. That, in part, is what \nthis is all about. We want to get an agreement. We will continue to \noffer the original language to whatever legislation may be offered in \nour determination to get resolution of this issue. But we certainly \ncannot agree under these circumstances to the request propounded by the \nmajority at this time, so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is unclear. Does the minority leader \nobject?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I indicated I did object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to correct one thing that \nthe Senator said. As a matter of fact, no agreement has been reached on \nthe budget resolution conference report, and, in fact, I believe there \nwas a meeting of the conferees at 3 o'clock on Tuesday of this week. I \nassume there will be other meetings of the conferees. I am not a \nconferee on that budget conference, but I do know that they met, I \nbelieve, for about an hour or hour and a half on Tuesday of this week. \nWe hope they will meet again soon and get an agreement because we would \nlike very much, as I know the Senator, the Democratic leader, would, to \nhave that budget resolution conference report so we can get on with \nappropriations bills.\n\n[[Page S5906]]\n\n We hope to have it at the earliest opportunity next week, if not get \nan agreement today.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5904-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5906-S5907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO BLOCK HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to talk about this issue of naming \nconferees, and about the health care bill itself. I know many people \nthink that when we have these little confrontations it is just \npartisanship and that it does not mean anything, but I wanted today to \ntake a little time to talk about the real issue here and explain what \nit really means.\n  Let me begin by noting that the Senate passed a bill 44 days ago \nwhich would make health insurance permanent and portable, and which set \nout a procedure to try to make it easier for people to get and keep \ngood private health insurance. It was this little bill right here.\n  Now, 44 days ago, the distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, \ntried to appoint conferees to work out the differences between our \nhealth care reform bill and the health care reform bill that passed the \nHouse of Representatives, so that both Houses of Congress could then \nbring up and pass a final bill.\n  For 44 days, Senator Kennedy has objected, and for 44 days he has \ndenied working Americans the following provisions: No 1, an 80-percent \ndeduction for health insurance premiums that are paid by the self-\nemployed. This is a provision which is contained in the bill that we \npassed thanks to an amendment that was written and offered by Senator \nDole; No 2, the deductibility of long-term health insurance premiums; \nNo 3, the ability of people with terminal illnesses, with the \ncertification of a physician, to go ahead and collect their life \ninsurance--a very important provision for people who have AIDS; No 4, \nState-sponsored high risk insurance pools--that will help low-income \npeople who have high medical risks get health insurance in the State \nthey reside in; and, finally, No 5, the ability to, on a penalty-free \nbasis, draw money out of your IRA's, your individual retirement \naccounts, if you have high health insurance bills. These are things \nthat have been agreed to and these are things that, with certainty, \nwould happen if we passed this bill. But, for 44 days, the Democrats \nhave prevented us from going to conference and working out an agreement \nthat would let us pass this bill.\n\n  What does 80 percent deductibility of insurance premiums for the \nself-employed really mean? In the last year for which figures are \navailable, there were roughly 3 million Americans who had insurance \nthrough self-employment. They were allowed a 25 percent tax deduction \non the cost of that health insurance, even though, if they worked for \nsomebody else, it would be 100 percent deductible. So the 3 million \nAmericans who work for themselves had to pay 75 percent of their \ninsurance premium with after-tax dollars because the Tax Code \ndiscriminates against the self-employed. Again, in the last year for \nwhich figures are available, the average self-employed American, in \nbuying health insurance, got a deduction of $713. If we had passed this \nbill 44 days ago when we had a chance to go to conference and work out \nour differences, the average American who works for himself would \nultimately be able to deduct $2,283 for the payment of private health \ninsurance premiums. In other words, for over a month now, we have \ndelayed over $1,500 of savings to every self-employed worker in \nAmerica.\n  In addition, we now have in America over $1 trillion in individual \nretirement accounts or other forms of tax shelter. By allowing that \nmoney to be used to pay health insurance costs, when those costs exceed \n7.5 percent of your gross adjusted income, we would be liberating $1 \ntrillion of assets that could be used to help working Americans at a \ntime when not only has a rainy day arrived, but it is pouring cats and \ndogs as a result of exploding health insurance costs. Yet we have not \npassed any of these provisions because the Democrats have objected to \nnaming conferees. Well, why do we have a filibuster of a bill that the \nDemocrats, in huge numbers, support? Why is this happening? That is the \npoint I want to address right now.\n  The Democrats say they are filibustering this bill because they are \nopposed to medical savings accounts. They are fearful that medical \nsavings accounts will be in the final bill since the House of \nRepresentatives overwhelmingly adopted a provision that would permit \nAmericans, who freely choose to set up medical savings accounts, to do \nso on a tax exempt basis--and they object to this.\n  It is very interesting to note that this objection is a rather new \nphenomenon. In fact, some of the objectors have, in the past, been some \nof the strongest proponents of medical savings accounts. Let me quote \nSenator Daschle, the Democratic leader, who introduced a bill--which \ncontained medical savings accounts--with Senator Nunn, Senator Breaux, \nSenator Boren, and others. In a statement related to that bill here is \nwhat he said: ``We have introduced a bill * * * which would allow \nemployers to provide their employees with an annual allowance in a \n'medical care savings account' to pay for routine health care needs.'' \nThat was his position 2 years ago.\n  Let me quote the Democratic leader in the House, Dick Gephardt, who \nalso had a bill which contained medical savings accounts. He said, \ntalking about medical savings accounts, ``It's very popular. A lot of \npeople like that option and I think it will be in the final bill.'' \nThat is the final health care bill. ``I think it is a great option.'' \nThis was Dick Gephardt's position on medical savings accounts just 2 \nyears ago.\n  Even the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill endorses the idea of medical savings \naccounts. So why the change of heart? What has happened? The Democrats \nsay they discovered that medical savings accounts only help rich \npeople.\n\n  Well, let me read you some quotes from some of these supposedly rich \npeople who have medical savings accounts. This is an allegedly rich \nperson who is the political director of the United Mine Workers in \nIllinois. In writing to Senator Simon he said:\n\n       An amendment to the health care package has been offered to \n     add a medical savings account provision. The United Mine \n     Workers has a similar provision in our current contract that \n     is anticipated to produce significant savings versus our \n     previous insurance.\n\n  Let me read from another rich person who writes on behalf of medical \nsavings accounts. This is a part-time bus driver from Danville, OH who \nwrites:\n\n       Today I would like to appeal to President Clinton to please \n     support the medical savings account issue. Nearly 3 years ago \n     we went to a medical savings account plan and it has been \n     very helpful.\n\n  Why, all of a sudden, having introduced bills that provided for \nmedical savings accounts--why, all of a sudden, are people like Senator \nDaschle and Minority Leader Gephardt and other Democrats in Congress \nnow so adamantly opposed to medical savings accounts? Let me tell you \nmy theory as to why, all of a sudden, Democrats who have been for \nmedical savings accounts in the past are now so adamantly opposed to \nthem. I think that the discovery they made is not that medical savings \naccounts are for rich people, but rather their discovery is that \nmedical savings accounts give people freedom. They let people choose. \nThey empower people. Republicans are not trying to force Americans to \ntake medical savings accounts. We just want to allow them to do make a \nchoice without discriminating against them in the Tax Code.\n  Our Democratic colleagues oppose letting Americans have that choice \nbecause they do not want Americans to choose their own health care. \nThey want Government to choose. They claim they are for this little \nbill, but it is actually this big stack of bills that they support.\n  This is what they are for. This is what we have been debating over \nthe last 2 years--the Clinton health care bill and all of its \nderivatives. Our Democratic colleagues know that to let people choose \ntheir own health care means that Government cannot choose it for them. \nThe holding up of this bill and their new-found opposition to medical \nsavings accounts shows one thing very clearly: the Democrats do not \nwant families to choose, they want the Government to choose.\n  This little bill is not the health care bill they are for--this big \nstack of bills\n\n[[Page S5907]]\n\nis the health care bill they are for. They really believe that they \nwill get this big stack of health care bills someday, but only if they \ndo not give people the freedom to choose their own health care.\n  So why are we being held up? Why for 44 days have we not named \nconferees on a bill with provisions that virtually everyone says they \nare for? Remember, all 100 Members of the Senate voted for it. The \nreason is that the Democrats do not want people to have the freedom to \nchoose their own health care is because their real plan is not to make \ninsurance portable and permanent and it is not one that would empower \npeople to be efficient in buying health care through medical savings \naccounts. After all, that is what this bill and the House bill are \ntrying to do. The bill the Democrats long to get back to is a bill \nwhich is represented by all of the bills that we wisely rejected last \nyear. They want to get back to a bill where the Government, not the \nfamily, chooses.\n  The truly amazing thing is that Senator Kennedy today had a press \nconference attacking Senator Dole for holding up a bill that he, \nSenator Kennedy, has been filibustering for 44 days. For 44 days, \nSenator Kennedy has stood up and objected to naming conferees, and then \ntoday he attacks Bob Dole for holding up an agreement?\n  But why has Senator Kennedy objected? He has objected because he \nrejects the right of people to choose. He rejects the right of \nindividual citizens to decide whether they want low-deductible health \ninsurance or high-deductible health insurance. Further, he rejects the \nright of those who choose high-deductible health insurance to put the \nsavings into a medical savings account which they can use to pay those \ndeductibles tax free or which, if they do not use it for that purpose, \nis available to send their children to college, to make a downpayment \non a new home, or to start a new business. Senator Kennedy and the \nDemocrats do not want people to have that right to choose, because deep \ndown in their hearts, they want the Government to choose.\n  This is the health care plan they are for--it is not the health care \nplan that we debated this year. The Democrats know if we get medical \nsavings accounts, if families have an incentive to be cost conscious, \nif families have the right to choose their own health care, that this \nwill work, and it would mean that they never get the opportunity to \nhave these health care purchasing collectives where Government would \nmake the decisions.\n  So I simply want to remind my colleagues, when the minority leader or \nSenator Kennedy stands up and objects to naming conferees, what they \nare really objecting to is freedom. They are really objecting to the \nright of people to choose--they do not want people to have a right to \nchoose, because they want Government to choose.\n  That is what this debate is about. Do you want Government to run the \nhealth care system, or do you want family choice to dominate the health \ncare system?\n  To me, that is a very easy question to answer. And let me note the \ndifference between what the Democrats are doing this year and what I \ndid last year--just in case our colleague from Massachusetts should \ncome over and say, ``Well, here is Phil Gramm, he held up the Clinton \nhealth care bill in 78 days of debate.'' Yes I did. It was God's work \nand I expect to be remembered for it when I get to the golden gates, \nbut I never denied it. I never stood up and said, ``This is a great \nbill the President has proposed. These are wonderful ideas. I'm for it, \nbut I'm just not going to let you pass it.''\n\n  I said over I am not going to let you pass this, except over my cold, \ndead political body. This is not what Senator Kennedy is saying. \nSenator Kennedy says he is for this bill, yet he is not allowing us to \nname conferees because he does not want people to be free to choose. He \nwants the Government to choose. This is what the debate is about--\nfreedom--and I wanted to come over today to be sure that people \nunderstood with certainty what we are talking about. I want them to \nunderstand that the Republicans want families to choose, the Democrats \nwant the Government to choose, and that this is about as big a \ndifference as you can have in the world.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5906-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5907-S5908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EXTRA, EXTRA--``READ ALL ABOUT IT''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 2 days ago, I spoke proudly of my \nState's 150th birthday celebration this year and also the Smithsonian \nInstitution's cooperation with that effort. By the way, the Smithsonian \nInstitution happens to be 150 years old as well this year, and they are \ncelebrating that anniversary throughout the year. But for 2 weeks, \nbeginning on June 26, there is going to be a celebration of my State on \nThe Mall. Specifically, though, on June 26 there will be a birthday \nparty for Iowa from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. in the Centennial Building on The \nMall across from the Smithsonian castle.\n  I hope that Americans will come to see, over the course of those 2 \nweeks, demonstrations about Iowa industry, Iowa agriculture, Iowa \neducation, Iowa history, culture--everything--that will be on display \nthere.\n  I announced that I was going to speak a little bit and shortly every \nday on a certain aspect of Iowa.\n  I want to make reference to spreading the spirit of Iowa. As I talk \nabout the Iowa spirit, I will talk about the role of weekly and daily \nnewspapers throughout the history of Iowa, my State.\n  So it is time to say, ``Extra, extra--read all about it.''\n  Mr. President, Iowa celebrates its 150-year-old heritage this year. \nAnd at the end of this month and during the first week of July, Iowa \nwill participate at the Festival of American Folklife on our National \nMall to showcase our folks and way of life. Billing the celebration as \n``Iowa--Community Style,'' hundreds of Iowans and Iowa natives will \npitch in to spread the sesquicentennial spirit to more than a million \nvisitors.\n  Of course, Iowa's story of community wouldn't be complete without \nsharing a vital and continuing chapter integral to community life in \nIowa. Iowa's first newspaper started in Dubuque when the Dubuque \nVisitor issued its premiere edition on May 11, 1836. And Iowa's longest \nrunning newspaper continues to roll off the presses each day in \nsoutheast Iowa. The Burlington Hawkeye's first edition dates back \nprestatehood, to July 10, 1837. To this day, the local newspaper office \nremains an important hub of activity on Main Street in Iowa's 99 county \nseats and surrounding communities. More than 340 hometown weekly and \ndaily newspapers currently report local events in Iowa.\n  As you may know, Iowa consistently ranks at the top in literacy and \nother tests of scholastic achievement. Perhaps it's no small wonder \nthat my State also holds the highest per capita number of newspapers in \nthe country. Just take one county in Iowa, as an example. Situated on \nthe banks of the Missouri River in northwest Iowa, Sioux County has a \npopulation of about 30,000 people and boasts no less than seven \npublished newspapers each week. Known to be well-read, Iowans are \nserious about keeping abreast of current affairs in our local, national \nand international communities.\n  In fact, an international venture between Iowa media outlets and \nforeign journalists started 3 years ago. The International Center for \nCommunity Journalism, based in Grinnell, IA, has helped to match \njournalists from the Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Mongolia, and \nThailand with more than 30 newspapers in Iowa. Iowa families open up \ntheir homes for 2 or 3 months while the visiting journalist works at \ntheir local newspapers.\n  Many times, Iowa journalists and journalism educators will \nreciprocate the stay in the foreign country. This exchange of \ninformation, culture, and talent has helped to spread the Iowa spirit \nand a vital understanding of the importance of a free press in a \ndemocratic society. The program soon will\n\n[[Page S5908]]\n\ninclude journalists from Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, the \nPhilippines, Singapore, and Vietnam.\n  Without a doubt, Iowans have grown to depend on their hometown papers \nfor school news, high school sports coverage, business items, local \ngovernment and politics, community announcements, and human interest \nstories. Typical of any endeavor in my State, be it enterprise, \neducation or entertainment, newspapers in Iowa place great emphasis on \nquality. Combining news reporting and advertising, the local newspaper \nis a constant and reliable source for the community.\n  The Iowa Newspaper Association each year awards top honors to \nnewspapers in Iowa for general excellence; for delivering the best \neditorial, front, sports, and feature pages; for best coverage of local \ngovernment, agriculture, and education; and, for overall community \nservice.\n  Merchants and shopkeepers on Main Street rely on the local newspaper \nto advertise upcoming sales and promotions. And readers pay close \nattention to the ads.\n  For sure, Iowa's hometown newspapers wouldn't miss this once-in-one-\nhundred-and-fifty-years-opportunity to help spread Iowa's spirit. \nVisitors to the cafe on The National Mall will find a grand newspaper \nstand displaying many of Iowa's hometown papers. You can discover for \nyourself a trove of Iowa's ink in the Herald, Journal, Gazette, Review, \nLeader, Express, Record, Bee, Chronicle, Register, Times, and Courier, \njust to name a few. I would encourage those who plan to celebrate with \nIowa--community style, to stop by and ``read all about it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5907-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE LEGEND OF KATE SHELLEY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it may have started out like a normal \nday, but July 6, 1881, did not end in a typical manner. In the late \nafternoon, around suppertime, a terrifying storm struck central Iowa. \nIt was a terror. Sensible people stayed indoors away from its wrath and \nfury. Creeks and streams became full to overflowing with the rainwater \nas the storm raged on.\n  Then there was a crash. It was heard by a family living close to one \nof the rain soaked creeks and the railroad bridge which crossed it. \nWith that crash a young 15-year-old Iowa girl from Moingona stepped \nfrom obscurity into legend.\n  As H. Roger Grant wrote in ``The Palimpsest,'' ``the courage of Kate \nShelley rightfully deserves to be remembered.'' For on that night she \nbravely faced her destiny.\n  Engine No. 11 was checking the Chicago & North Western Rail Road line \nfor storm damage when it plunged into Honey Creek. The water was deep \nand the current was fast. The crewmen on that train needed help, and \nKate Shelley knew she had to give that help. Putting all thoughts of \npersonal safety aside, she went out into the storm. As she later said, \n``The storm and all else was forgotten and I said that I must go to \nhelp the men, and to stop the passenger (train) that would soon be due \nat Moingona.''\n  Kate put together a lamp with a wick made from an old felt skirt. \nAgain in her own words, ``(I) started out into the night and the storm, \nto do what I could, and what I though was my duty, knowing that Mother \nand the children were praying to God to keep me from every harm.'' \nKate's father, who had been an employee of the Chicago & North Western, \nhad died some 3 years before.\n  Upon reaching the wreckage, Kate found that of the four-man crew, \nonly two had survived. One clung to a tree and the other to tree roots \nas the deadly waters of Honey Creek swirled around them. Kate saw one \nof the men in the flashes of lightning. He shouted at her and she at \nhim, but the noise of the storm was go great to be hearing each other \nwas impossible.\n  Let me again turn to Mr. Grant's ``Palimpsest'' article,\n\n       Shelley (then) began the most perilous portions of her \n     trek. Crossing the Des Moines River bridge, even in ideal \n     conditions, was dangerous. The North Western had studded the \n     ties along this 673-foot-long span with twisted, rusty spikes \n     to discourage trespassers. And the ties themselves were \n     spaced a full pace apart. `I got down upon my hands and \n     knees, . . . and guided myself by the stretch of rail, I \n     began the weary passage of the bridge,' explained Shelley. `I \n     do not know how long I was in crossing, but it seemed an age. \n     Halfway over, a piercing flash of lightning showed me the \n     angry flood more closely than ever, and swept along upon it a \n     great tree, the earth still hanging to its roots, was racing \n     for the bridge and it seemed for the very spot I stood upon.' \n     Added Shelley, `Fear brought me up right on my knees, and I \n     clasp my hands in terror, and in prayer, I hope, lest the \n     shock should carry out the bridge. But the monster darted \n     under the bridge with a sweeping rush and his branches \n     scattered foam and water over me as he passed.\n\n  Kate Shelley made it across that bridge and to the station at \nMoingona. There she found that the North Western had already stopped \nthe eastbound passenger train. But that was not the end of her perilous \nnight nor of her heroism. Those two men were still clinging to life in \nthe tumultuous waters of Honey Creek. A relief locomotive was sent with \nKate as the guide. Engineer Edward Wood and brakeman Adam Agar were \nsaved.\n  Kate Shelley is an American hero for the ages. She is as much of a \nrole model for all of us today and for our children's children's \nchildren, as she was to her contemporaries.\n  Kate Shelley did not have to go out into that ferocious storm in the \nmiddle of the night in 1886. But she did. She knew that her actions \nwould make a difference. Her actions would help people she did not \nknow, but that she never the less cared for. Her actions would help to \nprevent destruction, injury, and death. Her selfless actions would save \ntwo lives. What an example for all Americans to follow.\n  Mr. Grant quotes several contemporary newspaper accounts of the night \nin his article. One states,\n\n       Ed Wood says he was well nigh overjoyed when he saw the \n     light approaching the clearing near the end of the bridge, \n     and that he will never forget the sight of Kate Shelley \n     making her way over the twisted and broken trestle work to \n     the last tie yet hanging over the wreck in the boiling flood \n     below.\n\n  Another newspaper wrote Shelley crossed the Des Moines River bridge,\n\n       . . . with nothing but the ties and rails (with) the wind \n     blowing a gale, and the foaming, seething waters beneath. Not \n     one man in five hundred (would) have (gone) over at any \n     price, or under any circumstance. But this brave, noble girl, \n     with the nerve of a giant, gathering about her, her flowing \n     skirts, and on hands and knees she crawled over the long \n     weary bridge.\n\n  Yesterday I said that the Iowa spirit was almost too big to describe. \nIt is. But I think that I can in all honesty say the spirit of Kate \nShelley is the spirit of Iowa. And it is a part of the American spirit, \nthe spirit of helping others in a time of need and danger without \nexpecting something for yourself. I hope that all of us can learn from \nthis brave young woman's example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5908-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5908-S5910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for some time now, and on more than one \noccasion, there has been an effort to clear a number of judicial \nnominees that have been pending on the calendar awaiting action. As a \nmatter of fact, there are now 17 such judicial nominations that are on \nthe Executive Calendar. Some of them date back as far as December 1995. \nThe latest group that was reported from the Judiciary Committee to the \nSenate came on May 9.\n  Now, on each occasion when there has been sort of an agreement worked \nout that one, two, three, or four judges could be cleared and moved, \nthere have been objections to those. I know the majority leader would \nvery much like to be able to move as many as possible of these judicial \nnominations. He said so publicly. He has been working on it today. I \nknow he will continue to work to find what problems might exist and see \nif more could be approved. He will continue to do that. On his behalf, \nas the majority whip, I will do all I can do.\n  I feel like while it might be ideal under some conditions to some \npeople to get them all done at once, under Senate prerogatives every \nSenator can raise concerns about a nominee for a variety of reasons--\ntheir qualifications for the job and other considerations. But I think \nif we cannot get them all done, we need to start moving down the road. \nYou get as many as you can, and you come back and work some others.\n  I know there are a number of judges that Members of the minority \nparty support and would like to get approved. Some of these that were \nrecommended\n\n[[Page S5909]]\n\nby Democrats are also supported by Republicans. We should continue our \neffort to show that we can move these nominations. We are getting to \nthat point in the year where it will get more and more difficult.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations en \nbloc on today's Executive Calendar: Calendar No. 511, Joseph Greenaway \nof New Jersey; Calendar No. 514, Gary Fenner of Missouri; Calendar No. \n591, Walker Miller of Colorado; and Calendar No. 575, Charles Clevert, \nJr., of Wisconsin.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed en \nbloc; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc; that \nany statements relating to the nominations appear at the appropriate \nplace in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the \nSenator's actions; and the Senate then return to legislative session.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, I ask the acting leader \nabout another nominee that was considered before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, reported out favorably, I believe the date was April 25, and \nhas been on the calendar for some time now, and who is strongly \nsupported by the people of Montana and for whom I have heard no \nobjection, no substantive objection whatever. His name is Don Molloy. \nMight I ask if Don Molloy might be added to that list and included in \nthe acting leader's request?\n  I say that in part, Mr. President, because there have been no judges \nconfirmed in this session of Congress--none. I might say that many \njudges were referred by a Democratic-controlled Senate in years when \nthere were Republican Presidents. I might say, for example, in 1992, \nthis Senate confirmed 66 district and circuit court judges. I might \nadd, none has been brought up or passed by this body in this session of \nthis Congress. In 1988, the Senate confirmed 42 district circuit judges \nfor President Reagan. I could go on down the list. I will not take the \nSenate's time.\n\n  As the Senator from Mississippi said, there are now 17 judges on the \ncalendar, far short of the 66 and 42 that were passed in previous \nyears. This is already June. I do not know how many more days this \nSenate will be in session this year. I ask, basically, why not all the \n17 that are on the calendar? There is no reason why they should not be \nadded.\n  Specifically, I inquire about Don Molloy, who has been nominated by \nthe President and has been reported out favorably by the Judiciary \nCommittee, has been on the calendar, for, gosh, over a month, why his \nname cannot also be added to that list.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator would yield under his reservation for me to \nrespond to his questions, we have tried on other occasions, at least \ntwo that I am personally familiar with, to move a grouping of these \njudicial nominations. I think on one occasion it was not even this same \nfour. There may have been a different one that was considered on this. \nIt was objected to by Members of the minority party. So we have been \ntrying to move some of these judges that we could get approved through \nthe process. Some of them were objected to on the Senator's side, as \nyou have done--or as you are apparently prepared to do today--and \nothers have objected to other judges. We cannot get them all cleared \nright now. We would like to get the ones we can get cleared done, and \ncome back again later, as we work through this list.\n\n  Now, in regard to your specific nomination, we were not able to get \nthat cleared today. There have been some reservations or objections \nraised. We are continuing to explore that. I do not personally know \nwhat the reasons are, or how many objections there are. But I plead \nwith the Senator from Montana, once again. These four have been \ncleared. Hopefully, we can get an agreement on more--perhaps even \nwithin the next few days. But if we do not break this down and start \ngetting some approved, the whole thing stays dammed up.\n  So any one Senator might have a judge on the list of 17, and his one \njudge may not be qualified, or may have some sort of a judicial problem \nbased on his experience, or there may be some personal problem. As a \ngeneral rule, if any Senator says a judge or a judicial nominee is \npersonally repugnant to that Senator, that carries great weight around \nhere.\n  So is the Senator saying today that until we can get all 17, we will \nget none of them? Any one Senator can walk in here and say, ``I object \nto that group unless my judge is on there.'' I am trying, on behalf of \nthe majority leader, to say, let us get started. These four have been \ncleared. Let us do these four, and maybe there will be another four. \nBut you cannot say to the Republicans, ``Well, there have not been any \ndone this session,'' if they are being objected to by Democrats. Let us \nget started. I have told the Senator that I am willing to work and see \nwhat the problems are, and maybe they are problems that can be worked \nout. I cannot make a commitment on how that would be done, or when it \nwill be done. But I am prepared to get into it as much as I can, within \nmy role as it is, and see what the problems are.\n  Please consider moving these. These are judges that have been \napproved, that we can clear and move today off the calendar--\nnominations recommended by Senator Bradley of New Jersey, Senator Kohl, \nand I am not even quite sure who made the recommendation on the judge \nfrom Missouri or the one from Colorado. I presume they have broad \nbipartisan support in those respective States, even though those States \ndo not have a Democratic Senator. Let us do these and see what else we \ncan do.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, with some bemusement, I listen to my good \nfriend from Mississippi. When a vacancy occurred in Montana for a \nFederal district court judge, I saw this as an opportunity to find the \nbest person in the State of Montana for this position. This is one \npower, one thing that a U.S. Senator can do--that is, to recommend to \nthe President of the United States who the President might, in turn, \nnominate to a Federal district court judgeship.\n  I took this very, very seriously. I sat down and surveyed the State \nof Montana to determine who I regarded as the best, the brightest, the \nmost thoughtful persons--Republicans and Democrats, just good \nthoughtful people--and put together a nominee commission. I called each \nof them up personally--six, seven, or eight of the best Montana minds \nand the most thoughtful persons in the State of Montana, Republicans \nand Democrats--and asked if they would serve. They all said they would \nlove to. I said to each of them, ``I would like you to nominate or \nrecommend to me the best people in our State.'' I said precisely, ``I \nam not carrying water for any Republicans, any Democrats, liberals or \nconservatives; it makes no difference. I want the best.'' My \ncommission, my group, then nominated three different people whom they \nregarded as the best people in Montana to serve in this position as a \nFederal district court judge. I then sat down with each of the three, \ninterviewed each of the three for hours. I then called my group again \nand asked their opinions. I talked to all the Federal judges in \nMontana, all the State district court judges in Montana, and I asked \ntheir views.\n\n  I can tell you that Don Molloy is the top choice in the State of \nMontana for this position--by Republicans and by Democrats. There is \njust no denying that.\n  I say, in addition, to my good friend from Mississippi, that they \nneed to have this position filled. That is because there is going to be \na backlog in our State in the Federal district courts. Why? Basically, \nbecause of the unfortunate problems with the alleged Unabomber in \nMontana, and the Freemen are causing all kinds of problems in our \nState, which is putting an additional pressure on the law enforcement \npersonnel in our State. Many of those actions will be in Federal \ndistrict court.\n  So I ask my good friend from Mississippi why Don Molloy's name cannot \nbe added to the list of four. I am personally not pleading for all 17 \non the calendar. But I make a very reasonable suggestion to add one \nmore to the list of four--that is, Don Molloy.\n  I have heard no substantive objection. I have heard no objection to \nhim. He passed the committee. I believe that these nominees, to avoid \nthis deadlock, probably should be brought up on the floor one by one \nand let Senators speak in favor or against the\n\n[[Page S5910]]\n\nnominees. Let them stand up and say what they think. Let them vote the \nway they want to vote. I might say to my very good friend from \nMississippi that my colleague, Senator Burns, a Republican from the \nState of Montana, supports this nominee. He supports this nominee. If \nyou have bipartisan support for our nominee, Don Molloy, I see no \nreason why he should not be added to that list of four.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there has been objection to this point to \nthis particular nominee. I do not know him. I do not know his record. I \nam not on the Judiciary Committee. I can only say that we have not been \nable to get any other than these four approved to this point. Maybe \nthere is some problem there. I do not know. Maybe there is not.\n  I can sympathize with the Senator, because I remember one time that \nmy State of Mississippi agreed to go along with a nominee from \nLouisiana, who was particularly well qualified to be a member of the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals--basically, a Mississippi position. \nBecause there was such a uniquely qualified nominee, a former \nCongressman and Governor that we withheld with the insistence that it \nbe a nominee from our State. So that nomination went forward, and then \nit languished, and it laid there, and it seemed to be objected to. \nFinally, the term ended, or that session of the Congress, whatever that \nwas--maybe the 98th session. At any rate, there was never \nan explanation of what the problem was. There was an objection by the \nDemocrats to this fine man, who clearly had judicial temperament, was \nhighly rejected, ethical, a former Congressman and Governor and, yet, \nit just stayed there and never was considered.\n\n  So I understand how the Senator feels about this. But it is a unique \nthing to the Senate to make the recommendations to Presidents for the \nFederal district judges, as well as appellate courts, even though \nappellate courts are treated a little differently than Federal district \njudges. It is also a unique Senate prerogative to have an objection to \na judge. Obviously, it can come from some other State, some member of \nthe Judiciary Committee--who knows? Sometimes it is very difficult to \nfind out exactly what the problem is. But they have a way, in many \ninstances, of working themselves out.\n  Again, the majority leader has said to the minority leader that he \nwould like to move as many of these as possible.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I can help the Senator move one more right now. That is \nmy suggestion. That is helping the leader. He can move one more.\n  Mr. LOTT. We do not have that one cleared and the other 12. But we do \nhave four cleared. When those are done, we will try some others. I make \none last plea to the Senator. I believe that if he would let these four \ngo, it would help break down the dike, and we would see others move.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my very good \nfriend. We simply have heard no good reason why Don Molloy should not \nbe on the calendar.\n  It is with great reluctance that I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa \nfor allowing us to have this exchange in an effort to try to clear some \njudicial nominations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5908-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, earlier today the Senate Finance \nCommittee heard testimony on the issue of most-favored-nation trade \npolicy for China. As you know Mr. President, the President of the \nUnited States, President Clinton, on May 20 announced that China would \nbe granted most-favored-nation status for another year. This is an \nannual determination made in the case of China. For the other 100 and \nsome nations that have most-favored-nation trade status with us it is \nmore on a permanent basis. It does not have to be annually like it is \nfor China.\n  I might say, too, for the benefit of my colleagues that there are \nonly about five or six countries that would be called major trading \npartners, or potential major trading partners that do not have most-\nfavored-nation status. So I am not sure that the terminology is very \ngood when it really kind of refers to normal trading status between the \nUnited States and any other country. But it has been titled like this \nfor decades. So it sounds like maybe really more than what it really \nis. But the President made that decision.\n  I wanted to announce my support of the President's decision. So we \nare going to enter a period of time here where Congress debates whether \nor not the President is right to have granted most-favored-nation \nstatus to China, and also we will do that through a resolution of \ndisapproval of the President's action. So if the resolution of \ndisapproval does not pass the Congress then, of course, the President's \nactions will stand. If it would pass Congress by a majority vote but \nthe President would veto, which you would assume that he would, then \npresumably unless there are votes to override--which means two-thirds \nmajority--that the President's action would still stand.\n  So I think it is fair to assume that regardless of the annual \nexercise we go through, regardless of the motion of disapproval being \napproved, in the final analysis there will not be a two-thirds vote to \noverride the President's actions. So China will have most-favored-\nnation status for another year.\n  I personally believe--and I support, of course--that the President's \ndecision should and will be upheld. But there is a lot of sentiment \nagainst China on Capitol Hill, and recent developments in our \nrelationship with China has not helped China's chances of success in \nfighting the motion of disapproval.\n  Most recently on trade issues in regard to China our United States \nTrade Representative announced sanctions against China to the tune of \n$2 billion. These sanctions will take effect on June 17 unless China \ncomes into compliance with the bilateral agreement on intellectual \nproperty rights that was reached in 1995. In response to our own \nGovernment's announcement of sanctions against China, they in turn said \nthat they would levy 100 percent tariffs on many U.S. exports. These \ninclude agricultural products such as cotton, beef, chicken, and \nvegetable oils.\n  So it appears that we could be on the verge of a trade war with one \nof our major agricultural export markets. I want to reflect on this \nissue by briefly discussing how we got into this position, and what it \nmeans for China's chances on MFN.\n  Mr. President, as you know, the Clinton administration's position on \nhow to deal with China has never been very clear. In fact, I suppose \nyou could put it in a class with a lot of other issues that the \nPresident has taken positions on in the past. He has changed his view \non this one as well.\n\n  In addition, since he has been President, I can say he has had no \nlong-term view on what a relationship with China ought to be. Some have \nsaid that the President seems to make policy according to the last \nperson he has spoken to on a given day. That has been a very general \ncomment about the President. But it is one, if you look at specific \nactions on China, that I think you can apply even more specifically to \nour China policy.\n  In 1992, when he was a Presidential candidate, Bill Clinton harshly \ncriticized the Bush administration for being soft on human rights in \nChina. Candidate Clinton vowed at that time to condition China's most-\nfavored-nation status on--these are his words--``respect for human \nrights, political liberalization, and responsible international \nconduct.''\n  That is what the President said was wrong with President Bush's \nposition on China.\n  Just 2 years later, President Clinton favored separating human rights \nfrom most-favored-nation status, and he favored that year granting \nChina MFN status, as the Bush administration had done, and as the \nReagan administration had done. And it even goes back beyond that.\n\n[[Page S5911]]\n\n  While the President was changing his mind, there was not any evidence \nwhatsoever that China had altered its behavior to satisfy President \nClinton's very own standards that he had enunciated in 1992 on the \nissue of MFN. Recently the contradictions and rhetoric have become more \npronounced, and the consequences even more important.\n  Our lack of a tough and clearly defined policy toward Beijing has \ncreated a new atmosphere in China. It is an atmosphere in which China \ndecided that it can ignore its responsibilities to the world community.\n  So my question to you is this: Does this administration have \ncredibility in dealing with China? I think that lack of credibility is \npart of the reason that we have problems not only with our government \ntoward China but also within the United States of whether or not our \npolicy toward China is right. This constant changing of policy does not \nsend a very clear signal to the American people of the benefits of MFN, \nor the importance of continuing MFN for China. You see some of this in \nChina's action--its attempt to intimidate Taiwan prior to its election \nthrough so-called military exercises. China has allegedly sold nuclear \nmaterials to Pakistan, but denies knowledge of doing so. Now it has \nblatantly violated its intellectual property rights agreement with the \nUnited States. Do you think that China would behave in this manner if \nthey really took the President's rhetoric seriously? Our own United \nStates Trade Representative has announced sanctions due to China's \nbreach of the intellectual property rights agreement. I support these \nsanctions, and I have not found any opposition to these sanctions. The \ncredibility of the United States and our ability to enforce future \nagreements would be very much on the line and questioned if we did not \nimpose these sanctions. However, if we had had a more consistent policy \ntoward China in the last few years, I think this situation on the \nintellectual property rights could have been avoided. Unfortunately, \nCongress will have to debate China's most-favored-nation status with \nits looming trade dispute as a backdrop. For many Members it will be \ndifficult to go home and justify voting for MFN while China openly \nviolates existing trade agreements. So I am afraid that the vote may be \nvery close.\n  Mr. President, it is important to consider the implications of not \nextending most-favored-nation status at this time.\n  In 1995, United States exports to China totaled about $12 billion. \nThose exports would be jeopardized. Tariffs on products coming into the \nUnited States from China would also be raised significantly. This \namounts to a tax, of course, on our American consumers, so American \nbusinesses and consumers will suffer.\n  The MFN debate is no ideological exercise. It affects business. It \naffects jobs for Americans. It affects consumer costs. So we are \ntalking about pocketbook issues in dealing with MFN. There is at least \none area that will suffer if MFN is revoked. It is of interest to my \nState of Iowa. That is agriculture. Those of us from agriculture States \nknow how especially important this debate is. It is very important.\n  Is the Chair speaking of the 10-minute thing?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thought I yielded to the speaker without losing my \nright to the floor; I was protected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Unanimous consent was granted.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. OK. Then I should have objected to the unanimous \nconsent request. But the unanimous consent overrode the unanimous \nconsent I had to have my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is true.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Those of us from agriculture States especially know how \nimportant the debate on MFN is. China has a population of 1.2 billion, \nwhich is one-fifth of the world population, but it has only 7 percent \nof the world's arable land. So China will continue to import large \namounts of its food needs. The good news for the American farmer is \nthat the diet of the Chinese people is changing rapidly. Meat \nconsumption is growing 10 percent per year there, or a staggering 4 \nmillion tons annually. So value-added exports will play a very \nimportant role in China's future and in the agricultural exports of our \ncountry to China.\n  The potential for growth over the coming decades is extremely high. \nWe are going to have a 75-percent increase of exports to Asia, and 50 \npercent of that increase by the year 2000 is going to be with China. So \nby the year 2030 this is going to be a very important market for \nAmerica and particularly for American agricultural.\n  It also relates very well with our new farm program. This program \nwill have a declining amount of appropriations for agriculture to a \nphaseout by the year 2002. So farmers will earn more from the \nmarketplace, and our ability to export is very important in \naccomplishing this. China, of course, will play a very important role \nin these exports.\n  So I think our policy toward China must be one of aggressive \nengagement. We need to continue to negotiate agreements with the \nChinese on trade and other matters as well. We must work to bring China \ninto the world community of nations, and I believe that these actions \nwill ultimately bring about real reform within China. Granting most-\nfavored-nation status should be a part of that policy.\n  We had a debate in the Finance Committee a few weeks ago about how \nmisleading the term MFN is. It is not something special. As I have \nalready said, it is something that is granted to all but a handful of \nnations. But with that said, we must still vigorously enforce all of \nour agreements with China. Trade agreements are not worth the paper \nthey are written on if we are afraid to take appropriate measures of \nenforcement.\n  There is a real old saying in the Western United States of ``keep \nyour door unlocked, but if you do, keep a shotgun behind the door.'' I \nthink that is how I see our activities with China. You have to be open \nwith them, but we have to be prepared to make sure that they stick to \nthe agreements as well. So we have the WTO accession negotiations with \nChina coming up. That gives us an opportunity to discuss with the \nChinese all of the concerns raised in the MFN debate. We can also use \nthe imposition of 301 sanctions to accomplish our goal.\n\n  That is a much better environment than the MFN debate for bringing \nChina to the table and around to the international norms that they say \nthey agree with, the international norms of trade agreements being \nfollowed, the international norms of human rights that are in the \nUnited Nations Charter, the international norms of rule of law, and you \ncan name a lot of others. China says that they accept them. A lot of \npeople who do not want MFN status say since China does not meet these \ninternational norms all the time, we should not grant MFN. But these \nother environments are the place for those issues to be discussed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Is this morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is, indeed, with 10 minutes allotted for \neach speaker.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself the 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5910-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5911-S5915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRUSTEES REPORT ON MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and fellow Senators, the trustees' report \non Medicare and Social Security has just been delivered. Everybody \nshould know that is a report that is put together by a six-member \ncommission, four of whom are either Cabinet Members of the President or \nhierarchy of the Social Security System itself.\n  On page 10 of the summary of that report, the following statement is \nfound:\n\n       The trustees recommend the earliest possible enactment of \n     the legislation to further control the HI program costs and \n     thereby extend the life of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. \n     This is, however, only a first step in what must be a long-\n     term process to achieve balance between HI costs and funding.\n\n  Now, I repeat, these trustees I do not believe are Republicans. They \nare not Members of the Congress. Three of\n\n[[Page S5912]]\n\nthem are members of the President's Cabinet. One of them is the \nadministrator or the head person at Social Security. Then there are two \noutside citizens.\n  Now, what they have said is this fund is going bankrupt 1 year \nearlier than we thought. I know no one wants to hear that. No one wants \nto really face up to the reality, but they have said we were wrong even \nlast year; it is going to become insolvent even sooner, so they now say \nit will be insolvent in 5 years.\n  That means it is already annually spending out more than it is taking \nin, and but for a surplus, there would not be enough money to pay the \nbills. Then they say that 5 years out there will not be any surplus at \nall and the money coming in will be tremendously deficient in terms of \npaying the bills.\n  Now, I do not believe it is asking too much and I do not think senior \ncitizens would think that it is asking too much for us to fix that. \nShould we wait another year and then we only have 4 years to fix it? \nShould we wait 4 years and wake up in the morning and say, seniors, it \nis right around the corner; there is not going to be enough money to \npay the hospital bills? Or should we fix it now? Actually, these \ntrustees recommend that we do this at the earliest possible time, and \nthey recommend that we do this by further controlling costs.\n  Mr. President, I want to update the Senate on the status of the \nMedicare trust funds. Yesterday, we received the annual reports from \nthe Medicare trustees.\n  The new report tells us that the hospital insurance (part A) trust \nfund will go bankrupt early in the year 2001. Last year's report \npredicted bankruptcy in 2002, so we've lost 1 year there. In addition, \nthe President's veto of last year's Medicare reform plan means we have \nlost another year. We are now 2 years worse off than we were 1 year ago \ntoday.\n  The report tells us that Medicare spending is 2.7 percent of the \neconomy right now. If we don't do anything to slow the growth of \nMedicare spending, that will more than double, to almost 6 percent of \nthe economy in the year 2020.\n  The report confirms that the trust fund ran a small deficit for the \nfirst time last year. The report tells us that if we don't do anything, \nin the year 2005 the cash coming into the hospital insurance trust fund \nwill be $130 billion less than the cash we need to pay hospital \nbenefits.\n  Let's talk about the plan we're proposing in Congress. Our plan would \nspend $1.48 trillion on Medicare over the next 6 years. Yes, it would \nslow the growth of Medicare spending, from about 10 percent per year, \nto 6.2 percent per year. That's still more than twice the rate of \ninflation, a goal the President endorsed 3 years ago.\n  The President says that our short-term goal should be to keep the \npart A trust fund solvent for 10 years. Our plan does that; his does \nnot. His keeps the trust fund solvent for only 1 year, and plays a \nshell game with $55 billion of home health spending.\n  I can summarize the budgetary goals of our Medicare reform plan in \ntwo quick points, Mr. President. For Medicare part A, we will meet the \ngoal of keeping the part A trust fund solvent for more than a decade \nwithout any shell games.\n  And for Medicare part B, we will achieve the same level of savings as \ncontained in the President's budget.\n  Keeping the part A trust fund solvent requires making hard choices, \nMr. President. Our plan saves money first by restructuring the system \nto provide seniors with more choices. Today we have a Medicare Program \nwhich is modeled after a state-of-the-art health insurance plan from \nthe mid-1960's.\n  It is time to bring Medicare into the 1990's, and to prepare it for \nthe next century. Over the past 10 years, workers in the private sector \nhave seen their health insurance coverage change. More of them are \nchoosing to move into managed care, and more of that care is being \ndelivered through networks of providers which can care for the entire \npatient.\n  Many workers in the private sector and Government employees have \nhealth care choices, choices which many Medicare beneficiaries do not \nhave today. I believe that by offering seniors a wide range of options, \nand by making private firms compete for the business of seniors, we can \nbetter meet the beneficiaries' needs, and we can save money as well.\n  The trustees' report tells us that Medicare spending per beneficiary \ngrew about 10 percent over the last year. We simply cannot sustain a \nprogram in which each year we spend 10 percent more for each person. We \nneed to restructure the Medicare Program so that beneficiaries can make \nintelligent decisions about how they can best receive medical care.\n  Our plan would also make some needed changes in the way we pay \nproviders. Most hospitals are paid by the prospective payment system. A \nhospital is paid a specific amount for a certain medical condition. \nThis fixed, up-front payment encourages the hospital to deliver care \nefficiently. While the prospective payment system has not done enough \nto control hospital spending, it was definitely a step in the right \ndirection.\n\n  Our Medicare reform plan would reform how Medicare pays for home \nhealth services, and for services delivered in skilled nursing \nfacilities. These are the fastest growing components of Medicare \nspending today, and we need to restructure the way we pay these \nfacilities to help control costs.\n  Our Medicare reform plan would also reduce the rate of growth in \npayments to providers. This is nothing new, Mr. President, and if we \nare to control costs in the short run, we must do it. But to those who \nclaim that we are going to actually cut payments to providers below \ntoday's level, I say you are absolutely wrong. Even after reform, \npayments to hospitals and physicians will go up.\n  The providers, Mr. President, should be among the strongest \nsupporters of our reform plan, because they will ultimately benefit \nfrom a system that delivers and allocates health care more efficiently. \nAs more Medicare beneficiaries participate in privately offered \nMedicare plus plans, we can get the Government out of the relationship \nbetween a patient and his or her doctor. We can allow doctors to \npractice the best kind of medicine they know, and we can allow a \npatient and a doctor to cooperate in making smart and economical \ndecisions about the amount and type of care that a beneficiary needs.\n  Our Medicare reform plan would enact real reforms to control Medicare \nprogram costs so that we can keep the Medicare trust fund solvent for \n10 years. Once we have done that, we can then begin to address the \nlonger-term financial problems that will result from the retirement of \nthe baby boom generation.\n  That is in direct contrast to how the President's budget proposes to \ndeal with Medicare. The President's budget contains a Medicare shell \ngame which just moves money around from one pot to another. The \nPresident's Medicare shell game would mislead Medicare beneficiaries, \nhard-working families paying taxes, and the Congress about the health \nof the part A trust fund.\n  And the President's Medicare shell game would place $55 billion more \npressure on income taxes. It makes you wonder if this is really just a \nback-door way to increase taxes, Mr. President.\n  The President's plan would take $55 billion of home health spending, \nwhich is currently paid out of Medicare part A, and would say that it \nis no longer going to be paid from the Medicare part A trust fund. He \nwould transfer responsibility for that spending from Medicare part A to \nMedicare part B.\n  Why would you do that? For one simple reason: it makes the part A \ntrust fund look better. Since you're no longer spending that $55 \nbillion from the part A trust fund, that trust fund goes bankrupt more \nslowly, and it appears healthier. But you haven't really done anything \nto address the problem, because the spending still exists in medicare \npart B.\n  By playing this shell game with home health spending, the President \nclaims to keep the trust fund solvent, when really all he has done is \nshift the problem from one part of Medicare to the other. That would be \nbad enough, if that's all there were. But unfortunately there is more.\n  Medicare part B is paid for from two sources. Premiums paid by \nbeneficiaries cover 25 percent of the costs, and income taxes from \nhard-working\n\n[[Page S5913]]\n\nAmerican families pay the other 75 percent. Every $1 paid by a medicare \nbeneficiary for doctor's services through Medicare part B is subsidized \nby $3 from working taxpayers.\n  We know that the President's Medicare shell game transfers $55 \nbillion of home health spending from Medicare part A to Medicare part \nB. So it would make sense that, if you did that, beneficiary premiums \nwould go up to pay for 25 percent of those costs.\n  But they do not. The President's shell game transfers the $55 billion \nof spending from part A to part B and makes the part A trust fund look \nhealthier, but he exempts the transferred spending from the calculation \nof the premium.\n  So who do you think pays for it? Where does the $55 billion come from \nto pay for the transferred home health spending? Under current law and \nunder our reform plan, it comes from the payroll taxes that pay for \npart A benefits, and are needed to keep the part A trust fund solvent.\n  But if the $55 billion is now paid from part B, but the premiums paid \nby beneficiaries are not going to pay for any of it, then the entire \n$55 billion cost will be borne by hard-working, taxpaying American \nfamilies. Rather than subsidize three-fourths of this spending, as they \ndo for all other part B services, the President would make working \ntaxpayers subsidize the whole thing.\n  Let me summarize the shell game, Mr. President:\n  First, transfer $55 billion of home health spending from part A to \npart B;\n  Second, this makes the part A trust fund look healthier, when \nactually nothing has changed;\n  Third, exempt the $55 billion from the calculation of the part B \npremium;\n  Fourth, and therefore make working taxpayers pick up the entire $55 \nbillion cost.\n  I wonder if there are plans to extend this shell game in the future, \nMr. President. If he wanted to, each year the President could propose \nto transfer some more spending from Medicare part A to Medicare part B. \nHe could exempt it from the premiums, and each year he could claim to \nsave Medicare. But in reality all he would be doing is misleading the \nAmerican people and Medicare beneficiaries, allowing Medicare to go \nbankrupt, and raising taxes on hard working American families. I \nsincerely hope that this is not the President's goal.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am going to insert a statement in the Record \nbecause of the lack of time that explains in detail the proposal that \nthe Republicans have submitted this year. This proposal, which is \nworking its way through the Congress, would save the trust fund for 10 \nyears.\n  I want to spend a little bit of time talking about what the President \nof the United States does not do. It has been very difficult. It seems \nlike nobody wants to write about what the President is proposing, but I \nbelieve we ought to tell the public what he is proposing and let them \npass judgment upon whether he has a bona fide, legitimate 10-year fix \nof Medicare. The proposal that our committees will work on, everybody \nagrees, will make the trust fund solvent for 10 years. But now let me \nsuggest how the President goes about solving this problem. I wish I was \na better wordsmith because what he has done just cries out for some \nsimple few words to explain it that everybody would understand. But I \nam not very good at that. The closest I can come to it is a flimflam, a \nhoax, a charade. So let me try to tell you what I mean.\n\n  The trust fund has money coming into it from all the workers of \nAmerica. All the hard-working people getting paychecks, they will see a \nlittle piece of it taken out, and it goes in this trust fund to pay for \nhospital and home health care for senior citizens. It is a lot of \nmoney. The problem is the costs in that fund have grown 10 percent a \nyear and the taxes going in are not growing at 10 percent a year.\n  Some say we can cover seniors and modernize this system, and instead \nof growing at 10 percent a year, maybe we can cover it at a growth of 7 \npercent a year. Some say the providers that are charging for this care \nhave to charge in a different way and we have to prevent fraud and we \nhave to make sure that we are not being overcharged as we attempt to \ntake care of seniors for their hospital care.\n  The most interesting thing about this is that out of that fund \ncurrently, we also pay for home health care for seniors. It does not \nmatter to the Senator from New Mexico how one explains how that \nhappened to come about. The truth of the matter is, when these trustees \nwere referring to reducing the costs, they were referring to reducing \nthe costs of what we are paying for out of that trust fund.\n  One of the big-ticket items that we have committed to pay for out of \nthis trust fund for our seniors is home health care. It just happens \nthat home health care is growing rapidly. As a matter of fact, if you \nlooked in that trust fund and zeroed in and said, ``What are we paying \nfor,'' and you asked, ``What is it costing,'' the fastest growing one \nis home health care for seniors. It is growing at 19 percent a year.\n  The trustees recommended that we try to reduce the costs of this \nprogram. Listen carefully. Here is how the President did it. He said, \nlet us not pay for home health care from the trust fund. Let us take \nthe spending out of the trust fund. It is a small item, $55 billion \nover the next 6 years. Let us just take it out of there and not pay for \nit out of the trust fund anymore.\n  That is marvelous. If you can do that with immunity and if you can do \nthat without charging somebody for the $55 billion, you have a \nmarvelous budget. We just got rid of $55 billion worth of debt that \nthat trust fund is obligated to pay for our seniors, and we say we are \nnot going to pay it anymore.\n  Obviously, if you do that you have already made the trust fund \nsolvent for a little bit longer. You took away $55 billion of its \nobligation. And what does the President do with it? He says we are \ngoing to pay for that from general revenues, paid by the working \ntaxpayers of America.\n  How do you like that? All of a sudden, whack, just like that, we \ntransferred $55 billion from the trust fund to all the hard-working \npeople of the country. Mr. President, $55 billion of their taxes are \ngoing to go to pay that. And all of a sudden, the trust fund got a \nlittle more solvent.\n  The trust fund may be getting solvent, but the taxpayer is going \nbroke. The youngsters in America, with children, trying to raise a \nfamily, they could not have even dreamt of such a marvelous gift from \nthe President. Suppose they woke up one morning and he said, ``I have \ntaken $55 billion out of that trust fund, and you pay for it. But I \nhave made the trust fund solvent because I just got rid of $55 billion \nworth of things it has been paying for.''\n  Frankly, if that is how you want to fix the trust fund, why do we not \ngo over and ask those who are taking care of the trust fund and paying \nthe bills, why do we not say, ``Why do you not give us another whole \nbunch of bills we are paying for seniors out of the trust fund? Why do \nyou not find another $50 billion and let us not pay them anymore out of \nthe trust fund. Let us take those responsibilities out and say we are \ngoing to pay for them, we are just not going to pay for them out of the \ntrust fund?''\n  Then who is going to pay for them? Certainly we are not saying nobody \nis going to pay for them. Certainly we are not saying we are going to \ntake them away from the seniors. We are just saying the taxpayer will \npay. We are just saying let those hard-working people pay. They do not \nknow it, but we just put another tax on them.\n\n  Frankly, if I sound a bit let down, if I sound a bit frustrated, I am \nboth. I am really let down.\n  I ask for an additional 5 minutes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If I appear a little let down, I am. If I appear a \nlittle bit kind of chagrined, I am. Because we set about to do \nprecisely what the trustees said. We tried to reduce the costs to the \ntrust fund of providing this care. We wanted to make the system modern, \ngive seniors options instead of the 30-year-old program, one program \nfor all seniors. We thought we could save them money if we gave them \noptions. We thought they might get more coverage if we gave them \noptions. We worked very hard on how can we change the way we keep the \nsystem from getting defrauded. We worked very hard at how we pay and \nmake sure we are getting our money's worth for all these hospital \nbills.\n\n[[Page S5914]]\n\n  Isn't it something, after you have worked like that, you have gone \nacross the country and told the people you are doing it, along comes \nthe President and, overnight, in the budget, says, ``I just found a way \nto save $55 billion. Just take it out of there and let somebody else \npay for it.''\n  I do not understand why people are not asking the administration, and \nthose who represent the administration: How can you do this? Who is \ngoing to pay the $55 billion that you just relieved the trust fund of? \nWho is going to pay it? Is it manna from heaven, going to fall down \nsomewhere and nobody is going to have to pay it, or are we going to \nfind a way not to provide it to seniors?\n  So I thought it was very important to explain this, one day after the \nissuance of the latest report--and, senior citizens, with each year the \nreport is getting worse. It is not going to get better. We have to try \nto fix this program. I do not believe anybody really thinks that fixing \nit means letting us transfer the costs of it to working men and women \nwho already are paying too much taxes. We do not exempt them. We did \nnot find a way to exempt the way their tax is. They are going to pay \nfor it.\n  I venture to say, in closing, if somebody were to offer a bill to the \nU.S. Senate that said, ``Let us put a $55 billion tax on Americans' \ngeneral income tax and let us transfer that to the trust fund to pay \nfor hospital care for seniors,'' I venture a guess that it would not \nget 15 votes. For everyone knows you cannot take every trust fund that \nis around, and when it is not quite able to do its job, just go out and \nsay put an income tax on the public to pay for it. This was a trust \nfund. We told the working people you will pay a fixed amount, put it in \nthere, and it will take care of this. And we have not yet even \nattempted a reasonable effort to reduce the costs and supply seniors \nwith adequate hospitalization.\n  We are just coming to grips with the problem, and along comes an \nopportunity to do it together and do it right with the President and \nthe Congress working together, and the President finds a way to get rid \nof the problem, about half the problem, by deciding to move $55 billion \nworth of costs out of the trust fund and saying, ``We'll pay for it \nanother way.''\n  I do not like to just always paint the side of the picture the \nSenator from New Mexico sees. There will be some who will say it is \npretty logical that we should take out home health care. Maybe it \nshould not be in there. But the truth of the matter is, when you do it \nthis way, you have perpetrated on the public a vicious \nmisrepresentation, for you are telling them you made it $55 billion \nmore solvent, and you are not telling them how it is going to be paid \nfor, on whose shoulders is the cost going to fall as this $55 billion \nhas to come out of the general coffers of America.\n  I am quite sure that the President might say, ``I don't intend it \nthat way,'' but I ask, how do we intend to pay for it otherwise? It \ncould be that since we are moving that down into another provision of \nhealth care for seniors, maybe the President is going to propose that \nwe raise the costs of that program to seniors. They pay 25 percent of \nthat. The taxpayers pay 75 percent of that. That is for the insurance \npolicies for everything but hospitalization. Perhaps the President will \ncome along here and say, ``We've got to make sure the seniors bear a \nportion of that cost.''\n  I do not find that anywhere in the budget. So I am assuming it comes \nout of the general tax coffers of the country to pay for making the \ntrust fund solvent.\n  Again, in summary, if it is the intention of the Congress and the \nPresident to make the trust fund solvent, not by reducing costs but by \npaying for a big portion of it out of general taxes, maybe we ought to \ntell everybody that. Maybe we ought to say that is how we are going to \nprovide for this hospitalization. I do not believe anybody thinks that. \nI do not believe anybody thinks you are going to make that fund solvent \nby taking 4, 5, 6 percent of the general taxes that Americans are \npaying and put it in there. Pretty soon there will be no tax dollars \nfor anything else.\n  So I thought it was very important that we get the message out. I had \nhoped I could have gotten it out yesterday. It would have been more in \nrhythm and in sequence with the issuance of the report, but we had \nother important things to speak of, so I came today to do it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I want to thank the Senator from New Mexico for his \nstatement, and it is timely. It is important the record show that.\n  Yesterday, we heard from the trustees, the actuarial study of the \nstate of the trust fund of Medicare. This Senator happens to be holding \ntown meetings across Idaho on Medicare. I can tell the Senator from New \nMexico, there is one question always asked. In your package, and I am \nusing the comparative between what you did, what Senator Roth worked in \nproducing, what the Senate finally voted on to reform Medicare a year \nago, and I compare it with what the President had offered, and they say \nto me, ``Well, now, home health care, that's a very important part of \nkeeping costs down. Why is the President doing what he's doing?''\n  I try to explain it to them. They say, ``Well, then doesn't that mean \nit just gets funded out of the general fund?''\n  I say, ``With no other form of taxation or revenue source''--as the \nSenator from New Mexico just pointed out--``you are absolutely right.''\n  They say, ``Well, that takes it out of the character of the kind of \nhealth care this country needs.''\n  We ought to be moving people toward home care. It is the least \nexpensive way, or it is a less expensive way, certainly, and it clearly \noffers that senior who needs this kind of health care the sanctuary of \nthe home. We ought to be driving toward that.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, I think, has made a very important \nstatement in that area. Let me thank him for doing so. I do not want to \nhave to deal with this issue again this year, but if we do, I do not \nwant the President sitting down there saying, ``We're slashing it,'' \nwhen there is less than a half a percentage point difference in what we \nare doing.\n  I think the thing that is most interesting for those attending my \ntown meetings--we use the charts and the graphs; we show the \nPresident's plan and our plan--they say, ``Where's the difference?''\n  I say, ``We offer more options, and those options help bring costs \ndown.''\n  They say, ``We see that, Senator, but we thought you were destroying \nthe program.''\n  I say, ``Well, when the facts are on the table, no one--no one--in \nthis Senate will ever do that. But we are on the board of directors, if \nyou will, of Medicare and we have to make the necessary corrections to \nget it done.''\n  I think your points today are valuable, very important to the whole \nof the message, and I thank you for bringing it to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there is another aspect which I have not \nspoken about, and I will take a minute to discuss it. It is entirely \npossible that when you take expenditures out of the trust fund that \nwere obligated to be paid by that trust fund, that you might be \ndiminishing the quality of what you are giving seniors, for if the \nobligation is in the trust fund, it is a pure trust responsibility to \npay for those kinds of things for seniors. If you take it out and say \nit is going to be paid for out of the general fund, it may be that down \nthe line, we will turn it into welfare or we will pay less for it \nbecause we will be saying, ``It's not in the trust fund; it's something \nwe can control by just turning the money off or on.''\n  I have not said that other than today, but I do believe it is subject \nto a serious question: Do you diminish the expectation rights of \nseniors to home health care if you take it out of the trust fund and \nput it in another place under another fund which may not be quite as \nsecure in terms of the commitment?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n\n[[Page S5915]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I want to speak just briefly on two \nsubjects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5911-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DANIEL E.

While I do not want to speak of Mr. Moss--and I am pleased \nyou recognized him--I want to speak about you for just a moment, and to \nthank you for the relationship you and I have had on the issue of the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. We were not successful a \nfew moments ago on another very important vote.\n  But I must say, in all fairness--and I want the Record to show this--\nthat over the years that you and I have worked side by side on this \nissue, I think most of the public watching would have said, ``Isn't \nthat interesting. Here is a liberal and a conservative.''\n  We took the politics out of this. It was a bipartisan effort, a \nstrong one, on the part of the Senator from Illinois and this Senator. \nOut of that relationship and our commitment for fiscal responsibility, \nI have developed a very fond respect for you and all of the work you \ndo. While you and I disagree on a lot of issues, we have worked \ntogether very, very well.\n  Let me thank you publicly, and for the Record, for the tremendous \neffort you put forth and the contribution you have made toward bringing \na balanced budget amendment to the Constitution to the American people. \nA very special thanks to the senior Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague from Idaho, and my thanks to Senator \nCoverdell from Georgia. I knew Senator Craig when he was Congressman \nCraig. We said hello, but that was just about it. But I had a chance to \nwork with Senator Craig here and came to have great respect for him. I \nam grateful to all those who were helpful to us: Senator Hatch, Senator \nThurmond, Senator Heflin, Senator Bryan, others in both political \nparties.\n  A balanced budget constitutional amendment, one of these days, has to \npass. The question is, how much we are going to hurt our Nation before \nwe pass it. There is just no question, if we had passed it back when \nJohn F. Kennedy complained about spending $9 billion on interest--today \nwe are spending $344 billion on gross interest--what a much better \ncountry we would have. We cannot wait another 5 or 10 years.

Mr. President, I will speak just briefly on another \nsubject. That is, Senator Lugar and I and Senator Warner and a total of \n25 of us on both sides have introduced a bill to say, let us have a \nstudy of the growth of legalized gambling in our country.\n  This is not the most Earth-shaking thing, but the fastest growing \nindustry in our country is legalized gambling. And there are problems \nwith that. It is the only form of addiction that Government promotes. \nWe would be shocked if we saw a sign saying, ``Smoke Marlboro \ncigarettes. You know, they're fun to smoke'' or ``Drink more whiskey. \nYou'll really have a good time,'' because both of those provide revenue \nfor Government. But we do not seem to be shocked when there are \nbillboards, like on the south side of Chicago, saying, ``The Illinois \nlottery--this is your way out.'' This is the impoverished area of \nChicago. That is not the way out for people. It is education. It is \nhard work. It is the kind of things that we know have to be done.\n  So Senator Lugar, Senator Warner, and I introduced this legislation. \nTo the credit of Senator Stevens and his committee, it was reported out \nby voice vote. Now we want to move it through the Senate. The House has \nalready passed a bill. We have to work the two out.\n  My hope is that we could get this done quickly. I spoke last week to \nSenator Dole. I would love to see, before Bob Dole leaves, the Senate \nhave us pass this legislation.\n  The New York Times 3 days ago had an editorial urging the Senate to \npass this legislation.\n  The Christian Science Monitor has an editorial. The last paragraph \nreads:\n\n       It's time society knew the real costs of gambling. The \n     Senate should pass the measure without delay.\n\n  I hope we do this. I have no illusions. We are not going to stop \nlegalized gambling in this country. We are not going to close Las Vegas \nor Atlantic city. But I think we should be looking at the possibility \nof steps to limit the growth. For example, you can now or shortly will \nbe able to, on the Internet, gamble by computer using your American \nExpress or Visa or some card. We do not know where that is going to \nlead. I think a commission ought to be looking into this.\n  There are people who get addicted. I got into this because my mother \nis a member of a Lutheran Church in Collinsville, IL. And a substitute \nteacher at a Lutheran school of that church, unknown to her family, got \naddicted to gambling. They thought the money was going for rent and \npaying the bills and so forth. One day they came home and there was a \nnote saying you could find her in the shopping mall parking lot. She \nhad committed suicide. She went to a riverboat casino and got addicted. \nAnd you know, these stories multiply.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthese two editorials.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 3, 1996]\n\n                         Gambling in the Senate\n\n       Despite intense opposition from the gambling industry, the \n     Senate Governmental Affairs Committee has approved a \n     worthwhile measure to create a national commission to review \n     the social and economic impact of casinos and state-run \n     lotteries. Chances are good that it would win easy approval \n     by the Senate, much as a similar bill unanimously passed the \n     House in March. But there remains a danger that Senate \n     Republican leaders may try to kill the measure quietly by \n     failing to allow time for a vote on the Senate calendar.\n       The bill approved by the Senate committee is a somewhat \n     watered down version of the House plan, which was proposed by \n     Representative Frank Wolf, a Virginia Republican. But it is a \n     marked improvement over the revision proposed earlier by Ted \n     Stevens of Alaska, the committee chairman. The compromise \n     fashioned by Mr. Stevens and the bill's sponsors--Richard \n     Lugar, Republican of Indiana, and Paul Simon, Democrat of \n     Illinois--grants the commission adequate subpoena power and a \n     sufficiently broad mandate to examine gambling's consequences \n     in communities around the country.\n       As various forms of gambling have spread across the nation, \n     there has been little effort to examine the economic and \n     social impact. State and local political leaders faced with \n     deciding whether to approve gambling in their area, or expand \n     its presence, often have little hard information available to \n     assess the advantages and disadvantages to their communities.\n       Bob Dole, now in his final days as Senate majority leader, \n     has indicated support for a Federal commission, despite heavy \n     financial support for his Presidential campaign from\n\n[[Page S5916]]\n\n     the gambling industry. But, at least for now, the bill is not \n     on the list of measures he hopes to pass before he departs \n     the Senate around June 11. Mr. Dole's likely sucesssor, Trent \n     Lott of Mississippi, has voiced reservations about forming a \n     national commission.\n       With pro-gambling lobbyists working overtime to defeat \n     those good idea, the best step now would be for Mr. Dole to \n     bring the bill to the Senate floor before he departs. In \n     doing so he can serve the public good and demonstrate his \n     independence from a wealthy special-interest group.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           [From the Christian Science Monitor, May 20, 1996]\n\n                          Gambling: A Bad Bet\n\n       The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee last week \n     approved a bill to set up a national commission to study \n     gambling in the United States.\n       The bill calls for the commission to examine the social and \n     economic impact of gambling on communities and individuals \n     and issue a report within two years. it would look at all \n     forms of gambling, including new forms of interactive \n     computer technology and gambling over the Internet. Three \n     commission members would be named by the president, three by \n     the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and three by the \n     Senate majority leader. The board would hold public hearings \n     and have the power to subpoena witnesses.\n       Such a study, which joins a number of state-sponsored \n     inquiries, is long overdue. The states' headlong rush over \n     the last 20 years into lotteries, bingo, riverboat casinos, \n     and other gaming was accompanied by promises of economic \n     development, more state funding for schools and other \n     services, and ``harmless'' entertainment.\n       Not one of these promises has come to pass. Instead of \n     economic development, discretionary spending is drained away \n     from other, more-productive spending on goods, services, or \n     entertainment. Instead of spending more on education or \n     social services, legislators have taken away general funds in \n     equal amounts and merely replaced the money with lottery and \n     keno revenues. Instead of harmless entertainment, there is \n     organized-crime involvement, gambling addiction, and a whole \n     host of personal problems fed by the lure of ``easy money.'' \n     The states, themselves addicted to gaming revenues, are \n     forced to invent new games to augment lottery earnings lost \n     to competition.\n       The gambling industry opposes creation of this commission, \n     worried it will find that gambling causes more problems than \n     benefits for states and communities.\n       It's time society knew the real costs of gambling. The \n     Senate should pass the measure without delay.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. I urge Senator Dole, if possible, prior to Tuesday, to \nbring this up. I would hope we could pass it quickly. If that cannot \nhappen, I hope Senator Lott or Senator Cochran, I am not voting on who \nwill be the leader over there on their side, but I hope that we could \nmove on this quickly. I think it is clearly in the national interest. \nThis, again, is not an attempt to stop legalized gambling in this \ncountry. It is an attempt to say ``Let's look at where we are.''\n\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee. He is \nnodding, either because I was speaking, or he wishes to speak.

Mr. President, I rise today with grave concerns that the \nMedicare hospital insurance trust fund is no longer creeping toward \ninsolvency, but galloping toward it.\n  This is very serious news. Based on the Medicare trustees' report \nreleased yesterday, Wednesday, June 5, the Medicare HI trust fund is \ngoing bankrupt earlier than expected. In fact, according to the \ntrustees' report, of which three of the six trustees are members of \nPresident Clinton's Cabinet, the trust fund may run out of money as \nearly as calendar year 2000.\n  What is happening to the Medicare trust fund is pretty basic. The \nprogram is paying out more than it is taking in. This simple dynamic, \nif left unchecked, will lead Medicare to bankruptcy in less than 5 \nyears. And, simply put, bankruptcy of the trust fund means there will \nnot be money to pay the hospital bills of our senior citizens and \ndisabled individuals reliant on Medicare.\n  Medicare is on a collision course, and we cannot afford not to act. \nTaking no action to avert Medicare's collision course toward bankruptcy \nmeans leaving millions of seniors and disabled beneficiaries with an \nempty promise. I believe this is wrong.\n  It is time to put politics aside.\n  To address Medicare's financial crisis, it has been suggested \nappointing a bipartisan commission to develop a solution. I support the \nestablishment of a commission. A commission could facilitate addressing \nthe Medicare crisis. But, I cannot support the idea of establishing a \ncommission if this is a delay tactic or a tactic to avoid addressing \nthe issue.\n  I am concerned because, frankly, the administration's track record in \nproposing a solution is not good. Last year, the administration ignored \nthe Medicare crisis. President Clinton's fiscal year 1996 budget did \nnot include any proposals to shore up Medicare's fiscal debt, nor did \nhis budget claim there was a problem. We are facing a crisis. A crisis \nrequires action.\n  There is a lot of talk about wanting to get down to business to solve \nthe Medicare trust fund crisis. Didn't anyone notice that we tried that \nlast year? That in the Senate we put forward a proposal that would have \ntruly preserved and protected the Medicare Program, not just through \nthe next 5 years, but for the next generation.\n  Our proposal would have kept our promise to leave a legacy of a \nrobust Medicare program for our children and our grandchildren. And \nyet, the Clinton administration played politics with Medicare and waged \na ``Medi-Scare'' campaign. Yet, again, Democrats now are saying that \nRepublicans are resorting to scare tactics.\n  I do not agree that scare tactics include alerting the public to \nfactual information reported by the Medicare trustees.\n  ``Medi-Scare'' tactics were used last fall as Congress worked to \npreserve and strengthen the Medicare program.\n  Instead of debating the issues and focusing on the need to preserve \nMedicare, others resorted to political rhetoric that played on the \npublic's emotions and distorted the truth. Democrats kept talking about \nMedicare ``cuts'', when not one of the Republican proposals would have \ncut benefits. The program was not ``cut,'' in fact, spending would have \nincreased every year under the Republican reforms. And, then there was \nthe final emotional play linking changes to the Medicare program to a \ntax cut. According to the Washington Post last September, even this \ntactic was refuted: ``The Democrats have fabricated the Medicare-tax \ncut connection because it is useful politically.''\n  Now, is the time to put partisanship aside. Time is running short, \nand we need to work together to avert the crisis.\n  There are three very basic, but crucial facts that we can not avoid--\nthese three facts are:\n  Fact: if changes are not enacted into law, the trust fund will \ncontinue on its course toward bankruptcy and there is no provision in \nthe law allowing for HI expenditures to be made on behalf of Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Fact: according to the Medicare trustees, Medicare will be bankrupt \nin 2001.\n  Fact: the year 2000--the last year the Trustees believe Medicare will \nbe solvent, is less than five years away.\n  Given the very short time-time Medicare will remain solvent, and \ngiven the demographic progression of the Medicare program, we cannot \nafford more delay. We are already 2 years closer to insolvency because \nwe lost a year to address the problem, and the program is one more year \ncloser to bankruptcy than we expected, yet we are miles away from \nreaching an agreement on a solution.\n  Demographic trends will continue to increase financial pressure on \nthe trust fund. Today, there are less than 40 million Americans who \nqualify to receive Medicare. By the year 2010, the number will be \napproaching 50 million, and by 2020, it will be over 60 million. While \nthese numbers are increasing, the number of workers supporting \nretirees will decrease. While we have almost four workers per retiree \ntoday, we will have about two per retiree by the year 2030.\n\n  Yet, my friends on the other side of the aisle will point out that \nthe President took action in 1993 to extend the life of the HI Trust \nFund--he raised taxes. President Clinton's 1993 budget he enacted into \nlaw included two taxes to bail out the trust fund. First, the 1993 \nClinton budget increased taxes on workers by taxing all wages earned, \nand second, the 1993 budget increased the amount Social Security \nbenefits are subject to taxation from 50 percent to 85 percent.\n\n[[Page S5917]]\n\n  Increased taxes were not a solution in 1993, and they will not be a \nsolution in the future.\n  Last year, Republicans proposed to preserve, protect and strengthen \nthe Medicare program. We worked hard to put together a balanced \nproposal that did not cut Medicare but slowed the rate the cost of the \nprogram was expected to grow. Under our plan that was approved by \nCongress, annual per beneficiary Medicare spending would have increased \nfrom average spending of $4,800 in 1995 to more than $7,200 in 2002.\n  Under the original Senate Balanced Budget Act as reported out of \nFinance Committee, the Medicare program would have remained solvent for \nabout 18 years. According to the CBO estimates, under our proposal, the \nMedicare HI Trust Fund balance would have totaled $300 billion in 2005. \nThe CBO stated, the HI Trust Fund would meet the Trustees' test of \nshort-range financial adequacy.'' In other words, for the next 10 \nyears, the HI Trust Fund balance, at the end of every year, would have \nbeen more than enough to pay Medicare benefits for the following year.\n  More importantly, using the CBO's estimates through 2005, our Finance \nCommittee staff, in consultation with the Office of the Actuary within \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, estimated that the \nMedicare HI Trust Fund would have been solvent through about the year \n2020. That would have meant 10 years after the baby-boom generation \nbegins to retire a quarter of a century from today.\n  We need to preserve and protect the Medicare program. We need to make \nsure we leave a solid legacy for the next generations. The demographics \nand the predictions of cost growth confirm that the program is not \nsustainable. It is no longer time for rhetoric, but time for action. \nPlaying politics with Medicare is simply wrong. Putting off what needs \nto be done is the cruelest tactic.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there have been a number of speeches made \ntoday by colleagues on the other side of the aisle about Medicare. I \nask the American public to understand the opposition to Medicare, as a \nprogram. For example, I wonder if those same Senators who talk about \nhow they were rallying to help Medicare would recognize that just last \nyear, late in the year, the majority leader of the Senate, Senator Dole \nsaid, ``I was there fighting the fight against Medicare, one of 12, \nbecause we knew it would not work in 1965.'' On that same day, at \nanother place in Washington, a speech was given by the Speaker of the \nHouse, where he said, ``Now, let me talk about Medicare. We don't get \nrid of it in the first round because we don't think it would be \npolitically smart. We believe it's going to wither on the vine.'' We \nhave another leader in the House of Representatives, the majority \nleader, Dick Armey, a Congressman from Texas, who is second in command \nin the House of Representatives. He said, ``Medicare has no place in \nthe free world. Social Security is a rotten trick. I think we are going \nto have to bite the bullet on Social Security and phase it out over \ntime.''\n  This is where they are coming from. The Republican leadership does \nnot like Medicare. Look at what Haley Barbour said: ``This is manna \nfrom Heaven.'' The Republican National Committee chairman was \nresponding to the Medicare trustees' report that was released when the \nRepublicans were looking for a way to justify their scheme to cut \nMedicare. ``This is manna from Heaven''--the fact that the Medicare \ntrust fund is in trouble.\n\n  The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, we have had Medicare for \nsome 27 years, and there have only been 2 years where in the annual \nreport of the trustees it has indicated that Medicare is in trouble. \nThe reason for that, of course, is that Medicare is a pay-as-you-go \nsystem. Every year, the trustees have said, ``You have to do something \nto take care of Medicare,'' and we do. One of the things we recently \ndid, in 1993--all the Democrats did it, and we did not get a single \nRepublican vote--is we extended the solvency of the trust fund for 3 \nadditional years.\n  There is a lot of work that we need to do to take care of Medicare. \nMedicare is a tremendous program. In the early 1960's, less than 40 \npercent of the American senior citizens had some type of health \ninsurance. Today, almost 100 percent--over 99 percent--of senior \ncitizens have health insurance. The reason they have health insurance \nis because of Medicare.\n  Of course, there are things we need to do with Medicare. For people \nto stand, though, with a straight face and say, ``We are not cutting \nMedicare; all we are doing is cutting the rate of increase,'' certainly \ndoes not answer the question. We have thousands of people coming on the \nrolls--thousands and thousands of people--every week in the United \nStates. People are living longer. During that period of life extension, \nthey need additional health and medical care. Medicare has been a boon \nto these senior citizens in their older years to take care of that.\n  We need money to do that. If you use the argument that has been used \nby my colleagues on the other side, where, in effect, Mr. President, \nthey are saying, ``This is not a cut; we are only cutting the rate of \nincrease,'' well, if that is a fact, we keep hearing on the Senate \nfloor all the time about defense funding, defense forces. They talk \nabout this increase that we are getting, and that a 5-percent increase \nis really a decrease in defense spending. Well, that same argument then \nwould certainly apply to Medicare, a nominal funding increase of $1,653 \na person. But the fact of the matter is that the purchasing power is at \na loss of about $1,000.\n  So let us talk realistically. The fact that you raise the dollars \ndoes not mean in fact that you increase the ability of people to \npurchase. In fact, it is quite to the contrary.\n  We know that the Speaker wants Medicare to wither on the vine. The \nmajority leader in the Senate was glad that he voted against it in 1965 \nbecause he said he knew it would not work--some 30 years ago.\n  Well, we are willing to take care of the problems in Medicare. In the \nbudget submitted by the President there is an extension of the problems \nwith Medicare. There are a lot of things that we need to do, and we can \ndo those. But the one thing that we cannot do is continue this \nPresidential debate and in the process damage the image of Medicare. \nMedicare has billions and billions of dollars in the trust fund today. \nThose trust fund dollars will continue to be there for the foreseeable \nfuture. We have to, as we have in years gone by, change certain things, \nand we are going to do that. But we are going to have to wait, it \nappears, until the Presidential election season is over before we can \nconstructively take care of the problems with Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as if in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about Medicare, \nwhich I know has been discussed by other Members on the floor, and \nspecifically about the Medicare trustees' report which I know has also \nreceived a fair\n\n[[Page S5918]]\n\namount of attention, as well it should. This Medicare trustees' report, \nremember, is the second --there have been a number of reports--second \nin a series of reports that have raised a very large red flag, which \nred flag essentially had printed on it ``The Medicare Trust Fund is \nGoing Bankrupt.''\n  The Medicare trustees are independent in the sense that their job is \nto review what is happening with the Medicare system, do it in an \nanalytical way, and issue a report. Even though three or four of the \nmembers are officially members of the administration, they have great \ncredibility as to the integrity of this report.\n  The first report that they initiated in this area that threw up the \nred flag in such a large way stated unequivocally--this was almost a \nyear ago now--``We strongly recommend that the crisis presented by the \nfinancial position of Medicare trust fund be urgently addressed on a \ncomprehensive basis, including a review of the program's financing \nmethod, benefit provisions, and delivery mechanisms.''\n  Well, the U.S. Congress--specifically the Republican leadership in \nthe U.S. Congress--did address the Medicare trust fund and that \nspecific direction from the trustees. We put forward a proposal which \nwas included in the balanced budget, which unfortunately the President \nvetoed, that addressed the underlying problem of the Medicare trust \nfund. It did it by giving seniors an opportunity to have more choices \nas to the type of health care that they receive. Unfortunately, that \nproposal was vetoed.\n\n  So we now have another report coming out which has said that the \noriginal report of a year ago grossly underestimated the problem. This \nchart sort of reflects the situation. I call this the plane crash \nchart, the nose dive chart, or whatever you want to call it. This is \nthe blue line that shows what is happening in the Medicare trust fund \nin the original report that we most refer to around here of a year ago. \nThis red line is the new timeframe for insolvency. It has been moved \nfrom the year 2002 to the year 2001. But actually that only tells a \nlittle bit of the story when you use those 2 years because of the \ninsolvency which is being projected by the trustees. In the year 2001 \nthey are talking about an insolvency or a deficit of $33 billion in the \nMedicare trust fund, part A. But in the year 2002, under this new \nreport, they are talking about a deficit of over $100 billion--a \nmassive deficit in the trust fund in the year 2002.\n  What has the administration's response to this been? It has been to \ntake their head and stick it as far down in the sand as they can and \nflap their wings in some demagogic manner about how the Republican \nproposals are going to slash Medicare when nothing could be less \naccurate or less truthful.\n  The Republican proposal was that we should slow the rate of growth of \nMedicare from 10 percent annually down to 7 percent annually and that \nwe should do that by, as I mentioned earlier, giving Medicare \nbeneficiaries essentially the same type of choices that Members of \nCongress and the Federal employees have today. Today, unfortunately, a \nMedicare beneficiary has only one really viable choice. They have some \nexperimental choice, and that is called ``fee for service.'' This is \nthe type of health care delivery service we had in the 1950's and \n1960's in this country; the type of health care service seniors grew up \nwith and, therefore, are most comfortable with. It happens to be the \nmost expensive type of health care delivery service. People who work in \nthe private sector today, who work in a business place today, who have \nhealth insurance, know that there are very few fee-for-service \nprograms, that for the most part we have what is known as mixed cost \nprograms where you buy a health care delivery service that takes care \nof all your activities when you are an employee.\n  It might be an HMO; it might be something called a PPO; it might be a \ngroup of doctors practicing together. There are a group of variables \nabout how this is done. But today we have basically fixed-cost delivery \nsystems.\n  What we as Republicans said to the seniors was, all right, if you \nlike fee-for-service, you can stay with it. We are not going to tell \nyou that you have to change, but we are going to encourage you to look \nat some other services, HMO's, PPO's, groups of doctors practicing \ntogether, other types of insurance programs, and to the extent you \nchoose one of these other programs which has to deliver at the minimum \nthe same benefits you are now getting under your health care system, \nunder health care services, to the extent you choose one of those that \ncosts less, because many of them can cost less, then we in the Federal \nGovernment are going to give you an incentive to choose that less \nexpensive system.\n  You may say, well, how can there be a less expensive system that is \ngoing to give the same type of care to seniors? It is called the \nmarketplace. It just happens in the marketplace there are a lot of \nhealth care providers that are willing to give the same or even better \nservices for less than what Medicare today pays to the average senior \nfor fee-for-service.\n  That is because we pay so much for the average care for seniors. We \npay about $4,800 a year. That is a lot of money for seniors. There are \na lot of systems out there that could probably supply that care, and \nmaybe more care--maybe eyeglass care, maybe pharmaceutical care--and do \nit for less than $4,800 a year. To the extent it was less, we were \ngoing to give our seniors the option to choose the least costly service \nwhich may be a better service. And the incentive we were going to give \nthem to do it was to keep the difference. If their plan they choose \nwere to cost $4,500, that today costs us $4,800 to pay for their fee-\nfor-service, and the plan they choose was a fixed-cost system that cost \n$4,500, the senior would keep the $300 difference.\n  That would create three events. No. 1, it would mean that seniors \nwould have an incentive to go out and look for cost-effective health \ncare. No. 2, it would mean the marketplace would respond with lots of \ndifferent opportunities for quality health care. And No. 3, it would \nmean that the Federal Government would get a predictable rate of growth \nin health care. Instead of having a 10 percent rate of growth, we can \nconservatively estimate that the rate of growth would be about 7 \npercent. Why? Because in the private sector, which has done exactly \nthis, which has gone to a variety of different health care programs, \nthe cost of the premiums has actually dropped by about 50 percent.\n  What we are talking about is getting a 30-percent drop in the cost of \npremiums, so we know if we use this opportunity we would have the \nopportunity to control costs especially in the outyears and therefore \ngive us a better chance at maintaining the solvency of the Medicare \ntrust fund.\n  What was the response of President Clinton and his minions when we \nput this plan forward? The response--and we still hear it from \nCongressman Gephardt and his group--was, we are slashing Medicare. We \nare slashing Medicare. Well, we said, Mr. President, tell us what you \nare going to do then to get the system under control. He did not have \nan idea, did not have a proposal. He said, you are just slashing \nMedicare. Let me go scare some seniors and tell them that you are \nslashing Medicare.\n  It was the most demagogic position taken by a President in a long \ntime because it was dealing with such an important issue and they did \nit in such a purely partisan and political way, so demagogic, in fact, \nthat even the Washington Post, which is the spokesman for basically the \nliberal agenda in this country, if you are going to be honest about it, \nin its editorial policy, said that what the President was discussing \nwas ``medagoguery,'' coined a phrase ``medagoguery,'' a very \nappropriate word to add to our lexicon.\n  And so now with the trustees' report coming forward and telling us \nthat the situation has even gotten significantly worse, that the system \nnow instead of going broke in the year 2002 is going to go broke in the \nyear 2001, now we hear rumblings in the administration, murmuring from \nthe administration, well, we have a program to save this, to push it \nout a few years.\n  Let us look at what the administration is proposing because what they \nare proposing is a terribly crass act of intergenerational transfer of \nburden. What they are proposing essentially is to take a major part of \nthe cost of the present Medicare system which is borne by the hospital \ntrust fund and to shift that cost on to all Americans who pay taxes.\n\n[[Page S5919]]\n\n  The program that they are proposing is to take the home health care \nportion of the hospital trust fund, which represents about $55 billion, \nand transfer that out of the hospital trust fund, part A, into \ntheoretically part B. But they do not put it in part B really. What \nthey are doing is they are putting it on the backs of all the taxpayers \nin America. Today, of course, this item, $55 billion in home health \ncare, is paid for out of the hospital trust fund.\n  What does that mean? It means it is paid for by the taxes which go \ninto the trust fund which are to accumulate for the purposes of buying \ninsurance for seniors when you meet the age eligibility requirements. \nAnd so these costs of home health care are supported by the taxes paid \nto the trust fund. But what they are proposing is to take it out of \nthat trust fund, and they put it in the part B trust fund and they have \nit paid for by the general taxpayers.\n  In fact, they go so far in this exercise of political gamesmanship as \nto not only take it out of the hospital part A trust fund, but when \nthey put it into the part B trust fund they do not even require that \nseniors pay what is the traditional percentage of the part B trust \nfund, which is 25 percent.\n  Let me explain that because that is fairly complicated. Basically, \nthe part B trust fund, as many people know, pays for things other than \nhospitalization, other than acute care. Under our system today, a \nsenior citizen pays 25 percent of the costs of their nonacute care, \nnonhospitalization costs, and the general taxpayers, John and Mary \nSmith who are working down at the local restaurant or at the gas \nstation or on an assembly line, they pay 75 percent of the senior \ncitizens' costs for their nonhospitalization. That is the part B trust \nfund.\n  Well, when they took the $55 billion out of the part A trust fund and \nput it into the part B, the administration at the same time said, no, \nseniors are not going to have to pay even the 25 percent. So the full \n$55 billion falls on Mary Smith and John Smith who are working at the \nlocal restaurant, the local gas station, or the local assembly line. \nAnd it is a clear transfer from one generation to the next generation \nof the costs of $55 billion.\n  Does it do anything at all to address the underlying problem of the \nMedicare system, which is that it is growing at an annual rate of 10 \npercent? No, nothing. Absolutely nothing. It does not address the \nprimary problem of the Medicare trust fund one iota. All it does is \ncreate a political benefit for this administration of being able to say \nto seniors, well, by taking $55 billion out of your obligation and \nputting it on your children's back, we have been able to extend the \nlife of the trust fund by a couple of years.\n  That is truly a crass and, I think, cynical approach to addressing \nwhat is a very core and significant problem. Because as I mentioned \nwhen I began the talk, the size of the Medicare problem in the part A \ntrust fund is now estimated to be a $100 billion deficit in the year \n2002. So through this little bit of gamesmanship, they may buy a year \nor two, but they do not do anything at all to address the underlying \nproblem--nothing. All they did is create the ability to go into this \nelection and say to seniors, listen, we corrected this problem.\n  Of course, there is not going to be any asterisks by that which says \nto the seniors' kids, to the children and their grandchildren, oh, I am \nsorry; we just raised your taxes $55 billion--because that is all this \nis. This is a tax increase on the children of our seniors and their \ngrandchildren who are working of $55 billion.\n  Now, it is not unusual for this administration to resolve problems by \nraising taxes. They gave us the largest tax increase in the history of \nthe country which was, under a 5-year budget, $265 billion or $285 \nbillion, but actually now that we are funding under a 7-year budget it \nturns out it was a $550 billion tax. Now, on top of that tax increase \nof $550 billion, they want to hit working Americans with another $55 \nbillion tax increase, while at the same time, and most amazingly with a \nstraight face --and this is what I find rather ironic, they do this \nwith a straight face--at the same time they say to our seniors, oh, we \nhave taken care of the Medicare problem.\n  They have not done a thing about the Medicare problem. There is no \neffort at all in the administration proposal to address the factors \nwhich are driving a 10-percent annual rate of growth in the trust fund. \nIn fact, if anything they have aggravated it because they have taken \nthe $55 billion and put it on the back of the average taxpayer in this \ncountry, John and Mary Jones, working someplace on Main Street. That \nmeans that we created a whole new burden on them, which is an \nentitlement, which they will have to pay taxes on and then expand the \nprogram as a result of lack of accountability, which is the way \nprograms expand around here. They get created as entitlements and put \nin the general fund and then there is no way to control them at all. \nThat is essentially what they are doing here.\n  If you are going to address the Medicare issue, you have to look at \nthe fundamental question, what is driving the rate of growth of \ninflation in Medicare costs? I have heard some pundits saying, ``It is \ndemographics, it is people. It is all the new people coming in the \nsystem.''\n  That is not true at all, not during the timeframe we are talking \nabout. Yes, it is true when the postwar baby boom people hit the \nsystem. When Bill Clinton's generation and mine hit the system it is. \nBut between now and 2010 it is not a demographic issue, it is a \ngenerational issue. It is not a demographic issue. It is a function of \nthe fact that the rate of inflation in health care costs in Medicare \nare dramatically exceeding the rate of inflation of health care costs \nin the private sector and in the costs of health care for people who \nare under the age of 60.\n  Last year, the rate of growth in the premium costs of people under \nthe age of 60 was flat, essentially no inflation. The rate of growth of \nMedicare was 10 percent. You can see that is what is driving the \nproblem with the Medicare trust fund. So, until you address that rate \nof growth of costs of the health care in Medicare you are not going to \nbe able to make the system solvent.\n  So, when the Republicans came forward last year and put down a \nproposal which was aimed specifically at bringing market forces into \nplay in the Medicare system, taking it out of the system which is a \n1960's system designed for the health care delivery system of the \n1950's, and moving it into the 1990's by bringing market forces into \nit--when we did that we put forward a proposal which was fundamentally \nsound and which was directed at the core problem, which was the fact \nthat the rate of growth of health care costs was too great. Through the \nuse of market forces we tried to control that.\n  What we have here essentially, in the Medicare system, is a 1959 \nChevrolet driving down a 1990's highway. It has not been repaired. The \nhubcaps have fallen off, it is running on three pistons, the exhaust \nsystem is spewing out pollution, and it cannot keep up to speed. What \nwe suggested, as Republicans, is that we should put a new car on the \n1990 highway, something that can keep up with the times and something \nthat would actually give the seniors a better choice of options for \nhealth care delivery.\n  What the White House suggested, what the administration suggested, \nwas that we simply get more oil and more gas and pour it into the car, \nthe 1959 Chevrolet, and we get that oil and gas from John and Mary \nJones, who are working on Main Street. It was a cynical act, to say the \nleast. Exceeded, of course, by their statements that our proposals were \nslashing and cutting Medicare. That was the most cynical act by this \nWhite House, but in the tradition of that, equally or competitively \nsimilar, to suggest we should make this type of a transfer.\n\n  If we are going to resolve the Medicare problem, we are going to have \nto have a White House which thinks about something other than \nreelection; that thinks about substantive policy, that thinks about how \nyou govern, not how you get reelected to govern.\n  I have not seen any sense that that is the character of this White \nHouse, but there is still time. Republicans still have on the table a \nproposal which would substantively improve the Medicare system, and do \nit in a way that would lead to a real direction of solvency for the \ntrust fund, rather than to a shell game of transferring burden from one \ngeneration to the next. I hope, if nothing else, the American public \nwill see through the games that\n\n[[Page S5920]]\n\nthe White House has been playing on this and would put some pressure on \nthe administration to begin to act responsibly in this area.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the key measures of any government \nis how well it protects the people from the threat of violent crime. In \nthe preamble to our Constitution, the charter of our Government, we are \ntold the purpose of Government is to ``establish Justice, insure \ndomestic Tranquility * * *''\n  Only by doing those things and doing them well do we hope to ``secure \nthe Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity * * *''\n  I would like to talk today about the record of the Clinton \nadministration in regard to crime. In doing so, I will contend that \nmere words are not enough to fulfill that sacred trust between \nGovernment and the people. To fulfill its obligation, its obligation to \nprotect people from crime, Government must act.\n  One of the President's closest advisers said recently, ``Words are \nactions.'' Words are actions. They really are, Mr. President. The \nrecord of this administration gives grave cause for doubt.\n  For 2 years, 1993 and 1994, President Clinton and his party \ncontrolled the White House and both Houses of Congress. One-party \ncontrol means the party in charge generally gets to set the agenda. It \nis pretty clear that the fight against crime should be at the top of \nany sensible national agenda.\n  Violent crime remains at historic highs. Every year 43 million \nAmericans become victims of crime, and 10 million become victims of \nviolent crime. Juvenile crime is a problem now of historic proportions.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, there is no reason to believe that this is \ngoing to change unless we take some very drastic measures. Here is why. \nViolent crimes by young people age 18 to 24 have gone up 50 percent \nsince 1986. These young predators are moving coldly, dangerously into a \ncareer that will wreak havoc on their communities for years to come. \nThat is bad enough.\n  But it will get even worse, even scarier, because while crime among \n18- to 24-year-olds has gone up 50 percent, crime by even younger \noffenders, those aged 14 to 17, has gone up 150 percent--150 percent--\nsince 1986. So if we think violent crime is bad now, wait until these \n14- to 17-year-olds get into their prime age for crime, the late teens \nand early twenties. The problem we will have to face is when today's \nviolent teenagers grow up. They are going to be a major social force in \nthis country. To me, that would indicate cause for serious concern \nabout the kind of America we are going to have in the next couple of \ndecades.\n  Mr. President, the picture is bad in regard to violent crime. But, \nunfortunately, it does not get any better when we look at the issue of \ndrugs. Since the Reagan-Bush years, marijuana use has tripled--\ntripled--among those 14 years of age and 15 years of age. In 1992, 1.6 \nmillion young people were reported to have used marijuana--1.6. Today \nthat number has risen to 2.9 million.\n  Mr. President, one good way to find out what our real social problems \nare is to visit a hospital emergency room. Today cocaine-related \nepisodes have hit their highest level in history. People talk about the \n1980's as the cocaine decade. But visit any emergency room and you will \nsee that it is even worse today.\n  Heroin-related episodes are rising, too. They jumped 66 percent in \n1993 and have stayed at that higher level.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I think any fair observer would \ncharacterize this as a very bleak picture. A fair observer would say \nthat violent crime, especially youth violence, is a major challenge to \nAmerica and very probably the single greatest challenge we face in this \ncountry.\n  Let us talk for a moment about how the U.S. Government has coped with \nthis crisis. Let us examine what the new Clinton administration wanted \nto do after they took office, what it proposed to do in its first 2 \nyears. Then let us examine what the Clinton administration actually \naccomplished in its first 2 years. Finally, I would like to examine \nwhat was accomplished after the first 2 years.\n  Let us start first with the new administration's proposals. So I \nbegin with the first phase: The new Clinton administration and its \nagenda and what they wanted to do.\n\n  For 2 years, Mr. President, 1993 and 1994, we had an undivided \nGovernment, a Government under the control of a single party. A \nPresident with a free hand could create positive change and do what is \nnecessary to protect the American people from the plague of violent \ncrime. What use was made of this opportunity? What did the new \nadministration propose to do about this major national crisis?\n  Here is the answer. Here, Mr. President, if you can believe it, is \nwhat the new administration proposed to do. This is what the \nPresident's budget proposed to do. The President wanted to cut 790 \nagents out of the FBI. The President wanted to cut 311 agents out of \nthe DEA. The President wanted to cut 123 prosecutors, take them out of \nthe Federal courts. The President wanted to construct zero--zero--new \nFederal prisons. Finally, the President wanted to cut prison personnel \nby 1,600. That was the proposed response of the Clinton administration \nto this major national crisis.\n  It is true, Mr. President, that much of this agenda did not actually \nbecome a reality. It did not happen because, fortunately, congressional \napproval was required. Again, fortunately, concerned Senators on both \nsides of the aisle said to the administration, ``No. No way. We're not \ngoing to do it.'' Thanks to Senators like Orrin Hatch, Joe Biden, Pete \nDomenici, Fritz Hollings, much of that misguided agenda was not passed, \nwas defeated.\n  Let me turn, Mr. President, to the actual Clinton administration \nrecord. There is, Mr. President, of course, a lot that the President of \nthe United States can do without congressional approval. The President \nhas a great deal of discretion. Let us look at what the new \nadministration actually did without congressional approval. I think \nwhen we look at this we will find that on every front of the war on \ncrime there was a monumental retreat.\n  First, no new FBI agents were trained. No class. No FBI class.\n  Second, the White House Office of Drug Policy was absolutely gutted, \nan 83 percent cut in staff.\n  Next, the prosecution of gun criminals went down 20 percent. The \nprosecution in Federal court of those who use a gun in the commission \nof a felony went down 20 percent.\n  Prosecution of drug criminals--drug criminals--went down 12.5 \npercent.\n  No new FBI agents trained, the White House drug office was gutted, \ngun prosecutions down 20 percent, drug prosecutions down 12.5 percent. \nThat is what the President did by himself.\n  Here is what else actually happened under the President's leadership.\n  Federal spending on drug interdiction went down 14 percent. The \nFederal drug budget accounts that fund antismuggling efforts dropped by \n55 percent. In fact, the Clinton administration made a conscious \ndecision to ignore the fact that drugs were coming into this country. \nThey thought it would be enough to focus on the drugs once they were \nalready in the country.\n  But, Mr. President, we should make no mistake, spending less on \ninterdiction does have consequences. It does make a difference. \nAccording to recent Federal law enforcement statistics, the disruption \nrate, the amount of drugs that are blocked from actually entering the \ncountry, dropped 53 percent between 1993 and early 1995. The projection \nis an additional 84 metric tons of marijuana and cocaine coming into \nthe United States every year.\n\n  What was the result of this cut? What was the result of this change \nin policy by the administration, change in emphasis?\n\n[[Page S5921]]\n\n  Since 1991, Coast Guard seizures of cocaine are down 45 percent. \nCoast Guard seizures of marijuana are down 90 percent. The Clinton \nadministration, unfortunately, has ignored a fundamental fact: Spending \nmoney on the antidrug effort does make a difference. When we make the \nantidrug fight a national priority, drug use does drop. Between 1981 \nand 1992 Federal spending on the drug war effort rose 700 percent. Over \nroughly the same period, drug use was cut in half.\n  But, tragically, the opposite has happened under the Clinton \nadministration. Drugs have gotten cheaper. They are more easily \navailable and more pervasive in the lives of our young people. Between \n1993 and 1995, the retail price of a gram of cocaine fell during that \n2-year period from $172 to $137. Over roughly the same period, \nanswering a survey, the number of 8th graders who think it is bad to \neven try crack once or twice dropped from 61 percent to 51 percent. And \noverall teenage drug use is up 55 percent.\n\n  On measure after measure in the years 1993 and 1994, America's \nanticrime and antidrug effort lost ground. That was the Clinton \nadministration's record of accomplishment. They faced a tough problem \nand had to make tough choices. The sad litany I have recited is the \nbest they could do.\n  Now, moving to the third item I want to talk about, in 1995 there was \na major change in the landscape of Federal crime-fighting policy. The \nnew Senate came under new leadership. Over the last 16 months under \nthat new leadership, a dramatically different effort on the issue of \ncrime has emerged. Since January 1995, the majority leader, Senator \nDole, took over the helm of America's anticrime strategy. Here is \nAmerica's new strategy for fighting crime: FBI agents, up 20 percent; \nDEA agents, up 15 percent; $800 million in new funding for Federal \nprosecutors; $3 billion in new funding for prisons; $1 billion in \ngrants to States and local communities so they can fight crime at the \ngrassroots level from neighborhood to neighborhood to neighborhood.\n  Mr. President, that is a truly remarkable change. I do not believe it \nis just a coincidence. A pattern of differences as striking as this can \nlead to only one tenable conclusion. Only one major factor intervened \nbetween the dismal record of 1993 and 1994 and the truly remarkable \nresurgence in the Federal crime-fighting effort that has occurred over \nthe last 16 months.\n  That one factor, Mr. President, is the new management in the Senate \nand the House. I suggest Senator Bob Dole be given the credit he \ndeserves for changing the culture of Washington in this very important \nway.\n  Mr. President, politics has been defined as the art of the possible. \nThe best definition of leadership I ever heard is this: ``Leadership is \nthe art of changing the limits of what's possible.''\n  Over the last 16 months, Mr. President, we have seen this happen in \nthe fight against crime. I think it is time that Senator Dole got the \nrecognition he deserves for a very, very impressive accomplishment. \nFurther, Mr. President, I believe people should be paying more \nattention to actions and accomplishments than simply to election year \nconversions and all the rhetoric that they spawn.\n  The former chairman of the House Committee on Narcotics, a Democrat, \nonce said he had ``Never seen a President care less about drugs,'' \nreferring to the President of the United States. The lackluster war on \ndrugs is just one symptom of an overall abdication on the issue of \ncrime itself.\n  Mr. President, as we prepare to say goodbye to Majority Leader Dole, \nlet me say I speak for many when I observe that we will miss his \nexcellent leadership on this very vital and important issue. We owe him \nour thanks not for his words but, rather, for his actions.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5920-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5921-S5922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT VOTES\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we probably all have been guilty at one time \nor another of getting a little carried away on the Senate floor when we \nare trying to present our position on an issue. I think we saw a little \nbit of that yesterday by those of us who want to protect Social \nSecurity, and I would like to take a minute to respond to some of \nthose, I think, inflammatory remarks.\n  I think the junior Senator from Oklahoma was right on the edge when \nhe was talking about the 33 Senators that had previously voted in \nopposition to a balanced budget which included the use of Social \nSecurity. It has been said that to treat your facts with imagination is \none thing, but to imagine your facts is another. We saw just how big \nsome people's imaginations were yesterday.\n  I was 1 of those 33. The junior Senator from Oklahoma accused me of \ncoming to Washington and voting one way and going back to my State and \ntalking another. I am sure he does not know how I talk in Kentucky. I \nam sure he does not follow me around. I am sure he does not take the \npaper clips from my newspapers to see how I am quoted in my local \npaper.\n  Mr. President, I thought we were beyond the pony express era. I \nthought that we were on C-SPAN and 60 million people could immediately \nsee how you vote and what you say and they would know that before you \nget home. I have represented my State, now, for almost 22 years here in \nthe Senate. I have been fortunate to have been reelected by a large \npercentage. I think when I vote and I explain my vote to my people some \nmay not like it but they understand the reason for it.\n  Mr. President, I voted for a balanced budget amendment until this \ntime. Then we were labeled, yesterday, as BBA 6. So I am one of the BBA \n6's now. I do not know exactly what that means, except when the \nleadership on the Republican side sat down in the Democratic Cloakroom, \nand with a fountain pen wrote how much money they would be taking from \nSocial Security each of the next 7 years, how much they would be taking \nfrom Social Security to balance the budget, that is when I reneged. \nThat is when I said if you want my vote, put a firewall in as it \nrelates to Social Security. Now I have that piece of paper, Mr. \nPresident. It is in my file and I will keep it. It is the handwriting \nof some of the leadership on the Republican side, how many billions of \ndollars, and as I recall the last 2 years, roughly $147 billion they \nwere going to take out of Social Security trust fund.\n  Now, when the junior Senator from Oklahoma says those of us who voted \n``no'' last time, the 33, did not want a balanced budget, I just \ndisagree with that. How can he say I do not want a balanced budget \namendment? All I say is build a firewall for Social Security. You could \nhave 70-odd votes if you do that. It would be easy to pass. But, no, \nthe Republicans want an issue. They want an issue. They do not want it \npassed. They lost a vote today for one reason and one reason only. You \nare talking about star wars, and you have one of the greatest minds as \nit relates to defense in this country in the Senate in Sam Nunn, the \nSenator from Georgia, who was vehemently opposed. He said you are \nmandating that we put it in to spend $60 billion and you do not know \nwhether it will work. Let us research it for another 3 years. You are \nnot going to get it up any faster. Then in 3 years you will know it \nwill work, and then let us do it. No, we were forced into the vote on \nthe basis that we shall do it whether we know if it will work or not, \nand at a cost of $60 billion, and that is right behind that attempted \n$700 billion tax break--in one day. And the next day, they holler, \n``The sky is falling.'' So you have turned at least one Senator off as \nit relates to the political tactics being used on the Senate floor.\n\n  Now, we have 10 fictitious reasons for voting against the balanced \nbudget amendment. There is only one reason, in my mind. We have heard a \nlot about a contract. We have heard a lot about a contract now for \nalmost 2 years. Well, we had a contract with the farmers called the \nFreedom to Farm Act. Signed it, passed it. A contract. Within\n\n[[Page S5922]]\n\n7 weeks, you are breaking that contract. The House Agriculture \nAppropriations Committee was eliminating almost $100 million out of the \npayments to the farmers that they thought they had signed up for next \nyear. You are reducing WIC by having it frozen. You are reducing \nnutrition programs by $300 million on the House side. Contracts are \nbeing broken. I thought both sides had agreed to a contract. Both sides \nwere committed to it. Therefore, we find that we are already breaking \ncontracts.\n  When you are going to use Social Security funding, then I think we \nare breaking a contract with those who are expecting that. Sure, we are \nhaving a bump in the road on Medicare. We all understand that. The \nPresident has submitted two budgets reducing part A. Now, everybody \ntalks about Medicare and paints it with a broad brush. It is part A \nthat is short, not part B. Part A is the hospital and part B is the \ndoctor, if you want to put it into categories. So part A is the part \nhaving problems. Part B still has a surplus. Part B will have a surplus \nfrom now on, the way things are going.\n  So we have one part of Medicare to be fixed. Even now, there is a \n$100 billion surplus in part A, as I understand it. If you continue to \nuse it, over a period of time, that will be reduced to zero. You need \nto keep it at a level where it will not be reduced and where the level \nwill stay the same over the next 7 years.\n  Mr. President, if Social Security were protected, we could pass the \nbalanced budget amendment and get on with actually passing our spending \nbills. We hear a lot about how bad things have been. I have been here \n22 years now. I did not see any vetoes, under the Republican \nadministration, as it related to tax increases and spending increases. \nI did not see those vetoes. We did not have enough votes to override \nthem, if the Republicans would have stayed together. But, no, we went \nfrom a $900 billion deficit to $5 trillion in 12 years under Republican \nleadership. During that time, Republicans had 6 years of control here \nin the Senate Chamber. Could you have supported a veto? Absolutely, you \ncould have sustained a veto.\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not mind debating the issues, but I \ncertainly hate to be singled out and it becomes a personal issue. As I \nsay, the junior Senator from Oklahoma came very close to the edge of \nbeing challenged under the rules of the Senate yesterday. So I just \nhope that, as we debate the issues, we eliminate the personalities and \nthe personal attacks. It is nice to have a picture of your grandson \nhere on the Senate floor. I have five grandchildren. I enjoy \ngrandchildren. But do you know something? It is hard for me to believe, \nas a grandfather, that if I watched my daughter give birth to a son, my \ngrandson--as I read the Record and listened to him yesterday, in his \nfirst breath, it was handed to him and the first thing he thought about \nis that this poor child owes $18,000 in back taxes, or he has that debt \non him. I would have thanked the Lord for my daughter coming through \nthe delivery healthy. I would thank the Lord for being given a healthy \nbaby before worrying about how much tax load or debt load that newborn \nbaby had. Nevertheless, I am sure the taxpayers had something to do \nwith paying for the picture of that grandson that was here on the \nSenate floor.\n\n  So here we are getting personal again, and I do not like it. The only \nway I know how to say to my colleagues that think the debate is about \nwho supports a balanced budget--this is a debate about who wants to \nsave Medicare. This is a debate about who wants to raid Medicare, who \nwants to cut the deficit, and that sort of thing. Those issues are \nfine. But when I am accused of voting one way here and going home and \nsaying another thing--the day of the Pony Express is over. It is \ninstantaneous what I say and do here, and it is getting to my \nconstituents.\n  So while people are predicting doom and gloom again today, the BB-6 \ncan point to a record of deficit reduction and a commitment to balance \nthe budget, while protecting the pact we made with citizens to protect \nSocial Security. So we passed a bill in 1990, under a Republican \nPresident, signed by him, not to include the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, are we proceeding as in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, for a period of up to 10 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5921-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5922-S5926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM BILL\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this afternoon, there were some \ncomments made about where we are on the Kassebaum-Kennedy health reform \nbill. I wanted to just take a few moments of the Senate's time to \nreview a little bit of the bidding on where we have been, where we are, \nand what the hope is in terms of the future.\n  Mr. President, as we know, this legislation was developed by Senator \nKassebaum, myself, and other members of our Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee in the wake of the 1994 debate on comprehensive health care. \nIt was really reflective of the expressions that were made by \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, both the now majority leader, Senator \nDole, and others on the Democratic side, who said, ``Let us try to find \ncommon ground together, areas where we agree. Let us try, if we cannot \ndo a comprehensive program, to at least shape a proposal that can make \na difference to millions of Americans--particularly those with \npreexisting conditions--recognizing the importance of portability, \nmoving from one job to another, being able to carry the insurance if, \nfor some reason, an individual loses their job, or the company closes \ndown.''\n  Over the period of really the last months, and even over recent \nyears, that proposal has been working its way through the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee. It had virtually unanimous support of \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, and it has worked its way through the \nSenate with 100 votes. Unanimity, Mr. President, 100 votes--a unanimous \nvote here in the Senate and in our committee. I find that to be an \nextraordinarily rare occasion, when you take something that can provide \nsuch a meaningful difference and provide relief for families and for \nworking families, a measure that can make a very important difference, \nparticularly to those with preexisting conditions.\n  The efforts of Senator Kassebaum and myself have been to try to keep \nthe legislation clean--that is, to try to resist various amendments, in \nspite of the fact that we might have agreed with some of those \nprovisions at other times. That was certainly true in my case with \nregard to the excellent proposals that were added to the measure by \nSenator Domenici and Senator Wellstone on mental health. I feel very \nstrongly that it is about time that we treat mental health in the way \nthat we consider other serious illnesses, and not make the \nconsideration of mental health a stepchild in our health care policy \nareas.\n  Nonetheless, we had worked out a process where we were going to try \nto move ahead with the areas that we could agree on, so that we can \nmove through this legislative process with that in mind. We accepted \nsome matters that were overwhelmingly supported by Members of the \nSenate where there was no serious objection.\n  We accepted the mental health provisions. But it has always been the \nposition of the Senator from Kansas and myself that we were going to be \ncommitted to a proposal that would provide just the measures which \ninitially came out of the committee unless we were going to be able to \nconvince our Members in the conference that we needed to make at least \nsome progress in the areas of mental health.\n  Senator Domenici, Senator Wellstone, I must say Tipper Gore, who has \nbeen enormously interested in the areas of mental health, have all \nweighed in in terms of making the case once again of the importance of \nextending some protections to the area of mental health. That is an \nissue which I know is still under consideration by at least those that \nare meeting. I can point out for the Members of the Senate, that those \nmeetings have not included the Members of this side of the aisle, but \nwe have tried to work in a constructive way in at least getting some of \nthese ideas forward for the consideration of those who are in the room.\n  I want to just mention parenthetically that there were some comments\n\n[[Page S5923]]\n\nmade earlier today on the issue of appointing conferees. It has always \nbeen our position that we should have conferees that reflect at least \nthe will of the Senate, but the various proposals that have been made \nhere in terms of the conferees were not even close to the ratio of \nRepublican to Democrat. We were not going to agree to a stacked deck \nand a position that would not reflect the will of the Senate.\n  It always interests me how worked up some of our Members can become \nwhen they are talking with this righteous sense of indignation about \nthe fact that there is some objection to the appointment of the \nconferees, particularly in the way and the numbers in which they were \nsuggested. There has never been any reluctance to naming conferees that \nwere going to be reflective and represent the committees that had the \nprime jurisdiction. That is the way it has been done here. The \nparticular proportion that was suggested was completely out of order, \nwhich is why we are in that stalemate.\n  Most importantly, we are prepared to see the measure that passed 100 \nto nothing here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, or the measure that \npassed unanimously out of our committee, to pass out of the conference, \nto pass the House of Representatives, to pass the Senate and be signed \nby the President of the United States in the matter of the next day or \ntwo. That is what we are able to do as legislators. That would make a \ndifference to the 25 million Americans each year who would be helped by \nthis bill--who would find that they are able to be assured of \ncontinuing attention to their particular health needs as long as they \nwere going to pay their participation in premiums.\n  We have the opportunity to move on that legislation. It is still out \nthere. We are caught in a situation evidently that unless we are \nprepared to accept other measures which have been controversial and \ndivisive and recognized as such, or where at least very important \nquestions have been raised about those matters, that we cannot make \nprogress unless we are prepared to bend on those matters. It is still \nmy hope that even at this very sensitive time in the discussions where \nleaders in the House and leaders in the Senate are attempting to try to \nmake at least one additional effort to try to find the common ground, \nthat we can still resolve this and be able to respond to the millions \nof our fellow citizens that have these preexisting conditions and want \nto be able to carry their health care measures with them.\n  But I want to take just a few moments of the Senate's time this \nafternoon--I see other colleagues. Could I ask for 5 more minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I appreciate it.\n  Mr. President, I still hope that we will be able to achieve this \nmeasure.\n  I have gone into, in some detail, the principal concerns of the \nissues on medical savings account. But there are a few items that have \nbeen mentioned with regard to medical savings accounts that were not \nmentioned here in the course of this afternoon.\n  Let us understand that if insurance companies want to sell medical \nsavings accounts, they can do that today. They do not need to have \nadditional legislation. For those that say let us have the free choice, \nindividuals can be out and purchase those measures at the present time. \nA number of States have begun to set up their own medical savings \naccounts. So the idea that we are denying some kind of free choice is \nvirtually inaccurate and a distortion and a gross misrepresentation \nabout where the medical savings account issue is.\n  Individual companies--and there are the companies, for example, like \nthe Golden Rule Insurance Co., that are out selling medical savings \naccounts today. Of course, it is true that Golden Rule Insurance Co. \nhas been drummed out of the State of Vermont because of the way that \nthey have exploited consumers. And it is true that Golden Rule \nInsurance Co., the principal company that would benefit from medical \nsavings insurance companies, refuses to share market information with \neven the American Academy of Actuaries so that we could get a real \nreflection as to what has been the experience of that company. When \nasked by the American Academy to share their data, Golden Rule said, \nabsolutely no, we will not do that, even though they have experienced \nextraordinary profits in this area.\n  Nonetheless, Mr. President, one of the factors that was not raised \nthis afternoon was the fact that we are talking about the cost to the \nAmerican taxpayers by those that are proposing medical savings \naccounts. The Joint Tax Committee has estimated that if there were just \nto be 1 million Americans out of the pool of about 130 million \nAmericans who purchase health insurance, if we have to have 1 million \nof those, the cost to the taxpayers and to the deficit would be $3 \nbillion for 1 million people. That is not what I am saying. That is \nwhat the Joint Tax Committee is saying.\n  We are talking about when you are going from 1 million to 10 million \nto 20 million, or as the Rand Corp. considered, 70 million, you do not \nneed much of a slide rule to understand what this is going to do to the \nFederal deficit, let alone health care policy.\n  So it is so interesting to me to hear out there many of our Members \nsaying, ``All we want is freedom. All we want is freedom.'' Sure it is \nall they want is freedom to put their hands into the till of the \nFederal Government and take out billions of dollars to subsidize what \nwill be primarily a benefit for the richest individuals in this \ncountry; the richest individuals in this country. And we pointed that \nout over the course of the debate and the discussion. I heard one of my \ncolleagues talk about the fact that there were some Democrats that \nwanted this at another time. At another time, we were talking in the \ncontext of a comprehensive health care reform where we were going to \nhave effective cost controls, an entirely different situation than we \nhave today.\n  So those who are out on the floor with their big charts saying what \nis wrong with these words that were stated a few years ago, I daresay \nthat is when we were talking about a comprehensive program with \neffective kinds of cost containment, which is not what we are dealing \nwith today. Anyone should understand it. I question whether it would \nhave been really justified even at that time. But, nonetheless, there \nwere those that believed it ought to be given a try, and that was an \nissue within that context that I think was legitimate. But that is not \nwhat we are talking about.\n  Make no mistake about it. We are talking about underwriting the \nhealth care insurance for the wealthiest individuals at the expense of \nthe average taxpayer. The Joint Tax Committee has pointed out, well, if \nyou spend $3 billion, how much of that would go to average working \nfamilies? How much would they benefit from that? One percent of that $3 \nbillion would benefit average working families. Who gets the rest of \nthe 99 percent? The ones that get the rest of the 99 percent are going \nto be in the highest income brackets. That is just one issue that ought \nto be debated and discussed.\n  There is a body of opinion in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives that support this concept. Certainly we ought to have \nan opportunity to review it. We ought to examine it. We ought to have \nat least an opportunity to see whether the greatest fears about what it \nwould mean in terms of cost and what it would mean in terms of skewing \nthe whole insurance system and what it would mean in terms of \npreventive care are true--we ought to at least have an opportunity to \ntest that.\n  The President of the United States has indicated that he would sign a \nbill, if there was a proposal that would really test this idea, in an \narea that provided a real test about medical theory and about the costs \nof this program over a reasonable period of time, which seems to me to \nbe a reasonable position. Why we have to deal with this at this time is \nbeyond me. But nonetheless, it is a matter which is at least before the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, I will include in my full comments the various \nopinions that have been made about the American actuaries, what they \nbelieve will be the impact in terms of the cost of health insurance, \nthe analysis which has been made about who would use this, who would \nbenefit and who would suffer under this program, what the impact would \nbe on children who are so often the ones who are left out and left\n\n[[Page S5924]]\n\nbehind, and the fact that medical savings accounts will effectively \ndiscourage all preventive care in terms of needy children in our \nsociety and what the Congressional Research Service said was going to \nbe the health implications. These are important matters. I believe that \nthe Senate, before it is going to jump into this program, ought to have \nvery complete answers to it.\n  So I hope if we are going to have an opportunity--and certainly we \nshould at some time--to get to the issue of medical savings account, \nthe American people ought to understand that we have the opportunity in \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States to do \nsomething meaningful for millions and millions and millions of American \nfamilies today. We have a proposal that will make a difference to those \nfamilies--more than 25 million of those families. It passed unanimously \nin the House and the Senate of the United States, with broad bipartisan \nsupport. Our urging is that we take that very important, modest but \nvery, very important proposal and that we move it down to the \nPresident's desk and we get on with it. If there are other measures \nthat ought to be debated, let us debate them but not on this bill.\n  Mr. President, if we follow that recommendation of the Senator from \nKansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] and those of us who are members of the \ncommittee, we can do something truly worthy to be remembered in the \narea of health care reform.\n  Mr. President, medical savings accounts do not belong in the \nKassebaum-Kennedy health insurance reform bill. They have already been \nrejected by the Senate. A bill containing them cannot be enacted into \nlaw and signed by the President. They are an untried idea with the \npotential to destroy the access to affordable, comprehensive coverage \nthat tens of millions of Americans now enjoy.\n  Millions of Americans need insurance reform, so that they can be \nsecure in the knowledge that their health care, coverage cannot be \ntaken away because they become sick, because they change jobs, or \nbecause they lose their job. Their hopes should not be held hostage to \nthis extremist, special interest proposal. But because the Republican \nleadership in the House and Senate is pursuing a rule or ruin approach \nto this legislation, their hopes may be dashed once again.\n  Medical savings accounts sound good in theory. Why not encourage \nbusinesses and individuals to buy less costly high-deductible health \ninsurance policies and put the premium savings into a tax-free account \nthat can be used to pay some routine medical costs? But in this case, \nwhat sounds like good medicine in theory is quack medicine in practice.\n  Medical savings accounts are an idea whose time should never come. \nUnder conservative estimates by the Joint Tax Committee they are a $3 \nbillion tax break for the wealthy and healthy. As the Center on Budget \nand Policy Priorities said, ``MSAs create new tax shelter \nopportunities. Use of an MSA would be highly advantageous to \nsubstantial numbers of higher income taxpayers. Low and moderate-income \ntaxpayers would receive little or no tax benefits from using MSAs \nbecause they either do not pay income taxes or pay taxes at much lower \nrates.'' The American Academy of Actuaries concluded that medical \nsavings accounts are ``Taxing money from the unhealthy and giving it to \nthe healthy.'' The Joint Tax Committee estimated that only 1 percent of \nthe tax benefits would go to people with incomes of less than $30,000.\n  If more people enroll in these accounts than Joint Tax has estimated, \nas many analysts believe will happen, the cost could rise to the tens \nof billions. How ironic that those who are loudest in their clamor to \nreduce the deficit are willing to waste these vast sums on this \ndestructive special interest boondoggle. If we have billions to spare, \nthey should be spent on reducing the cost of coverage for hard-working \nAmerican families or on deficit reduction--not on a perverse income \ntransfer from the poor and sick to the healthy and rich.\n  Medical savings accounts raise premiums for the vast majority of \nAmericans--especially those who are sick and need coverage the most--by \nsiphoning the healthiest people out of the insurance pool. As premiums \nrise, more and more working families will be forced to drop coverage. \nIn the words of the Congressional Budget Office, medical savings \naccounts ``could threaten the existence of standard health insurance.'' \nMary Nell Lenhardt, Senior Vice-President of Blue Cross and Blue Shield \nconcluded, that MSAs destroy ``the whole principle of insurance.'' A \nnew report by the Urban Institute concludes that, even under \nconservative assumption, premiums for comprehensive coverage could rise \nby 40 percent. If a higher proportion of people shift to MSAs, the cost \nof comprehensive coverage could rise by more than 300 percent.\n  Moderate income people who choose medical savings accounts could be \nexposed to financial disaster if someone in the family becomes \nseriously ill. As the American Academy of Actuaries said, ``individuals \nand families who experience significant medical expenses soon after the \nestablishment of MSA programs will face high out-of-pocket costs. These \nhigh out-of-pocket costs will not be randomly distributed. They will be \nconcentrated among older workers and their families and among those \nwith disabilities and chronic illness.'' The last thing that the \nAmerican people need--especially those who need health care the most--\nis another massive increase in the cost of medical care.\n  Because they encourage high deductible plans, medical savings \naccounts discourage preventive care. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, high deductible plans that come with MSAs have meant \nthat poor children are 40 percent less likely to get the care they need \nas compared to fully-insured children. This is the wrong direction for \nhealth policy.\n  Medical savings accounts are a giveaway to the insurance companies \nwho have the worst record of profiting from the abuses of the current \nsystem. But the American people should not have to pay such a high \nprice to reward them--even in return for $1.5 million in campaign \ncontributions over the last 5 years. It is no accident that a company \nlike Golden Rule Insurance favors medical savings accounts. This is a \ncompany that is ranked near the bottom by consumer reports because of \nits inadequate coverage, frequent rate increases, and readiness to \ncancel policies. When Golden Rule withdrew from Vermont because they \nwere unwilling to compete on the level playing field created by \ninsurance reform, Blue Cross and Blue Shield took over their policies. \nThey found that one in four policies included an exemption. Whole body \nparts, like arms, backs, breasts, and even skin were written out of \ncoverage. Newborns were excluded unless they were born healthy.\n  The Republican medical savings account plan includes absolutely no \nguarantees that companies profiting from selling these policies will be \nprevented from abuses like this in the individual market. Moreover, \nalthough MSA's are billed as providing catastrophic protection, there \nis no requirement that they have reasonable life-time limits or not \nimpose excessive co-payments when the deductible level is reached.\n  It is shocking that the very company that has provided the financial \nengine behind this right-wing proposal has refused to share any data \nabout its plans with the American Academy of Actuaries or other \nimpartial analysts. Golden Rule knows that medical savings accounts \ncan't stand the light of day--and that's why they are tying to ram them \nthrough on a bill that the American people want.\n  Some Republicans are anxious to include MSA's in the insurance reform \nbill because MSA's are part of their long-run plan to dismantle \nMedicare and turn it over to private insurance companies. This is a \nfoot in the door for that item on the right-wing agenda--and this, too, \nhas no place in an insurance reform program.\n  No respectable health policy analyst supports medical savings \naccounts. Newspapers from the Washington Post to the New York Times to \nthe Los Angeles Times to the Boston Globe have condemned them. The \nPresident has said that they could doom the bill's prospects for \nbecoming law. They don't belong in this bill--and I urge my colleagues \nto reject them.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to say a word about the charge \nthat I\n\n[[Page S5925]]\n\nam blocking the appointment of conferees. The fact is that the list of \nproposed conferees the Republican leadership has offered is \nunprecedented in its unfairness. In the last three Congresses, there \nhas been no conference that has been so stacked. The only reason for \nthis unacceptable proposal is to try to ram medical savings accounts--a \nproposal the Senate has already rejected and which will kill the bill--\ninto insurance reform.\n  Republicans leaders know that Americans want the reforms promised in \nthis bill and have little interest in medical savings accounts. That is \nwhy Representative Kasich said, on March 24, ``We will not let medical \nsavings accounts destroy the ability to give people portability and \neliminate pre-existing conditions.'' On March 29, Speaker Gingrich said \nhe would not let medical savings accounts stand in the way of a \nPresidential signature. But the American people should know that there \nis a vast gap between the words and the reality. In spite of repeated \noffers from the Democrats to sit down and discuss the issues in the \nbill, in spite of three separate Democratic proposals for a sensible \ncompromise on medical savings accounts, Republican leaders have been \nunwilling to negotiate and unwilling to back off their insistence on \nthis poison pill.\n  Whether the issue is tax fairness, preservation of comprehensive \nhealth insurance for the vast majority of Americans, or the special \ninterests versus the general interests, medical savings accounts are \nbad medicine for our health care system. They are a poison pill that \nwould kill health insurance reform. The Senate has already spoken. It \nis time to send a clean bill to President Clinton without further \ndelay. The American people are waiting.\n\n\n                 problems with medical savings accounts\n\n                   1. lavish tax breaks for the rich\n\n       The $1.7 billion revenue loss will go almost exclusively to \n     the highest income and healthiest Americans.\n       Joint Tax Committee Analysis concludes that less than 1% of \n     those who will purchase MSAs under this amendment will make \n     less than $30,000 a year. Virtually no one will purchase \n     these plans who makes less than $20,000 a year.\n       The well-to-do will be able to use MSA as a second IRA, \n     except that this IRA will have no income limits and will \n     accrue disproportionately to the extremely wealthy. People \n     choosing this option with large assets can use their own \n     money to pay their medical bills and protect their tax \n     deferred MSA savings.\n       Health care analysts are virtually unanimous in their \n     opposition to MSAs.\n       The American Academy of Actuaries says that MSAs are, \n     ``Taking money from the unhealthy and giving it to the \n     healthy.''\n       The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says, ``MSAs \n     create new tax shelter opportunities. Use of an MSA would be \n     highly advantageous to substantial members of high income \n     taxpayers.''\n\n\n              2. hand-out to golden rule insurance company\n\n       To select MSAs, an individual is required to select a \n     catastrophic insurance plan, and Golden Rule is one of the \n     largest marketers of catastrophic plans in the country. MSAs \n     would simply allow Golden Rule to greatly enlarge their \n     market.\n       The company has given $1.6 million in political \n     contributions to Republicans over the last 5 years.\n       They are near the bottom of insurance company rankings done \n     by consumer groups, such as Consumers' Union, because they \n     provide inadequate coverage, frequent rating increases, very \n     aggressive underwriting, and readiness to contest claims and \n     cancel policies.\n\n\n    3. unravels health insurance and increases premiums for working \n                               americans\n\n       Because healthy and wealthy individuals are most likely to \n     purchase MSAs, those who remain behind in the traditional \n     insurance plans will likely face higher premiums because the \n     insurance pool has been weakened.\n       The premium increases could be high enough to force lower \n     income working people to drop their coverage.\n       Insurance pool for ordinary Americans without MSAs will \n     suffer both from healthy people pulling out to obtain MSAs \n     and also from individuals with MSAs who become sick going \n     back into the traditional insurance pools.\n\n\n       4. part of the republican plan to ``wither away'' medicare\n\n       This Golden Rule plan is the tool that Republicans want to \n     use to have Medicare ``wither on the vine.'' It is advocated \n     by Speaker Gingrich--who coined this phrase and by Leader \n     Dole, who proudly talks about his vote against the original \n     enactment of the Medicare program.\n       Clearly, Medicare MSAs have an even greater potential to \n     undermine the financial stability of the Medicare program to \n     both beneficiaries and the taxpayers who support it by \n     exposing the program to an option that rewards cherry-picking \n     healthy beneficiaries--not competition over cost and quality. \n     Medicare MSAs were included in the Republican reconciliation \n     bill vetoed by President Clinton in December, 1995.\n       Today's amendment is just the first step back toward the \n     Republicans and Golden Rule's ultimate goal of putting in \n     MSAs into the Medicare program. They were rejected doing \n     Medicare MSAs when the President vetoed their excessive \n     Medicare cuts; now--through today's amendment--they are \n     setting the stage for pushing Medicare MSAs as the next \n     logical step.\n\n\n                     5. discourages preventive care\n\n       MSAs may discourage cost-saving preventive care, such as \n     annual check-ups, immunizations and other wellness efforts. \n     The high deductible coverage associated with MSAs may lead to \n     delayed care and under-utilization of routine and preventive \n     health care services.\n       MSAs divert participation from managed care. Capitated \n     plans and other managed care arrangements hold the promise of \n     coordinated, quality-tested care and cost efficiency not \n     provided through MSAs.\n       MSAs will not promote cost containment in the long-run. By \n     allowing people to have MSAs when they are healthy but switch \n     to more traditional coverage when they become ill, the MSAs \n     simply become a vehicle for sheltering income, not a means of \n     promoting more cost-conscious consumers.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, yesterday the trustees of the Medicare and Social \nSecurity trust funds released their long-awaited annual report, and \nthat report confirms our worst fears that the Medicare Hospital \nInsurance trust fund--which pays for the hospital bills of our Nation's \nelderly--will be bankrupt in nearly 4 years, in the year 2001. This is \na year earlier than the trustees predicted in their last report.\n  The report, which by law, Mr. President, was due April 1 but only \nreceived yesterday, 10 weeks late, indicates that the Medicare trust \nfund ran a deficit of $2.6 billion in 1995 and that the deficit will \nnearly quadruple to $9.2 billion this year. By the year 2001, the fund \nwill have a deficit of $56 billion, and, having exhausted all accrued \ninterest, it will be bankrupt.\n  That is what we are looking at. The Trustees report provides a \nstriking reminder that this crisis which the Medicare system faces did \nnot disappear with the President's veto of the Balanced Budget Act of \n1995--the one honest attempt to make structural reforms to the Medicare \nProgram. To the contrary, this report shows us that Medicare is going \nbroke at even a faster rate than previously predicted.\n  What are we doing about it? Last year, Congress passed a 7-year \nbalanced budget plan--the first in a generation--that included Medicare \nreforms that would have extended the life of the hospital insurance \ntrust fund for a decade and also addressed long-term structural reforms \nto help preserve the program for the critical time when the baby \nboomers begin to retire. This proposal was vetoed by the President.\n  The plan passed by Congress allowed Medicare to grow at a rate of \nover 6 percent a year--not cut, Mr. President, but grow at a rate of \nover 6 percent a year--with the spending per beneficiary growing from \n$5,300 to $7,000 by the year 2002.\n  It has been characterized by some on the other side that these are \ndraconian cuts. Is a 6-percent increase a draconian cut? Is an increase \nin payments for beneficiaries from $5,300 to $7,000 by the year 2002 a \ncut? It certainly is not, Mr. President.\n  The Medicare reforms passed by Congress last year made changes to the \nsystem that reflect the way health is practiced in the 1990's, offering \nfor the first time real health care choice to seniors. What is wrong \nwith choice? We proposed insurance options that would allow doctors and \nhospitals to integrate and provide affordable coordinated care to \nseniors. We proposed medical savings accounts as an option--an option, \nnot a mandate--for Medicare beneficiaries giving individuals the \nability to manage their own health care dollars, choose any doctor they \nwant, and shop around for the best quality care at the best price.\n  Congress acted. The President chose to abdicate. We responded to the \nurgency to save the program. The President chose to veto our proposals, \nthus ensuring that the crisis in Medicare is simply going to continue. \nUnderstanding the political risks involved in engaging in a debate over \nMedicare, I\n\n[[Page S5926]]\n\nthink we acted responsibly. I think we negotiated in good faith. I \nwould hate to think that this was all just an exercise in futility.\n  Yet, we have seen more of the same from this administration this \nyear. The President's budget includes Medicare gimmicks, not Medicare \nreforms. As we all know, the Medicare problem is not just a crisis of \nthe much talked about pending insolvency of the Medicare Hospital \nInsurance--HI--trust fund, it is a fiscal crisis affecting all areas of \nthe Medicare program, with Federal spending increasing by 12 percent in \n1995 and projected to grow 8.6 and 10 percent from now until the year \n2005.\n  The administration attempts to be deceptive by proposing to move \nspending obligations for home health care from part A, where outlays \nare limited by incoming receipts from the Medicaid HI tax, to part B, \nwhere 72 percent of the funds come from general revenues and where, \ntheoretically, there are no limits on growth in spending or solvency \nproblems. I think it is deceiving to make this accounting move and mask \nit as reforms that ``save'' the Medicare Program.\n  This gimmick does add life to the part A trust fund ensuring solvency \nto the year 2005 as opposed to 2001, but it is simply that, Mr. \nPresident. It is a gimmick. It does nothing to address the true problem \nof the Medicare system which is basically the absence of market \ninfluences and a lack of alternatives to the current one-size-fits-all \nprogram. Seniors need and deserve the same choices in health care plans \navailable to the rest of us. Why should they not have it?\n  Mr. President, we are going to attempt again to put forth real \nMedicare reforms this year. It is my hope the President will stop \nproposing gimmicks, stop scaring the seniors, and start dealing \nhonestly with true Medicare reforms that everybody can understand. At \nthe end of the day, we are not all that far apart. I believe we share \nthe same goals of saving the Medicare Program for future generations. \nSo let us get on with it in real, honest reforms.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5922-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5926-S5928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE MEDICARE TRUSTEE'S REPORT AND THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today is D-day, the anniversary of the \nNormandy invasion, a climactic moment in the long struggle to liberate \nEurope in World War II. How ironic it is that on this anniversary, \nRepublicans are reviving their failed campaign to deny Medicare \nbenefits to the same senior citizens who fought so bravely for our \ncountry in that war.\n  One of the most unsavory tactics in the Republican attack on Medicare \nlast year was their disinformation campaign to use the 1995 Medicare \ntrustee's report to justify their cuts. Their scare tactics were \nunsuccessful. Their crocodile tears for Medicare were unconvincing.\n  The $89 billion--the amount which the Trustees said was needed to \nrestore solvency--could not possibly justify the $270 billion in \nMedicare cuts or the higher premiums and higher deductibles proposed by \nthe Republicans. Far from preserving and protecting, and strengthening \nMedicare, the Republican plan was designed to damage and destroy it by \nforcing senior citizens to give up their family doctors and join HMO's \nand other private insurance plans. President Clinton saved Medicare by \nvetoing the Republican plan--and he was right to do so.\n  This year, the Republicans are returning to the scene of their crime. \nThey are trotting out the same old sales campaign that didn't sell in \n1996. They are trying to use this year's trustee's report to peddle a \nretread of the irresponsible proposals the American people resoundingly \nrejected last year.\n  There is nothing really new in this year's report. There has been a \nmodest change in projections of outlay and income--projections that \nalways fluctuate from year to year. Under this year's projections, \nMedicare solvency extends to 2001 rather than 2002. That leaves us 5 \nyears to make necessary corrections instead of 6 years--corrections \nthat the President has already proposed and that could be adopted \ntomorrow if the Republicans were not determined to use Medicare as a \npiggy bank for new tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  They are not prepared to say: All right, these are the adjustments in \nthe Medicare system that are necessary to carry the Medicare solvency \nfor the next 10 years. We are not going to do that. We are not going to \nagree to it because we want to be able to squeeze Medicare even more, \nto justify our tax breaks which have been estimated by Mr. Kasich in \nthe House at over $178 billion. Let us just understand that, I say to \nour senior citizens.\n  Mr. President, the $178 billion they want for tax breaks for wealthy \nindividuals and corporations, where are they getting it? By squeezing \nthe Medicare system. It is wrong. And the seniors understood that it \nwas wrong last year and it is wrong this year as well.\n  Just as there is nothing really new in this year's trustee's report, \nthere is nothing really new in this year's Republican retread. As they \ndid last year, Republicans try to justify their deep Medicare cuts by \nclaiming they are needed to preserve Medicare against the insolvency of \nthe hospital insurance trust fund.\n  The hypocrisy of this claim is so transparent that no senior citizen \nshould take it seriously. Last year, a few weeks before they proposed \ntheir massive Medicare cuts, House Republicans passed a tax bill that \ntook almost $90 billion in revenues out of the Medicare hospital \ninsurance trust fund over the next 10 years--and brought it that much \ncloser to insolvency.\n  Understand, Republicans took $90 billion out of that last year for \nthe purposes of their tax breaks. We did not hear a word then about the \nimpending bankruptcy in Medicare. The President's economic recovery \nplan in 1993 extended the solvency of the trust fund for 3 years. It \npassed without a single Republican vote.\n  When we had the opportunity to provide for additional kinds of \nsolvency, we were unable to get a single Republican vote. We did not \nhear a word from the Republicans then about the impending bankruptcy of \nMedicare.\n  Like last year, the Republican plan proposes deep cuts in Medicare to \nfund new, undeserved tax breaks for the wealthy. Like last year, the \nRepublican plan is designed to cause Medicare to ``wither on the vine'' \nin the words of Speaker Gingrich--by forcing senior citizens to give up \ntheir family doctor and join private insurance plans. Majority Leader \nDole has said that enacting Medicare was a mistake from the beginning--\nand he is trying to use this budget to correct that mistake.\n  Last year, Republicans tried to justify their excessive Medicare cuts \nwith a large array of misguided arguments. This year they are repeating \nthe same arguments, as if repetition can somehow substitute for \nreality. The American people were not fooled last year--and they \ncertainly will not be fooled this year.\n  When Republicans took up the issue last year, they proposed to cut \nMedicare by $270 billion--three times more than the amount the Medicare \ntrustees said was needed to stabilize the trust fund. This year, \nRepublicans are proposing to cut $167 billion from Medicare. By \ncontrast, the President's plan cuts Medicare by $116 billion--44 \npercent less, but it guarantees Medicare solvency for 10 years. And it \nfunds Medicare at the level necessary to assure that quality care will \nbe available for senior citizens when they need it.\n  Even worse, Republicans support an inflexible ceiling on Medicare \nspending. Consequently, if inflation is higher or medical needs are \ngreater than anticipated, Medicare spending will not go up, and many \nsenior citizens will be out of luck and out of care.\n  An estimated 20 percent of all Medicare hospitalization can be \navoided by relying on better preventive services and more timely \nprimary and outpatient care.\n  So, if we have interventions earlier, if we have better home care, if \nwe have the investment in our seniors to avoid the more costly expenses \nwhen they\n\n[[Page S5927]]\n\nmust come into the hospital, that can save billions and billions of \ndollars. We ought to be thinking about that, without reducing the \nservices for our elderly and actually improve the quality of health \ncare for our seniors.\n  As much as 10 percent of all Medicare expenditures may be due to \nfraud, and can be reduced or eliminated by better oversight.\n  The work Senator Harkin has been involved in, in reviewing Medicaid \nand Medicare fraud, is absolutely powerful and absolutely convincing \nabout the tens of billions of dollars that can be saved. You go to any \nhall in this country and ask our senior citizens where there can be \nsavings. Any senior citizen can give you chapter and verse about how \nthere can be savings in the Medicare system. Many of them can tell you \nabout the fraud that is being perpetrated upon them at the present \ntime. We ought to address that kind of issue before we are talking \nabout reductions in essential services.\n  Medicare could save $20 billion annually if senior citizens have \nassistance in monitoring their medications more carefully in order to \navoid adverse drug reactions.\n  We spend billions and billions of dollars a year from adverse drug \nreactions where the senior will go to a doctor and receive various \nmedications, receive other medications from another doctor, and find \nthere is an inconsistency in terms of taking both medications and then \nfind they have an illness. There are ways to remedy that problem, to \nsave billions and billions of dollars--again, to improve the quality of \nhealth. We do not hear that issue raised or discussed or debated.\n  We do not have to destroy Medicare in order to save it. Congress will \nnever allow the Medicare trust fund to become bankrupt. I know that, \nand the American people know it. It is time for the Republicans to stop \nraiding Medicare, and join in sensible steps to improve and strengthen \nit for the future.\n  Another false Republican argument in defense of their Medicare cuts \nis that the reductions are not really cuts, because the total amount of \nMedicare spending will continue to grow. But every household in America \nknows that if the cost of your rent, the cost of your utilities, and \nthe cost of your food go up--and your income stays the same or goes up \nmore slowly--you have taken a real cut in your living standard.\n  Republicans speak of a cut in defense, even though defense spending \nhas remained stable. Apparently, the same Republican logic does not \napply to spending on Medicare that applies to spending on guns and \ntanks. A cut is a cut is a cut--whether it is in Medicare or Social \nSecurity or national defense.\n  Republicans also claim that deep cuts in Medicare are necessary to \nbalance the budget. But that argument only proves that Republican \npriorities are wrong. Democrats favor a balanced budget, and President \nClinton has proposed a balanced budget--balanced fairly, not balanced \non the backs of senior citizens, or children, or workers. There is a \nright way to balance the budget, and a right-wing way. And \nunfortunately, the Republicans continue to pick the right-wing way.\n  Republicans deny that their Medicare cuts will fund tax cuts for the \nwealthy. This time, the leopard claims that it really has changed its \nspots. But their budget clearly envisions $60 billion in revenue \nincreases from tax extenders and closing of selected corporate \nloopholes in order to fund $60 billion in new tax breaks for the \nundeserving rich. Without those new tax breaks, they wouldn't need to \ncut Medicare by $167 billion.\n  The Democratic amendment eliminates these new tax breaks for the \nwealthy and uses them to protect Medicare. The Medicare trust fund \nshould not be a slush fund for Republican tax breaks for the rich.\n  Republicans can run as hard as they want in this election year, but \nthey can not hide from these facts.\n  Even more damaging than the loss of the billions of dollars that \nRepublicans would slash from Medicare is their attempt to turn Medicare \nover to the private insurance industry. The Republican budget contains \na number of changes to force senior citizens to give up their own \ndoctors and join private insurance plans.\n  Once they are forced into these plans, senior citizens will be \nstripped of many of the protections they enjoy today--protection \nagainst overcharges by doctors and other health care providers, \nprotection against premium-gouging and profiteering by insurance \ncompanies, protection of their right to keep their own family doctor \nand go to the specialist of their choice.\n  Republicans claim they only want to offer senior citizens a choice, \nbut this is a choice no senior citizen should be forced to make.\n  The harsh cuts in Medicare contained in the Republican budget are \nalso a repudiation of our historic commitment to Social Security, \nbecause the distinction between Medicare and Social Security is a false \none. Medicare is part of the same compact between the Government and \nthe people as Social Security. That compact says contribute during your \nworking years, and we will guarantee basic income and health security \nin your retirement years.\n  Any senior citizen who has been hospitalized or who suffers from a \nserious chronic illness knows that there is no retirement security \nwithout health security. The cost of illness is too high. A few days in \nan intensive care unit can cost more than the total yearly income of \nmany senior citizens.\n  The low and moderate-income elderly will suffer most from these \nMedicare cuts. Eighty-three percent of all Medicare spending is for \nolder Americans with annual incomes below $25,000. Two-thirds is for \nthose with incomes below $15,000.\n  No budget plan that purports to be part of a Contract With America \nshould break America's contract with the elderly. It is bad enough to \npropose these deep cuts in Medicare at all. It is even worse to make \nthese cuts in order to pay for an undeserved and unneeded tax break for \nthe wealthiest Americans.\n  Everyone knows that the real vote on Medicare is not on the floor of \nthe Senate or the floor of the House of Representatives. The real vote \nwill be cast in November by the American people, and they know that the \nfuture of Medicare is too important to be decided by a Republican \nCongress or a Republican President.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 more minutes to \nrespond to questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I simply ask the Senator from Massachusetts, when he \nwas referring to the 1993 Budget Reconciliation Act--where I think we \nreduced Medicare expenditures because that had to be done, but we did \nit consistent with beneficiary purposes--the Senator brought up the \npoint that we did not get a single Republican vote. It was a stunning \nmoment. I will never forget it. I was sitting right over there. We had \nto get every single Democrat to let that effort to improve Medicare \nsurvive.\n  I do not understand that. I do not understand the inconsistency of \nthat. If they are for trying to do something about Medicare now, why, 3 \nyears ago, was there a total lack of interest, with no mention of \nMedicare trust fund health at that time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is entirely correct, and there is no Member \nof the Senate who knows more about those negotiations than the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, since he was really the leader in those \nnegotiations, which were enormously complex and difficult.\n  Even with the reductions that were worked out, we were sensitive to \nany reduction in benefits for recipients and looked for other ways to \nfind the savings that were achieved in that program but, nonetheless, \nextended the solvency for a period of 3 years.\n  As the Senator knows, even after that period of time, we found out at \nthe start of this Congress that our Republican friends wanted to take \nsome $80 to $90 billion out of the trust fund to designate it for tax \nbreaks for the wealthy. Not only were they unresponsive to the calls \nand challenges at the time the Senator has mentioned, but even \nfollowing that, they were willing to raid the trust funds for tax \nbreaks for the wealthy.\n  It is enormously troublesome, I think, for all of us to see, again, \nthe effort to raid the Medicare trust funds to use for additional tax \nbreaks today.\n  I am wondering, as the Senator from West Virginia, who is a real \nexpert on\n\n[[Page S5928]]\n\nMedicare, Medicaid and health policy generally, if he does not find \nthat to be one of the most repulsive aspects of the proposal that has \nbeen advanced by our Republican friends?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, I do, and I \nam also confounded, frankly, by the sense of its stupidity. It is not \njust obscene, it is stupid. The American people have rejected the idea \nof tax cuts for the wealthy. That was rejected, and then they come \nright back again for the same thing. Maybe there has been more emphasis \nin the House than here, but nevertheless, there is this tremendous \ndesire for tax cuts for the wealthy. They have to have those tax cuts, \nand the Medicare beneficiaries just take second place.\n  I was stunned when I heard the Senator say, ``this is the anniversary \nof the invasion of Normandy and for those people, let them fall where \nthey might.''\n  Mr. KENNEDY. They are the ones who fought in the wars and pulled the \ncountry out of the Depression and are the ones who paid into this fund \nover a period of time. This is not a piggy bank. The Medicare trust \nfund is not a piggy bank for Republicans to dip into to grant tax \nbreaks for wealthy individuals. That is really the fundamental issue. \nIt will continue to be debated here and across the country in the \ncourse of the campaign.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer. I want to continue \nsome of the thoughts of the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, \nwho has incredible knowledge of this history, over 30 years in the \ndevelopment and nondevelopment of health care policy.\n  Might I ask the Presiding Officer how much time I have in order to \nspeak?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5926-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5928-S5929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IMPLICATIONS OF MEDICARE TRUSTEES' REPORT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, first of all, I will not be able to \nfinish, but I will do the best I can. I want to acknowledge the very \nserious implications of the Medicare trustees' report released \nyesterday. The Medicare part A trust fund, the part that pays the \nhospital bills of beneficiaries, is likely to be insolvent by 2001, a \nyear earlier than predicted last year. This is a very serious issue. I \ntake it as such, and it must be addressed.\n  So the news is bad, Mr. President. Unfortunately, contrary to \nassertions made by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, this \nis not a new problem, and unlike the Republicans, this is not a problem \nDemocrats just discovered.\n  The Republicans chose to ignore 20 previous trustees' reports that \nwarned of future trust fund problems. But when they needed to come up \nwith the money to pay for tax breaks, they decided to manufacture an \nimpending crisis.\n  Just 3 years ago, as the Senator from Massachusetts and I were \ndiscussing, the trustees projected the hospital trust fund was going to \nrun out of money in 1999, which is 3 years hence. Democrats took \nimmediate measures, and I know because I was responsible for putting \nsome of those together, to add 3 more years of solvency by very \ncarefully reducing Medicare spending by about $59 billion. And, Mr. \nPresident, Democrats have produced our own Medicare proposals that \nwould postpone the date of trust insolvency for at least another \ndecade. That is called 10 years. That is quite a lot of time.\n  The CBO has certified that the President's Medicare plan would extend \ntrust fund solvency until the year 2005. Here we are dealing with 9 or \n10 years.\n  The big difference between Democrats and Republicans is that we have \nonly proposed those reductions in spending that are necessary to \nachieve 10 more years of solvency. That is our only purpose. That is \nour only policy purpose. The Republicans continue to propose drastic \nMedicare cuts so that they can pay, again, for what has become a \ncliche--but a cliche is something that is said so often it is true--tax \nbreaks for the wealthy.\n  Mr. President, over the past decade, Congress has, and usually in a \nvery bipartisan manner, taken repeated steps to rein in the costs of \nthe Medicare Program. We do not have a bad record on this. We reformed \nthe hospital payment system in 1983. We reformed the physician payment \nsystem in 1989. Senator Durenberger, a Republican from Minnesota, was \ninstrumental in that. We did this together, Democrats and Republicans, \nwith minor controversy, to shore up the hospital trust fund. That was \nthe policy purpose, and to make the Medicare Program a prudent \npurchaser of health care services.\n  Unfortunately, the bipartisanship to address the problems of Medicare \nended--and ended completely--in 1993 when the Republicans refused to \nparticipate in what was an entirely serious effort to reduce the \nFederal deficit. Democrats were forced, therefore, to act alone. \nBecause of the Democratic efforts, and without, as the Senator from \nMassachusetts said, a single Republican vote. This is really \nextraordinary when you think about it; there are usually a few people \nwho will help on this--there was not a single one, not a single one.\n  The deficit has fallen now for 4 straight years as a result of that \naction in 1993. That had not happened since either Harry Truman was \nPresident or the Civil War. I am not sure which, and there is a big \ndifference. But, anyway, 4 years of budget deficit reduction has not \nhappened in a long, long time.\n  Bipartisanship also failed to materialize last year when the \nDemocrats refused to engage in an exercise to carry out Speaker \nGingrich's Contract With America, that handed out tax breaks for the \nwealthy at the expense of the Medicare and Medicaid Programs.\n  Mr. President, there are billions of dollars in common Medicare \nsavings that we could agree on tomorrow to strengthen the trust fund. \nBut compromise is not something that many of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, and particularly on the other side of the Capitol, \nhave learned to do to this point.\n  Last year, the public overwhelmingly rejected the massive health care \ncuts proposed by the Republicans. Instead, though, of coming up with a \nnew plan, or even new numbers, the Republicans have not changed much at \nall.\n  They say their plan is more moderate, but it is not. The total \nMedicare savings in their new plan are lower, but they are lower only \nbecause their new budget covers 6 years, not 7.\n  That tends to make a difference. If you look at the year-by-year \nMedicare cuts in this year's Republican budget, you can see that the \ncuts are nearly identical to--identical to or larger--than the cuts in \nthe vetoed budget reconciliation bill from last year.\n  Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst, who Republicans do \nnot like to hear quoted, said just a few weeks ago that the ``new'' \nRepublican budget ``is no more than a routine expression''--this is \ninteresting--``a routine expression of core GOP fiscal policy: never to \nask the top 1 percent of Americans to sacrifice if Medicaid, Medicare, \nor education funds for ordinary people can be targeted instead.''\n  The Republican budget resolution goes way too far in trying to reduce \nMedicare spending. The cuts are much more than is needed to extend \nshort-term solvency for another decade. The Republicans know that.\n  The Republican budget would hold Medicare to a much tougher standard \non its health care costs than current projections for even private \nhealth insurance. That is an important point. Private health insurance \nis expected to grow by 7.1 percent on a per person basis over the next \n7 years. The Republican plan caps Medicare per person spending at 4.8 \npercent over the next 7 years, even though Medicare generally serves an \nolder and a sicker population. And Medicare, as a program, is even \ncovering more people, while private health insurance is covering fewer \nand fewer Americans, as employers pull back from what I would consider \ntheir responsibility.\n  So these very tight budget caps that the Republican plan would impose \non Medicare spending will seriously harm the quality of care that \nseniors currently receive, or will significantly increase their out-of-\npocket expenses, or will do both.\n\n[[Page S5929]]\n\n  Last year Dr. June O'Neill, the Republican-appointed head of the \nCongressional Budget Office, testified before the Senate Finance \nCommittee that seniors would in fact have to pay more, pay more to keep \nthe same level of quality that they have today under the Republican \nplan. She is their appointee. That is what she said.\n  I asked her how much more? She said she did not know. I sent her a \nletter soon after the specifics of the Republican plan were finally \nunveiled by the Finance Committee. That was not only signed by myself, \nbut also by the minority leader, asking her again, how much more would \nseniors have to pay under the Republican proposal?\n  I never got a response. I am a U.S. Senator. I assume that after a \nwhile somebody in that position would eventually get a response. I did \nnot. I still do not know exactly how much more seniors would have to \npay. All I know is that they will have to pay a lot more.\n  Mr. President, in West Virginia, which I represent, the average \nsenior's income is $10,700 a year. We talk of seniors making $25,000, \n$17,000, $18,000. In West Virginia the average is $10,700 a year. They \nare already spending 21 percent of their income on health care. They do \nnot have a margin. They do not have room for more.\n  People always assume that somehow the Democrats are just being silly \nand soft because they assume that seniors can pay more. Some seniors \nshould pay more, and high-income seniors probably should. That should \nbe worked out as a package, dealing with the whole Medicare Program, in \nexactly the kind of Medicare commission that Senator Dole proposes and \nwhich I support.\n  Mr. President, for my constituents in West Virginia, ``more'' is a \nvery scary word. Last year I talked about Geno Maynard, Sue Lemaster, \nand John and Betty Shumate.\n  Geno Maynard is 78 years old and lives in Kenova, WV; Sue Lemaster, \nis a 83 year old who lives in Follansbee; and John and Betty Shumate \nare Medicare beneficiaries who live in Beckley. They're 4 of the \n330,000 West Virginians who depend on the Medicare Program for health \ncare, and they all told me that they were worried. They quite flatly \ntold me, they do not have any more money to spend on health care. It's \na big worry for millions of other seniors all over America. On average, \nseniors already spend 21 percent of their incomes on health care \nexpenses.\n  Mr. President, it is a year later and I still cannot tell my \nconstituents how much more they would have to pay under the Republican \nplan. I can only say that according to reliable health experts and the \nRepublican-appointed head of the Congressional Budget Office, they are \ngoing to have to pay more for their health care.\n  Mr. President, in addition to tight budget caps, the Republican plan \nalso assumes enactment of some very dangerous programmatic changes. For \nexample, Mr. President, the Republican plan assumes elimination of \ncurrent law balance billing protections for senior citizens. Medicare \ncurrently prohibits health care providers from price gouging. Health \ncare providers are banned from charging Medicare patients more than 15 \npercent above what Medicare pays them. This is an incredibly important \nfinancial protection that we enacted in 1989--on a bipartisan basis--as \na part of physician payment reform. Prior to enactment of balance \nbilling protections, seniors spent over $2 billion a year on out-of-\npocket balance billing charges.\n  Last year, I offered an amendment during the Finance Committee's \nmark-up of the Republican Medicare bill that would make sure \nbeneficiaries would continue to have the same financial protections \nthat they have under current Medicare law. My amendment was defeated on \na strict party line vote. This is just one more example of how the \nRepublican plan will insidiously destroy the Medicare Program.\n  Mr. President, there are plenty of other examples. To name just one \nmore: A Medicare medical savings account proposal that actually costs \nthe Medicare Program $4 billion a year; and will further weaken the \nMedicare trust fund. The New York Times reported that according to \n``many experts'' MSA's would lead to the ``balkanization of healthy and \nsick.''\n  Let us not forget that the Medicare Program is an incredible success \nwhen it comes to access. Seniors are the only group of Americans who \nenjoy universal coverage. If Medicare is cut by unprecedented amounts \nof money to pay for anything but Medicare, the consequences will be \ndisastrous for health care providers and beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, the bigger problem that we all continue to skirt \naround is the long-term solvency of the Medicare trust fund. When the \nbaby boomers begin to retire in 2011, the Medicare Program will be \nseverely, severely strained. I proposed a Greenspan-like commission \nlast year to try to take this debate out of the political arena. The \nAmerican Hospital Association also thinks a commission is necessary to \nforce action to improve the short-term and long-term solvency of the \ntrust fund.\n  Hospitals have plenty of reason to worry. Not only are their bills \npaid from the part A trust fund, but the American Hospital Association \nestimates that the new Republican budget cuts hospital payments 20 \npercent more than last year's Republican budget. As a result of these \nlarger hits to hospitals, ``hospitals are likely to experience actual \nreductions in payment rates,'' not just reductions in the rate of \nMedicare revenue growth.\n  The Prospective Payment Review Commission [ProPAC]--a nonpartisan \ncommission that advises Congress on hospital payment issues--has issued \na stern warning about the severe negative effect massive Medicare \nreductions will have on hospitals. In my own State, over 50 percent of \nall our senior citizens live in rural areas. How far are they going to \nhave to travel to get basic hospital care if their local, rural \nhospital is forced to shut its doors?\n  Mr. President, the solvency of the Medicare trust fund is too \nimportant of an issue to be left to politics-as-usual. Thirty-seven \nmillion Americans rely on the Medicare Program to pay for their health \ncare services. The Republicans' suggestion that the Democrats are \nuninterested in doing what is necessary to put Medicare on sound \nfinancial footing is preposterous. It was Republicans in Congress who \nvoted against Medicare's creation in 1965--and it is now Republicans in \nthis Congress who pose a real threat to Medicare's future. They will \nkeep on saying they are saving Medicare, but raiding Medicare is no way \nto rescue it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on the vote earlier today rejecting the constitutional \namendment for a balanced budget. I supported that amendment, as I have \non a number of occasions during my tenure in the U.S. Senate. I was \ndisappointed to find the amendment failed today in light of the \nrepetitive speeches on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the \nimportance of balancing the budget.\n  It is true that, if discipline could be imposed in the Congress of \nthe United States, a balanced budget amendment would not be necessary. \nBut the historical fact is unmistakable that the kind of discipline \nnecessary is simply not present, given the nature of our system where \nthere are so many demands for programs to spend and where there is such \nan aversion, understandably, to increases in taxation. So if there is \nto be a balanced budget, it is mandatory that it be a requirement of \nlaw which would rise to constitutional proportion.\n  Every other unit of government has the requirement for a balanced \nbudget. My State, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, has such a \nrequirement. Cities have such a requirement. Townships have such a \nrequirement. Counties have such a requirement. On an individual basis, \nall of us must live within our means or we wind up in the bankruptcy \ncourt.\n  The issue of a balanced budget came into sharper focus for me 2 years \nand 4 months ago when my wife Joan and I had our first grandchild. It \nwould be absolutely unthinkable, as individuals, for us to purchase on \na credit card for young Sylvie Specter or her sister\n\n[[Page S5930]]\n\nPerry Specter. But that is precisely what we are doing as a nation in \nbuilding up deficits in the range of $200 billion a year and a national \ndebt which now exceeds $5 trillion. There has been a unique opportunity \nto deal with this in an institutional way to achieve a balanced budget. \nThat is through a constitutional amendment.\n  There are many subjects which are talked about on the Senate floor, \nrepetitively, where it is very hard to find out which philosophy is \ncorrect and which political party is at fault. I suggest, Mr. \nPresident--and I do not do this often--that there is a defining \ndifference between the philosophy of the Republicans and the philosophy \nof the Democrats on this subject. That has been continuously \ndemonstrated by the votes on this subject.\n  Today's vote was 64 to 35. So the Senate fell three votes short of \nthe two-thirds necessary to have a constitutional amendment. Among the \n53 Republicans, 52 voted in favor of the constitutional amendment for a \nbalanced budget. Among the 46 Democrats who voted, one Democrat being \nabsent, 12 Democrats voted in favor of the constitutional amendment for \na balanced budget and 34 voted against.\n  President Clinton has stated his position in being in opposition to a \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget. Senator Dole, the \npresumptive Republican nominee, has led the fight for a constitutional \namendment for a balanced budget.\n  I believe that this is very similar to the Clinton health care \nproposal as a defining issue as to where the parties stand. The Clinton \nhealth care proposal was a very drastic change to put the Government \ninto the health care business.\n  When I read the Clinton proposal in September 1993, I started to make \na list of all the agencies, boards, and commissions which were created. \nI found I could not tabulate them all and asked an assistant to make me \na comprehensive list. My assistant, instead, made a chart instead of a \nlist. I am sparing C-SPAN viewers showing again the chart. It has been \nfairly extensively shown with boxes in red showing more than 100 new \nagencies, boards, and commissions under the Clinton health care plan, \nand the boxes in green, 50, giving additional tasks to 50 existing \nbureaus.\n  Bob Woodward of the Washington Post said that chart was the critical \nfact to defeat the Clinton health care plan. A picture is worth 1,000 \nwords. A chart in some situations is worth 1,000 pictures and perhaps \nworth more than $100 billion in this case.\n  I believe that the health care program that President Clinton \nproposed was a defining issue, just as this vote today on a \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget is a defining issue.\n  I am convinced that the budget can be balanced with a scalpel and not \na meat ax. I serve as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nLabor, Health, Human Services and Education. The allocation to that \nsubcommittee was reduced from $70 billion last year to $62 billion.\n  Senator Tom Harkin, my distinguished ranking member on the Democratic \nside, Senator Harkin and I worked collaboratively, as we did when he \nwas chairman of the subcommittee and I the ranking minority member, and \nwe structured a budget that handled it with a scalpel and not a meat \nax.\n  We found that budget would not meet the President's requirements, and \nwe came back on the floor of the U.S. Senate this spring. Senator \nHarkin and I offered an amendment which added $2.7 billion. It was like \nthreading a needle to find a way to reach an amount which was \nsatisfactory to the President, which would pass muster with the House \ncommittee in conference. After 20 hours of negotiations, the House \nMembers approved the compromise by a vote of 6 to 5 and we got it done. \nThis year, Senator Harkin and I looked at the budget resolution, saw \nthat we were still going to be short of a mark which would be \nsatisfactory, and we structured another amendment for $2.7 billion. \nThis time, Senator Domenici, chairman of the Budget Committee, came in \nand added another $2.3 billion for a total of $5 billion in excess of \nwhat his committee had reported to the floor, so that we would have a \nrealistic figure to do the job.\n  I cite that as an illustration. If you examine the fine print and \nlook at the semicolons, there would be agreement that it was done \nwithin our confines, moving toward the balanced budget, and done with a \nscalpel and not a meat ax. I believe that we can establish priorities \nto have a balanced budget and do it carefully, preserving the important \nprograms and eliminating those that are unnecessary, cutting those \nwhere cuts can be made.\n  I am personally convinced that the American people are prepared to \nhave shared sacrifice to have a balanced budget if the cuts are \nuniform. As I said on this floor last year before we took up the budget \nresolution, I thought as much as I would like a tax cut I was opposed \nto it, because while you can justify the cuts if they are fairly made, \nif there is a tax cut at the same time it simply is unacceptable--some \nwill be favored for a tax cut, with some of the proposals favoring \nthose in the $100,000 category while others at a much lesser figure had \nto have the reductions. If the reductions are fairly stated, I think \nshared sacrifice is something that the American people are prepared to \naccept. That is the concept of a balanced budget.\n  It is my hope that this issue, like the issue of health care, will be \ndealt with by the American people in November. I thought it a mistake \nwhen the Government was closed down last November, not something I am \nsaying for the first time on June 6, 1996. I said it back on November \n14, as the Congressional Record will show during the first shutdown. \nThat was an opportunity to crystalize the issue for the November \nelection.\n  I think this is a watershed, a landmark signal issue on today's vote. \nWhen you take a look at the party alignment, with President Clinton \nleading the Democrats and 34 out of 46 voting Democrats in the Senate \ntoday voting ``no'' on the balanced budget amendment, and 52 out of 53 \nRepublicans voting ``yes'' on the balanced budget amendment, that is an \nissue which ought to be submitted to the referendum this November. I \nyield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5929-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5930-S5931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEDICARE INSOLVENCY\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Since that \ngroup of trustees had just made their report public yesterday at the \nnews conference which we all read and heard about, that subject came \nup.\n  It occurred to me, since there was before the general public a \nsuggestion by the President that he had made recommendations that were \nalmost identical with the Republican suggestion about how to protect \nthe benefits of this Medicare Program and how to deal with this \nimpending insolvency of that fund, it occurs to me that we are going to \nsee more of the same kind of political shenanigans from now until the \nend of this year, with nothing being done unless somebody is ready to \nsay, ``OK, we will go along with your proposal.''\n\n  The President can say that to the Congress, or we can say that to the \nPresident. I am prepared at this point to suggest, in a serious way, \nand said this to Secretary Shalala at the hearing, the Congress accept \nthe President's suggestions. We can pass the suggested changes for \nshort-term relief of pressure on that fund, but at the same time \nappoint a commission which is also called for by the President and the \ntrustees in their report to propose long-term changes, changes to \naffect the long-term insolvency problems of the trust fund, and that \nthe Congress, through its leaders and the President himself, agree to \nimplement the recommendations of that commission for long-term changes.\n  It seems to me that is one way to resolve this as a part of this \nargument\n\n[[Page S5931]]\n\nover whether Republicans are trying to cut taxes, to impose changes on \nMedicare beneficiaries as a part of a budget balancing act. We already, \nin the Congress, submitted to the President proposals to rescue the \nMedicare Program. That was a part of the Balanced Budget Act which the \nPresident vetoed. He has already rejected what Congress has suggested. \nAfter weeks and weeks of negotiations with leaders of the Congress and \nthe President at the White House, all we got out of it were some photo \nops, some political posturing, partisan sniping. We have had enough of \nthat. The American people are fed up with that kind of politics. That \nis not the way to run the Government. I am tired of it.\n  I have recommended and seriously urge this Congress to accept the \nrecommendation of the President--not the one, of course, that says that \nhome health care ought to be paid for out of the general Treasury; I am \ntalking about changes that will reduce the costs of the program in a \nway that saves the program from insolvency--they recommended last year \nthat we had to act before the year 2002, that we were going to see an \ninsolvency, there would be a bankrupted fund, in effect.\n  Now, the report this year is worse than that. The year before it was \ngoing insolvent. Under the last report, it is going to lose $33 \nbillion, and the following year $100 billion. Contrary to what the \njunior Senator from West Virginia said, that this is a Republican-\nmanufactured crisis, that is an outrageous comment. That is totally \noutrageous. These trustees are Democrats by and large. Secretary Rubin \nsaid it, Secretary Shalala said it is going to be insolvent, Secretary \nReich said it would be insolvent, the head of the Social Security \nAdministration was standing there and agreed with them. That is not a \ngroup of Republicans. The Republicans are not manufacturing a crisis. \nThe crisis is real. The crisis is now.\n  It is irresponsible for us to continue to sit here and listen to this \nkind of arguing made by Senators on the other side that this is some \nkind of effort by Republicans to frighten older people. I am \nfrightened. I am not an eligible beneficiary yet. We have to act.\n  I want to commend the Senator from Pennsylvania for his leadership in \nan effort to get the Secretary to agree to recommendations to the \nadministration, that they take a stand, put their recommendations in \nthe form of legislation, send it to the Hill, and see if we can pass \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nMississippi for his kind comments and would amplify what he said. After \nhis leadership in bringing this issue before the subcommittee and the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, it was the subject of extended \nadditional discussion. Secretary Shalala did say that she would be \nprepared to recommend to the President that he sign a separate bill.\n  There are really few black and white issues on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate or in the Congress of the United States. I believe that the \ngridlock is visible right down the middle between Republicans and \nDemocrats. I think there are, as a rarity, some clear-cut issues, as I \nmentioned a few moments ago on the Clinton health care plan or on the \nbalanced budget amendment, where there is a clear philosophical and \nfactual difference. The posturing which has been undertaken on Medicare \nI think has been a plague on both Houses and is so recognized by the \nAmerican people.\n  Senator Cochran and I put it on the table in a direct conclusive way \ntoday and Secretary Shalala agreed with the Cochran-Specter \nproposal, and that is not giving up on the attempt to reach an overall \nreconciliation bill, to have a balanced budget, which will be presented \nby the Congress; but, at the same time, that there be a second bill, \nand if the first overall bill is rejected--which will be a global \nsettlement on the deficit, an agreement between the President and \nCongress--Secretary Shalala said she would recommend that a separate \nbill be approved. That bill would be to accept the figure of the \nPresident, where he has recommended--and on this floor it is always \narticulated in terms of ``cuts,'' which is inaccurate. It is $116 \nbillion of reduction on the rate of increase.\n\n  Nobody is suggesting cuts. Every time somebody talks about a cut, it \nis factually incorrect. Last year, there was not a proposal for cuts in \nMedicare. There was a proposal to have the rate of increase of 7.1 \npercent instead of a higher figure on increase. This year, the proposal \nis 6.1 percent of increase, which is a decrease in the rate of \nincrease. That is to say that the increase is not as much as it would \nhave been.\n  President Clinton has proposed a reduction of $116 billion in the \nrate of increase. And the proposal which Senator Cochran suggested, and \nI seconded, and Secretary Shalala agreed to, would be to have that as a \nseparate bill, which would be an accommodation to the Medicare trust \nfund, which would keep it solvent for a period estimated on a variety \nof between 5 and 10 years.\n  Right after Senator Cochran's questioning and comments to Secretary \nShalala, I said that it was the most forceful statement I have heard on \nthe Appropriations Committee in the 16 years that I was present. I was \nabout ready to say the most forceful statement by Senator Cochran, but \nI amended that to be the most forceful statement from anyone that I \nhave seen in my 16 years. Then I walked over to him and said, had it \nbeen on national television, he would have been an instantaneous \nnational, if not worldwide, hero. But that happens to be an area where, \nperhaps in an off moment, we have had agreement between a Democrat and \ntwo Republicans.\n  I said to Senator Cochran that if he would introduce the legislation, \nI would cosponsor it. Now I say, if he will not, I will, and I hope \nthat he will cosponsor it.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, S. 1740, the so-called Defense of \nMarriage Act, raises serious questions about the authority of Congress \nto limit the effect of a State court judgment in other States.\n  To assist the Senate in its consideration of S. 1740, I asked Harvard \nLaw School Professor Laurence H. Tribe, one of the most respected \nconstitutional scholars in the Nation, to review the bill and its \nconstitutionality. Professor Tribe has done so and has concluded \nunequivocally that enactment of S. 1740 would be an unconstitutional \nattempt by Congress to limit the full faith and credit clause of the \nConstitution.\n  Mr. President, assaulting the Constitution is hardly defending \nmarriage. I believe that all Members of Congress will be interested in \nProfessor Tribe's analysis, and I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof his letter be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 24, 1996.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: You have asked me whether the \n     Constitution empowers Congress to enact Section 2(a) of S. \n     1740, which calls itself the Defense of Marriage Act and \n     which would amend 28 U.S.C. 1738 by amending a new section \n     1738C to exempt ``same sex * * * marriage[s]'' from the reach \n     of the Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause, Art. IV, \n     sec. 1, cl. 1, by authorizing any State choosing to do so to \n     deny all ``effect to any public act, record, or judicial \n     proceeding'' by which another State either recognizes such \n     marriages as valid and binding, or treats such marriages as \n     giving rise to any ``right or claim.''\n       My exclusive focus in this analysis is the question of \n     affirmative constitutional authority in light of the Full \n     Faith and Credit Clause, which the Supreme Court over half a \n     century ago aptly described as ``a nationally unifying \n     force,'' ``alter[ing] the status of the several states as \n     independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore rights \n     and obligations created under the laws or established by the \n     judicial proceedings of the others, by making each an \n     integral part of a single nation, in which rights * * * \n     established\n\n[[Page S5932]]\n\n     in any [state] are given nationwide application.'' Magnolia \n     Petroleum Co. v. Hunt, 320 U.S. 430, 439 (1943). I have not \n     found it necessary to pursue the further inquiry that would \n     be required if one were to conclude that Congress does have \n     affirmative authority to create the proposed exception to the \n     Full Faith and Credit Clause for same-sex marriages--namely, \n     whether such an exception would nonetheless violate a \n     negative prohibition like that of the Due Process Clause of \n     the Fifth Amendment, see Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, \n     115 S. Ct. 2097, 2111-16 (1995); Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. \n     497, 500 (1954), on the ground that it singles out same-sex \n     relationships for unfavorable legal treatment for no \n     discernable reason beyond public animosity to homosexuals, \n     cf. Romer v. Evans, 1996 WL 262293, *9 (U.S. May 20, 1996).\n       Whether this fairly characterizes the Defense of Marriage \n     Act and would in fact be a fatal constitutional flaw in the \n     Act, or whether part or all of the Act could be successfully \n     defended against such a Due Process Clause attack, are \n     questions on which I express no view here, and indeed are \n     questions that it would be unwise to address in light of the \n     conclusion I think one must reach on the anterior question of \n     affirmative congressional power. On that question--and for \n     reasons having absolutely nothing to do with anybody's views \n     on the merits of same-sex marriage or homosexual \n     relationships, and nothing to do with anybody's views about \n     Romer v. Evans or other equal protection cases--my conclusion \n     is unequivocal: Congress possesses no power under any \n     provision of the Constitution to legislate any such \n     categorical exemption from the Full Faith and Credit Clause \n     of Article IV. For Congress to enact such an exemption--\n     whether for same-sex marriages or for any other \n     substantively defined category of public acts, records, or \n     proceedings--would entail an exercise by Congress of a \n     ``power[] not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution''--a power therefore ``reserved to the \n     States'' under the Tenth Amendment. The proposed \n     legislation is thus plainly unconstitutional, both because \n     of the basic ``limited-government'' axiom that ours is a \n     National Government whose powers are confined to those \n     that are delegated to the federal level in the \n     Constitution itself, and because of the equally \n     fundamental ``states'-rights'' postulate that all powers \n     not so delegated are reserved to the States and their \n     people.\n       As many of this statute's proponents are fond of reminding \n     us, the Tenth Amendment says in no uncertain terms that the \n     ``powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.'' But \n     it is that basic axiom, as I will explain below, that most \n     clearly condemns the proposed statute. The Supreme Court \n     explained in New York v. United States, 505. U.S. 144, 155-56 \n     (1992), that the inquiry ``whether an Act of Congress invades \n     the province of state sovereignty reserved by the Tenth \n     Amendment'' is a ``mirror image[]'' of the inquiry ``whether \n     an Act of Congress is authorized by one of the powers \n     delegated to Congress . . . in the Constitution.'' Thus, in \n     United States v. Lopez, 115 S. Ct. 1624 (1995), the Supreme \n     Court struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 \n     (``GFSZA'') on the ground that, because neither the Commerce \n     Clause nor any other provision of the Constitution delegated \n     to the Federal Government the power that it sought to \n     exercise in the GFSZA, Congress had usurped states' rights in \n     enacting that seemingly sensible measure. The Court stressed, \n     as a matter of ``first principles,'' that requiring Congress \n     to confine itself to those ``few and defined'' powers \n     delegated to the National Legislature, id. at 1626 (quoting \n     James Madison, The Federalist No. 45), was the Constitution's \n     most fundamental device for ``ensuring[] protection of our \n     fundamental liberties', '' and ``reduc[ing] the risk[s] of \n     tyranny and abuse.'' Id. at 1626 (quoting Gregory v. \n     Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 458 (1991)).\n       As a constitutional scholar sometimes identified as \n     ``liberal,'' I was apparently expected by many to side with \n     the Lopez dissenters--Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and \n     Breyer. In fact, however, I had publicly predicted, and \n     publicly applauded, the Court's Lopez decision, believing \n     strongly that Congress, however, sound its policy objectives, \n     has a solemn duty to take seriously the constitutional \n     boundaries of its affirmative authority--something I believe \n     it failed to do when enacting the GFSZA, and something I \n     believe it would even more clearly fail to do were it to \n     enact the Defense of Marriage Act.\n       Who but a madman could favor handgun possession near \n     schools? Who but a scoundrel could oppose the defense of \n     marriage? But of course that isn't the issue. We must look \n     beneath these plain vanilla wrappings to see the power grabs \n     they conceal. In the ``defense of marriage'' context, that \n     power grab is remarkably clear once one strips away the \n     emotion-laden rhetoric that surrounds the issue.\n       The defenders of the proposed new 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1738C, \n     conceding that the Constitution requires them to identify an \n     affirmative delegation of power to Congress as the source of \n     the lawmaking authority they would have Congress exercise, \n     can point only to the Full Faith and Credit Clause itself, \n     and to this statement in particular: ``And the Congress may \n     by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, \n     Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect \n     thereof.'' The proposed law's defenders, without any \n     evident embarrassment or sense of irony, claim that a law \n     licensing States to give no effect at all to a specific \n     category of ``Acts, Records and Proceedings'' is a general \n     law prescribing ``the effect'' of such acts, records and \n     proceedings. That is a play on words, not a legal \n     argument. There may be legitimate debate about precisely \n     what sorts of national legislation this clause empowers \n     Congress to enact so as to mandate sister-state \n     enforcement of various state policies which, absent such \n     effectuating legislation, the States might otherwise be \n     free to disregard notwithstanding the Full Faith and \n     legislation, the States might otherwise be free to \n     disregard notwithstanding the Full Faith and Credit \n     Clause. But it is as plain as words can make it the \n     congressional power to ``prescribe . . . the effect'' of \n     sister-state acts, records, and proceedings, within the \n     context of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, includes no \n     congressional power to prescribe that some acts, records \n     and proceedings that would otherwise be entitled to full \n     faith and credit under the Full Faith and Credit Clause as \n     judicially interpreted shall instead to be entitled to no \n     faith or credit at all!\n       The reason is straightforward: Power to specify how a \n     sister-state's official acts are to be ``proved'' and to \n     prescribe ``the effect thereof'' includes no power to decree \n     that, if those official acts offend a congressional majority, \n     the need to be given no effect whatsoever by any State that \n     happens to share Congress's substantive views. To read the \n     enabling sentence of the Full Faith and Credit Clause to \n     confer upon Congress a power to delegate this sort of \n     nullification authority--to read it, in other words, as the \n     proponents of this anti-same-sex-marriage-law must read it if \n     they are to treat it as the source of power for the \n     legislation they advocate--would entail the conclusion that \n     congress may constitutionally decree that no Hawaii marriage, \n     no California divorce, no Kansas default judgment, no \n     punitive damages award by any state court against a civil \n     rights lawyer--to suggest a few of infinitely many possible \n     examples--need to be given any legal effect at all by any \n     State that chooses to avail itself of a congressional license \n     to ignore the Full Faith and Credit Clause. The enabling \n     sentence simply will not bear so tortured a reading.\n       The claim of its supporters that this measure would somehow \n     defend states' rights by enlarging the constitutional \n     authority of States opposing same-sex marriage at the expense \n     of the constitutional authority of States accepting same-sex \n     marriage rests on a profound misunderstanding of what a \n     dedication to ``states' rights'' means. If this is a \n     protection of states' rights, then it would equally protect \n     states' rights for Congress, without any affirmative \n     authorization in the Constitution, to license any State \n     wishing to do so to deny basic police protection to same-sex \n     couples visiting the State after getting married in a home \n     State that recognizes same-sex marriage, despite the \n     Privileges and Immunities Clause, Art. IV, Sec. 2, cl. 1. Our \n     Constitution protects the rights of the States by assuring \n     their equal status in the Union, and by guaranteeing that \n     Congress may legislate only pursuant to a delegation of power \n     in the Constitution. The proposal federal law transgresses \n     both of these principles. That it does so in a manner that \n     involves licensing some States to take actions that the \n     Constitution itself would otherwise forbid--and in this sense \n     enlarges the powers of States availing themselves of its \n     purported authorization--should not be permitted to deceive \n     anyone into mistaking this legislation for a law friendly to \n     principles of state sovereignty.\n       Indeed, the proposed measure would create a precedent \n     dangerous to the very idea of a United States of America. For \n     if Congress may exempt same-sex marriage from full faith and \n     credit, then Congress may also exempt from the mandate of the \n     Full Faith and Credit Clause whatever category of judgments--\n     including not only decrees affecting family structure but \n     also specified types of commercial judgments--a majority of \n     the House and Senate might wish to license States to \n     nullify at their option. Such purported authority to \n     dismantle the nationally unifying shield of Article IV's \n     Full Faith and Credit Clause, far from protecting states' \n     rights, would destroy one of the Constitution's core \n     guarantees that the United States of America will remain a \n     union of equal sovereigns; that no law, not even one \n     favored by a great majority of the States, can ever reduce \n     any State's official acts, on any subject, to second-class \n     status; and, most basic of all, that there will be no ad \n     hoc exceptions to the constitutional axiom, reflected in \n     the Tenth Amendment's unambiguous language, that ours is a \n     National Government whose powers are limited to those \n     enumerated in the Constitution itself.\n       The basic point is a simple one: The Full Faith and Credit \n     Clause authorizes Congress to enforce the clause's self-\n     executing requirements insofar as judicial enforcement alone, \n     as overseen by the Supreme Court, might reasonably be deemed \n     insufficient. But the Full Faith and Credit Clause confers \n     upon Congress no power to gut its self-executing \n     requirements, either piecemeal or all at once.\n       If judicial precedent for this textually and structurally \n     evident conclusion is sought, it must be sought in analogous \n     areas rather than in the context of the Full Faith and Credit \n     Clause itself, for Congress has never attempted to exercise \n     its Full Faith and Credit enforcement power to nullify rather\n\n[[Page S5933]]\n\n     than to enforce the mandate of that clause. In perhaps the \n     closest analogy, the Supreme Court has interpreted another of \n     the Constitution's few clauses expressly authorizing Congress \n     to enforce a constitutional mandate addressed to the States \n     to mean that Congress may effectuate such a mandate but may \n     not ``exercise discretion in the other direction [by] \n     enact[ing]'' statutes that ``dilute'' the mandate's self-\n     executing force as authoritatively construed by the Supreme \n     Court. Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 651 n. 10 (1966) \n     (Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment). A similar principle \n     must guide interpretation of the Full Faith and Credit \n     Clause, whose text leaves no real doubt that its self-\n     executing reach, as authoritatively determined by the Supreme \n     Court, may not be negated or nullified, in whole or in part, \n     under the guise of legislatively enforcing or effectuating \n     that clause. This is especially so in light of ``the strong \n     unifying principle embodied in the Full Faith and Credit \n     Clause looking toward maximum enforcement in each state of \n     the obligation's or rights created or recognized by . . . \n     sister states . . . '' Hughes v. Fetter 341 U.S. 609, 612 \n     (1951).\n       It would do violence not only to the letter but also to the \n     spirit of the Full Faith and Credit Clause to construe it as \n     a fount of affirmative authority for Congress--if I may be \n     excused for borrowing a marriage metaphor--to set asunder the \n     States that this clause brought together. The Constitution's \n     plan to form a ``more perfect Union,'' in the preamble's \n     words, would be inexcusably subverted by treating its most \n     vital unifying provision as a license for legislation that \n     does not unify or integrate but divides and disintegrates.\n       It is no answer at all to say that some purported \n     marriages--e.g., marriages entered into in one State by \n     residents of another in order to evade the latter State's \n     prohibition against bigamy--might in any event be entitled to \n     no ``faith and credit'' under Art. IV, Sec. 1, cl. 1, as \n     occasionally construed by the courts. To the degree that this \n     is in fact true of any given category of marriages, divorces, \n     or other official state acts--itself a complex and \n     controversial question (see Robert H. Jackson, Full Faith and \n     Credit--the Lawyer's Clause of the Constitution, 45 Colum. L. \n     Rev. 1, 27 (1945); Douglas Laycock, Equal Citizens of Equal \n     and Territorial States, 92 Colum. L. Rev. 249, 313-37 \n     (1992))--all that follows is that, with respect to such \n     marriages, divorces, or other official acts, the proposed \n     federal legislation would be entirely redundant and indeed \n     altogether devoid of content.\n       In any such context, ``[e]ven if the Federal Government \n     possessed the broad authority to facilitate state powers, in \n     this case there would be nothing that suggests that States \n     are in need of federal assistance.'' Rubin  v. Coors Brewing \n     Co., 115 S. Ct. 1585, 1591 (1995) (rejecting on First \n     Amendment grounds a ``let-Congress-assist-the-States'' \n     argument in support of a federal regulation of beer \n     advertising). The essential point is that States need no \n     congressional license to deny enforcement of whatever sister-\n     state decisions might fall within any judicially recognized \n     full faith and credit exception. The only authority the \n     proposed statute could possibly add to whatever discretion \n     States already possess would be authority to treat a sister \n     State's binding acts as though they were the acts of a \n     foreign nation--authority that Congress has no constitutional \n     power to confer.\n           Sincerely,\n     Laurence H.

Here in the United \nStates, breast cancer is second to lung cancer in cancer-related deaths \namong women. However, in spite of its prevalence, we still cling to the \nbelief that it will not happen to us or those we are close to. Chances \nare that someone you know and love will be a victim of this tragic \ndisease. Chances are that someone will be your wife, mother, daughter, \nor sister.\n  As with most types of cancer, a primary cause has not been found. \nYoung women are increasingly dealing with the fear of this potentially \nthreatening disease. Older women, who are at a much higher risk, are \noften not aware of their vulnerability to breast cancer. Only 34 \npercent of women over the age of 50 receive regular mammograms.\n  Until a cure is found, we all must join in the effort to raise money \nfor research and continually improve education and awareness of this \ndisease. I am proud to say that Alabama has been a driving force in our \nNation's efforts toward these goals. Advances at the University of \nAlabama at Birmingham, like the identification of the human natural \nkiller cell thought to play a key role in the body's destruction of \ncancer cells, are vital to the discovery of a cure. The consistent \nsupport of research centers, like the Marshall Space Flight Center, \nwhich assist with and support cancer research, are crucial to our \nprogression toward a cure. Not unlike UAB and Marshall Space Flight \nCenter, cancer research and education facilities across the country \nmust receive funding. This signifies the importance of the Race for the \nCure which allows individuals, who are essentially helpless against \ncancer, to work in unison for cancer research and awareness.\n  Having chaired the Alabama Breast Cancer Summit, I have been amazed \nat the aggressiveness and frequency of this disease. An article which \nappeared in The Journal of the American Medical Association on February \n9, 1994, told of how the baby boom generation have about twice the risk \nof developing cancer as their grandparents. The threat becomes even \nmore imminent when one considers how quickly the percentage of elderly \npeople in this country is growing. Even now, the risk for women is \ngreater than before. Women born in the 1950's have almost a 3 times \ngreater risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer than women born 50 \nyears earlier. Some of this increase can be attributed to the improved \nmethods of diagnosing breast cancer. However, because the trends are \nsteady and are seen in women over 50, who receive less screening, \nresearchers believe better diagnoses cannot explain the whole picture.\n  The Race for the Cure is, therefore, important not only in terms of \nraising money for breast cancer research but also in providing a forum \nfor awareness and education. I encourage everyone who can to \nparticipate in the Race on June 15. Also, I would like to encourage \neveryone in the Nation to get involved in efforts to fight breast \ncancer in their communities. We all have to work diligently toward a \ncure for this tragic disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5933-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

WESSEL\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to George L. \nWessel, a friend and associate, who is stepping down as president of \nthe Buffalo AFL-CIO Council after 27 years as Erie County's foremost \nlabor leader representing more than 100,000 workers in more than 200 \nlabor locals. Though he will continue to stay active in the community, \nhe will now be fortunate enough to spend more time with his wife of 49 \nyears, Mary; his daughter, Mary Catherine; and his three grandchildren, \nJoseph, Mary Anna, and Catherine Victoria. I thank him for his good \nwork and wish him the best of luck in the future.\n  George Wessel's career involvement with the labor movement began when \nhe returned home from serving his country in the U.S. Navy during World \nWar II. He worked for Remington Rand, joined the Printing Pressmen's\n\n[[Page S5934]]\n\nUnion, and eventually became a journeyman printer. From that position, \nhe advanced to become a chief steward in the plant and a member of the \nLocal 27 executive board. His fellow workers noticed his dedication to \nthe cause of organized labor, and in January 1961, they elected George \nas secretary-treasurer of the local which represented all print shops \nin western New York. In this post, he again served with distinction \nuntil January 1, 1969, when he was elected to succeed Judge James L. \nKane as president of the Buffalo AFL-CIO Council.\n  As President, George Wessel has enjoyed great popularity as a leader \nof labor and as a leader in civic life. Elected to nine 3-year terms as \npresident of the Buffalo AFL-CIO Council, George has been a tremendous \ninfluence on the labor movement in the past quarter century. In the \nearly 1980's, the Buffalo AFL-CIO Council was in the forefront of \nefforts to organize Solidarity Day in Washington, DC. Since then, \nthousands of union activists have converged at the Nation's Capital \neach year to call attention to issues affecting working men and women. \nGeorge has also overseen council activities, negotiated with business \nleaders, mobilized affiliated locals for public demonstrations, and \nbeen the official spokesman for organized labor in Erie County. He also \nstarted the grand tradition of the Labor Day parade through the streets \nof Buffalo. It was several times my honor to march through the streets \nwith George during the parade, and I was always the better for having \ndone so.\n  George Wessel has also been a sterling member of the community as he \nhas constantly worked to improve the physical, social, and cultural \nenvironment of Buffalo. Whether as a member of the United Way, or as a \nmember of the labor advisory board at Cornell University, George Wessel \nhas strived to make Buffalo a better place to live and work.\n  Though labor has faced many setbacks in western New York and \nthroughout much of the country in recent years, George Wessel has \nfought to stem that tide. Due to his great efforts, organized labor \nstill remains at the forefront of commercial activity and is a much \nrespected movement in the Buffalo community.\n  We shall all be sorry to see George step down as president of the \ncouncil, but organized labor will still remain a force in Erie County. \nLike the Workers Memorial in Chestnut Ridge, this is a testament to \nGeorge Wessel's half century of involvement with the union movement in \nBuffalo.\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that current \nletters from the Governors of California, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, \nMichigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, \nSouth Carolina, Virginia, and Wyoming on the need for the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution be --I would use the word \nmemorialized--in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                State Capitol,\n\n                                     Sacramento, CA, June 4, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: This week, the 104th Congress will make \n     a final attempt to pass the Balanced Budget Amendment. The \n     amendment has already been approved overwhelmingly by the \n     House of Representatives, and it is within two votes of \n     passage in the Senate. I urge you to take this opportunity to \n     endorse the Balanced Budget Amendment and help secure the \n     Democratic votes needed to ensure its passage.\n       To Californians alone, certainty of a balanced federal \n     budget is literally worth billions upon billions of dollars. \n     The lower interest rates that would accompany reduced federal \n     borrowing would save our state government more than $3 \n     billion per year, enough to provide a $262 tax cut for every \n     household in California. More importantly, balancing the \n     budget by 2002 would prevent each and every citizen in \n     California from assuming more than $4,000 worth of additional \n     federal debt.\n       Comparison of federal spending and California state \n     spending over the past five years shows that if Washington \n     had practiced a level of fiscal discipline similar to that we \n     have exercised in Sacramento, the federal government would \n     now be running a surplus rather than a deficit. There is no \n     question that California's constitutional mandate for a \n     balanced budget has provided an essential incentive for \n     achieving this performance.\n       Now, California is reaping the benefits of tightly \n     controlled spending, with a resurgent economy driving up \n     state tax revenues. This has set the stage for tax cuts that \n     will let people keep more of their own money, and increased \n     funding for education and other investments in California's \n     future.\n       Mr. President, you, more than anyone else, should be \n     supporting the Balanced Budget Amendment to show your honest \n     commitment to reforming federal spending and sparing future \n     generations from a crushing burden of debt. The Balanced \n     Budget Amendment is a promise that transcends elections; a \n     promise that cannot be simply revoked on November 6.\n       I challenge you to make public your support for the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment and help secure the two Democratic \n     votes needed to pass it.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pete Wilson.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                State of Illinois,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                    Springfield, IL, June 4, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: In the next week, the Senate will \n     be voting on the Balanced Budget Amendment. I urge you to \n     contact Senators from your party and ask them to vote for \n     this critical measure. We must change the direction our \n     country is going financially, and this is the first step.\n       This is a very bi-partisan issue, as Senator Simon from the \n     State of Illinois has proven. Members from both sides of the \n     aisle have recognized the importance of passing a bill \n     mandating to Congress that this country operates under a \n     balanced budget. The longer we wait to balance the budget, \n     the more we leave a legacy of debt for our children and \n     grandchildren and take away from our ability to address \n     pressing national priorities.\n       In the United States, we currently spend 11 times more \n     money on interest on the national debt than we do on \n     education, and twice as much on interest than on all of our \n     poverty programs. We have come to realize in Illinois the \n     importance of a balanced budget and the sacrifices that are \n     needed to achieve that goal. A balanced budget requirement as \n     been part of our state constitution since 1970, and members \n     of both parties have worked hard at maintaining that \n     requirement.\n       Mr. President, I can not stress enough the importance of \n     passing the Balanced Budget Amendment. In order to achieve \n     the balanced budgets that you and the Republican leadership \n     have proposed, we need the discipline of a constitutional \n     amendment. Again, I urge you to contact members of your party \n     in the Senate, and request that they vote for the Balanced \n     Budget Amendment. I thank you, in advance, for your \n     consideration on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Jim Edgar,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  State of Kansas,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                         Topeka, KS, June 5, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: The next few days will be historic. \n     The announcement by United States Senator Bob Dole to resign \n     from his position as Majority Leader and U.S. Senator is of \n     great historical significance. Before the distinguished \n     Senator departs, you and the members of Congress will have \n     the opportunity to perform a legislative act equally \n     historic--approving legislation to balance the federal \n     budget. As Senator Dole concludes his terms in the United \n     States Senate, this week has been proclaimed Balanced Budget \n     Week in recognition of Senator Dole's efforts to set America \n     back on track toward economic vitality. I encourage you to do \n     everything in your power to promote a balanced budget \n     amendment.\n       Since 1932, Kansas has been a cash basis state, which means \n     that pursuant to State law, Kansas cannot debt spend. We are \n     forced to project revenues and balance our budgets \n     accordingly. Sometimes we must reevaluate our priorities and \n     tighten our belts. Other times we must reevaluate the \n     relationship between the State and its citizens by \n     determining in what programs the people of Kansas want their \n     government to engage, and which programs are no longer worthy \n     of the people's financial resources. That kind of common \n     sense approach to budgeting has served Kansas well, and it \n     can go a long way toward resolving the deficit at the federal \n     level. If Kansas can balance its budget each and every year, \n     as do the people of America, so too can the federal \n     government.\n       In Kansas, we directed an Administration that has taken the \n     initiative to provide Kansas children with the same \n     opportunities for a sound fiscal future with which we were \n     blessed. The budget we submitted to the state Legislature \n     this year is the first in a generation that spends less than \n     the year before. We have been able to pass along the savings \n     to Kansas taxpayers in the form of meaningful tax relief--in \n     excess of $1.4 billion over five years. We accomplished \n     significant tax relief--reducing the burden on Kansas \n     taxpayers--without neglecting those in\n\n[[Page S5935]]\n\n     need of our help and support. Although this was a daunting \n     and challenging task, the people of Kansas expected nothing \n     less than courageous leadership from their elected officials. \n     Similarly, the people of America expect nothing less from \n     their President.\n       The future of America's children depends on your support of \n     a balanced budget amendment. Please do not fail to make the \n     most of the historic possibilities presented in the days \n     ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Graves,\n       Governor.\n     Sheila Frahm,\n       Lt. Governor, U.S. Senator Designate.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               State of Louisiana,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                        Baton Rouge, June 4, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As I mentioned when you were here last \n     week, Louisiana is a conservative state. That Louisiana's \n     State Constitution requires the Legislature to pass and the \n     Governor to sign a balanced budget is a strong reflection of \n     these conservative values.\n       I would like to take this opportunity to request that you \n     join me, a majority of our nation's governors, and eighty-\n     three percent of all Americans in supporting a balanced \n     budget amendment to the United States Constitution. A \n     balanced budget requirement has been good for Louisiana, it \n     has been good for your home state of Arkansas, and it would \n     be good for the United States of America.\n       It is time for our elected officials in Washington to \n     exercise the same degree of fiscal discipline that their \n     colleagues in statehouses across the country do. I'm afraid \n     that past history makes it all too clear that we will not get \n     a balanced federal budget unless we require one \n     constitutionally.\n       For the sake of our children and their children, to put \n     their needs above those of the federal government in \n     Washington, I urge you to announce your support for a \n     balanced budget amendment today.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        M.J. ``Mike'' Foster, Jr.,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                State of Michigan,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                        Lansing, MI, June 5, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President, The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: This week Congress has the opportunity \n     to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment that will truly change \n     the way Washington does business.\n       Large deficits and public indebtedness undermine the growth \n     of the economy and impose unnecessary and unfair burdens on \n     our future generations. This may explain why the American \n     people overwhelmingly support a Balanced Budget Amendment. \n     Recent surveys indicate over 80% of those individuals polled \n     support a Constitutional amendment to require a balanced \n     budget, while only 16% said that they oppose this measure.\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment will force the federal \n     government to take appropriate action to live within its \n     means just as 49 of the 50 states must do. This action is \n     necessary to prevent further burdens on our children and \n     succeeding generations. A balanced budget plan would add $32 \n     billion in disposable income to the U.S. economy, $88 billion \n     in new investment and would yield up to 6.1 million new job \n     opportunities with the confidence and assurance that real \n     work and real wages bring.\n       Mr. President, I strongly urge you to join the majority of \n     the nation's Governors and the nation's citizens in \n     supporting the Balanced Budget Amendment. I encourage you to \n     request Members of the Senate to support this measure when it \n     comes up for a vote this week.\n       Thank you for your consideration on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Engler,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           State of New Hampshire,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                        Concord, NH, June 4, 1996.\n     Hon. William Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As Governor of New Hampshire, I write \n     to you today in support of the Balanced Budget Amendment to \n     the United States Constitution.\n       The time has come to deal with the greatest threat to the \n     well-being of Americans, the ability of our federal \n     government to balance its budget without raising taxes and \n     without sending unfunded mandates to be paid for by the \n     citizens of our State. It must be done and I believe it is of \n     tremendous importance that we do it now.\n       As a former Attorney General, one who has studied our \n     nation's Constitution and loves it, I recommend amending it \n     only after considerable reflection. I simply know of no other \n     way to restore belief in our citizens that government can be \n     responsive to the principles and values that made this \n     country great. It is unfortunate that such an amendment is \n     required, but it is clear that it is required.\n       New Hampshire does not have a balanced budget amendment, \n     but no Governor has ever submitted an unbalanced budget. In \n     New Hampshire, it is illegal for a department head to deficit \n     spend.\n       New Hampshire has balanced budgets for 200 years without an \n     income or sales tax. All governors share common problems and \n     seek common solutions. In New Hampshire, however, balanced \n     budgets are the norm, as they should be in Washington.\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment is a bold step, but the \n     American people are ready for bold change. They have grown \n     frustrated with excuses as to why the federal budget cannot \n     be balanced. They have rejected the attitude that our \n     children will somehow be able to pay for financial \n     mismanagement.\n       This moment in history can return the United States to a \n     policy of fiscal sanity. I respectfully urge you to move \n     forward and support the Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       The American people will be with you.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Stephen Merrill,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           Office of the Governor,\n\n\n                                                State Capitol,\n\n                                       Santa Fe, NM, June 4, 1996.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: I am writing to request your \n     support of a balanced budget amendment in 1996. This would \n     initiate an era of sound fiscal policy for the federal \n     government and serve to make our nation stronger and our \n     children's future more secure. To take a stand on this issue \n     and work with Congress is to offer the American people a \n     reason to again believe in the decision making ability of \n     government.\n       The national debt, though often discussed in the abstract, \n     is a very real danger. If you do not take measures to ensure \n     a balanced budget amendment, this insidious threat to our \n     nation's future will continue to grow without impediment. We \n     must not let this opportunity go unanswered and I implore you \n     to lead this country into a future secured by solid \n     government policy. We cannot go forward without a balanced \n     budget amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Gary E. Johnson,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                State of New York,\n\n\n                                            Executive Chamber,\n\n                                         Albany, NY, June 5, 1996.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: I urge you, Mr. President, to \n     support and actively work to pass the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment to the Constitution offered by Senator Dole. This \n     amendment calls for a balanced federal budget by the year \n     2002.\n       Passing a Balanced Budget Amendment is critical to \n     America's strength as a world leader. Moreover, as elected \n     officials, we have a special obligation to free our children \n     and grandchildren from the mountains of government debt which \n     are mortgaging their future. Approving a Balanced Budget \n     Amendment would not only instill long-needed fiscal \n     discipline in Washington, but also would lower interest \n     rates, increase real disposable income for working families, \n     and help create millions of new jobs.\n       Last year, despite virtual unanimous Republican support, \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment failed in the Senate because of \n     overwhelming Democrat opposition. In addition, you vetoed the \n     only balanced budget bill passed by Congress in the last 26 \n     years. However, it's not too late to correct the mistakes of \n     the past and put our nation on sounder financial footing.\n       Again, I urge you, Mr. President, to support Senator Dole's \n     Balanced Budget Amendment and actively lobby your party \n     members to secure its passage.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 George E. Pataki,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            State of North Dakota,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                       Bismarck, ND, June 5, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n      Washington, DC.\n       Mr. President, I am writing today to express my support for \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment.\n       All but one state in our United States has a requirement to \n     balance its budget. In my home state of North Dakota, the \n     legislature has made tough, hard, and sometimes unpopular \n     decisions to balance its budget every biennium since \n     statehood. It is only proper that our federal government in \n     Washington take on that same responsibility to protect the \n     future generations of our country.\n       The passage of the Congressional balanced budget plan would \n     add $32 billion in real disposable income, $66 billion in new \n     purchases, $88 billion in new investments, and over 100,000 \n     new housing starts to the United States Economy while also \n     providing up to 6.1 million new job opportunities.\n       In North Dakota the passage would mean a savings of $2,388 \n     a year on payments for a 30-year mortgage on a $75,000 house; \n     $1,026 in savings over the life of a 4-year loan on a $15,000 \n     automobile; $1,891 in savings over the life of a 10-year \n     student loan of $11,000--all totaled these savings would \n     amount to $74,381 over the duration of the loans.\n       All Americans must be assured that their future and the \n     future of their children are secure and that their needs are \n     foremost in the\n\n[[Page S5936]]\n\n     minds of our leaders in Washington. There is no better way to \n     guarantee the citizens of North Dakota the bright future they \n     deserve than to pass the Balanced Budget Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Edward T. Schafer,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                State of Oklahoma,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                  Oklahoma City, OK, June 4, 1996.\n     Hon. Bill Clinton,\n     The White House.\n       Dear Mr. President: On Friday, May 31, at 4:59 p.m., the \n     Legislature of the State of Oklahoma adjourned its 1996 \n     session. Not once during that four-month session was there a \n     moment of discussion about deficit spending. Not one penny \n     was appropriated to pay interest on a state debt. No bill was \n     passed that spent a cent in excess of actual state revenues--\n     all because the Constitution of Oklahoma contains an \n     amendment that requires a balanced budget.\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution will be considered in the Senate this week. I \n     urge you to follow the examples of 49 of our 50 states--\n     including Oklahoma and Arkansas--and support this effort to \n     import common sense from the states to Washington.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Frank Keating,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          State of South Carolina,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                       Columbia, SC, June 5, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As the Senate prepares to reconsider \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment, I write to express my strong \n     support of this important legislation. The time has come for \n     the federal government to abide by the same rules of fiscal \n     responsibility that every family, business, and state \n     government must follow.\n       The federal deficit imposes debilitating costs on both \n     current and future generations. We must start setting \n     priorities and make difficult decisions now for the sake of \n     our children and our children's children. The longer that we \n     avoid our responsibility to the American people, the more we \n     put the prosperity of future generations at risk.\n       A balanced budget will result in lower interest rates, \n     which will allow working families to keep more of their hard-\n     earned money. With lower interest rates, more families will \n     have the opportunity to own their own home, and businesses \n     will be able to afford the capital investment to grow jobs.\n       Unfortunately, despite promises made in Washington, a \n     balanced budget has not become law in decades. In fact, your \n     veto of the first balanced budget in 26 years makes it \n     imperative that the Congress pass a constitutional amendment \n     to balance the federal budget. Your support for this \n     amendment would give the citizens of South Carolina and \n     across the nation the opportunity to vote on the nation's \n     fiscal integrity and the future of our country. Only a \n     constitutional amendment will provide the ironclad discipline \n     needed to restore fiscal responsibility.\n       You have historically been in favor of a balanced budget, \n     as evidenced by your recent budget proposal, and as a former \n     governor, you had to balance your own state books every year. \n     By expressing your public support for the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment, you would prove your convictions to the American \n     public, over eighty percent of whom strongly support such an \n     amendment.\n       I respectfully ask you to urge the Senate to pass the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment and put America on the path of \n     prosperity and growth for generations to come.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 David M. Beasley,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         Commonwealth of Virginia,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                       Richmond, VA, June 4, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The United States Senate is preparing \n     to consider again the Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S. \n     Constitution. Often in the past, you have voiced your \n     commitment to balancing the federal budget, and I sincerely \n     hope that you will couple your words with actions and \n     publicly and energetically encourage the Senate to approve \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment now.\n       As an original sponsor of the Kyl-Allen Balanced Budget \n     Amendment in the United States House of Representatives, I \n     was most disappointed last year when the Senate failed by one \n     vote to send this constitutional amendment to the States for \n     ratification. The Balanced Budget Amendment is not a unique \n     or unproven concept. As a former governor, you are no doubt \n     aware that virtually every State operates under the \n     discipline of a balanced budget requirement. The fact is, it \n     works. With our requirement for a balanced budget, Virginia \n     is one of only four States with a AAA Bond Rating for our \n     careful and limited use of debt.\n       The people of the United States recognize that passage of \n     the Balanced Budget Amendment is an essential discipline for \n     getting the federal government on the path toward fiscal \n     responsibility. It is also important to improving the quality \n     of life for working families in Virginia and across America.\n       A family's cost of living is greatly affected by interest \n     rates. The lower interest rates would accompany a balanced \n     budget. Working Americans deserve to be able to keep more of \n     their hard-earned money and put it to work for their \n     families. As borrowing costs drop, housing becomes more \n     affordable as well. A 2% drop in interest rates would save \n     the average homeowner between $1,600 and $1,800 per year in \n     mortgage payments. More affordable housing means more home \n     ownership which is the American Dream. And a healthy housing \n     industry increases job opportunities for electricians, \n     plumbers, carpenters, excavators, forestry products, \n     appliance manufacturers, Realtors, and many more that are \n     associated with the housing industry.\n       Our government should be helping, not hindering, more \n     individuals and families to realize the American dream of \n     homeownership. We can begin to do so by making the balanced \n     budget the law of the land in Washington, as it is in our \n     States. Please put the force of your office behind a balanced \n     budget for America--let us in Virginia vote on this important \n     Amendment.\n       With kind personal regards, I remain,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     George Allen,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 State of Wyoming,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                       Cheyenne, WY, June 5, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Next week the 104th Congress will have \n     it's final opportunity this year to pass a Balanced Budget \n     Amendment. Once allowed to become law, this Amendment will \n     truly change the way our country does business.\n       It is time for our elected officials in Washington to \n     exercise the same degree of fiscal responsibility that state \n     governments have adopted. I am concerned that if Washington \n     continues with the current financial practices, future \n     generations will have a financial burden beyond repair. \n     History has made it all too clear that we will not balance \n     the federal budget unless required by the constitution.\n       The United States spends 11 times more money to pay for \n     interest accrued on the national debt than we do on \n     education, and twice as much on interest than on all of our \n     entitlement programs. In 1993 the state of Wyoming recognized \n     a need for the Governor to submit the budget under estimated \n     revenues. It is important to realize the need for a balanced \n     budget, and to make the sacrifices necessary to achieve that \n     goal. Now is the time for action!\n       In Wyoming, our constitution requires a balanced budget \n     each biennium. The people of Wyoming cannot understand why \n     such a requirement at the federal level is even questioned. \n     Your support for the Balanced Budget Amendment would do much \n     to bring accountability back to the federal government. I \n     trust we in Wyoming can count on your support.\n       I can not stress enough the importance of passing the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment. In order to achieve the balanced \n     budget that you have proposed, the people of the United \n     States deserve the discipline of a constitutional amendment. \n     I urge you to contact members of your party in the Senate, \n     and request that they vote for the Balanced Budget Amendment!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jim Geringer,\n     Governor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5934-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5936-S5937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the whole Nation is waking to yet \nanother trustees' report that should paint a very bright, vivid red \nlight to every American. We have gone past the yellow light. I would \nlike to share with the Senate just a few facts that have recently been \npublished by the Coalition To Save Medicare.\n  Fact: Medicare's hospital fund will be broke in less than 5 years.\n  Fact: Because Medicare reform was not enacted last year, $133 billion \nmore in savings is needed to meet the trustees' own minimum \nrequirements.\n  In other words, when the President of the United States vetoed the \nattempt to keep Medicare solvent, to make it solvent for almost 20 \nyears, to improve the options that seniors would have, to increase the \ninvestment in it 70 to 80 percent, the net effect is in 1 year we have \nmade the job of solving and saving Medicare $133 billion more \ndifficult.\n  Fact: Each day, Medicare is spending $25 million more than it takes \nin.\n  Fact: Without reform, a working American's annual payroll taxes will \nhave to increase between $1,880 and $3,185 immediately to assure the \nlong-term health of Medicare.\n  Fact: Maintaining the current system as it is for the long term \nwithout reform or tax increases will require immediately increasing the \nannual hospital deductible a senior pays to between $5,380 and $6,540.\n  Fact: Without reform, a working American's annual payroll taxes must\n\n[[Page S5937]]\n\nimmediately increase to between $1,229 and $1,564 just to ensure that \nMedicare survives 25 years.\n  Mr. President, as I have told Georgians and Americans all across the \ncountry, the era of passing these problems on to another generation is \nover. It is absolutely over. Within a decade, Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, Federal retirement and the interest only on our \ndebt will consume 100 percent of the U.S. Treasury. It does not take a \nrocket scientist or a brilliant economist from one of our major \nuniversities to understand that that will wreak havoc on every family \nand every business. It will destabilize the world's greatest democracy.\n  This problem is going to get worked out. We are either going to take \ncharge of it and lead our way out of it or we are going to stumble into \nit, and world markets and the economy will come crashing down on our \nheads.\n  I am reading from the Washington Times, Wednesday, June 5, 1996. It \nopens by saying:\n\n       The Clinton administration today is expected to confirm \n     that Medicare will go bankrupt by 2001, but prospects for \n     resolving the problem this year look dim.\n\n  So, as we approach this train wreck, we continue to turn away from it \nand we run the risk of destabilizing the lives of millions of \nAmericans. But the more important thing that I read in this article is \nthe following. It reads, ``Democrats said they are not that concerned \nthat Medicare will go broke,'' that is interesting, ``because Congress \nhas always acted at the last minute to avert a disaster.''\n  The last minute part is correct. But the averting of a disaster is \nnot. We have been moving with each succeeding year towards an ultimate \ndisaster which has been called to our attention, once again, by the \ntrustees. It says:\n\n       ``I think Congress would default on Treasury bonds first,'' \n     said Rep. Pete Stark, California Democrat.\n\n  It is interesting. Mr. Stark is the ranking member on the \nsubcommittee on Ways and Means that deals with entitlements. This is a \nmost interesting statement that he makes on this dilemma. He says:\n\n       Mr. Stark acknowledged the $90 billion Democratic plan does \n     not go far enough to reform the system, even in the near-\n     term, and does not even begin to address what all sides say \n     is a massive insolvency problem in 2010, when the Baby Boom \n     generation starts to retire.\n\n  He goes on to say, and this is the key:\n\n       To fix the longer-term problem, Mr. Stark said, Democrats \n     probably would resort either to a government takeover of the \n     hospital and health-insurance payment system or raising \n     payroll taxes.\n\n  I hope everybody across our land has a chance to hear that solution. \nThis is the solution he is offering up that produced the 104th \nCongress. This was the idea that the administration and the President \nand the First Lady took all across the country and said, look, the way \nto solve this problem is to have the Government take over medicine, \nhave the Government take over another 17 percent of the American \neconomy. And Americans said, ``No way.'' They were so offended by this \nidea that they turned the majority of the Congress over.\n  But the idea has not left, and I believe that this statement by \nRepresentative Stark means that we are going to enter into, through the \nissue of Medicare, the whole question of our plan to modernize it, to \ncreate new options, to keep it in the private sector, to make it \ncompetitive, versus their plan, which is the old standard status quo, \nlet the Government take it over and increase the economic burden on the \nAmerican family and the American worker.\n  Mr. President, an average family in the State of Georgia today makes \n$45,000 a year. By the time the Federal Government gets through going \nthrough their checking account, and the State government, and FICA for \nSocial Security and Medicare, and their cost of regulatory reform, and \ntheir share of the higher interest rates because of the national debt, \nthey end up with 49 percent of their wages to run their families' \nbusiness. The suggestion that Mr. Stark is coming forward with is: That \nis not enough. Let us take another 10 or 20 percent out of their \nchecking accounts.\n  What America needs is for Washington to return these resources to the \nchecking accounts of the average American family and to reject the \nadministration and Mr. Stark's everlasting plea for more government and \nbigger government and more taxes and higher taxes.\n  I think Mr. Stark, knowingly or unknowingly, wittingly or \nunwittingly, has drawn an enormous benchmark for us to debate over the \nbalance of this year and the balance of this Congress as we talk about \nMedicare and talk about life in the American family and community in \nthis great United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett).

A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nrequire written consent before using union dues and other mandatory \nemployee fees for political activities; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n\n                    The Union Member Protection Act\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I introduce the Union Member \nProtection Act. As you may know, the unions are mounting an \nunprecedented campaign this year to defeat Republican Members of \nCongress. The main source of the money for this campaign comes from \ncompulsory union dues levied upon rank-and-file union members, as well \nas nonunion members who work in union shops. This past March the AFL-\nCIO, at a unique convention in Washington, DC, voted to levy a special \nassessment on every dues payer of 15 cents monthly per person to raise \n$25 million of the $35 million goal.\n  In a recent survey of 1,000 rank-and-file union members, commissioned \nby Americans for a balanced budget and conducted by the Luntz Research \nCos. 58 percent of the union members were not aware that the national \nlabor unions were using mandatory monthly dues on a $35 million \ncampaign to defeat Republican Members of Congress. When told of this, \n62 percent opposed the use of their union dues for this political \neffort. This is not surprising considering that nearly 40 percent of \nunion members voted Republican in the 1994 elections.\n  When discussing the pledge of $35 million from the unions for the \npurpose of unseating Republicans, Vice President Gore stated, ``One \ngroup with a conscience connected to working families can overpower \nhundreds of thousands of interests working against the interest of \nworking families.'' Conscience? Washington union bosses are living \nextravagant lifestyles, financed from workers' paychecks and, yet, they \nwould have people believe that Republicans are the ones out of touch \nwith rank and file working families. Union bosses have spent $2.3 \nmillion on the AFL-CIO's private airplane, $1.9 million to decorate the \npersonal home and conference center of a union boss, $250,000 for a \nWashington, DC, condominium, and more than $100,000 for a union boss' \nfuneral. These very same union bosses are responsible for President \nClinton exempting the labor unions' health care plans from his proposed \nGovernment takeover of the Nation's health care system, revoking \nPresident Bush's executive order requiring unions to notify their rank-\nand-file members of their right not to fund union political activities, \nand vetoing numerous bills opposed by the Washington union bosses, \nincluding a balanced budget, family tax cuts, and welfare reform. It's \nno wonder that 66 percent of union members prefer the leadership of \ntheir local chapters.\n  My bill, the Union Member Protection Act, will allow no dues, fees, \nor other money required as a condition of employment to be collected \nfrom an individual for use in noncollective-bargaining activities \nunless the individual has given prior written consent. Noncollective-\nbargaining activities would include: First, nonpartisan registration \nand get-out-the-vote campaigns and second; the establishment, \nadministration, and solicitation of contributions to a separate fund to \nbe used for political purposes. The written consent could be revoked in \nwriting at any time.\n  Mr. President, when a meeting of union leaders in Washington, DC, can \nresult in the bosses' effectively imposing a tax increase on the union \nworkers across the country so that the union bosses can have millions \nof dollars at their disposal to pursue their personal political \nagendas, the collective-bargaining power that Congress granted the \nunions is being abused. When we know that nearly two-thirds of the \nunion workers are not even aware they are being so taxed and disagree \nwith the D.C. bosses' politicizing of their own dues in this manner, \nthe abuse becomes so acute that it calls out for reform. My bill is a \nsimple reform: It gives individual workers the direct right to say \n``yes'' or ``no'' whenever union bosses ask them to finance activities \nthat fall outside the scope of collective bargaining. If the union \nbosses here in Washington are so confident their workers agree with \ntheir politics, they should have no problem with this bill. We'll soon \nsee how confident they are.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1845\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to permit duty free treatment for certain articles \nprovided by the Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy and the Arcetri \nAstrophysical Observatory; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      TARIFF EXEMPTION LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I introduce legislation today to \npermit duty-free treatment for certain structures, parts, and \ncomponents provided by the Max Planck Institute to University of \nArizona's submillimeter telescope and provided by the Arcetri \nAstrophysical Observatory for the University of Arizona's large \nbinocular telescope [LBT]. This legislation will help ensure the \ncontinued progress of astronomy in the United States and in Arizona.\n  To advance the potential of submillimeter astronomy, the Steward \nObservatory of the University of Arizona and the Max Planck Institute \nin Germany are collaborating on the construction and operation of a \ndedicated submillimeter telescope in Arizona. The University of Arizona \nhas unique capabilities in large glass optics, instrumentation, and \nmountaintop sites; the Max Planck Institute in development of large, \nprecise radio astronomy telescopes.\n  The SMT is the highest accuracy radio telescope ever built. And the \nSMT project has fostered an effective collaboration between an American \nUniversity, a German national research laboratory and high-technology \nindustries in both Germany and America.\n  The Tariff and Trade Act of 1984 provided a waiver of tariffs for \nequipment and materials provided by the Max Planck Institute. An \nextension of the waiver is necessary to further develop custom \ninstrumentation not available from any U.S. producer. An extension of \nthe waiver is also necessary to allow the calibration and repair of the \nequipment required by the project.\n  In addition, the University of Arizona has collaborated with Arcetri \nAstrophysical Observatory in Florence, Italy, to build the large \nbinocular telescope. The scientific goals of the LBT include studies of \nthe early universe and the formation of galaxies more than 10 billion \nyears ago. The very high sensitivity and spatial resolution for the LBT \nwill make it the most powerful instrument in the world for this kind of \nastronomical research.\n  This legislation will also provide duty-free treatment for components\n\n[[Page S5941]]\n\nthat cannot be obtained in the United States for construction of the \nUniversity of Arizona's large binocular telescope.\n  At a time when Federal budget constraints have made belt-tightening \nnecessary, these tariff exemptions are important to the continued \nsuccess of scientific research.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr, Inouye, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. \n        Kennedy):\n  S. 1848. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage the production and use of clean-fuel vehicles and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   The Clean Fuel Vehicle Act of 1996\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I want to talk about choices in \ntransportation. Most Americans who travel to work get there by car, \nsome perhaps by bus or commuter rail. Some even fly by jet airplane. \nThese are all choices in transportation modes, but they all have one \nthing in common: oil.\n  As we enter the 21st century, we must expand our choices in how we \npower transportation in this country. The percentage of total energy \nuse devoted to transportation is now at its highest level ever. \nTransportation accounts for two-thirds of the country's total petroleum \nuse, and transportation is 97 percent dependent on petroleum.\n  Americans are traveling by car more and more. The total number of \nvehicle miles traveled in California has increased by 10 percent since \n1991. Meanwhile, fuel economy has decreased for the second year in a \nrow.\n  This dependence on petroleum puts our economy foolishly at risk. The \narteries of our economy run on oil; and as we have seen with the latest \ngasoline price hikes, clogged arteries can cause heart problems in this \neconomy.\n  The cost of our oil addiction is paid not just at the pump but at our \nhospitals and doctors' offices.\n  According to the Coalition for Clean Air, diesel exhaust alone has \nbeen associated with up to 30,000 lung cancer deaths in California. \nThink about this: thirty thousand painful, premature deaths from one \nsource in one State.\n  In order to develop transportation choices that improve our health \nand wean us from the oil pump, we must develop real incentives for \nbuyers to consider alternatively fueled vehicles.\n  We began to do that in a real meaningful way in Congress in 1992 with \nthe Energy Policy Act. The modest incentives in that law helped to \nalmost double the number of alternatively fueled vehicles on the road. \nTo continue this trend, we need to build on our current incentives and \nreally spur the market for clean-fuel vehicles.\n  That is why I am introducing, with Senators Inouye, Feinstein, and \nKennedy, the Clean Fuel Vehicle Act of 1996. This bill provides a set \nof temporary, targeted tax incentives designed to spur the market for \nclean-fuel vehicles by making them cost competitive with fossil-fueled \nvehicles.\n  Increased use of zero-emission or low-emission vehicles will reduce \nthe Nation's dependence on foreign oil, reduce harmful transportation \nemissions, and stimulate market demand for high-technology vehicles and \ncomponents.\n  First, my bill exempts electric vehicles [EV's] and other clean-fuel \nvehicles from the luxury tax and from the depreciation on luxury \nautomobiles. This corrects a ludicrous inconsistency in current tax \nlaw. The law now provides a 10 percent tax credit of up to $4,000 on \nthe purchase of an EV. At the same time, however, a luxury tax is \nimposed if the total price of the car exceeds $32,000. In effect, our \ncurrent stimulus program puts a tax break into one pocket and takes it \nout of the other.\n  Second, my bill will allow the entire cost of an EV to be depreciated \nover a 5-year span. Under current law, only the first $3,000 or so of \nthe purchase price may be depreciated over 5 years; the remaining cost \nmust be recovered over a much longer period.\n  Third, the Boxer bill lifts the Government use restriction on tax \nincentives, giving a private business that leases EV's to a Government \nagency the same tax incentives it gets for leasing to a private \ninterest. Because of their great size and visibility, Government fleets \nare the initial target market for clean-fuel vehicles.\n  Fourth, my bill eliminates an oversight in the 1992 Energy Act that \nallows an electric-powered bus to take advantage of only the existing \n$4,000 tax credit. The bill would make electric buses also eligible for \nthe $50,000 tax deduction available to other clean-fuel buses. This tax \ndeduction would be greater than the $4,000 tax credit, especially for \nurban transit buses.\n  Finally, my bill overturns a 1995 IRS decision to tax liquified \nnatural gas [LNG] as a liquid fuel similar to diesel.\n  LNG holds the most promise as an alternative fuel for heavy-duty \ntransportation such as trucks and locomotives. It is abundant and \ncheaper than oil, and it contains more energy per pound than gasoline \nor diesel fuel. LNG is cooled to an extreme temperature whereas its \nchemical cousin, compressed natural gas [CNG] is pressurized for \nstorage. Both perform the same in a vehicle's engine. The advantage for \nLNG is less volume needed for on-board storage, which is important for \nheavy-duty vehicles such as trucks and buses. Lowering the tax on LNG \nis an important step for putting clean-fuel trucks and buses on \nCalifornia highways.\n\n  The IRS ruling put LNG at a tremendous cost disadvantage, which might \nwell doom the emerging market for this clean-burning fuel. The IRS \nruled that since LNG was not specifically mentioned in the 1993 \nlegislation which set the tax rate for CNG, it must be an other liquid \nfuel used in motor vehicle transportation under IRC section 4041(a), \neven though LNG is exactly the same as CNG when it enters an engine. \nThe tax on gas is levied on 1 million cubic feet rate. If you do the \nmath that provides the per gallon equivalence, it reveals that the IRS \nruling places an effective tax rate of 31.5 cents per gallon, diesel, \nequivalent on LNG, a disparity of 25.6 cents when compared to the tax \non CNG. In fact, this tax rate places LNG 7.1 cents above the tax on \ndiesel, the very fuel for which LNG is the clean-burning alternative.\n  As you can see, the provisions in the Boxer Clean Fuel Vehicle Act \nare based on common sense:\n  Don't give clean-fuel vehicles a small tax break and then turn around \nand tax them as luxury vehicles;\n  Give electric buses the same tax deduction provided other clean-fuel \nbuses; and\n  Make the taxes on natural gas fair and consistent and let LNG be a \nreal competitor to diesel.\n  Finally, this bill says: Let's get serious and provide a significant \ntax credit for those who buy electric vehicles. And let's encourage \nleasing arrangements with local governments by allowing private \ncompanies to obtain the tax breaks and pass them to the governments \nthrough lower costs.\n  As anyone who has been gouged at the gas pump recently can tell you, \nit is high time to break oil's stranglehold on American consumers. To \ndo that, we must help provide them with choices.\n  The Boxer bill provides a jump-start for clean-fuel vehicles, not a \npermanent subsidy. All of the tax incentives in my bill will expire at \nthe end of the year 2004. By then, the clean-fuel vehicle market will \nbe on its own, and we can enjoy a cleaner, healthier 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1848\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the recognition and designation of the \nofficial society to administer and coordinate the United States of \nAmerica activities to commemorate and celebrate the achievements of the \nsecond millennium, and promote even greater achievements in the \nmillennium to come by endowing an international cross-cultural \nscholarship fund to further the development and education of the \nworld's future leaders; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n                       the millennium act of 1996\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nMillennium Act of 1996 along with my colleagues, Senators Warner, Dodd, \nBennett, Boxer, Breaux, Burns, Chafee, Coats, D'Amato, Graham, Heflin, \nHutchison, Jeffords, Kerry, Lieberman, Lott, Moseley-Braun, Murkowski, \nPell, Pressler, Robb, Simon, Snowe, Bryan, and Cochran.\n  This bill is a bipartisan effort to focus the Nation's attention on \nwhat may become one of the most anticipated events in history--the \nbeginning of the new millennium. As the new millennium nears, this bill \nhopes to focus our attention on the achievements of the past 1,000 \nyears and helps to foster educational opportunities for those who may \ntake on leadership responsibilities in the next 1,000 years.\n  Since its founding in 1979 by a group of college students from around \nthe world, The Millennium Society has worked to organize a global \ncelebration and commemoration of humankind's achievements during this \nmillennium and to endow a cross-cultural scholarship program to help \neducate future leaders. I believe it is the oldest organization in the \ncountry formed for the specific purpose of celebrating and \ncommemorating the historical significance of the Millennium. The \nSociety was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, charitable \norganization in 1984 for the purpose of establishing and administering \nthe Millennium Society Scholarship Program.\n  The Millennium Society plans to organize and telecast ``Countdown \n2000'' celebrations here and around the world to enable the \ninternational community to both view and participate in this historic \nmoment. The Society hopes that the ``Countdown 2000'' events will raise \nat least $100 million to permanently endow its Millennium Scholars \nProgram.\n  Unlike the Bicentennial Commission which required Federal funding, \nthis bill asks for no Federal funds. Title I of this bill provides the \nSociety with the official authorization and designation to administer \nMillennium activities both here and abroad and ensures that charitable \nproceeds go to the Millennium Scholars Program. The organizers hope \nthat this designation can operate much like the U.S. Olympic Committee \ntrademark. Mr. President, to the best of my knowledge, there are no \nother organizations that are competing for this designation nor have \nany indicated any specific interest in doing so.\n  The second title authorizes the minting of commemorative coins. This \nbill incorporates some of the language from the House Commemorative \nCoin reform legislative package, H.R. 2614. Specifically, the \nMillennium Society agrees not to derive any proceeds until all the\n\n[[Page S5943]]\n\nnumismatic operation and program costs allowable to the program have \nbeen recovered by the U.S. Mint. Moreover, it embodies some of the key \ncriteria and recommendations of the Citizens Commemorative Coin \nAdvisory Commission. The minting of the Millennium coins would not \nbegin until July of 1999. Further, through its own fund raising \nefforts, the Millennium Society will match the funds received through \ncommemorative coin sales for its scholarship program.\n  The third title of the bill expresses the sense of Congress that the \nU.S. Postal Service should consider the issuance of stamps to \ncommemorate the close of the second millennium and the advent of the \nthird millennium.\n  The Millennium Society was established as an international charitable \norganization dedicated to giving students from around the world a \nchance to go on to college and to promote international fellowship and \nunderstanding among the world's peoples on an unofficial and \nnongovernmental basis.\n  I hope other Senators will join us in supporting this legislation to \nboth commemorate the coming millennium and help provide scholastic \nfunding for its future leaders.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Mack, and Mr. \n        Smith):\n  S.J. Res. 56. A joint resolution disapproving the extension of \nnondiscriminatory treatment--most-favored-nation treatment--to the \nproducts of the People's Republic of China; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n  the china most-favored-nation treatment disapproval joint resolution\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, inasmuch as I believe Senators ought to \ntake a position on the very significant question of a most-favored-\nnation designation of China by the United States, I, today, along with \nSenator Feingold, Senator Mack, and others, offer a resolution of \ndisapproval of President Clinton's renewal of most-favored-nation \ntreatment for China.\n  As I indicated earlier, Senator Feingold, Senator Mack, Senator Smith \nof New Hampshire are principal cosponsors of this resolution of \ndisapproval.\n  Now then, if there is somehow a valid reason for the United States--\nthe world's leader in freedom--to offer the same trading terms to China \nthat the United States offers to other nations that do honor their \ncitizens' human rights and that do respect the rule of law, I cannot \nthink of such a reason. None come to mind.\n  Mr. President, this is President Clinton's fourth renewal of MFN \nstatus for China. The President has covered the waterfront on this \nissue. He has been all over the lot. He has had his customary array of \npositions on MFN, as with countless other issues, and it is almost \nimpossible to follow the President's ever-changing position without, as \nthe saying goes, a printed program. As a candidate running for the \nPresidency in 1992, Mr. Clinton condemned the Bush administration for \nwhat candidate Clinton alleged was ``coddling dictators.'' But when Mr. \nClinton took office in 1993, he decided, no, it was all right with him \nto support MFN to China--provided that China ``made progress'' in \nrespecting human rights. The following year, 1994, when the President \nwas forced to acknowledge that there had been no progress by China in \nhuman rights, President Clinton decided that human rights should not \neven be a factor in the annual MFN renewal.\n  Instead, the President said that he would advance human rights \nthrough a set of principles for United States businesses, enhanced \ninternational broadcasting to China, and what the President described \nas ``increased support for nongovernmental organizations working on \nhuman rights in China.''\n  That was 2 years ago, and we are still waiting for any evidence \nwhatsoever that any of the Clinton initiatives have gone anywhere or \naccomplished anything. The business principles announced by the White \nHouse did not even mention China or its flagrant labor abuses.\n  We are still waiting for Radio Free Asia, which the administration \nhas apparently renamed and is now calling it the Asia Pacific Network, \nor some such thing, because apparently somebody in the Clinton \nadministration perhaps decided that the name Radio Free Asia may be a \nlittle bit confrontational insofar as the Communist Chinese are \nconcerned. Well, as for the aid to nongovernmental groups supporting \nhuman rights in China, perhaps the administration would be willing at \nleast to give us a hint as to what, if anything, has been done. They \ncertainly have made no report on the matter one way or the other. I do \nnot believe one thing has been accomplished.\n  This year, when the President announced his intention to renew MFN, \nhe said the MFN decision ``isn't a referendum on all China's \npolicies.'' I say, the heck it is not. Whether Mr. Clinton likes it or \nnot, when the United States extends MFN to China, we are treating China \nlike virtually all of our other trading partners. There are, of course, \nmany other countries that deserve a stern line from the United States, \nbut China is in a class by itself when it comes to the violations of \nhuman rights.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, that China's record on human rights, \nsince the most recent MFN renewal, has continued to be disgraceful. \nEven the State Department's latest annual report on human rights stated \nthat the Chinese regime ``continued to commit widespread and well-\ndocumented human rights abuses,'' abuse, I might add, which affect \nevery kind of fundamental human rights imaginable.\n  According to many observers, religious persecution in particular \nintensified with the Government moving against independent Christian \nchurches and Muslim groups. Challenges to the regime were not \ntolerated. Quoting the State Department, ``By year's end, almost all \npublic dissent against the central authorities was silenced by \nintimidation, exile or imposition of prison terms or administrative \ndetention.''\n  The annual MFN debate has become more than a mere referendum on \nChina's policies; it is now a referendum on the Clinton \nadministration's policies, and President Clinton made it so. In the \nfuture, in addition to requiring report on China's human rights record, \nperhaps we should consider an annual report on the Clinton \nadministration's China policy.\n  During the past year alone, the Clinton administration decided to \nlook the other way while China sent nuclear material to Pakistan \nbecause, the administration says, the Chinese leadership didn't know \nanything about it. Now come reports that China is seeking to acquire \ncomponents of SS-18 missiles from Russia and the Ukraine. And I \ndiscussed that subject on this floor this past Tuesday.\n  China has fired missiles over the Taiwan Strait in a reckless and \nbellicose attempt to intimidate Taiwan's people as they established the \nfirst Chinese democracy. Despite explicit commitments to preserve Hong \nKong's institutions and autonomy after 1997, the Chinese Government has \nannounced it will abolish the elected legislature and made threats \nagainst the independent judiciary and civil servant of Hong Kong.\n  On Trade, it is the same story. Last year, the administration agreed \nto let China have a year to crack down on dozens of pirate compact disk \nfactories. In April, the administration let it be known in news reports \nthat President would be hard pressed to renew MFN if Beijing didn't \nfollow through on its promise to end the pirating of copyrighted \nmaterial. The regime has not followed through and the President renewed \nMFN anyway. Now we are waiting to see if the administration imposes $2 \nbillion in sanctions against Chinese products, imported with United \nStates.\n  Despite all of these egregious examples of Chinese misbehavior, we \nstill pay China's bills. Our trade with China is one-way. The United \nStates buys 40 of China's exports, but China severely limits United \nStates access of United States exports to their markets. Last year, our \nexports to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and even Belgium were greater than our \nexports to China, even though those countries have a tiny fraction of \nChina's population.\n  Still some businessmen contend that we need to trade with China. It \nwill open up their society, they say. But what is going on in China is \nnot free trade. The regime is turning over enterprises to the military \nso it can make money for itself and acquire technology from foreign \nbusinesses.\n\n[[Page S5944]]\n\nThere is no rule of law to protect Chinese or foreign investors. \nOfficial corruption is widespread. A disagreement with a business \npartner who has official connections can land you in jail.\n  Renewing MFN again this year will be a sign to Beijing that the \nUnited States will do business as usual with China no matter what the \nconsequences. I trust that Senators will bear this in mind as the days \ngo by.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, the Senator from North Carolina, for his \nleadership on the MFN issue and for the bipartisan effort which is \nneeded because we have a bipartisan problem on the other side of this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, on May 31, President Clinton announced his intention \nto extend for another year most-favored-nation trading status to China, \na decision I regret as objectionable and truly perplexing. Our previous \nPresident, former President Bush, took that position, and regrettably \nthe majority leader who obviously seeks to be President, also takes the \nsame position. So we have a very serious problem with a past \nadministration, a current administration, and potentially another \nadministration all turning away from this issue of whether or not China \ndeserves most-favored-nation status. I think that is objectionable \nbecause it reaffirms an erroneous and even illogical choice made by the \nadministration in 1994: that trade rights and human rights are not \ninterrelated and, yet, that through ``constructive engagement,'' \nincluding easy trade terms, human rights will improve. The chairman of \nthe committee and I argued then that this approach was naive and \npredicted that the dismal human rights situation in China would remain \nunchanged. Unfortunately and sadly, I and others concerned with the \nBeijing regime's callous disregard for the basic rights of any \nindividual, have been proven right. De-linking MFN to improvement in \nhuman rights has resulted only in despair, prison, and abuse for those \nstruggling in China to guarantee basic freedoms. The President' \ndecision is perplexing because it seems so very clear to me and other, \nmore expert, observers that the Chinese covet and need trade with the \nUnited States and that the only pressure they apparently respect is the \nprospect of economic sanctions. Words and exhortations to improve, to \nact decently and in conformity with international norms, are pocketed \nand ignored. It is not working. In fact, things have gotten worse.\n\n  So I rise today, Mr. President, to join in offering a resolution of \ndisapproval of the President's action, an option available to the \nCongress under the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment. I recognize that this \nresolution will draw strong opposition. I know that the leadership in \nboth Houses has already indicated its support for the President's \nannouncement and we will soon be witness to a heavy lobbying effort by \nthe administration and its allies in business and in the Congress to \nprevent our resolution from prevailing. So the odds are difficult. Of \ncourse, the odds are even more difficult for overriding a Presidential \nveto should we succeed. Nevertheless, I believe denying MFN-status to \nChina is the right thing to do and should be pursued, not just for \nthose suffering at the hands of the Chinese regime, but because it is \nin our national interest on many fronts: political, economic, and \nmoral.\n\n  Let me turn first, Mr. President, to the state of human rights in \nChina which the Senator from North Carolina has discussed in some \ndetail. Two years after the administration's de-linking decision, the \nState Department's annual report on human rights described an abysmal \nsituation, marked by increased repression. I quote here verbatim:\n\n       Abuses included arbitary and lengthy incommunicado \n     detention, forced confession, torture and mistreatment of \n     prisoners. Prison conditions remained harsh. The government \n     continues severe restrictions on freedom of speech, the \n     press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, movement and \n     workers rights. The report continued that by the end of 1995 \n     almost all public dissent had been silenced by intimidation, \n     exile or imposition of prison terms or administrative \n     detention.\n\n  In December 1995 we were witness to a concrete example of how little \nconstructive engagement has accomplished. Wei Jingsheng, a prominent \ndissident who has dedicated his life to speaking out against the \nChinese Government's repression of its own people, was hauled before a \nshow court on charges of subversion. Wei Jingsheng had already spent 16 \nyears looking at the inside of Chinese prison walls, but when he was \nfinally released in 1993 he immediately and courageously took up again \nthe cause of freedom. For his bravery and unstinting devotion to human \nrights Wei Jingsheng--after a 6-hour court proceeding--was sentenced to \nanother 14 years. The administration issued a condemnation, of course, \nand an appeal for clemency. It is any surprise, Mr. President, that the \nChinese took this statement for what it was--mere words--and that Wei \nJingsheng languishes today in an abusive prison system?\n\n  The impunity with which the Chinese Government acts--and knows it can \nact--has a debilitating effect on dissent. We know from our own \ncontacts that prominent intellectuals and common citizens temper their \nstatements, carefully refraining from pronouncing on political topics.\n  I anticipate that administration apologists will point to recent \nreforms in the Chinese legal system as evidence that engagement is \nreaping benefits. But in a way that is like a Trojan Horse. Many of the \nreforms are meant to facilitate foreign investment by making clear the \nrules of the game and providing legal recourse for settling disputes. I \nimagine, however, that Wei Jingsheng and others take cold comfort in \nChina's version of the Uniform Commercial Code. To be sure, reform of \nprison procedures and criminal laws are welcome developments. Perhaps \nthey do point to an evolution in the rule of law in China. But unless \nthey are put into practice--and they clearly are not if, as is the case \nin China, officials can detain individuals without charge or even \nacknowledgment of detention--the reforms are merely paper promises.\n  The list of human rights horrors goes on. In the past year, we have \nbeen witness to a well-documented report by Human Rights Watch/Asia \ndetailing fatal neglect and abuse in Chinese orphanages. Tibetan \nreligious sensitivities were trampled on when Chinese authorities \nusurped and gave to themselves the right to choose the Panchen Lama, \nsecond only to the Dalai Lama in Tibetan Buddhism, continuing a nearly \n50-year pattern of persecution and repression of the Tibetan people. In \nfact, the Chinese admitted only on June 1--and here we have truly the \nphenomena of a wolf in sheep's clothing--that they were holding under \nhouse arrest ``for his own protection'' the 7-year-old boy designated \nby Tibetan Buddhists as the true Panchen Lama.\n  Chinese contempt for construction engagement is evident in other \nfora: thee bald-faced attempted intimidation of Taiwan in March, sales \nof nuclear equipment to Pakistan, the utter disregard for agreements to \nend violation of U.S. intellectual property rights.\n\n  Is it possible to come to anything but this self-evident conclusion: \n``constructive engagement'' has failed so far to improve Chinese human \nrights behavior. I would say the evidence justifies the exact opposite \nconclusion: human rights have deteriorated and the regime emboldened to \nact recklessly in other areas vital to U.S. national interest.\n  In announcing his intent to extend MFN, President Clinton said that \nthe decision, as the chairman has pointed out, ``was not a referendum \non China's policies.'' That is what the President indicated. And, of \ncourse, I believe firmly that the President abhors the daily repression \nand abuse in China. That is not the issue. What is the issue is how a \ntortured United States policy is perceived in Beijing. Recently, the \nadministration announced it was taking the Chinese regime at its word \nthat it had no idea that a Chinese firm--operated by the military--was \nselling ring magnets to Pakistan for use in that country's nuclear \nweapons program. This announcement--coming on the heels of tough talk \nof sanctions for what seems to me to be a clear violation of China's \n1992 pledge to abide by the obligations of the Non-Proliferation \nTreaty--must have evoked self-satisfied smiles in Beijing.\n  Why? Because the threat of sanctions for ignoring our policies on \nnonproliferation--at least in this instance--went by the boards, just \nas our insistence that China respect human\n\n[[Page S5945]]\n\nrights in return for normal trade relations were jettisoned in 1994. \nLooming on the horizon is the ballyhooed trade war over our threat to \nimpose higher tariffs on some Chinese goods, in retaliation for China's \nblatant continuing violation of United States intellectual property \nrights, IPR. We have been down this road before. It was only in \nFebruary 1995, when threatened with higher tariffs on $1 billion of its \ngoods, that China signed an agreement to curb IPR piracy. In the 15 \nmonths since, by the estimate of the Motion Picture Industry \nAssociation, the harm to U.S. copyrighters has actually increased.\n  Let us see if we can briefly discern a pattern here. In 1992, the \nadministration promises to link trade preferences to improvement in \nhuman rights. Two years later, that policy is abandoned. In 1995, our \nintelligence agencies discover Chinese violations of nonproliferation \nobligations. Sanctions are threatened and then abandoned in the face of \npromises to do better. Also, in 1995, the Chinese promise to do better \non IPR and the problem worsens. Our response: more tough talk, and this \ntime ``we mean it.'' If I were sitting in Beijing, I would come to the \nconclusion that the threats are empty, the rhetoric hollow.\n  Constructive engagement has failed to alter Chinese behavior to the \ngood. So let us drop the pretense and cut to the quick. We trade with \nChina and extend to it normal trading privileges because our Government \nbelieves it benefits American business, the United States economy, and, \ntherefore, the national interest. We look the other way, in practice if \nnot in word, on Chinese violations of human rights, nonproliferation--\nperhaps in the end even on IPR--because it is good for business. As I \nsaid at the outset, I find this rationale perplexing.\n  Our trading relationship with China is really quite one-sided. \nWriting in the New York Times, May 16, Alan Tonelson, a research fellow \nat the U.S. Business and Industrial Association, argued that our $34 \nbillion trade deficit with China depresses job creation, wages and \ngrowth of the United States economy. This tremendous deficit--which has \nhelped China amass more than $70 billion in foreign reserves, a war \nchest useful to riding out any trade war--is not the result of fair-\ntrading practices. China is a protectionist nation, Mr. Tonelson notes, \nwith some of the highest tariffs in the world. It dumps artificially \nlow-priced goods--products manufactured by children and convicts--on \nAmerican markets, hurting U.S. competitors. According to Mr. Tonelson, \nChina extorts know how and high-skill jobs from American companies, \nsuch as Boeing, seeking to set up shop in China. Certainly China is a \nvast market, with tremendous potential. But our 1995 exports to China \nof $11.7 billion--only 0.12 percent of our GNP--were less than what we \nsend to Belgium or Hong Kong.\n  On the other hand, we buy up to 40 percent of China's exports and \nthat allows China to finance its industrial and military modernization \nprogram. We have the leverage to make them play by the rules of the \ngame. Does it not make sense to use that leverage now, from a relative \nposition of strength, than try to make the Chinese play fair 10, 20, or \n30 years from now when by many projections it will be a legitimate \nsuperpower? As Mr. Tonelson notes, even the higher tariffs imposed on \nChina under a non-MFN scheme would still be lower than China's tariffs \non our products.\n  Mr. President, if mortal outrage at blatant abuse of human rights is \nnot reason enough for taking a tough stance with China--and I believe \nit is and that the American people do as well--then let us do so on \ngrounds of self-interest.\n  United States credibility is at stake; a firm stance which refuses \nChina the privilege--not the right--of MFN will enhance United States \nstature and, in the long run, benefit United States business, the \nAmerican consumer, and, we can hope, ultimately leads to an improvement \nin China's economic and political behavior.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nand friend the Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, in introducing \nlegislation to correct an inequity that exists in our Social Security \nsystem.\n  The Social Security Family Protection Act that we are introducing \ntoday expands upon legislation I have introduced since 1992 which calls \nfor the prorating of Social Security benefits in the month in which the \nrecipient dies. Currently when a Social Security beneficiary dies--\nregardless of whether it is the first day of the month or the 29th day \nof the month, his or her last monthly benefit check must be returned to \nthe Social Security Administration. The current system ignores the fact \nthat the beneficiary runs up expenses during that last month and that \nthe survivors are left to pay for those expenses, without the \nassistance of the Social Security check. In many cases, the loss of \nthis benefit causes serious financial problems for the surviving family \nmembers because they are unable to financially subsidize the expenses \naccrued by the late beneficiary in their last month of life.\n  My original legislation prorates the Social Security benefit based on \nthe date of death and allows the check to go to the surviving spouse. \nUnder the Social Security Family Protection Act, the beneficiary's \ncheck will be prorated and it will go to the surviving family members. \nUnder the prorated system in the bill, if the beneficiary dies before \nthe 15th, the family will receive 50 percent of the benefit, if the \nbeneficiary dies after the 15th, the family will receive the entire \ncheck. The expansion of this bill is based on Senator Mikulski's own \nfamily experience with Social Security after her widowed mother died, \nat the end of the month.\n  The Social Security Family Protection Act will correct the \ninappropriate assumption in current law that a beneficiary has not \nincurred expenses during his or her last month of life. I know that my \ncolleagues have heard, as have Senator Mikulski and I, from \nconstituents who have lost a husband or wife, father or mother toward \nthe end of the month, received the Social Security check and spent all \nor part of it to pay the bills only to receive a notice from Social \nSecurity that the check must be returned. Under our bill, the surviving \nfamily members--whether it is a spouse, a son, or a niece--would be \nable to use the check to help pay the final bills incurred by their \nloved one.\n  I would like to read a part of a letter I received from a constituent \nabout the experience of his family when his brother-in-law died. This \nletter, along with Senator Mikulski's own experience, serves to \nhighlight why this bill is necessary.\n\n       On February 29, 1996 at 9:20 p.m. He passed away. The way I \n     figure it, the month of Feb. has 696 hours in it. He was \n     alive for 693 hrs and 20 min. of the month, missing a full \n     month by 2 hours and 40 min. Or to put it another way, he was \n     alive for 99.99617 percent of the month missing a full month \n     by 0.0038314 percent. With this evidence in hand, the SSA \n     then decided that his check for the month of Feb. had to be \n     returned to them. Unfortunately, his debts for the month \n     didn't disappear just because he failed to live the extra \n     0.0038314 percent of the month.\n       And since they waited till April to let anyone know of this \n     policy, we paid his out-\n\n[[Page S5947]]\n\n      standing bills with this money. Now they want their money \n     back. . .. I really don't expect to see this resolved to my \n     benefit, but it would be nice to see some kind of pro-rating \n     system put into place for the rest of the people who are \n     going to encounter this ghoulish practice. These people have, \n     at this time, no recourse what-so-ever in this matter.\n\n  I know that my colleagues have all received letters like this. For \nmany of these people that Social Security check is the only financial \nresource available to deal with the costs incurred during their loved \none's last days of life. Without it, they are left struggling to find \nthe money to pay back the Social Security Administration.\n  I believe that pro-rating Social Security checks for the month of \ndeath provides a solution to what is an unfair situation and I hope my \ncolleagues will join us in supporting this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5946-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HERMAN STAROBIN\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is a fortunate man who can \nknow at the end of his life that he not only earned the respect of \nothers, but that he dedicated himself to a cause in which he believed. \nHerman Starobin was certainly one of those men. He died recently at the \nage of 75, having led a full and inspirational life. Herman was a \nlongtime friend of mine, whose compassion for and dedication to the \nAmerican worker set an example for us all. A true renaissance man, he \ndistinguished himself in many fields over the course of his lifetime.\n  During the Second World War, Herman covered the European theater as a \nfreelance journalist. After the war, he took over the family business \nfrom his father, and manufactured steel doors. While running the \nbusiness Herman studied economics at New York University, where he went \non to earn a doctorate. In 1969, he joined Harman Industries as \ncorporate economist, and eventually rose to the presidency. Along the \nway, he garnered the well-deserved reputation as an expert on \ninternational trade.\n  Herman's experience at Harman Industries left an indelible impression \non him. It led him in 1984 to pursue his next career with the \nInternational Ladies Garment Workers Union, where he fought valiantly \nfor the future of American working men and women. At the time Herman \nhad joined Harman Industries, the United States was the preeminent \nmanufacturer of consumer electronics, but when he left 15 years later, \nthe United States had lost its lead in manufacturing. Herman had \nwitnessed the devastation of communities and tearing asunder of \nfamilies that resulted from the deluge of imports, and that lit the \nfire under him. His firsthand experience and knowledge led him to \ndevote the rest of his life to fighting to save our manufacturing base.\n  In his position as Director of Research for the I.L.G.W.U., Herman \nwas at the forefront of every major trade debate of the last decade. \nWhen Herman spoke, he spoke with authority. He did not live in the \nesoteric world of economic modeling; he possessed the conviction of one \nwho understands how the real world operates in this era of global \ncompetition.\n  We will miss his vigor, his humor, his encyclopedic knowledge and his \nendearing charm. On behalf of Peatsy and my staff, I would like to \nexpress our deepest sympathies to his wife Carol and his daughter \nChristina. Herman was a true champion of the people, and it was an \nhonor to have known him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5947-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NATIONAL ABORETUM OF THE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I was pleased this morning to honor \nthe work of the Agricultural Research Service and the U.S. National \nArboretum by planting a newly developed disease-resistant American elm \non the grounds of the U.S. Capitol. Joining me was Dr. Floyd Horn, \nAdministrator of the Agricultural Research Service; Larry Coughlin, \nPresident of the Friends of the National Arboretum and former \nCongressman from Pennsylvania; my good friend, fellow tree junkie, and \nliberally utilized advisor, Dr. Tom Elias, Director of the National \nArboretum; and Dr. Denny Townsend, the scientist who has spent a \nlifetime studying and developing new trees for cities and towns and the \nperson responsible for developing this new American elm.\n  I also want to thank the Architect of the Capitol, Mr. William Ensign \nand the Landscape Architect in his office, Mr. Matthew Evans for their \nprofessional assistance in facilitating this event.\n  The Dutch elm disease has ravaged our native American elms for over \n65 years and has largely eliminated these magnificent trees from cities \nand towns throughout the eastern and Midwestern United States. But now, \nwith the help of Dr. Townsend, and the National Arboretum, we stand a \ngreat chance of seeing a return of the stately and valuable American \nelm.\n  I am delighted to be the congressional sponsor of the tree planting \nceremony to honor the many accomplishments of the National Arboretum \nand the ARS in their contributions to the city and town landscapes in \nthe United States.\n  The purpose of the ceremony was to recognize the National Arboretum \nof the Agricultural Research Service. Over 645 new and improved \nvarieties of ornamental and floral plants have been developed and \nreleased. Truly a remarkable record. The Arboretum has given us \nhundreds of Glen Dale hybrid azaleas, several flowering pear trees, the \nvery popular and widely grown hybrids and selections of crape myrtles \nand viburnums, a disease resistant sycamore suitable for city streets, \nnew red maples, numerous hollies and magnolias, and now a series of new \nelms including Valley Forge and New Harmony.\n  There is no question that the Arboretum has contributed greatly to \nthe growth of the nursery and floral industries in the U.S. Their \nintroductions, releases, and discoveries have helped to make the green \nindustries the number one growth industry within Agriculture in \nAmerica.\n  I am especially proud of the new cooperative agreement recently \nentered into between the Arboretum and the University of Missouri. On \nFebruary 7, 1996, a memorandum of understanding was signed to establish \na U.S. National Arboretum Midwest Plant Research and Education Site at \nthe Horticulture and Agroforestry Research Center in New Franklin, MO.\n  The new program will provide significant research and educational \nopportunities for all of us in our mission to discover, develop, and \ndisseminate knowledge for the stewardship and sustainable use of human \nand natural resources. With this in mind, our planting at MU will be \narranged to enable visitors, such as homeowners, and nurserymen to make \neasy comparisons between selections for their use. This relationship \nwith the Arboretum will provide practical benefits to many ordinary \nAmericans, while providing the research community at Missouri access to \nnumerous vegetative types that can be used for scientific study and \neducational purposes. In Missouri, we are very excited about this new \nrelationship with the Arboretum.\n  I offer a hearty congratulations to Dr. Horn, Dr. Elias, and Dr. \nTownsend. Our country is grateful for people like you and your work in \ndeveloping new and better trees, shrubs and other flower plants for the \nbenefit of our national landscape and our environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5947-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5947-S5948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BORDER DRUG PROSECUTIONS\n\nMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago the Senate agreed to an \namendment to the budget resolution urging the Attorney General to \nensure that drug prosecutions along the United States-Mexico border are \nvigorously prosecuted.\n  In the interest of time and cooperation in moving the budget forward, \nI did not oppose the amendment. However, I strongly disagreed with \nseveral findings which imply that the current U.S. attorney for the \nSouthern District of California routinely failed to prosecute major \ndrug cases. The source of information for those findings was an article \nin the Los Angeles Times that made several dubious claims about drug \nprosecutions in the Southern District.\n  After the Senate passed the amendment, the Los Angeles Times \npublished a lengthy correction that retracted many of the charges made \nin the original article. Specifically, the correction\n\n[[Page S5948]]\n\nnotes that the newspaper ``misstated federal guidelines for prosecuting \n[drug] seizures.'' The article claimed--and those claims were repeated \nin the Senate amendment--that no prosecutions were made for the \npossession of less than 125 pounds of marijuana. The Times now \nacknowledges that several prosecutions have occurred in cases involving \nsmaller quantities.\n  The correction states that examples used in the original article \n``contained incomplete or inaccurate information.'' Because this \ninformation was the basis of Senate amendment, it too should be \nconsidered incomplete and inaccurate.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to correct the Record.\n  I ask that the correction be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n        Times Article Misstated Guidelines on Border Drug Cases\n\n       A Times article disclosing the release of hundreds of \n     Mexicans detained at the border on suspicion of drug \n     smuggling misstated federal guidelines for prosecuting \n     seizures.\n       The May 12 article--which touched off partisan political \n     fighting over the Clinton administration's drug policy--\n     inaccurately described a program under which federal \n     authorities since 1994 have sent more than 1,000 drug \n     suspects back to Mexico.\n       The guidelines state that prosecutors may decide not to \n     press charges if five criteria are met. The suspect must be a \n     first-time offender and a Mexican national and be caught with \n     less than 125 pounds of marijuana. There also must be \n     insufficient evidence of criminal intent, and the suspect \n     must have little or no information about organized smuggling. \n     Those suspects who meet all five criteria could be sent back \n     to Mexico, and their green cards or border crossing cards \n     confiscated.\n       The article, which was based on interviews with federal \n     officials, did not list all five criteria and incorrectly \n     implied that marijuana cases involving less than 125 pounds \n     were not prosecuted. When The Times later obtained a copy of \n     the internal guidelines, they were reported, as were \n     statistics showing that the U.S. attorney's office in San \n     Diego and the local district attorney have prosecuted \n     hundreds of cases involving less than 125 pounds of \n     marijuana.\n       In discussing the weight guidelines, the article \n     erroneously indicated that it applies to U.S. citizens, as \n     well as Mexican nationals, and a number of cases involving \n     U.S. citizens were cited to make various points.\n       The examples illustrating lack of prosecution contained \n     incomplete or inaccurate information, because some records \n     pertaining to those cases could not be found or were not \n     publicly available. The U.S. attorney's office, citing \n     privacy concerns, had declined to reveal specific reasons for \n     rejecting prosecution.\n       In one misreported case, a U.S. citizen with arrests in \n     January and February was charged in both instances, and \n     prosecutors say he will be charged in a third case pending a \n     competency hearing. A U.S. citizen with a prior smuggling \n     conviction was charged following an arrest in March with 68 \n     pounds of marijuana. In another case, in which charges were \n     dismissed against a woman defendant in a 158-pound cocaine \n     seizure, the article should have added that her codefendant \n     said the woman had no knowledge of the drugs. He was \n     subsequently sentenced to prison.\n       In all, federal officials say, four of the eight cases in \n     the article resulted in felony charges. Of the other four, \n     the district attorney in San Diego rejected one case for \n     insufficient evidence, the U.S. attorney rejected two on the \n     same grounds and the investigation continues in the other.\n       ``We prosecute all border drug cases in which we believe \n     charges are warranted and can be proved beyond all reasonable \n     doubt,'' said U.S. Atty. Alan D. Bersin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5947-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WAYNE R.

Throughout his career, Mr. Grupe \nhas steadfastly and diligently applied his talents and efforts toward \nprogressively more demanding challenges and service to the U.S. Navy. \nRising through a multitude of critical management positions in the \ncourse of his distinguished career, he has advanced to become the \nprogram officer at the Naval Facilities Engineering Command with \nresponsibility for policy and oversight of Navy and DOD programs in \nexcess of $7 billion annually.\n  Among his contemporaries, Mr. Grupe is considered to be the \npreeminent resource manager not only in terms of seniority but also \nprofessional reputation and exhibited accomplishments. He has served in \nhis current critical management position since 1971, a period \ncharacterized by burgeoning world-wide facilities construction and \nfleet base operating support requirements. His numerous professional \naccomplishments and achievements and his exceptional contributions to \nthe effectiveness of his Command will be enduring for many years to \ncome.\n  Mr. Grupe is a dedicated mentor and role model who has inspired and \nenabled many others to achieve similar accomplishments in their Federal \ncivil service career. It is with a certain amount of regret that I wish \na fond farewell to such an able and respected civil servant. His \nselfless service and interest in the people he so ably served will long \nbe remembered.\n  I join his family, many friends and colleagues in congratulating him \non his well earned retirement and wish him future ``Fair Winds and \nFollowing Seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5948-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5948-S5949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STAND FOR CHILDREN\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few moments today \nto speak about a wonderful and inspiring event, which took place on The \nMall in Washington this past Saturday.\n  Mr. President on June 1, 200,000 Americans from across the country; \nblacks and whites, Jews and Gentiles, rich and poor, male and female, \nliberals and conservatives came together to stand up for the rights of \nour nation's most vulnerable citizens--America's children.\n  I applaud the efforts of all those who came to Washington to make a \nprincipled stand for the rights of children. But as the Hartford \nCourant noted, ``the world's most prosperous democracy shouldn't \nrequire a rally to focus on deprivation of its young.''\n  Children don't vote. They don't have a political action committee. \nInstead, they must rely on the benevolence of adults to assure that \nthey have the tools and opportunities to succeed.\n  Unfortunately, it seems we as adults are failing to hold up our part \nof the bargain.\n  Consider the enormous adversities facing our youngest Americans. One \nin five children in this country is mired in poverty. Every day, 2,600 \nAmerican children are born into a life of poverty. And children remain \nthis Nation's poorest group of Americans.\n  Every day, 15 kids are homicide victims. Every 90 minutes, a gunshot \nends the life of one of America's children. When our nightly newscasts \nand newspapers focus on the most heinous violent crimes committed in \nour Nation it is children who seem to often be the perpetrators.\n  Additionally, more than 8,400 of America's young people are victims \nof abuse or neglect. Another 12 million lack health insurance, and \nchild care workers toil at the bottom of U.S. wage scales.\n  The evidence is clear that children in our Nation face innumerable \ndifficulties. But, events of the past weekend demonstrate that there \nexists in our Nation a groundswell of support for a political agenda \nthat protects children.\n  Two hundred thousand Americans came to The Mall in Washington because \nthey believe that everything we do in Congress should help, not hinder, \nthe growth and development of children.\n  They came to Washington because they believe that America should \nnever shirk its commitment to providing health care for children.\n  They came to Washington because they believe that children have a \nright to play in streets and on playgrounds free from the scourge of \nguns and drugs.\n  They came to Washington because in a time when education is essential \nto succeeding in the global economy of the 21st century, they believe \nthat every child must have the opportunity of a good education.\n  These are not, and should not, be partisan issues. And, it's with \ngreat dismay that I see some on the right attacking the intentions and \ngoals of the organizers of Stand for Children.\n  They claim that the event was simply an excuse to increase the size \nof Government. I couldn't disagree more. As Marian Wright Edelman, head \nof the Children's Defense Fund and organizer of the march said, ``We do \nnot stand\n\n[[Page S5949]]\n\nhere advocating big government. We stand here advocating just \ngovernment.''\n  I certainly agree that government is not the answer to all of the \nproblems of America's children.\n  It can't steady the hand of an abusive parent. But, it can help to \nprotect the child.\n  Government can't teach a child a skill. But, it can provide \neducational opportunity through Head Start, good public schools, or \nstudent loans.\n  It can't save a child's life. But it can take murderous assault \nweapons off the street and throw criminals in prison.\n  Government can't put food on the table. But government can help \nprovide child care, raise the minimum wage or provide economic \nopportunities so that parents, on their own, can focus their energies \non making a better future for their children.\n  Only in our Nation's communities, neighborhoods and homes can we \ntruly create an environment conducive to the good of our children.\n  But these cost-effective, common sense measures invest in our \nchildren's future and they should enjoy bipartisan support.\n  I've long supported child care initiatives in Congress, such as the \n1990 Child Care and Development Block Grant and the Family and Medical \nLeave Act. And each time, Members from both sides of the aisle have \njoined in co-sponsoring and supporting these measures.\n  Because, children's issues are not partisan issues. They are American \nissues and they affect each and every one of us.\n  Stand for Children is a clear demonstration that we need to go beyond \nthe rhetoric of protecting our children's future to concrete and \nunequivocal action.\n  I urge my colleagues to heed the call of the 200,000 Americans who \ncame to Washington this past Saturday and make a similar stand for \nchildren here in Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5948-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING JAMES B.

Mr. President, Senators Roth, Moynihan, and Chafee \nand I will soon introduce a bill to solve a small but serious problem \nthat has plagued our trade policy for years--the fact that most favored \nnation or MFN status does not mean what it says.\n  Let me offer an analogy that may illuminate the difficulties this \ncreates. In Greek myth, the gods punish King Sisyphus of Corinth, for \nvarious sins and repeated attempts to cheat death, by making him push a \nheavy stone up a hill for eternity. Each time he gets to the top, it \nrolls back down and he has to start again.\n  Our experience with MFN tariff status is somewhat similar. Each year, \nwe have to convince the public that MFN status does not really mean \n``most favored nation'' status, but simply the same tariff rate that \napplies to most countries.\n  This year is a good example. We will soon debate the President's \ndecision to renew MFN status for China. We will soon, I hope, pass \nbills to grant Bulgaria and Cambodia permanent MFN status. And we may \nalso take up a bill to grant permanent MFN status to Romania.\n  Obviously, logic tells us that these countries cannot all be \nAmerica's favorite country at one time. And sound diplomatic practice \nwould avoid ranking any single country as our favorite. Yet we can \nexcuse the millions of Americans who do not follow the arcana of trade \nlaws and agreements if they conclude that, somehow, Congress is \nattempting to anoint Bulgaria, Cambodia, China, and Romania as our \nfavorite country all in the very same year.\n  The truth is, of course, that we are attempting no such thing. MFN is \nthe normal tariff status we in the United States apply to most of our \ntrading partners. Under the Uruguay Round, it is a tariff level \naveraging around 4.5 percent. Often, in fact, tariffs fall well below \nthis MFN rate because of free trade agreements and special arrangements \nwith developing countries. So MFN is not even the best available tariff \nrate. It has nothing to do with favoritism.\n  Yet to this day, many people oppose MFN status for China because they \nbelieve it is a kind of special favor. The term is simply misleading \nand wrong. And it is extremely frustrating to explain it each year, \nonly to have to start explaining it again a few months later. It is a \nlongstanding, needless complication in our trade policy.\n  This year, we could push the metaphorical MFN stone up the hill once \nagain and hope that, this time, it stays at the top. But unlike \nSisyphus, we have another choice. We can just push the stone into a \nlake and get rid of the problem for good.\n  That is what our bill will do. It will delete the term ``most favored \nnation status'' from our trade laws, and replace it with ``normal trade \nrelations.''\n  That will not change our tariff and trade policies in any way. But it \nwill bring our terminology in line with reality. Thus, it will make our \npolicies more comphensive to the public and avoid needless arguments. \nIt is good common sense, and I hope it will get the Senate's \nsupport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5949-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5949-S5950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRATULATIONS TO WEST WARWICK HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to a \ngroup of students from West Warwick High School, West Warwick, RI. \nThese 18 young men and women deserve a note of recognition for their \noutstanding performance in the 1996 ``We the People. The Citizen and \nthe Constitution'' national finals.\n  From April 27-29, here in Washington, DC, the team from West Warwick \ncompeted against 49 other classes from throughout the Nation. They \ndemonstrated a remarkable understanding of the fundamental ideals and \nvalues of American constitutional democracy. The ``We the People'' \ncompetition is the most extensive of its kind. Developed to help \nstudents understand the\n\n[[Page S5950]]\n\nhistory and the principles of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, \nthe program has reached more than 22 million students at the \nelementary, middle, and high school levels in its 9 year history.\n  I appreciate the generations of dedicated citizens who have devoted \nthemselves to studying and interpreting, to drawing upon the principles \nset down in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights in order to make \nthis Government the most effective and democratic in the world. For \nthis reason it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to these young \npeople who are continuing in the fine tradition of constitutional \nscholarship. The group from West Warwick High School, as well as their \ncompetitors from across the Nation, not only demonstrated a remarkable \nunderstanding of the fundamental principles of the U.S. Government, but \nalso worked together to learn to participate responsibly in our \npolitical system. For me, and I am sure for every one of my colleagues \nhere, there can be no greater joy than to witness the emergence of a \nnew generation of Americans dedicated to upholding those common ideals \nunder which this Nation's leaders have convened for 220 years.\n  I commend the achievements of these students, and congratulate their \nteacher and all the faculty at West Warwick High School for a job well \ndone.\n  I commend the achievements of these students, and congratulate their \nteacher and all the faculty at West Warwick High School for a job well \ndone.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the names of these exceptional West Warwick \nhigh school students and their teacher, Michael Trofi, be entered into \nthe Congressional Record as follows:\n  Susan, Bickerstaff, Joshua Brassard, Carlos Cruz, Jason Deletesky, \nNicholas Dube, Brandon Hall, Paul Heatherson, Cynthia Jutras, Jennifer \nLavoie, Jessica Lavoie, Jessia Lefrancois, Steven Marandola, Richard \nMarrese, Jesse Nason, Matthew Raiche, Walter Richardson IV, Michael \nStreeter, and Tara Watson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5949-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    OLYMPIC FLAME COMES TO MICHIGAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this weekend the Olympic flame \ntravels to Michigan. This journey began on March 30 amid the ruins of \nthe sanctuary at Ancient Olympia in Greece, the site of the first \nrecorded Olympics in 776 B.C. The 84-day American leg of the Olympic \nTorch Relay began on April 27 and will ultimately involve over 10,000 \ntorchbearers. By the time the flame reaches its final destination, it \nwill have traveled over 15,000 miles and visited 42 States. This year's \nrelay is the longest and most inclusive torch relay in Olympic history \nand will culminate on July 19 in Atlanta at the opening ceremony of the \n1996 Centennial Olympic Games. The torch relay route weaves together \nthe American people in support of the Olympic games.\n  Michigan is holding a weekend of festivities in celebration of the \nflame's arrival. The 2-day, 25-mile relay will take the Olympic flame \nthrough southeastern Michigan and will involve 80 Michiganians as \ntorchbearers. The relay route begins Saturday in Dearborn Heights, \nmoves on to Dearborn for major festivities and ends Sunday on Hart \nPlaza in downtown Detroit where a large celebration is planned. After \nits stay in Detroit, the flame will board an ore boat which will carry \nit down the Detroit River and across Lake Erie to its next stop in \nCleveland, OH.\n  I am proud that this great symbol is being carried through Michigan. \nThe Olympics Games are indeed a spectacular sporting event, but they \nrepresent something much greater. They are a celebration of the \ngoodwill among nations. During the Olympic Games, people from around \nthe world compete against each other under the banner of peace, \nfriendship, and the pursuit of excellence. The flame symbolizes this \nOlympic spirit and it is an honor to have it travel to \nMichigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5950-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                VIRGINIA'S BUSINESS PERSONS OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have the great pleasure today to \nhonor John Broughton and Monty Blizard, whom have been selected as \nVirginia's 1996 Business Persons of the Year. These awards were made as \npart of Small Business Week, and I believe this celebration of small \nbusiness recognizes its crucial impact on our economy and society. John \nBroughton and Monty Blizard have worked together to make Broughton \nSystems, Inc., based in Richmond, VA, a superior firm that specializes \nin technology consulting and system development. Since its conception \nin 1981, Broughton Systems, has grown rapidly due to its intense focus \non client relationships. As a result of such intense loyalty to their \nclients, nearly 80 percent of Broughton Systems' work is with existing \nor longtime clients. With its fundamental guide ``treating customers as \nwe would want to be treated,'' Broughton Systems was recognized by Inc. \nmagazine as one of the fastest growing private companies in the Nation, \nand has continued to build on that growth.\n  Broughton Systems' loyalty does not stop with their clients, but \ncarries over to its employees as well. Broughton has created a strong \nsense of community within its organization by treating its employees as \nmembers of a family. As part of this family, Brougton seeks ways in \nwhich it can enhance employee satisfaction and productivity through \nnumerous programs and open lines of communication. For instance, work \nrelated issues, such as benefits and client management, are discussed \nopenly in company town meetings held twice a year. Mr. Broughton and \nMr. Blizard have also established opportunities for job sharing and \nhave creative compensation programs to reward performance. The company \nseeks candidates who are reentering the work force and is proud of the \nfact that it has never had to lay off an employee. All of this \nestablishes Broughton Systems as a secure place of employment, which in \nturn attracts creative and qualified individuals to compete in this \nexpanding and competitive market.\n  It is Broughton Systems' sense of family that has also spurred their \nemployees to be leaders and philanthropists in the local community. \nThey have given generously in the form of time, money, and pro bono \nwork for nonprofit organizations such as the Children's Hospital, \nSpecial Olympics, and the Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n  I am very pleased to have these two fine men being honored this week. \nIt is my hope that they will serve as models not only for other \nbusiness men and women in Virginia, but also entrepreneurs \nnationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5950-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5950-S5951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONDITIONS IN NIGERIA\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the further \ndisintegration of the human rights situation in Nigeria.\n  A few days ago, another assassination occurred which appears to be \npolitically motivated.\n  Kudirat Abiola, the wife of Moshood Abiola, the winner of the 1993 \npresidential election, was brutally murdered by a group of armed men \nnear a military checkpoint in Lagos, the capital. According to reports, \nthey jumped out of a car, pulled Mrs. Abiola out of her own car, and \nshot her in the forehead--execution style. Both Mrs. Abiola and her \ndriver died a few hours later in a Lagos hospital.\n  Obviously, at this point in time, the facts have not been established \nand it is important not to jump to conclusions before full information \nis available, but according to most accounts, this was a political \nassassination.\n  Mr. President, just 4 months ago, Alex Ibru, the publisher of the \nNation, one of Nigeria's leading newspapers was shot at on a Lagos \nstreet. Fortunately, he was only wounded.\n  The shooting this week is yet another indication of the deteriorating \nhuman rights situation in Nigeria. The assassination of the spouse of a \npolitical leader is an act which is deeply shocking. Political \nassassination itself is a horrifying assault upon a democratic process, \nbut when the family members of political figures become the targets for \nthis kind of heinous act, the injury goes even deeper.\n  Mrs. Abiola's husband, Moshood Abiola, has been imprisoned for nearly \n2 years. Kudirat Abiola herself was detained by the current regime just \nlast month apparently because she had on her person documents which \nsuggested that her husband should be the rightful leader of the \ncountry. She was released, but it is difficult not to see a\n\n[[Page S5951]]\n\nconnection between the tragic ending to her life and the earlier \ndetention. Mrs. Abiola had been an outspoken critic of Gen. Sani \nAbacha's regime. For nearly 2 years, she had been working tirelessly--\nboth in private and in public for the release of her husband. She had \nbecome a prominent individual in her own right, working to bring \ndemocracy to her country. Just last week, she met with John Shattuck, \nour Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights.\n  The assassination of this leading figure, following the executions \nlast year of a group of human rights activists, including the renowned \nplaywright, Ken Sara-Wiwa, has drawn international condemnation and \nrightly so. According to press reports, thousands of university \nstudents marched yesterday in Ibadan, joined by many others. Over 3,000 \npeople attended Ms. Abiola's funeral yesterday, including \nrepresentatives from a number of nations.\n  Mr. President, Nigeria is an important country in regional and \ninternational politics. It is the most populous country in Africa and \nan active member of many international bodies. Nigeria's fate is thus \nof great significance. It has the potential to become a major world \ntrading partner and an influential member of the international \ncommunity. Yet its leadership continues to squander this potential \nthrough this horrific behavior. The military regime of Gen. Sani Abacha \ncontinues to be associated with rampant corruption, brutal policies of \nrepression and execution and severe economic mismanagement.\n  I spoke yesterday with the Nigerian Ambassador to the United States \nand communicated my own concern that the most recent assassination is a \nmatter of grave concern and urged that his government conduct a full \nand transparent investigation of the circumstances leading to Mrs. \nAbiola's assassination and take steps to bring her murderers to \njustice.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa, on which I serve \nas the ranking minority member, recently held a hearing on United \nStates policy on Nigeria. As I said then, and as I have said many times \non this floor, the track of decline and violence in Nigeria causes \ngreat pain and instability in all of Africa. The brutal assassinations \nand executions underscore this problem.\n  The situation in Nigeria today stands in stark contrast to the trend \nin many African countries toward pluralism, transparency, and \nconstitutional guarantees of fundamental human rights. Nigeria \ncontinues to move in the opposite direction. The international \ncommunity needs to send very strong messages that this course of action \nwill make Nigeria an international pariah, shunned by all nations and \nall people committed to human rights and democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5950-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PRYOR\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

And one of the guiding forces behind its \npassage was Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey.\n  Senator Bradley is retiring from the Senate at the end of this year, \nand he leaves behind a record of accomplishment and innovation.\n  From the future of Russia to international trade to the state of our \ncities, Senator Bradley has been in the forefront of debates, providing \nboth leadership and original proposals.\n  Senator Bradley and I have not agreed on every issue over the years, \nbut one matter on which we see eye-to-eye is the need to restore \ncivility and a sense of decency to American society.\n  I have no doubt that Senator Bradley will continue to contribute a \ngreat deal to the debates of our time for many years to come.\n  Elizabeth joins with me in wishing all the best to Senator Bradley, \nand to his wife, Ernestine.\n  Senator Bradley has been a good friend. We have been on the Finance \nCommittee together. We have agreed on a lot of issues and, as I said \nearlier, disagreed on some. I think he has added a great deal of \ncivility to this body, and I know he has a bright future as he leaves \nthe Senate in whatever he may do in the private sector.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5951-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENATOR BENNETT JOHNSTON\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, like many Members of this body, I learned a \ngreat deal about how to succeed in the Senate from our former \ncolleague, Russell Long of Louisiana.\n  Senator Long knew this institution. He knew how to get things done. \nAnd he knew how to fight for the interests of his State. And during the \n14 years they represented Louisiana together, Senator Long had a \nwilling student and an effective partner in Senator J. Bennett \nJohnston.\n  And when Senator Johnston leaves this Chamber at the end of the year, \nhe will leave with a reputation as someone who knows the Senate, who \nknows how to get things done, and who knows how to fight for people of \nhis State.\n  Energy, water development, agriculture, and national defense are all \nissues that matter to Louisiana, and they are matters that have been on \nthe top of Senator Johnston's agenda.\n  As Republican leader, I have appreciated Senator Johnston's \nwillingness to set partisanship aside, and to do what is best for \nAmerica. His support of President Bush during the Persian Gulf War, his \nopposition to the Clinton tax increase, and his leadership in the \neffort to achieve true regulatory reform are three examples that come \nto mind.\n  I note that Senator Johnston will celebrate his birthday next week, \nand I would say to him that he is still a very young man, and that he \nstill has much to contribute to Louisiana and to America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5951-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5951-S5952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to executive session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate before I make any request \nhere that I have had a phone discussion today with Senator Daschle, the \nDemocratic leader. I hope there is still some way before I leave here \non Tuesday that we can dispose of, if not all the nominees on the \ncalendar, most of the nominees. It has never been my practice to hold \nup nominees because they have families; they have plans to make; they \nhave moves to make.\n  I know that we are sort of caught in a crunch here because we have \nobjections from both sides. And I did say on May 24, 1996, that I would \nbe happy to call up these nominations one at a time. If we cannot agree \non a package, if we cannot agree to do all or part, then it seems to me \nthat we ought to--\n\n[[Page S5952]]\n\nwe are talking more about judicial nominees than anything else at this \npoint--go one at a time.\n  Now, whether or not that will be satisfactory--I do not want to make \nthe request if it is not satisfactory, because I know the Democratic \nleader has obligations too, to his Members.\n  I am not going to ask you to object if you prefer to work this out \nsome other way, but I am prepared and I think the Democratic leader is, \nif we can find some way, to sort of break this logjam. We are in a \nposition to clear at least 5 nominees, not judges but other \nnominations. So we are making an effort, a serious effort. I am aware \nthe leader is making an effort to try to accommodate the concerns of \nthe President expressed to me this morning by the Democratic leader. So \nrather than make the request, I ask the Democratic leader if he knows \nof any other way we can deal with this that might resolve the problems \nwe both have?\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me say first I very much appreciate \nthe manner in which the majority leader has attempted to resolve this \nissue. No one has been more fair than has he, with regard to finding a \nway to resolve the matter and, as he indicated some time ago, he \nindicated his desire to take these matters up one by one. Under the \ncircumstances, I think, were we to not have any understanding as to how \nto resolve it, we would not be in a position to agree tonight to any \none particular element of the Executive Calendar relating to judges. \nBut I share the majority leader's view that our best opportunity would \nbe, perhaps, to take these matters up one by one. I would want to work \nwith him to see if we can resolve it in the next few days.\n  Mr. DOLE. As the Democratic leader knows, the Senators are coming to \nme and they are coming to you. They say, ``Just work out my problem,'' \nwhich I would be happy to do. But there are others who say, ``Not until \nyou work out my problem.'' And therein lies the problem.\n  So I hope we could accommodate. The judges I had in mind were Joseph \nGreenaway of New Jersey and Walker Miller of Colorado. We could go down \nthe whole list one time. Maybe everybody would cease to object, because \nthen we would have a vote up or down or somebody would have to stand up \nhere and say I want to speak however long it takes to sidetrack this \nnominee.\n  Perhaps we can, between now and Monday, and we are here at least for \n2 or 3 hours tomorrow morning. I will be happy to visit with the \nDemocratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Very good.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5951-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

My view was we were getting very, very close. I may be \nmistaken, but there have been constant contacts with the White House at \nthe staff level. And there have been changes made in the MSA provision, \nwhich is the one provision that seems to be the sticking point, and \nmany of the other issues with reference to mental health, the so-called \nMEWA's, and other provisions, have been resolved. So it is still \nhopeful that that can be accomplished between now and early next week. \nBut, in any event, I think there are still conversations going on at \nthis moment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/06/senate-section/article/S5952-5", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
