We \ndevelop a litmus test to judge others. Sometimes, when they don't \nmeasure up, we question their value and make condemnatory judgments of \nthem. Most serious of all, we think our categorization justifies our \nlack of prayer for them. Often we self-righteously neglect in our \nprayers the very people who most need Your blessing.\n  Give us Samuel's heart to say, ``Far be it from me that I should sin \nagainst the Lord in ceasing to pray for you.''--1 Samuel 12:23. Remind \nus that You alone have power to change the minds and hearts of people \nif we will be faithful to pray for them. Make us intercessors for all \nthose You have placed on our hearts--even those we previously have \ncondemned with our judgments. We accept Your authority: ``Judgement is \nmine, says the Lord.'' I pray this in the name of Jesus, who with Moses \nand the prophets, taught us to do to others what we would wish them to \ndo to us.

Mr. President, I am privileged to be joined this morning \nby my distinguished colleague and friend, Senator Ford. Senator Ford \nand I have the joint responsibility for the Rules Committee, and we \ncome to the floor today to announce the Senate presence on the World \nWide Web.\n  As of this morning, nearly 6 million Americans will have access to \neducational information about the U.S. Senate by way of Internet. We \nenvision the Senate Home Page as a tool that can be used by educators \nall across our Nation in helping with their teachings of the \nconstitutional and historical role of this institution, and its place \nin American Government and its underlying responsibilities within our \nsociety.\n  The U.S. Senate World Wide Web Server provides information from and \nabout the Members of the Senate, the Senate committees, and Senate \nleadership. This evolving service also provides general background \ninformation about U.S. Senate legislative procedures, the Senate \nfacilities in this Capitol Building, and the history of this \ninstitution. It also includes a visual tour of the Capitol for those of \nour constituents who may be unable to visit in person, and particularly \nfor those who can visit it. It includes many suggestions on how to plan \ntheir visits to the U.S. Capitol Building.\n  The Capitol Building also has, as we all know, a permanent art \ncollection of great renown and of great historical significance. That \ntoo is treated in this Internet.\n  I want to thank Senator Stevens and my colleague, Senator Ford, and \nother members of the Rules Committee who began this effort early this \nyear. We have a very valued staff, and this effort has been led by John \nMcConnell and Paul Steele, and most recently by the acting staff \ndirector, Grayson Winterling.\n  Special thanks to additional staff persons with technical ability in \nthe Sergeant at Arms, Tom Meenan, Chris Lee, Charlie Kirsch, Alex \nHobson, Jenny Yu, Roger Myers, Jim Judy, and Sara Oursler along with \nCherie Allen of the Secretary of the Senate's office, for developing \nthis technical achievement.\n  Additional thanks to many of those Senators and their high-technology \n\n\n[[Page S15372]]\nstaff members who were early adopters of this emerging technology, and \nwho indeed gave us the impetus to move forward to this day.\n  Further, Mr. President, I would emphasize that this is but one step \nunder the current leadership of the Rules Committee, myself and Mr. \nFord. We hope to enrich and further expand the Senate Internet presence \nin the coming months with additional information about the Senate, and \nits Members.\n  Further, Mr. President, some of the additional services that we hope \nto add will be a calendar of events in the Capitol and the Senate, \nvideo and voice excerpts of Senate proceedings, and expanded home page \npercentages.\n  I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Warner, \nour new chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, in announcing that as \nof this morning, the Senate is now online on the World Wide Web.\n  The Senate Rules Committee first authorized a Senate presence on the \nInternet in September, 1993, with the creation of the Senate FTP Gopher \nServer. In November of that year, the Rules Committee established \npolicies and procedures for Senate participation on the Internet. In \nthe short 2 years since that time, Internet technology has leaped \nforward producing the significantly improved graphics capability of the \nWorld Wide Web. The Web provides the Senate an improved opportunity to \nprovide educational information to the public and I am pleased that we \nare able to announce this step forward today.\n  The U.S. Senate World Wide Web Server is produced under the auspices \nof the Secretary of the Senate's office with technical advice and input \nfrom the Sergeant at Arms' Office and the Rules Committee technical \nstaff. The Senate Server will provide the public with general \ninformation on the Senate and how it works. The Senate Home Page will \nprovide a direct link to Member's home pages located on the Server and \nwill allow the public to surf such useful information as visual tours \nof the Capitol, committee membership and jurisdiction, a glossary of \nfrequently used legislative terms, and the history of the Senate.\n  While we all recognize the somewhat limited reach of the Web today, \nwith an estimated 6 million users nationally, the potential--and I \nemphasize ``potential''--for this technology to eventually reach every \nschool child, office place, and even private home, is obvious. The \nSenate needs to move into the 21st century and our presence on the Web \nensures that the Senate will not be left behind as this technology \nexplodes.\n  The Rules Committee will continue to monitor the development of the \nWeb with an eye to ensuring that as technology moves forward, the \nSenate keeps pace with policies and procedures that ensure access to \nimproving technology on a fiscally sound basis. I congratulate our \nchairman, Senator Warner, on moving forward with this initiative and \nencourage my colleagues to take advantage of this important \ncommunications tool.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. I say \nto Members of the Senate, Senator Ford and I have worked together on \nmany things for now some 17 years and he is a tough, fair working \npartner, I tell you that.\n  Mr. FORD. Leave the ``tough'' out.\n  Mr. WARNER. All right. He is a man who takes very conscientiously the \nduties of the Rules Committee and has for many years. It is a pleasure \nto work with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15371-6", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO THE CAPITOL POLICE\n\n  Mr. WARNER. On Monday, October 16, a very significant number--I shall \nnot make any estimate--of American citizens came from every corner of \nour land to answer a challenge to join in a day of atonement and \nbrotherhood on the National Mall and the west front of the U.S. \nCapitol. Many visitors journeyed to Washington from distant States to \njoin in what was characterized as the Million Man March, a successful \noccasion, indeed, by all press accounts.\n  The Capitol Grounds, which belong equally to every citizen of this \nNation, was one of the focal points of this gathering. Sometimes those \nof us who work in the Senate, whatever the capacity may be, tend not to \nfully appreciate what happens behind the scenes when large \ndemonstrations of this magnitude occur.\n  I stand today to pay tribute to the infrastructure of the Senate--\nindeed, I think of both the House and the Senate--that contributed in \nsome measure to making this an acceptable and safe event.\n  Again, I thank all who helped make it a safe event. It was one of the \nlargest demonstrations on the U.S. Capitol Grounds in contemporary \nhistory. I would particularly like to thank our Capitol Police \nDepartment; 1,100 U.S. Capitol Police officers were on duty on October \n16. All days off were canceled. Officers were required to work extended \nduty hours. Officers provided routine law enforcement, protective \noperations, and traffic control. Their professionalism assured that our \nvisitors received the services they deserved and permitted Senators and \nstaff to continue their work during the day.\n  There was also significant infrastructure to provide for health and \nfirst aid.\n  Planning meetings with the organizations began early in August to \nassure this public safety. Senator Ford and I convened two meetings of \nthe infrastructure on the Senate side and carefully reviewed their \nplans. We thank Chief Gary Abrecht, Assistant Chief Robert Howe, and \nDeputy Chief James Rohan for their overall command, and we are grateful \nto Lt. Gregg Parman and Officer Terry Rinaldi for their involvement in \nall phases of the planning process.\n  While the Nation focused its attention on the west front of the \nCapitol, the Capitol Police Department worked to assure the safety and \nsecurity of all who assembled, preserving the tradition of our first \namendment rights.\n  We thank the Capitol Police for their good work. We thank many others \nin this institution who equally contributed. And I pay a special \nrecognition to Mr. Howard Greene, the Sergeant at Arms, who was sort of \nthe executive officer of this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15372-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15372-S15374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF SENATOR NUNN\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to place into \ntoday's Record of the Senate the remarks made by our distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Nunn of Georgia, when he announced his future \nintentions, which, to the regret of many, indicated that he would not \nseek reelection to the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I say it is a privilege because Senator Nunn has been \na very, very close personal friend, a valued and respected professional \npartner--I always considered him a partner--for a quarter of a century. \nI first came to know Senator Nunn when I, as Secretary of the Navy, \nworked with Carl Vinson. Carl Vinson was chairman of the House Armed \nServices Committee. He served in the House of Represenatives for 50 \nyears. I had a role in the naming of a supercarrier after him, the \nU.S.S. Carl Vinson.\n  It was in the process of that naming procedure that I first came to \nknow Sam Nunn, who at that time was working in a capacity with Carl \nVinson and the House Armed Services Committee. Of course, when I was \nprivileged some 17 years ago to come to the Senate, he was a member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, and we worked there together for \nthese many years and will continue to work for this coming year. I \nanticipate his contributions in this coming year to our Nation and to \nour Senate will be no less as significant in magnitude as the many \ncontributions he has made over his entire career in the Senate.\n  As I say, I value his friendship, and for 6 years we were privileged \nto work together with Senator Nunn as chairman of the committee, and I \nhad the position of ranking member. We sponsored many pieces of \nlegislation, coauthored them together, particularly in the areas of \npersonnel and strategic matters. We journeyed together to many foreign \nlands in connection with our responsibilities on the committee.\n  So it is with heartfelt thanks that I say to my friend, in joining \nmany others in paying him respect, I wish him \n\n[[Page S15373]]\nand his family the very best of good fortune and simply say thank you, \nSenator Nunn, for the many things you have done for our country \nparticularly in the area of national security.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in today's \nRecord the full text of his statement. Also, I have a short article \nwhich appeared in the Washington Times entitled ``Inside The Beltway,'' \nand I will read it. That would be the final, concluding part of the \nentry in today's Record. It reads:\n\n       Family values. On Monday, after Senator Nunn announced that \n     he would not run for reelection next year, we asked him what \n     he felt had been his greatest accomplishment during his 24 \n     years in Congress. Mr. Nunn thought about our question for \n     several days and got back to us yesterday. We must concede we \n     were surprised at his response, having expected the Georgia \n     Democrat to cite one of his many legislative accomplishments.\n       ``Keeping my family together,'' he said.\n       Asked to explain, Mr. Nunn said that, with the multitude of \n     demands on a Senator's family, families have to make many \n     sacrifices. He said he is especially proud to have kept his \n     family together.\n       The Senator and his wife, Colleen, recently celebrated \n     their 30th wedding anniversary. They have two children, \n     Michelle, 28, and Brian, 26.\n\n  I think that final comment in connection with his future plans not \nonly symbolizes the humility of this great American but it also speaks \nto the life and the challenges of every Member of this institution.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Senator Nunn's Statement, October 9, 1995\n\n       I am honored to be in our beautiful State capitol building \n     on the floor of the Georgia house where I began my \n     legislative career 27 years ago. After a lot of thought and \n     prayer, I have concluded that my rewarding and fulfilling \n     legislative career should end at the conclusion of my present \n     term. This has been a difficult decision made much harder \n     because of my deep respect for the many people who have \n     encouraged me to run, but I know in my heart that it is time \n     for me to follow a new course.\n       I believe that both voters and incumbents have a \n     responsibility for careful assessment before entering into a \n     new Senate Contract. For me, an election establishes a sacred \n     trust between the voter and the elected official. Each time I \n     have been elected to the Senate, I have committed heart and \n     soul to the full range of duties of a Senator for a full 6 \n     years. The job requires this commitment--the people deserve \n     it.\n       Today, I look forward to more freedom, to more flexibility, \n     more time with my family, more time in Georgia, and more time \n     to read, write, and think. While I will not continue in the \n     legislative arena, I will continue my involvement in public \n     policy.\n       The essence of democracy is much more than just legislators \n     casting votes. It is the action of men and women who take the \n     time to wrestle with the problems of individuals and \n     communites--and do something to solve them. This is the new \n     arena that I will enter--that of a private citizen who also \n     is engaged in the challenges that face our communities and \n     our nation.\n       Today, there is no shortage of challenges. These include \n     issues of national security, foreign policy, the environment, \n     health care, and the plight of citizens struggling to fully \n     participate in the economic opportunity of our Nation.\n       Too many of our citizens are being left behind as our \n     economy moves from the industrial age to the age of \n     information and knowledge because they lack appropriate \n     education and training. A large part of our economic \n     challenge is fundamentally an education challenge. We must \n     change.\n       Too many children in America are born and grow up outside \n     family structures without the attention, nurturing, \n     discipline, and love that every human soul must have. Too \n     many parents who are struggling to provide their children \n     with basic needs have no way to protect them from street \n     violence and drugs. If America is to remain the greatest \n     country on Earth, our children must come first. We must \n     change.\n       Too many executives are spending too many corporate dollars \n     paying for television programs that bombard our homes with \n     sex and violence--not thinking or caring about the effect of \n     this bombardment on our children and our nation's future. Too \n     many of us as citizens sit by passively while this \n     bombardment takes place. We continue to buy the products \n     which are advertised and sold at the expense of our culture--\n     our values--our children--and our future. We must change.\n       We are reaping the harvest from this combination of \n     conditions in soaring rates of child abuse, drug abuse, \n     teenage pregnancies, abortions, and unprecented levels of \n     crime and violence.\n       These challenges are made more difficult because our \n     citizens are increasingly concluding that our political \n     system responds primarily to money and special interests. Our \n     system of government is sound, and most public officials are \n     honorable, but there are fundamental problems which must be \n     corrected.\n       Too much of the time and effort of Members of Congress is \n     consumed by fund raising. The ability to raise big money and \n     buy saturation tv ads has become the dominant theme of our \n     political races.\n       Too often the tactics of obsessive polling, negative and \n     cynical campaigns, and horse race media coverage overwhelm \n     substantive debate, dialogue with the voters, and real \n     leadership. Too much of the time of both Congress and the \n     executive branch is spent budgeting--not enough time is spent \n     in oversight and evaluation of Federal programs.\n       The average citizen primarily wants his or her elected \n     officials to use common sense for the common good, but too \n     often those voices are drowned out by the extremes in both \n     parties who are usually wrong, but never in doubt. Our system \n     of government is the best in the world, but our political \n     process is in need of major reform. Continuation of the two \n     party system, as we know it, will depend on whether true \n     campaign reform and congressional procedural reform are \n     undertaken soon.\n       America is not perfect, but it is the greatest country in \n     the world. During our 200 year history, when we have faced \n     economic, military, political, or social peril, Americans \n     have demonstrated the unrivaled ability to change and to grow \n     stronger in the process.\n       This is a period of transition for our Nation, similar to \n     the historic periods after World War I and World War II. \n     After World War I, decisions and events took place that led \n     to a devastating worldwide depression, and an even more \n     deadly war. After World War II, Americans led the way, in \n     rebuilding war torn nations, in building international \n     institutions that endured, and in containing communism until \n     it collapsed from its own weakness. American leadership \n     opened the door to an unprecedented era of prosperity for the \n     free world.\n       We too will someday be measured by how well we meet the \n     challenges we face today at home and abroad.\n       I am optimistic about America because the checks and \n     balances built into our constitutional system have stood the \n     toughest tests of time, and I am confident they will again.\n       I am optimistic because our military, with the world's best \n     technology, remains ready and well-led, with men and women \n     who reflect our very best in quality and in character. Our \n     military strength represents a strong defensive shield \n     against aggression. Our free society, our free flow of ideas, \n     our energetic people, and our free enterprise system \n     represent a strong offensive sword for democracy.\n       I am optimistic because America responds to major \n     challenges. We have the opportunity and responsibility to \n     prove to ourselves and to the world that our ideals of \n     liberty, justice, and human rights can all be made to work in \n     this land of diversity. In a world of ethnic and religious \n     strife, America has no greater mission.\n       I am optimistic because we are finally recognizing that our \n     fiscal soundness as a Nation depends on restraining the \n     growth of our entitlement programs. Entitlement reform, \n     including Social Security reform, will be difficult and must \n     be done over time with care--but it must be done.\n       I am optimistic because we are beginning a serious debate \n     on fundamental tax reform, and beginning to realize that \n     there is a direct connection between our savings and our \n     standard of living.\n       I am optimistic because we are at long last discussing \n     frankly the terrible affliction of family deterioration and \n     illegitimacy. We must reach out as an extended family to the \n     millions of neglected and abused children who desperately \n     need someone who cares. Government must play a role, but I do \n     not believe that it will be the decisive role. This is a \n     battle that must be fought one child at a time.\n       I am optimistic because I see our young people tutoring \n     children, helping flood victims, building houses for the \n     homeless, and working with at-risk youth. I see our young \n     military personnel on their own time teaching math to inner-\n     city children and mentoring young students.\n       I have watched my own daughter, Michelle, and her young \n     friends in Atlanta create an organization of 10,000 people of \n     all ages volunteering 20,000 hours per month for children, \n     the elderly, the handicapped, and others in great need. \n     Volunteers like these are filling a void in America today. \n     They are our real heroes.\n       I am optimistic because we have so many energetic, \n     innovative and bold young entrepreneurs like my son, Brian, \n     who are finding their niche in the dynamic new world of \n     information and technology--thereby building jobs and \n     strengthening America's economic future.\n       I am optimistic about Georgia's future and Georgia's \n     leadership in both the public and private sector. Our State \n     has benefitted from strong political leadership, sound fiscal \n     policy, and hard-working people. Our leaders in the private \n     sector understand the important role that business must play \n     in strengthening our education system and our communities.\n       When I leave the Senate at the end of next year, I know \n     that whatever I will have accomplished during my legislative \n     career will have been because I had a lot of help. I am \n     deeply grateful to Colleen, my wife and partner, for her \n     sacrifice, her patience, her wisdom and for her love which \n     made my life of public service possible--to my children, \n     Michelle and Brian, of whom we are very proud--to my \n     wonderful mother and my late \n\n[[Page S15374]]\n     father who shaped my life by their love, their expectations and their \n     example--to my sister Betty Mori and her husband, Jean, and \n     to my entire family and close friends for their sacrifice, \n     their steadfast support, and for their love.\n       I am grateful to my friends and supporters and to the \n     voters of Georgia for their support in each election--for \n     their encouragement and confidence--for their constructive \n     criticism and for their forgiveness of my errors.\n       I am grateful to my staff--past and present--who have \n     worked with honesty, skill, and dedication on behalf of the \n     people of Georgia and the Nation.\n       I am grateful to the Members of the U.S. Senate and House--\n     past and present--of both political parties, who have been my \n     mentors--teachers--and friends, and who have been my partners \n     in many legislative initiatives.\n       I am grateful to my friends in the Georgia legislature, and \n     to Governor Miller, Governor Harris, Governor Busbee, and \n     Governor Carter, Speaker Murphy and Lt. Gov. Howard as well \n     as our State constitutional officers. They have guided our \n     State with vision, fiscal prudence and integrity while I have \n     served in the Senate. I am grateful to our leaders at the \n     local level who play such an important role in the daily \n     lives of our citizens.\n       I am grateful to Georgia Democrats for their role in \n     leading our State to a point of unprecedented economic \n     opportunity. Georgia Democrats have made education our top \n     priority and brought together people from every region, every \n     walk of life, and every race to work for common goals.\n       I am honored to represent a State where the vast majority \n     of our people cast their ballots--not on the basis of one or \n     two issues--but rather on their judgment of a candidate's \n     principles and values, integrity and vision. I can never \n     fully repay the people of Georgia for the trust and faith \n     they have placed in me.\n       I have tried to return this trust and faith with hard work \n     and effective representation.\n       I hope that I have played a meaningful role in making \n     Georgia a better place to live and to raise our children.\n       I hope that I have helped build bridges of understanding \n     and cooperation between people of different races, religions \n     and political beliefs.\n       I have tried to help make America stronger at home and \n     abroad. I have tried to help build a safer and more peaceful \n     world with freedom and justice.\n       I have tried to instill in our young people by word and by \n     example--the understanding and belief that it remains \n     possible to be involved in the political process and also \n     retain both intellectual honesty and ethical behavior. In the \n     final analysis, this may be the single most important \n     responsibility of public service.\n       I look forward to continuing these efforts as a U.S. \n     Senator for the next 15 months, and after that--as a private \n     citizen of Georgia for whatever term God may grant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15372-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15374-S15375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     UNITED STATES TROOPS TO BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in recent days, the Nation has focused its \nattention on one of the most serious issues to come before this country \nsince I have been privileged to be in the Senate, and I say that in all \nsincerity. That is the very difficult decision facing the President of \nthe United States as to whether or not this Nation will make a \nfurther--and I underline further--commitment of our Armed Forces to the \nsituation in Bosnia.\n  As I am privileged to address the Senate this morning, there are \nstill pockets of combat in that war-torn nation, a nation which I have \nvisited five times myself, being the first Senator to go to Sarajevo \nover 2\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  Since that time, I am pleased that so many of the Members of the \nSenate have found the opportunity to go to that region so that they \ncan, likewise, gain a clearer and better understanding of this historic \nand tragic conflict.\n  I would like to focus my remarks today, Mr. President, on an issue \nwhich has captured the attention of the American people over the last \nweek, that is, President Clinton's decision to send up to 25,000 United \nStates ground troops to Bosnia.\n  Hearings were held this week in the U.S. Senate, both in the Armed \nServices Committee, of which I am a member, and in the Foreign \nRelations Committee. Those hearings revealed the depth of congressional \nconcerns, both Republican and Democrat, with this proposed deployment. \nMay I emphasize, Mr. President, I do not view this issue as a political \none. I think each Senator that has spoken out or involved himself or \nherself in this debate has done so very sincerely, as a matter related \nto their duties to this Nation, not for any political reason.\n  I myself, in traveling through my State, indeed, not just in the last \nmonth or so, but over the period of the nearly 3 years of this \nconflict, have detected perhaps the deepest, the most sincere concern \nthat I have ever experienced since the closing days of Vietnam about \nthis conflict and America's role in the conflict.\n  In my view, the American people are entitled to a voice in a decision \nof this magnitude. The American people have followed this conflict for \nover 3 years. They are well-informed, they understand the complexities \ninvolved, they should have a voice in this decision. Their voice can \nbest be manifested right in this institution, the U.S. Congress, with a \nvery thorough and extensive debate. That is the principal reason I rise \ntoday to address the Senate. We, their elected representatives in the \nCongress, must ensure that the voice of the American people is heard.\n  I call on the congressional leadership, both Senate and House, to \nestablish a plan for debating and voting on a freestanding resolution \nregarding the authorization for the use of United States ground troops \nin Bosnia.\n  I have consulted with my leader in the Senate, Senator Dole. And he, \nat this time, is considering this need for the leadership to establish \nthe procedure and the timing for this debate. In my view, in this \nspecial instance, the leadership must exercise control--I say that most \nrespectfully--control over the procedure by which the Senate commences \nthis debate to ensure that it is meaningful, well-informed, and timely.\n  I would like to emphasize that the timing of this congressional \ndebate is critical. If the Senate considers the issue too soon, that \nis, before we know the outlines of the peace agreement, before we know \nall of the details of the proposed NATO operation, there will be too \nmany unanswered questions to enable this debate to reach an informed \nconclusion. If we wait too long, however, our troops may well be on the \ntheir way, that is, our ground troops, and Congress will not have \nperformed the responsible role that I believe the Constitution requires \nus to perform. Only by daily monitoring of this situation can the \nleadership best determine that critical hour when this debate should be \ninitiated.\n  I do not see this debate, I repeat, Mr. President, as a political \nfight. This is not Republicans versus Democrats or Republicans versus \nthe President. The misgivings regarding this operation cross party \nlines. At issue in this debate is not who scores the most political \npoints. What is at stake are the lives of the men and the women of the \nU.S. Armed Forces and the present and future credibility of America's \nsecurity policy.\n  The most important question we must answer in this debate is whether \nor not the United States has a vital national security interest in this \nconflict in Bosnia, which justifies putting United States combat troops \nin harm's way in this operation and justifies imposing a very \nsignificant cost on the American taxpayer, a cost which cannot be fully \ncalculated at this time but which would easily be in the billions of \ndollars.\n  We must keep in mind that past military operations have taken dollars \nfrom our modernization and O accounts in the Department of Defense, \ndollars which directly affect the future readiness, preparedness, and \ncapabilities of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  Again, Mr. President, I focus on the fact that the use of United \nStates ground troops in Bosnia would be an additional step by our \nNation. Our military forces are already there and have been there in a \nvery significant way in those military operations involving airpower, \nand in those military operations involving the naval embargo. In both \nthe air and the naval operations, for several years we have been the \ndominant military participant.\n  I question, is this deployment of United States ground troops the \nbest of the remaining options for resolving the fighting in Bosnia? The \nPresident and his negotiators deserve credit for the achievements they \nhave had to date with respect to achieving a peace agreement and \nlessening the fighting. So that is definitely to their credit.\n  But should the United States play a role on the ground in Bosnia \ngiven that we are already, as I say, playing the major role in the air \noperations and the naval blockade, or are there other options we should \nconsider which \n\n[[Page S15375]]\nwould not involve such a significant number of upward of 25,000 United \nStates ground troops?\n  Mr. President, Senator Levin and I recently completed a report for \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee involving the United States \nmilitary involvement in Somalia. That report, I think, if I may say, \nshould accomplish one thing. It should cause the administration and \nthis Senate to consider more carefully the policy decisions that put \nmen and women who serve in our Armed Forces at risk.\n  As the father of one of the young Rangers killed in Somalia, Col. \nLarry Joyce, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in an open \nhearing, and I quote him:\n\n       Too frequently, policymakers are insulated from the misery \n     they create. If they could be with the chaplain who rings a \n     doorbell at 6:20 in the morning to tell a 22-year-old woman \n     she's now a widow, they'd develop their policies more \n     carefully.\n\n  That is why I emphasize that the American people need a much stronger \nvoice in this critical decision. And that can only be fulfilled, in my \njudgment, by a very comprehensive debate here in the U.S. Senate. I \nhope that President Clinton will actively seek such a debate.\n  I point out that, very wisely, President Bush, when he was faced with \nthe similar situation in the gulf war, received congressional \nauthorization for the use of force prior to the initiation of that \nconflict. That debate, though difficult and contentious, was, in my \nview, one of the finest in the contemporary history of this \ninstitution.\n  The final vote taken after, I think, almost 3 days of debate, was by \na narrow margin of five to authorize the President to use force. But \nthe debate and vote served to unite the Congress and, indeed, the \nAmerican people behind our President.\n  Fortunately, the casualty level in that conflict was far below the \npredictions. But had the Congress not been on record in support of the \nPresident and the war effort, and had that conflict resulted in \ngreater--there were significant losses--but had there been greater \nlosses, I fear the drumbeat could well have started right here in the \nCongress to bring our troops home. We need only remember the experience \nof Somalia.\n  In calling for this vote, I do not seek to question the President's \nrole as Commander in Chief--in particular, his authority to deploy \nUnited States troops in emergency situations, such as we saw in Grenada \nand Panama, when the circumstances did not allow for a protracted, \nprior debate in the Congress. That was quite appropriate, and it was \nthat type of action that was contemplated by the Founding Fathers when \nthey wrote into the Constitution the specific roles of the President \nwith respect to being Commander in Chief.\n  But that is not the case with Bosnia. That war has been going on for \n3\\1/2\\ years, since April 1992. We are, at best, weeks away from a \npeace agreement. There is plenty of time for the Congress to exercise \nits constitutional responsibility for such a deployment by thoroughly \ndebating the issue and voting on a resolution.\n  Although I have traditionally been a supporter of Presidential \nprerogative in the deployment of United States troops, I have yet to be \nconvinced that this President's plan, President Clinton's plan, for \nputting this additional contingent of military forces, namely, up to \n25,000 ground forces in Bosnia, is the proper option to follow.\n  I listened carefully to the administration's testimony during the \ncourse of our hearing in the Armed Services Committee, but I still \ncannot identify a vital United States national security interest in \nBosnia that justifies putting United States ground troops at risk in \nthat nation. I do not want to see U.S. troops inserted in the middle of \na civil war, a civil war which is based on centuries' old religious and \nethnic hatreds.\n  I would like to recount just a personal note. On my last visit, \nSenator Robert Kerrey and I went into the Krajina region which, just \ndays before our visit, had been the battleground for Croatian forces \ndriving Serbian forces out, Croatian Serbs having taken that land \nseveral years earlier. There was an enclave of Serbs that had been \ntrapped and prevented, in one way or another, from fleeing into Serb \nterritory. We met extensively with these refugees. In one particular \nmeeting, there was a doctor, there was a schoolteacher and there was \nanother very well-educated individual. As hard as we pressed them for \nanswers as to why this conflict exists and continues to exist, they \ncould give no answers to explain why well-educated people have \nparticipated all throughout that region--all sides--in barbaric acts \nwhich those of us in this country find incomprehensible.\n  That is my major concern as to why we should not put our troops in \nthere in harm's way. President Clinton has yet to make a convincing \ncase that we should proceed with this deployment.\n  In my view, the burden of proof on the administration to turn public \nopinion around is virtually insurmountable. Therefore, it has to be a \njoint responsibility of the Congress and the President, no matter how \ndefinite the President and others may wish to make this commitment at \nthis time. And another thing that concerns me, how the administration \ncan predict, should we go in, that this situation would be of such a \nnature that we could pull out all of our forces 1 year from today. I \njust find that incomprehensible.\n  So, Mr. President, I shall have more to say on this subject in the \ncoming days. I yield the floor and thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] is recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15374-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15375-S15376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               BLM LANDS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, October 22, which is just around the \ncorner, is a pretty important day in Montana, and I will tell my \ncolleagues why in just a minute. But I will say it is one of the \nreasons why I am dead set against S. 1031, a bill to transfer the lands \nadministered by the Bureau of Land Management to the States.\n  Let me say a word about multiple use. When Congress passed the \nFederal Land Management and Policy Act of 1976, it defined multiple use \nas ``the management of the public lands so that they are utilized in \nthe combination that will best meet the present and future needs of the \nAmerican people.''\n  That is what the statute says.\n  Let me tell you about what it means to Montanans--citizens of a State \nwith nearly 30 million acres of Federal public lands. To many \nMontanans, it means jobs, jobs from the timber that we harvest, \nminerals that we mine, oil and gas that we extract, livestock that we \ngraze and city slickers that pay for a week under the big sky with our \noutfitters and our guides.\n  And to all Montanans, folks who earn their living off the land and \nthe majority who live and work in towns, these lands represent what we \nlove most about our State. These lands provide recreation, an escape \nfrom work, a reminder that we live in the last best place.\n  It means teaching your kids to hunt like your dad taught you. It \nmeans being able to take your family out for a weekend and hike and \ncamp and explore in the most beautiful, pristine places known to man.\n  Montanans head to the Pryor Mountains hoping to catch a glimpse of \nthe wild horse herds; they float the historical Whitecliffs of the \nMissouri River; and they fish the blue-ribbon Madison River.\n  This weekend in particular reminds Montanans of just how lucky we all \nare to have so much Federal lands available to us. It is the start of \nthe big game hunting season.\n  Montanans head to the Missouri Breaks in search of trophy mulies, set \nup their elk camps in the Centennial Mountains, or take a trip to their \nfavorite spot to go antelope hunting, shoot upland game birds, \npheasant, or ducks.\n  Montanans are lucky because these Federal lands are near our homes. \nWithin an hour's drive from any town in Montana, these lands provide \nfull access and outstanding opportunities for a successful hunt. In \nfact, there were more than 375,000 hunting trips on Montana's BLM lands \nin 1994.\n  Just think of that, 375,000 hunting trips on Montana's BLM lands in \n1994.\n  There is, however, a bill pending in the Senate which takes this away \nfrom Montanans. It is S. 1031. It directs the \n\n[[Page S15376]]\nSecretary of the Interior to give all the BLM lands to the States who, \nin turn, may deal with them as they see fit.\n  Montana may choose to manage these 8.8 million acres of BLM lands \nmuch the same way they are currently managed. Of course, that would \nmean coming up with the $34 million in funding that the U.S. Government \ncurrently spends each year to manage BLM lands in Montana. Finding an \nadditional $34 million a year is a real stretch to our State when our \ntotal State budget is under $2 billion a year.\n  Of course, Montana has other options, as do other States, under this \nlegislation. The State could simply not pay for range improvements, \nweed control, recreation, and wildlife projects that are currently \nbeing paid for and carried out by the BLM.\n  Montana can also choose to raise some quick revenue by putting these \nlands on the auction block and selling them to the highest bidder. \nSleeping Giant, the Terry Badlands, the Missouri Breaks, Beartrap \nCanyon, the Pryor Range, the Centennial Mountains sold. Once public \nlands and streams, then fenced off; ``no trespassing'' signs put out. \nThis bill takes away what Montanans love most about our State: Open, \neasy access to public lands to hunt, fish, hike, birdwatch, snowmobile, \nfour-wheel drive.\n  I want to put my colleagues on notice that S. 1031 is a bad deal. It \nis bad for Montana. It is bad for the West. It is bad for the Nation. \nOur public lands are the key to perpetuating our outdoor heritage.\n  As Teddy Roosevelt said, ``The Nation behaves well if it treats the \nnatural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next \ngeneration increased, not impaired, in value.''\n  That is what Teddy Roosevelt said. S. 1031 ignores future generations \nand yanks their inheritance out from under them.\n  Marion and Rose Coleman of Laurel, MT, recently wrote me and said \nthis:\n\n       Please stop S. 1031 for the benefit of the 22 members of \n     our family who love to hunt, fish, and camp on public lands.\n\n  I am here today to let Marion and Rose Coleman, and all Montanans, \nknow that I intend to fight this bill every step of the way. It is \nanti-hunting, anti-Montana.\n  If it ever reaches the floor in anything close to its present form, \nit is dead on arrival. That is something I will guarantee my \ncolleagues, and, more importantly, that is something I will guarantee \nthe people of Montana.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Tuesday night in Houston, and last Friday \nas well, the President of the United States made a comment where he \nsaid specifically, ``I had to raise your taxes more than I wanted and \ncut spending less than I wanted to, which made a lot of you furious.''\n  Well, the comment made those of us who voted for that proposal even \nmore furious than it made, apparently, the audience to which the \nPresident was speaking.\n  Mr. President, the President of the United States has since said that \nhe did not intend to say that the package was bad. He did not intend to \nmean that he was not proud of the people who voted for it. But he left \nthe unmistakable impression that he would have cut more given the \nopportunity.\n  The fact is that, in 1993, Congressman Penny and Congressman Kasich \npresented $105 billion in additional spending cuts after the budget \ndeficit reduction bill was passed. I think it has done a tremendous \namount of good for the U.S. economy. It did reduce the deficit--as now \nestimated, by nearly a trillion dollars.\n  But Congressman Penny and Congressman Kasich, and later myself and \nSenator Brown on the Senate side, offered nearly identical proposals to \ncut over $100 billion over 5 years, and the administration opposed it. \nThey did not just send a letter about it. They sent various Members up \nhere, saying this was draconian and it was going to hurt--all the \nthings that are mentioned, typically, when a spending cut is made. \nMaybe this is part of a triangulation strategy that we hear about a \nlot. But, Mr. President, it is strangulating the confidence that we \nhave in Congress that whatever it is we do is going to continue to \nenjoy the support of the President.\n  Now, I do not want to drag it much farther than that. I actually had \na very harsh speech that I had written yesterday, and, fortunately, I \nthink both for myself and the President, there was not time to get to \nthe floor to give it. I have calmed down a bit since then. But a larger \npoint needs to be made here, rather than, did the President misstate or \nnot what it was he was trying to do?\n  Not only did Congressman Penny and Congressman Kasich and Senator \nBrown and myself present spending cut proposals, but the President put \ntogether a bipartisan entitlement commission, with 32 people on it. \nSenator Danforth and I chaired that effort. We presented to the \nPresident, in 1994, the recommendations of that commission, and those \nrecommendations are what I would like to talk about here today. They \nstill need the full consideration of this body.\n  Mr. President, it is fairly obvious that this place is still \ncontrolled by men. I am a man myself, and so it does not bother me most \nof the time. But we men behave differently than women in certain \nthings. One of the things women have noticed over the years is that we \nhave a tendency to exaggerate the size of things sometimes. That is, in \nfact, occurring in this entire budget debate.\n  The Republicans get up and talk about this being revolutionary, and \nwe heard Speaker Gingrich talking about a great revolution, and the \nDemocrats say, no, it is draconian, it is terrible, destructive, and on \nand on. The American people get kind of confused and wonder what is \ngoing on.\n  Mr. President, these are the facts. We will spend $1.5 trillion in \n1995, the fiscal year ending September 30. At the end of 2002, under \nthe Republican budget resolution, it will be roughly $1.858 trillion. \nIf you use the Congressional Budget Office baseline, with no change, it \nis about $2.1 trillion. So it is some $240 billion less. That is a lot \nof money, but hardly what I would put in the category of revolutionary. \nNor is it fair to say they are draconian, and on and on.\n  In some cases, I have had serious disagreements with the way the \nmoney is being allocated, but it is a relatively modest change. If you \nlook at the tax revenue generated and total spending over the next 7 \nyears compared to the past 7 years, we will spend nearly $2.4 trillion \nmore, and we are going to have $3.2 trillion more in tax revenue--a lot \nmore tax revenue coming in and a lot more money going out as well.\n  Mr. President, the goal that has been set over and over again by the \nRepublicans in this budget resolution and debate--and last night you \nheard it again--is that we are going to balance the budget. Yes, that \nought to be one goal. There is no question that it is accomplished \nunder this budget resolution. I am for balancing the budget. I would \nlike to be able to vote for the particular resolution that is going to \ncome back to us at some point. In its current form, I will not be able \nto do it.\n  Mr. President, there is another goal this budget resolution ought to \naddress, and it was identified by the bipartisan budget commission as \nmore troubling than the budget deficit. That is, as a percentage of our \nbudget, overall entitlements--not to the poor, but to the middle \nclass--overall entitlement growth is at an unsustainable level. Today, \nit is 64 percent of our budget. In 2002, at the end of this resolution, \nit will be 74 percent of our budget. In 2008, when my generation--the \nbiggest generation in the history of this country--starts to retire, it \nwill very rapidly go to 100 percent--100 percent, Mr. President. The \nFederal Government is going to be an ATM machine. Some will say that is \nfine, let it transfer payments out.\n  Mr. President, there are things that we appropriate that not only \nstrengthen our economy but improve the quality of life. I made a lot of \nmoney as a consequence of my parents helping to build the interstate \nhighway system. And as a consequence of their grandparents doing the GI \nbill, I have made a lot of money. This country has made investments in \nthe past that have improved the quality of our life. We spend \n\n[[Page S15377]]\n$1.7 billion a year on parks, and 17 million Americans a year enjoy \nthem, but we are going to cut it back. We are going to cut $1 billion \nout of the FAA. We already have $3 billion a year in increased costs to \nshippers as a result of delays. God knows what kind of disasters may \noccur as a result of underfunding that program.\n  We are going to have a real decline in education expenditures from \n$34 to $32 billion over the next 7 years. Transportation is going to be \ncut. We will be spending less on space and research and all sorts of \nthings that we ought to be doing. The reason is, of the $358 billion \nincrease in spending between this year and the year 2002, that \nincremental increase--all of it, more than 100 percent--goes for \nentitlements and net interest on the debt. Almost half of it, Mr. \nPresident, goes for an item that we have decided we do not want to talk \nabout--Social Security.\n  If you want to have a revolution, let us bring Senator Simpson's and \nmy proposal into consideration. People say, well, let us postpone that, \nand ``we are going to do it in 1997,'' says Speaker Gingrich. When you \nare saving money for retirement, time is not on your side. You can \nexercise, jog, watch your diet, quit smoking, get massages, or whatever \nelse, but you do not get the time back. Every year you wait, that is \nless wealth you generate. You may want to generate it in a collective \npool or a individual pool, as Senator Simpson and I are proposing.\n  Mr. President, to leave Social Security off the table makes it \nimpossible to do what we want to do with this budget resolution--not \nonly balance the budget by 2002, but balance the relationship between \nmandated programs and appropriated programs. We ought to decide \ncollectively that it is going to be some fixed percentage of our \nbudget, so we have money for schools, so we have money for roads, so we \nhave money for Head Start, or whatever else it is we decide we want to \nspend it on.\n  Mr. President, when the former chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee came to this body 35 years ago, 75 percent of the budget was \nallocated in appropriated accounts; 30 percent was entitlements and \ninterest.\n  The second objective we ought to be setting for ourselves is a big \none. It is going to require us to change the eligibility age in these \nprograms from 65 to 70, to phase it in. You cannot afford to do it any \nother way. It is why I said in the beginning that we describe it as \nbig, either on the positive side or a negative side. But it is kind of \na male sort of thing. The truth is that it is smaller than it needs to \nbe.\n  We need to take stock of the growth of entitlements. Otherwise, we \nare not going to have the money to be able to improve the quality of \nour lives, whether it is parks, natural resources development, or to \nincrease the productivity of our people and narrow this widening gap \nthat we see right now with the economic haves and have nots.\n  Next, Mr. President, now that Republicans say they want to preserve \nand protect Medicare, what that means is the market does not work.\n  When I hear the majority leader say the market is rational, the \nGovernment is stupid, here is one Government program he does not think \nis stupid. For people over the age of 65 who depend upon Medicare, the \nmarket does not work.\n  The same is true for somebody who is 25, that is out there in the \nwork force today making $8 an hour, being told they cannot have health \ninsurance because they cannot afford it. That is the principle \nunderneath the Medicare Program.\n  What we need to do is to say that we are going to radically alter--\nwhat a revolution--radically alter the system of eligibility and say to \nevery American, if you are a legal resident or American citizen you are \nin. You do not have to doubt that you will have coverage. The goal of \nuniversal coverage is just as desirable today as it was in 1993 and \n1994 when we debated it all the time.\n  Medicare, Medicaid, the income tax deduction, the Veterans \nAdministration programs are fiscal political and structural barriers to \ngetting that job done.\n  Democrats who for 35 years have supported Medicare because we \nunderstand the market does not work, need to say to recent convert \nRepublicans that to get everybody covered we have to do things much \ndifferently. That would be a revolution. That would be something big \nthat men and women would seize properly.\n  The last thing I say, Mr. President, contained in the debate \nyesterday in the Finance Committee was lots of conversation about the \nneed to promote growing. I am for it. We should have a debate about \nfundamental tax reform.\n  You cannot cut tax on those who have stocks and bonds and have a \nsubstantial amount of our income coming from stocks and bonds while \nraising taxes on people that make $7 an hour, depending on the earned \nincome tax credit. It is not fair. It does not wash. All you can hope \nis they do not notice and they do not vote as a consequence.\n  We are not being asked to reduce the capital gains tax by low-income \npeople who may benefit when they sell their home. We are being asked by \nwealthy Americans who have stocks and bonds and who have accurately \nsaid, in my judgment, that the economy does need to grow through \nproductive investment. We regard productive investment as replacing our \nincome tax with a progressive consumption tax.\n  It gives Americans an unlimited opportunity to save money and \naccumulate wealth over the course of their working life and promote \neconomic growth at the same time.\n  Do not put a capital gains tax cut out at the same time we cut and \nraise taxes for people that are at or below $25,000 a year, and to use \nthat money--they do not use it for television sets.\n  I heard a colleague who is critical of the program say all they are \ndoing is buying television sets. They use that few dollars to pay \nmedical bills, buy cars that have 80,000 miles so they can go to work \nand drop the kids at the child care center. Many are using it to make a \ndownpayment on rental deposits. They are using it the way the working \npeople ought to, to consume the things that are increasingly making it \ndifficult for them to cover their costs.\n  Finally, I say it again, I wish that the Republicans on the other \nside that currently control the majority of this Senate, I wish they \nwould turn across the aisle and say we should start negotiating. What \ndo you want, Senator Kerrey? My answer is simple. What I want is to fix \nthe cost of entitlements as a percent of our budget. What I want is to \nsay now you support the idea that the marketplace does not work, agree \nthat we will get universal coverage so every American knows they are \ncovered in health care. You cannot make the system work any other way.\n  Rather than block granting Medicaid to the States, we ought to bring \nthat and say to the States that $40 billion we will pay for, but you \nhave to take $40 billion, whether for education, job training, \ntransportation--something you do well. We have agreement; we will use \nthe marketplace.\n  We do not have to get down and fill the air with rhetoric about \nGovernment taking over health care. We know the market is doing a good \njob of controlling cost. There is consensus that that is what ought to \nbe done. Unless we change our notion of how people are going to become \neligible for health care, you cannot get that job done.\n  Last, I say for my friends on the other side of the aisle, there is \nconsensus on our tax system, whether it is the U.S.A. tax that Senator \nDomenici and Senator Nunn have worked on or other tax proposals, we \nknow we should not just be concerned about how much money we generate \nto pay whatever is mandated or whatever we want to appropriate.\n  We need to think about generating the money so the economy grows and \nso Americans out there who are producing the tax revenue have the \nopportunity to save enough to accumulate wealth over the course of \ntheir working life.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I hear an awful lot, and I put out a lot \nmyself from time to time about how bad the Government is and how \nterrible it does. I want to declare to my colleagues and people I \nrepresent in Nebraska that one of the reasons I stay in the job and am \nexcited about the job, you can use the Government of the United States \nof American to save lives. It saves lives.\n  It will be interesting to see what Colin Powell says when we ask him \nabout health care. The Government of \n\n[[Page S15378]]\nthe United States of America, the hospitals that provide health care \nfor U.S. Army servicemen have saved lives. Those people are Government \nemployees. You could change lives, enrich lives, improve lives. That is \nwhat it ought to be about.\n  We need to improve the Government and make it operate more \neffectively, but we need to tell the American citizens there is no free \nlunch in this deal. This Government in this country cannot be any \nbetter than our people are willing to make it. Our people are willing \nto make it a heck of a lot better than we allow.\n  We are frightened of universal health care. We got our brains beat \nout in 1993 and 1994. We do not want to talk about it. The American \npeople want to talk about it. We do not want to talk about fixing the \ncosts of entitlements based on facts and truth as the Speaker calls \nfor. We know if we give the facts and truth, we have to do Social \nSecurity, we have to change eligibility age, we have to change the \nmethod of eligibility.\n  Instead of working Republican and Democrats, I just hope that in the \nnext 60 days or however long it takes to do this deal, rather than \nlooking to always negotiate with the White House and try to cut a \ndeal--I fear that more than I do anything right now--look across the \naisle and work with us.\n  We are prepared to cast the tough votes. We want to embrace the \nfuture. We are not for the status quo. We are for change. We want to \nalter the course of our Nation's future and give investments to our \nchildren and be able to give them a brighter future than they have \nright now.\n  We are prepared, I believe, to cast the tough votes to change the \ncourse of this Nation's future, not based upon some calculation of \ntriangulation, trying to determine whether the President is more \npopular or less popular, trying to figure how to get reelected, but \ntrying to decide what is best for the people we represent, and most \nimportant what is best for our future.\n  Every single day of our lives has Americans--I do not care what your \nstatus is, what your name is, where you live--not a bad exercise to do \nas opposed to jogging is get up in the morning and go to bed at night \nand thank God for the things we have. We are a wealthy Nation, blessed \nwith enormous freedoms and opportunities.\n  I got out of high school in 1961. The cold war was on and our class \nthought whether we would go in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps because \nwe knew we were likely to go to Vietnam.\n  That is not the future of today. There is tremendous opportunity. \nSeize that opportunity rather than hyperventilate and exaggerating each \nother's position. Seize the opportunities and try to put in place a \nchange in the law that sends this Nation in a different direction, that \ndoes not just balance the budget but satisfies other needs and concerns \nand desires that the American people have today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15376-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REGISTRATION OF MASS MAILINGS\n\n  The filing date for 1995 third quarter mass mailings is October 25, \n1995.

Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs, I come to the floor to inform my \ncolleagues that at noon today the administration will announce that the \nUnited States, the United Kingdom, and France will sign the three \nprotocols to the South Pacific Nuclear-free Zone Treaty [SPNFZ], known \nas the Treaty of Rarotonga. I wholeheartedly welcome that decision.\n  The SPNFZ, which took effect in 1986, is signed by Australia, New \nZealand, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, \nTuvalu, the Cook Islands, and the Solomon Islands. The treaty includes \nthree protocols which are open to signature by nuclear countries \noutside the region. Protocol I prohibits any nuclear power with \nterritories in the zone from manufacturing, stationing, or testing any \nnuclear device within those territories. Protocol II commits the \nprotocol signatory not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons \nagainst any treaty signatory. Finally, Protocol III commits each \nprotocol signatory not to test a nuclear explosive device anywhere in \nthe zone. While no nuclear power has adhered to Protocol I, both Russia \nand the People's Republic of China have adhered to Protocols II and \nIII.\n  The SPNFZ is modeled after the Latin American Nuclear-Free Zone \nTreaty, the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which includes two protocols open to \nsignature by the nuclear powers. While the United States is a signatory \nto both the Tlatelolco protocols, we have not signed the similar \nRarotonga protocols. The reason appears to have been the tendency of \nthe western nuclear powers to be hesitant to sign on unilaterally. \nAlthough both we and the British appeared to be amenable to signing, \nbecause of French interests we refrained from doing so.\n  The continued obstinacy of the French, coupled with their decision to \ngo ahead with France's announced nuclear tests in the South Pacific, \ncaused me great concern for several reasons. First, I believed that a \nresumption of testing would result in the disintegration of the current \ntesting moratorium and a renewal of underground testing by other \nstates. Moratoria are like truces--they are only good as long as all \nthe parties to them observe their provisions. Second, it called into \nquestion France's commitment to the extension of the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. In May, the world's five announced \nnuclear powers persuaded the rest of the world to extend indefinitely \nthe NPT. To win that consensus, the five promised to sign a \ncomprehensive test ban treaty [CTBT] by the end of 1996. I believed \nstrongly that the resumption of French testing, only 4 months after \nFrance signed the agreement, called into serious question its \ncommitment to the CTBT and threatened to undermine international \nefforts to curb proliferation. Finally, the decision was vehemently \nopposed by most, if not all, of the countries in the region.\n  As a result of these concerns, on August 10 the distinguished ranking \nminority member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Pell, and I \nwrote President Clinton asking him\n\n       . . . to give serious consideration to an early decision to \n     seek Senate advice and consent to ratification of the \n     protocols to the Treaty. The timetable of such action would \n     be consistent with the achievement of a complete ban in 1996. \n     It would send a clear signal to the French that, while we \n     commend their decision to join in a compete test ban next \n     year, they should accede now to the overwhelming sentiment of \n     the peoples of the South Pacific that there should be no \n     further testing of any nuclear explosive devices in the \n     region. Moreover, it would send an unequivocal message to \n     regional nations that we support them in their desire to make \n     their zone nuclear-free. Finally, it is important to give \n     substance to the commitments we gave the regional nations \n     when they supported the U.S. this spring in the effort in New \n     York to secure the permanent extension of the [NPT].\n\n  The announcement today is an important step toward achieving a ban by \nthe end of 1996. While I would like to think that our letter had \nsomething to do with the decision--and here I would like to commend the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island for his efforts in that \nregard--I must realistically credit the Government of France with \nmaking the agreement possible. France was the only country testing \nnuclear weapons in the zone, and had maintained that they would not \njoin the protocols until the entry into force of the CTBT. Their \ndecision to join us in signing the protocols represents in my mind a \nmajor step forward in our drive towards 1996. I would hope that the \nparties would move quickly to sign the protocols, and pledge to respect \nthem pending each country's ratification process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15378-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S15379]]\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, it is with great respect and admiration \nthat I rise today to congratulate a friend, Montana businessman Ian \nDavidson. As company president and CEO of D.A. Davidson & Co. [DADCO], \na financial services company, Ian has ridden a wave of success in a \nfield where he has dared to be different. Recently, the Billings \nGazette honored Ian in a tribute to his tragedy and success. I would \nlike to do the same.\n  It has been almost a year since the D.A. Davidson corporate plane \ncrashed, killing three of the company's top executives. On November, 8, \n1994, Eugene Lewis, Robert Braggs, and Donald Knutson died along with \npilot Harold Graf in what Ian described as ``the worst tragedy of his \nlife.'' But the Great Falls based company has made great leaps in the \npast year. New leaders have been assigned to the vacated positions, and \ndespite the obvious grief experienced by the company and community, \n1995 has been a tremendous year for DADCO. In addition to adding \nbetween 65 and 70 new employees since the beginning of the year, DADCO \nboasts more than 100,000 accounts in the Northern Rockies and Pacific \nNorthwest.\n  Based on record earnings in the last 2 years and total capital of \nmore than $31.5 million, DADCO is ranked among the top 60 firms \noperating outside New York City. Recognition that solidifies its \ncorporate slogan--where ``Wall Street Meets the Rockies.''\n  Beyond this, while Ian would be the first to tell you that Montana \nhas been good to him, he has also been very good to Montana. He runs a \nbusiness that gives a lot back to our State and our Montana \ncommunities. Ian and his wife, Nancy, have been especially generous to \nthe University of Montana.\n  Again, I want to recognize Ian Davidson for his contribution to \nMontanas' communities. If we could all live our lives as fully and \nproductively as Ian Davidson, the world would be a better place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15379-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXTENSION OF TIME FOR MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, I came to the floor this morning to \noffer a resolution concerning the President's budget, and I have been \ninformed that my offering of this resolution and asking for its \nimmediate consideration would be objected to by the other side.\n  I will not offer the resolution. The resolution is actually very \nsimple. It goes to a very important item that is being discussed in the \ngeneral public and by the Members of Congress and the White House; that \nis, the President's budget and whether the President's budget comes \ninto balance, and whether we as a Congress should be adopting what the \nPresident wants to do in the area of the budget.\n  The President has been traveling around the country for several \nmonths now, talking about, waving around his balanced budget proposal, \nsaying he has a budget that will balance over 10 years.\n  Incredibly enough, the American public actually believes what the \nPresident is saying. I say ``incredibly enough,'' because the only \nperson who has said that the budget balances is the Director of his own \nOffice of Management and Budget, not any other independent agency, and \ncertainly not the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Nobody believes this budget is balanced. In fact, it does not come to \nbalance in 10 years or 20 years or 30 years. It never balances, except \nin his own interim shop. He has cooked the numbers, made all of these \nridiculous assumptions about how fast the economy will go and how low \ninterest rates will be and, all of a sudden wishes away all the budget \nproblems.\n  Yet he goes out there every day and talks about how he balances the \nbudget: ``It is just a matter of whether you want my balanced budget or \nthe Republicans' balanced budget,'' and the Republicans' balanced \nbudget is cruel and draconian and mean-spirited and all these sorts of \nthings, ``and mine is kinder and gentler and I really care about \npeople,'' and we can accomplish the same things.\n  The fact of the matter is he does not balance the budget. What I \nwanted to do was to present a resolution as a sense of the Senate that \nwe should adopt the President's budget his second budget.\n  You may recall his first budget was voted on here on the floor of the \nSenate. His first budget that he came out with back in February of last \nyear, which did not produce a balanced budget, he did not claim it \nproduced a balanced budget, and it was defeated 99 to 0 on the floor of \nthe Senate. He then went back and revised his budget to present his \nnew, improved, balanced budget over 10 years and has been running \naround since.\n\n  I think it is time for some truth here. Let us have a debate. Let us \nhave a debate on the President's budget. Let us examine what the \nPresident has done and whether he really does make the decisions that \nare necessary to bring this budget into balance over 10 years. Now we \nsay he was willing, yesterday, to accept 9, or 8, or even 7. We do not \nknow where he is at this time, but his budget says it balances in 10, \nso let us talk about it.\n  Unfortunately, there are Members on the other side who do not want to \ntalk about it, they do not want to debate the resolution, do not want \nto vote on the resolution, refused to give us an opportunity to bring \nit to a vote. I do not understand why. If they support their President \nand believe his budget is in balance, then why the fear of coming to \nthe Senate floor and having a good and open debate about what the \nPresident's budget does?\n  I am confident that there is someone on the other side of the aisle \nwho believes enough in the President's budget that they will be willing \nto take up the mantle and run with it and offer the President's budget. \nSo, what I will do is I will put this resolution over here on the desk. \nIf there is someone on the other side of the aisle who would like to \noffer the President's budget and begin a debate, here is the resolution \nthat will begin this debate. We can have a full and open debate on the \nPresident's budget. We can see whether it brings us into balance. We \ncan see what cuts he wants to make. We can see how he is going to \naccomplish it. Then we can look at what he wants to do and what the \nRepublicans are doing and see what the American public thinks.\n  That is the kind of dialog I think the American public would like to \nsee. They would like to see what the options are. And the Senator is \nright, you are hearing one side saying one thing, the other side saying \nthe other. Let us put them out here on the table. Let us see what the \nspecifics are with both. I will give someone on the other side of the \naisle the opportunity to do that.\n  If, for some reason, no one on the other side of the aisle picks up \nthat resolution and decides to offer it, next week I will find an \nappropriate vehicle and offer it as an amendment to a bill that is \ncoming through and have this discussion, because I think it is a \ndiscussion that needs to be opened up to the American public.\n  There is a lot of tomfoolery going on in this debate. There is a lot \nof misinformation being spread around in this debate. And there is no \nbetter place to straighten it out and talk about the facts than right \nhere on the Senate floor.\n  What are the facts as we know them? We have a letter from the \nCongressional Budget Office that says the President's budget does not \nbalance. It does not balance over 5 years, or 6 years, or 7 years, or \n10 years, or 20 years, or 50 years. It never comes into balance. What \nwe hope is the intent here, of this whole debate, is to balance \n\n[[Page S15380]]\nthe budget. The budget does not do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me congratulate my colleague from \nPennsylvania. I think it is appropriate, at this very, very historic \ntime--and I think we all understand the next 2, 3, 4, 5 weeks may be \nthe most important weeks that any of us ever serve in this body, or in \nthis Congress, and they may be some of the most important weeks for the \nfuture of this country--I think it is appropriate, and I think it is \nimportant we do have a full debate.\n  As the Senator from Pennsylvania so eloquently said, you cannot do \nthat, really, unless you view different options, unless both sides are \nwilling to debate the specific facts. Therefore, I think it is \nappropriate that the President's budget be literally on the table and \nthat we look at that and look at the assumptions in there and look to \nsee whether or not that budget does what the President says, and that \nis balance the budget.\n  There are those of us on this side who do not think it does. We think \nit is based upon assumptions that, frankly, are very optimistic and \nthat are not based upon reality and that the savings, so-called savings \nthat the President achieves he achieves in that manner, a changing of \nthe accounting rules, in a sense, or changing of the assumptions, at \nleast. So I think it is important we debate this.\n  We have, I believe, made some progress in this country in the tenor \nof the national debate. As I travel throughout my home State of Ohio--\nand, I imagine, my colleague from Pennsylvania finds the same thing in \nPennsylvania--we are seeing emerging a consensus about the problems \nthat exist and a consensus that this Congress finally has to do \nsomething about these problems.\n  There are three areas where I think really, today, there is a \nconsensus.\n  A balanced budget: The American people understand we cannot continue \nto do what we had been doing in the past. They understand that. So the \nreal question in this debate is, whose budget is realistic? Whose \nbudget will, in fact, bring about a balanced budget, as we believe ours \nwill, by the year 2002?\n  The second area where there clearly is a consensus is in regard to \nwelfare reform. We saw this on the floor a few weeks ago as we looked \nat the overwhelming vote. Over 80 Members of this body of 100 cast a \nvote in favor of the final welfare reform bill that passed. There is a \nconsensus in this country about welfare reform.\n  Medicare: A year ago, I do not think there was really an \nunderstanding about the problems that we have, that we face in regard \nto Medicare. Today, while there is a debate about what we should do \nabout Medicare, I do not think there is any longer a debate about the \nfact that something has to be done. The Medicare commissioners have \nsaid clearly that Medicare will, in fact, be bankrupt in a short period \nof time unless we take some very dramatic action.\n  So there is consensus on these three issues. As my colleague from \nPennsylvania says, it is important that we get the facts out and we \ndebate these facts on this floor.\n  Let me talk for a moment, in light of this, about the bill that is \ngoing to be coming in front of us. The American people may not have \nheard the term ``reconciliation.'' It is kind of a inside-the-beltway \nterm, but it is a term that is going to be used quite often in the next \nseveral weeks. This particular bill we are going to discuss is going to \nbe the vehicle for this Congress to bring about the changes I believe \npeople voted for last November. This legislation is bold, it is \nfarsighted, and it is absolutely necessary for America's future. \nFurthermore, it is based on sound data. It is based on facts. It is \nbased on good budget figures.\n  The American people decided last November they wanted a Congress that \nwas finally willing to put America back on track towards fiscal \nsolvency. I believe the American people are ready for this change. In \nfact, I believe the message of 1994, and frankly the message of 1992, \nwas that the American people were demanding this kind of change.\n  We cannot ignore the basic truth contained in the report of the \nbipartisan entitlement commission. That commission said, if we do not \nchange our present course, by the year 2012, every single penny in the \nFederal budget will be consumed by entitlements and interest on the \nnational debt.\n  Mr. President, I ask consent to speak for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If, in the year 2012, we want Government to have any \nmoney for discretionary spending--money to run the Army, Navy, Air \nForce, Marines, or the WIC program--it would then mean a tax increase, \nbecause there would not be any money left, no money left at all, if we \ncontinue to do what we have been doing.\n  In the days ahead, I intend to continue to talk about this issue, to \ntalk about the need for this reconciliation bill.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15380-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15380-S15383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BUDGET RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with interest to this morning's \ndiscussion. I would say to my friend from Pennsylvania, I do not \nsupport the budget plan the President sent to the Congress. I did not \nthink it was a good budget when he sent it back in February. I do not \nsupport it now.\n  But I would say the budget that is coming, the reconciliation bill \nthat is coming to the floor, is substantially worse than the proposal \nthe President offered, even though I do not support the proposal of the \nPresident. We could have a vote on a proposal here in the Senate that \ndoes make some sense, that does balance the budget in the right way, \nthat does not attack the Social Security trust funds. It can be done \nthe right way, but the proposals here we are debating, in my judgment, \nsteer this country in a direction that is not healthy.\n  The Senator from Nebraska a few minutes ago talked about the proposal \nthat says to a lot of working families we are going to increase your \ntaxes. And that is what this proposal will do.\n  Yesterday, the Treasury Department released an analysis indicating \nthat about 50 percent of the families will find increased taxes as a \nresult of this proposal. Then it says, if you are wealthy enough to get \nyour income from stocks and bonds, you will get a tax cut. It will be \nbeneficial to you. There is a beneficial approach for you. And the \nSenator from Nebraska says that is not what Members said they wanted.\n  Is it unusual for people to be skeptical when 97 percent of the \nmembers of a political party voted against the Medicare program saying, \nWe do not want it, we do not think it is necessary, we do not support \nit, and then they now later say, ``We are the ones that are going to \nsave it.'' And people are skeptical about that? I think they have a \nright to be skeptical.\n  That is what the debate is about, the priorities. I do not think we \nought to talk about a tax cut at this point this year. I think what we \nought to do is balance the budget, do it the right way, and then when \nwe have done that job figure out what we should do about the taxes. But \nsome people here want to take the popular things first, and say, Let us \nserve the dessert first; that is, wait and serve dinner.\n  I watched with some interest earlier this week people who have been \nin Congress for 30, 35, 25, or 20 years come to the floor of the \nChamber and cast their vote saying they would like to have term limits, \nand what is wrong with our country is that there are not term limits. \nSomebody who has been here for 30 years now votes for term limits, and \nsays the problem with America is we did not have a limit of 12 years on \ntheir term. What are they telling the American people--stop me before I \nrun again?\n  It is interesting to me that people say this is about changes and \nreform. In many respects, it is the business-as-usual crowd. Although \nthe priorities are changing, the way they see it, the rich have too \nlittle, the poor have too much, and we are going to change that \n\n[[Page S15381]]\nwith this reconciliation bill. We will take some from the poor and from \nmiddle-income working families and give some to the more affluent \nfamilies.\n  But aside from that, we will debate plenty of that in the coming \ndays. I want to point out to my colleagues that the day before \nyesterday the majority party came to the Chamber and said, We have from \nthe Congressional Budget Office now a letter, and it says in the year \n2002 with our plan we will have a budget surplus. They were very proud \nof that letter.\n  So I wrote a letter to the Congressional Budget Office, and said if \nyou compute this the way you are supposed to compute it --which is \nhonestly, and the law requires you cannot use the Social Security trust \nfund to compute that because those can only be used for Social \nSecurity--if you compute it without the Social Security trust fund, \nwhat do you have?\n  Yesterday I received a letter in return saying,\n\n       . . . including an estimated off-budget surplus of $180 \n     billion, which is the Social Security surpluses, the CBO \n     would project an on-budget deficit of $98 billion for the \n     year 2002.\n\n  So in 24 hours this proposal has a slight surplus. Then it has a $98 \nbillion deficit in the year 2002.\n  But the point is the only way you can claim the budget is in balance \nwith this kind of arithmetic is if you take money out of Social \nSecurity and use it. People say that has been going on for a long time. \nIf that is the case, it is business as usual. This is change? No. It is \nnot. This is business as usual.\n  I started in 1983 offering the first amendment in the Ways and Means \nCommittee saying if you are going to put in the trust fund money you \nintended to save for the Social Security System, do not raid it, do not \npollute it, do not take the money for any other purpose, but protect \nit, keep it out the of calculation of the operating budget deficit. I \nhappened to lose in that vote in 1983, and I have tried a number of \ntimes since. The Senator from South Carolina actually succeeded in \nputting it into the law.\n  That is why I said to the Congressional Budget Office that you cannot \nadd it up this way. If you add it up the right way, the Director of CBO \nsays what you get is in the year 2002 a $98 billion deficit. I am most \nanxious to hear people explain that to the American people.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I had a question for the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Does the Senator from North Dakota believe that the President's \nrevised budget balances the budget in 10 years? Does the Senator \nbelieve that? He is running around the country saying he has a balanced \nbudget that balances in 10 years.\n  Does the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No. But let me ask the Senator from Pennsylvania a \nquestion. Does he believe that what he is bringing to the floor of the \nSenate balances the budget in the year 2002 in light of what the \nDirector of CBO says she thinks, that we will have a $98 billion \ndeficit?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I happen to believe, as I think most Americans do, that \nthe Social Security program is a Federal program. Maybe some people do \nnot think it is. It is a Federal program, and it should be counted as a \nFederal program. We have the luxury--it is a luxury--over the next \nseveral years of having a surplus in the Social Security trust fund. \nBut, as the Senator from North Dakota knows, that luxury is a short-\nlived luxury. Those of us who are going to be working to balance the \nbudget, over the next several years and beyond, are going to have to \nstart working with a Social Security fund deficit shortly, in the not \ntoo distant future, in about 15 years. So we are going to have the \nluxury now. But we are going to have to face the music.\n  I think the important thing is to begin that over a long period of \ntime so that we can start dealing with those deficits. And I think it \nis important to look at the Government as a whole--look at all of the \nFederal Government programs.\n  The Senator from Nebraska just a few minutes ago was saying you \nshould do what he wants to do on Social Security, which is eventually \nprivatize Social Security and change it.\n  So there are a lot of things out there. We may have to deal with the \nSocial Security issue. But all I am suggesting is that I think it is \nabsolutely appropriate to use all Federal accounts, to look at it as a \nunified budget as it has been done in the past to see whether we \nbalance the budget. Remember, it is a surplus now, but it will not \nalways be a surplus. We will have to deal with this problem over the \nlong term.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder. The Senator, I think, understands that the \nSocial Security trust funds are trust funds. If the Senator says we \nhave a surplus now, he either assumes that there is going to be a \nsurplus in the trust funds and not used for the operating budget \ndeficit--in which case there is going to be $100 billion deficit in the \nyear 2002--or he is not going to have the money in the trust fund. \nEither one of the two is going to happen.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I may reclaim my time. As the Senator from North \nDakota knows, Social Security issues the notes, and the notes are paid \ninterest. And we are going to have to pay the interest back as we \ncontinually do now. We will have to continue to pay that back. If you \nwant to make the Social Security trust fund argument, you have to make \nthe highway trust fund argument, you have to make the aviation trust \nfund argument, and you have to make the unemployment trust fund \nargument. The Government is made up of a bunch of trust funds in many, \nmany respects. If you want to take them all out and say just because it \nis a trust fund it is not a Federal program, that just does not mesh \nwith how we run our Government. The Government is segregated in the \ntrust funds because we have certain taxes dedicated to those funds. \nThat does not mean they are not part of the Government. Of course, \nthese are part of the Government. If they were not, people would not \npay the Social Security taxes because they would not have to because \nthere would not be anybody there to enforce it. We are there to enforce \nit, to make sure that the IRS enforces the payment of those taxes. We \ncan talk to a lot of businesses who have not paid their taxes. They \nwill tell you that the IRS is in their pocket in 2 minutes making them \npay that.\n  If you want to say that somehow is not a Federal program, or the \nunemployment program is not a Federal program, or the highway trust \nfund or aviation trust fund is not a Federal program, that all of those \nshould be removed and we should balance the rest of the budget, that to \nme is a gimmick where you are trying to get around the whole issue. The \nreal issue is are we going to make the changes in law to get this \nbudget in the balance, not just for the next 7 years but into long-term \nwhen a lot of these funds are going to be running deficits? My feeling \nis that we have to make the tough decisions.\n  I am going to be proposing an amendment I think eventually, to offer \nit as the President's budget because the President does not make the \ntough choices. He does not even come close with surpluses, and all of \nthese are fudged. Without them you cannot achieve a balanced budget. \nYet, he runs around this country talking about his balanced budget. He \nhas this budget that is going to balance over 15 years. There is not \nanybody in the Congress, there is not anyone who has studied this issue \nin the country, who has looked at these numbers who believes they \nbalance. They do not. The only person that believes they balance is the \nPresident, and the only reason he believes it is because he wants to \nfool the American public into believing that he has some balanced \nbudget, that he is accomplishing the same thing we are when the fact is \nhe is not. And you have the Congressional Budget Office, which said \nback in June, after he introduced this second budget of his that came \ninto balance, that his budget will produce in the next 7 years the \nfollowing deficits: 196 in 1996, 212 in 1997, 199 billion--these are \nall billion-dollar deficits--a $199 billion deficit in 1998, $213 \nbillion in 1999, $220 billion in 2000, $215 billion in 2001, and $210 \nbillion in the year 2002.\n\n  That is the Congressional Budget Office. They are the folks we have \nto deal with in trying to get a certification of whether we balance the \nbudget or not. \n\n[[Page S15382]]\n Unfortunately, the President is running around using--I ask unanimous \nconsent for 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, might I ask to be followed \nby 5 minutes following the presentation by the Senator from \nPennsylvania, the same unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from North Dakota will be recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The point I am trying to make is the President in his \nfirst State of the Union Address to the Congress said that he would use \nthe Congressional Budget Office numbers because they were the most \nreliable numbers. Now, he said he was going to do it. He is not doing \nit, and if he did use it, those numbers would not balance.\n  We have an obligation to the American public to play straight with \nthem. The President is not playing straight. We are going to offer an \namendment that is going to show the President that nobody here believes \nhis numbers. Quit going around the country saying you have a balanced \nbudget when you do not.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of my \ncolleagues but because we are not able to have a discussion back and \nforth very easily--I hope one day we could put an hour aside jointly \ncontrolled and have a discussion to figure out where are the facts. I \nwould love to do that with my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, but because of this discussion I want to take a couple minutes \nto try to clarify this.\n  It is not, as my colleague from Pennsylvania says blithely, well, \nthis is all Government spending; it is a Government program, Government \nrevenue. Therefore, it must be counted this way or that way.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what happened. In 1983, it was determined \nthat we were going to have a problem with Social Security. Just after \nthe Second World War, when the war ended, a lot of folks came back to \nour country, and I am told that they were very affectionate, had very \nromantic notions about seeing their loved ones again, and over a period \nof some years, with deep affection, this country produced the largest \nbaby crop in the history of America: the war babies. And so when these, \nthe war babies, the largest crop of babies in American history, reach \nretirement rolls just after the turn of the century in 2010 and 2015, \nwe need to be prepared for that.\n  So in 1983 we prepared for it. We said we are going to build \nsurpluses in the Social Security trust funds. This year we will collect \n$70 billion more than we need to spend in Social Security. Why? Because \nwe like to do that? No, because we are saving for the future.\n  Now, if instead of the $70 billion that we collect this year above \nwhat we need to spend in Social Security, if instead of keeping it in \nthe trust fund, we say we will use it over here as general revenue to \nbalance the budget, have you saved it in the trust fund? Of course not. \nIt is a fraud.\n  No business in this country would do what you propose we do. None. I \nam going to take the employees' retirement funds and use them in my \noperating budget. No one would do that. And that is why I asked the \nCongressional Budget Office to tell me, if you do not use the Social \nSecurity trust funds, then what do you have? What you have is a budget \ndeficit of nearly $100 billion in the year 2002.\n  I am telling you this is business as usual. This is parading around \nand masquerading as doing something you are not. You are not balancing \nthe budget if you are misusing the Social Security trust funds. And do \nnot tell me they are ordinary funds. They are collected from every \nworker's paycheck in this country and they are labeled Social Security \ntaxes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The wage earners are told they are going to be put into a \ntrust fund, and they are told the trust fund is going to be used for \nonly one purpose. Now, when it is used instead for the purpose of \nbalancing the operating budget, that is misusing the trust fund. It is \nlooting Social Security. It is fundamentally dishonest. And it is \nbusiness as usual, regrettably.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator.\n  When the gas tax was enacted, did not the Congress and President, \nwhen they signed that, say that that money would be dedicated, every \npenny you pay at the pump for gas taxes is dedicated to the highway \ntrust fund, to be used only for construction of highways and other \npurposes within that act? Is that not what the law says?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No. In fact, the law has been changed to take part of \nthat and move it for other purposes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. There is 2.5 cents----\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator wants to win a debate we are not going to \nhave, I say good for you. I will give you a medal. But we are not going \nto have a debate about the gas tax fund.\n  My interest is in having a debate about the $70 billion this year in \nthe Social Security trust fund that we deliberately collect above what \nwe need to save for the future and the fact that they again will be \nmisused. That is the question. We could have a debate about trust funds \nfor others.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will continue to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Is there not a surplus in the highway trust fund?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Is that surplus being used to offset the deficit?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, by law.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Well, only a portion of it is by law. As the Senator \nknows, 2.5 cents----\n  Mr. DORGAN. A portion by law.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Is dedicated to deficit reduction. The vast majority of \nthat fund is dedicated for the purposes only of improving our highways \nand other things related to transportation. Yet, we use that surplus to \noffset the deficit.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Just like, as the Senator suggested, we use the surplus \nin Social Security to offset the deficit.\n  My question is, why are you not here with a resolution that also \ndeals with it, and why did not the other side when they debated the \nSocial Security issue take all the trust funds that were running \nsurpluses? But why just pick out Social Security, if you are really \nserious and you want to have fairness, not say----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me reclaim the time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It is too small.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is a good question. I happen to feel the same way \nabout trust funds. But you do not worry about a mouse in the corner \nwhen there is a gorilla at the door. The 500-pound gorilla on this \nissue is the hundreds of billions of dollars of surplus in the Social \nSecurity trust fund. That is what you want to get at because accessing \nthat money--to be precise, about $1.2 trillion of that money--allows \nyou to balance the budget, or claim you have balanced the budget. But \nit is dishonest. It is not balancing the budget.\n  The President did the same thing. I do not disagree with you to say, \ndid he do it? Yes. It is wrong. It has been wrong since 1983, and the \nquestion is, when are we going to stop?\n  When do you stop coming to the floor and parading around with \npocketfuls of money from the Social Security trust fund and claim you \nhave done something to balance the operating budget deficit?\n  June O'Neill, the head of the CBO that you all hired, now says if you \ndo not include those funds--and you should not--you do not have a \nbalanced budget in 2002. What you have is nearly a $100 billion \ndeficit.\n  Now, we have a legitimate disagreement about priorities. I do not \nthink we ought to have a tax cut. I do not think 50 percent of it ought \nto go to families over $100,000 in income. I do not think you have to \ntake $270 billion out of Medicare. I do not think we have to build B-2 \nbombers or Star Wars or ships, planes, and submarines the Defense \nDepartment did not order.\n  We have a difference in priorities about what we should invest in and \nspend money on. I do not believe you \n\n[[Page S15383]]\nought to kick 55,000 kids off Head Start.\n  But beyond those differences in priorities, nobody ought to disagree \nthat it is wrong to take trust fund money to the tune of $1.2 trillion \nand claim you have done something good for the American people. You \nhave weakened this country. You have cheated old folks out of a future \nthey delivered in Social Security trust funds, and I would hope one day \nwe will stop this business as usual and tell the American people what \nthis budget is about.\n  Is my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank you.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15380-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BALANCING THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise also to talk about the budget \nbecause I think the budget is what is on our minds now, and properly \nso. I rise because we have come to a defining time when we will decide. \nAnd I am very interested in the colloquy that has gone on here. I \ncongratulate my friend from Pennsylvania for raising this question \nabout the President's budget. This is what we ought to be considering.\n  Let me say to my friend from North Dakota that the gentleman is not \nfor a balanced budget in any time. We are not going to get a balanced \nbudget if we follow that pattern because there is none there. We are \nfollowing the pattern that has been followed.\n  Furthermore, I think it is unfair to say this money is being used. I \ndo not know of any trust fund of any kind or any annuity which the \nproceeds are not invested. In this case, they are invested in the U.S. \nsecurities. And the reason they are invested is because the law \nrequires that. They are not stuffed in the mattress somewhere. And from \nan accounting standpoint, they do belong to that trust fund. And the \nSenator knows that, of course.\n  But I want to talk a little bit about the President's budget.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Of course.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that the transaction of morning \nbusiness be extended to 11:15 a.m., under the previous terms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I certainly would not want to stop this exciting debate.\n  Anyway, we do need to talk about where we are going. Now, there has \nbeen a great deal of activity in the administration going about the \ncountry saying, ``We have a balanced budget. We balance the budget in \n10 years.'' And so that, then, in our minds is measured against the \nRepublican proposal to have a balanced budget and do so in 7 years.\n  But there is a substantial difference between the two. One is that \nthe Republican budget does indeed balance in 7 years, as certified by \nCBO. The President's budget, what he has talked about for a 10-year \nbalance, does not balance at the end of 10 years. So that is really the \nissue. And probably we will become involved in great detail about it.\n  But you really start with the question, Are we committed to the \nnotion that we need to balance the budget? We have not been committed \nfor 25 years to do that. As a matter of fact, we have heard this same \ndebate for 25 years, the same excuses for 25 years, the same idea that \nwe cannot do it for 25 years. In the meantime, the debt has increased \nto $5 trillion. In the meantime, the interest paid on that debt will \nbecome the largest single-line item in the budget, larger than defense.\n  So we do not really have now a choice. We can talk about the idea of \nSocial Security being off-budget. I happen to favor that. The fact is \nthat it is not. The fact is that it has not been. And the fact is that \nthe folks on that side of the aisle would not balance the budget if it \nis on, let alone if it is off. It would make it much more difficult.\n  The President promised a 5-year balanced budget as a candidate. That \ndid not happen. Instead, we had the largest tax increase in history in \nthe 1993 budget.\n  The original budget by the administration this year was brought to \nthe floor, defeated 99 to 0. So the administration sent down a new \nbudget. It uses OMB numbers, not CBO numbers which the President told \nus a year ago, 2 years ago, that these are the numbers we all ought to \nuse. We all ought to be on a level field. And I agree with that. CBO's \nare the numbers.\n  So the budget does not balance. There are a number of other problems. \nThe proposition backloads cuts. The cuts come in after the year 2000. \nEighty-five percent of the cuts come in in the next century. That is \nnot a very tough approach to budgeting. It leaves the tough work for \nlater, increases the deficit by 31 percent during this 10-year period. \nWell, the Republican budget eliminates it. It adds $2 trillion to the \ndebt.\n  So that is the comparison that we make. We really need to come down \nto dealing with the fundamental changes that have to be made and that, \nindeed, will be voted on in the next 2 or 3 weeks.\n  Protecting Medicare--we have to make some changes. There is a trust \nfund there. The trust fund will go broke in the year 2002. The trustees \nsay so. You have to make some changes if you want some different \nresults.\n  Reform welfare--we need to do that. We needed to do it for a very \nlong time. We have the opportunity to do it.\n  Balance the budget--perhaps the most important. We have an \nopportunity to do that. There is legitimate debate about how you do it, \nlegitimate debate about the cuts you make or the reductions you make in \ngrowth. But there is not really a legitimate debate about whether or \nnot you financially and morally are responsible to balance the budget \nof the United States.\n  The real question is, what kind of a Government do we pass on to our \nkids? What kind of a financial situation and Government do we hand on \nas the new century comes on us? And those are the decisions we will \nanswer in the next 2 weeks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15383-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15383-S15384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DEBATING THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to join in and congratulate my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania for bringing this issue to the floor today.\n  I just want to make a few statements in support of his effort, to put \nthe President's so-called balanced budget on the table for debate, \nbecause I think we do need a healthy debate on both sides of the issue.\n  I would like to read from what the President has had to say in the \nlast 2 weeks in his radio addresses, when he talks about continually \nmaintaining that he does have a balanced budget.\n  He said on October 7, ``I am deeply committed to balance the Federal \nbudget.'' A week earlier, on September 30, he said, ``I strongly \nbelieve we must balance the budget.'' He said, ``Let's be clear. Of \ncourse, we need to balance the budget.''\n  Well, of the three budgets that the President has put on the desk \nthis year, none actually balances, according to the CBO, even his 10-\nyear plan which he again touts as a balanced budget. It still leaves \n$200 billion-plus deficits as far as the eye can see. So the President \nreally does not have a balanced budget at all. But at least we would \nlike to have the opportunity to talk about it.\n  We would like to give the other side of the aisle an opportunity to \nput those figures on the table. Let us debate them. Let us talk about \nthem. Let us let the American people see the difference between the \nRepublican plan and the Democratic plan.\n  As you remember, back in 1993--this week the headlines have been \ntalking about the budget of 1993 again. In fact, the President has been \ncoming from both sides of the issue again, flip-flopping on whether he \nraised taxes too high. Yes, he did raise them too high. Did he make too \nmany cuts? No. It was the spendthrift Democrats, that he could not stop \ntheir spending. So he had to raise taxes in order to balance the \nbudget.\n  If you look back at that balanced budget in 1993, the President has \nsaid many times we did not get one Republican vote in favor of that \nbudget. And he is right, not one Republican voted for the President's \nbudget.\n\n[[Page S15384]]\n\n  But what did Republicans do? As a Member of the House in 1993, I \nintroduced a budget called Families First, which, by the way, now makes \nup much of what is in the Republican budget this year, including the \n$500 per child tax credit. And many of the others--Congressman John \nKasich of Ohio, now the Budget chairman in the House, also introduced a \nbudget plan in 1993. Congressman Jerry Solomon of New York, Republican, \nalso introduced a budget of his own in 1993.\n  So we had three definite Republican budgets on the table proposed and \nwere voted on. We got 178 votes on my alternative Families First \nbudget. So what we are saying is Republicans did not vote in 1993 for \nthe President's plan, but we did vote for a budget plan that we had \nproposed.\n  So what I would advocate here today, and my colleague from \nPennsylvania has talked about, let us put the Democratic or the \nPresident's plan on the table so we can have a healthy debate and at \nleast a comparison of the two plans. And then, hopefully, let us get a \nvote on it so the American people know where the numbers really lie and \nwhere they are.\n  I know we are talking a lot about, and we are going to hear a lot in \nthe debate, about the Social Security trust fund. This is a complicated \nissue. But the American people should know that the way the budget is \nset up, that all the funds from the Social Security trust fund has been \nused by past Democratic Congresses for the same purpose.\n  The President's proposed budget that he maintains balances uses every \ndime, the same as the Republicans' do at this time for the unified \nbudget. But what remains in the Social Security trust fund are IOU's. \nAs my colleague from Pennsylvania pointed out, we are going to have to \nrepay those IOU's in the very near future. That is going to mean new \ntax revenues in order to do it. That is the only way the Government can \npay it back.\n  So we do have a problem. We do have a luxury right now for the next \nfew years of maintaining a surplus. But it will be easier to address \nthis problem that we are going to be confronted with in Social Security \nif we stay on course and balance the budget by the year 2002.\n  So I just hope that over the next couple days, and probably yet \ntoday, we are going to get a chance to look more at what the \nPresident's plan is, what he advocates, and get a healthy dialog and \ndebate going on these budget issues so the American people do get a \nvery clear picture of what the President has proposed and what \nRepublicans propose, because this is going to be the most important \nissue, for not only this Congress, but for the Congresses to follow, \nfor our children and grandchildren, because what we cannot do, morally \nor financially, is to leave them our debts. We have to address this \nproblem with every ounce of energy that we have.\n  So I hope we get a healthy debate on these issues. I thank you, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I yield the floor. And I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, I want to get back to some of the points \nthat the Senator from North Dakota was making with respect to the \nPresident's budget. I think it is significant that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota said that the President's budget does not come into \nbalance in 10 years, as he is claiming it does all over the country. We \nshould use the congressional budget numbers. In fact, the Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle, shortly after the President introduced his \nbudget, said that the President should use Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers. They have been the most reliable. The President addressed a \njoint session of Congress on February 17, 1993. This was shortly after \nhe was sworn in, inaugurated as President of the United States. He \nsaid:\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office was normally more \n     conservative in what was going to happen and closer to right \n     than previous Presidents have been. I did this----\n\n  In other words, he agreed to use Congressional Budget Office numbers.\n\n     so that we can argue about priorities with the same set of \n     numbers. I did this so no one could say I was estimating my \n     way out of difficulty. In the last 12 years, because there \n     were differences over the revenue estimates, you and I know \n     that both parties were given greater elbow room for \n     irresponsibility. This is a tightening of the rein on the \n     Democrats as well as the Republicans. Let us argue about the \n     same set of numbers so that the American public will think we \n     are shooting straight with them.\n\n  The President wanted to shoot straight back in 1993. In 1995, he \nwants to shoot any way he can to hit the target of getting reelected. \nHe believes he needs to get reelected by campaigning that he has a \nbalanced budget when he knows darn well he does not have one. He has \ndone exactly what he said he would not do, which is ``estimating my way \nout of this difficulty.''\n  He has reestimated what the growth of this country will be over the \nnext 7 to 10 years and reestimated what the interest rates will be. You \nhave to understand that if you reestimate just a tenth or two-tenths of \n1 percent more growth, what does that mean? If you say that instead of \nhaving 2.5 percent growth, actually, we are going to have 2.6 or 2.7 \npercent, you might say that is close. Yes, it may be close, but it \nmeans hundreds of billions of dollars in differences to the Federal \nbudget deficit, because that additional growth means more people are \ngoing to be working and paying taxes, and less people are going to be \nreceiving Government benefits. Therefore, the deficit would be lower.\n  I think it would be easy for me to balance the budget in 1 year. All \nI have to do is say the economy is not going to grow at 2.5 percent, \nbut at 5 percent, interest rates will be at 2 percent, and I will have \nbalanced the budget. I would not have to cut a thing or raise taxes, \nand just by estimating things differently for the future, I could \nbalance the budget. The economy is a lot bigger than the Federal \nbudget. When this multitrillion-dollar economy grows by even a little \nbit more, it has a tremendous ripple effect on this little part of the \neconomy, which is the Federal Government.\n  So what we are seeing here is the President trying to involve himself \nin debate, to become relevant to this debate, and he is using numbers \nthat just do not add up. Now we are coming down to crunch time when we \nare going to bring up the budget reconciliation bill. We have a letter \nfrom the CBO that says it balances the budget. I want to make this \nclear, because people are saying that we have had Gramm-Rudman and all \nthese things that were going to balance the budget. We have never \npassed a piece of legislation that, within its confines, has changes in \nlaw that will result in a balanced budget, if we do nothing else.\n  We have passed budget rules that say, well, we have to do certain \nthings every year and cut programs in the future and reduce spending in \nthe future. And if we do not, we will have this mechanism in place to \nmake you do it. That is what we have passed in the past. We have had \nprocedures by which we are forced to make decisions to balance the \nbudget. That is not what we are doing here. We have those in place just \nin case the economy does not grow as fast or just in case interest \nrates are higher, but what we have in place, given the conservative \nassumptions of the Congressional Budget Office, is a plan that will, in \nfact, result in a balanced budget, if we do nothing else. We do not \nhave to make any more changes in law or raise any taxes or cut any \nprograms. We will have done it all in one bill.\n  It is fundamentally different than anything we have done here since \n1968, which I think was the last time we balanced the budget. We will \nhave balanced this budget and put in place a law that does it--not a \nprocedure that \n\n[[Page S15385]]\ndoes it, but changes in programs in Washington that balance the budget.\n  That is what the public has asked us to do. No more gimmicks, no more \nprocesses to do it. We have done it. We have made the tough decisions, \nand we have stepped up to the plate and taken a good swing at it.\n  Is it perfect? Absolutely not. Anyone who suggests that anything that \ncomes out of the House and Senate is perfect does not understand the \nHouse and Senate. It is a compromise. It is putting things together to \nget the number of votes that are necessary to move the ball forward.\n  Are there things I would like different? Absolutely. But we made the \ntough decisions. We brought a group of people, hopefully, I believe, \nthe majority of people, together to pass a budget and send it to the \nPresident.\n  What we want out of the President is simply honesty. If the President \nwants to claim he will be involved in this debate, then he better come \nup with a budget that is real and quit running around saying that the \nRepublicans are mean and Draconian and all these things. ``I want to \nbalance the budget.'' He cannot have it both--mean, Draconian, nasty \ncuts from the Republicans and say, ``I want to balance the budget, \ntoo,'' and not do it.\n  If you want to balance the budget, balance the budget, put forth a \nplan that does it. He has not done that.\n  I have in my desk, and some may remember these numbers, I had a chart \nhere that had a question about where the President was in balancing the \nbudget. The previous campaign, several on the other side of the aisle \nwere asking the question, where is George? Why is he not involved in \nsolving the problems of this country?\n  So I asked the same question. I put up, day after day after day, and \nthe President refused to come to the table and balance the budget. \nThose number are still adding up. He still has not done so. Well, he \nhas a chance. He has a chance. We are willing to sit down with the \nPresident and work through what it will take to pass a balanced budget. \nWe understand we cannot pass a balanced budget on our own. The \nPresident has to sign the budget. He has to sign the reconciliation \npackage.\n  We want him to do that. We are not going through this as a political \nexercise to get one-upmanship on the President. I can tell you, I am \nnot anxious to vote for changes in a lot of laws, many of which I \nsupport and do not necessarily want to see reductions in, just to see \nthe President veto it and nothing happen. It is not a particularly \nsatisfying thing to have happen. If you are going to make the tough \nvotes, at least you want to see it happen. You want to see the changes \nthat you put forward go into law.\n  No one over here wants to do this as a political exercise. We want to \ndo it because we want to see this country be saved for future \ngenerations. We want to see that person who is sitting out there now \nlistening, who is at home and does not have a job and cannot find a \njob, have a better chance to get a job because the economy will be \nbetter. Everyone--the President, Democrats, Republicans--knows if we \nbalance the budget, the economy will be better. Interest rates will be \nlower. Growth will be higher. More jobs will be created. We all know \nthat.\n  The people listening who think, how am I going to get this employment \nopportunity? What will happen to turn this economy around? This is \nprobably the most important thing we can do to turn that economy \naround.\n  This is not an esoteric debate about balancing the budget, but about \naffecting people's lives. This is the young child who may be sick from \nhigh school and sitting at home at night and maybe just surfing around \non the channels and happens to stop here--probably not long--stop here \nand listen for a few minutes. That is for that person who wonders \nwhether they will have a job when they get out of high school or \ncollege, whether they will have the opportunity to be able to raise a \nfamily and buy a home at a reasonable interest rate.\n  That is what this is all about. This is about real people and real \nlives. This is not just about balancing budgets and numbers and charts. \nIt is about real people, and giving them the opportunity that this \ncountry was founded on.\n  We have the chance to do that. That is what this is about. We need \nthe President. We need the President. This should not be about \npolitics. This should be about working together for the common good of \nthis country. We want to do that. We have put forward planned \nspecifics.\n  Want to talk specifics? I remember listening early in the year when \nthe budget resolution was out there and they said, ``You guys are \nthrowing these numbers out. You do not have specifics.''\n  Folks, the Senator from New Mexico will come down next week with a \nwhole bunch of specifics, tell you exactly how we get from A to Z, how \nwe balance. The specifics are there. Here is how it happens.\n  Want to make some changes? We can make some changes. We are not going \nto make a change on this. We are not going to make a change on \nbalancing this budget in 7 years. That is something we will not change. \nWe are committed to the American public to do that.\n  I implore the President to stop waving this budget around. I know it \nmay look good in the polls today. People may believe he has a balanced \nbudget, and I know his polls are saying that people now believe he has \na balanced budget. All he does is go around talking about it, and \nunfortunately, the American public sometimes believes the President \neven when he is not telling the truth. I think it undermines the \ncredibility of the office.\n  Tell the truth. Tell the truth. Want to balance the budget in 7 \nyears? The opportunity is here. You do not have to run around the \ncountry and campaign that you will balance the budget. Stay in \nWashington and you can sit down with the people who are working on this \nproblem and you can balance the budget. You do not have to go around \nand raise money all over the country for your next campaign and talk \nabout how you should not raise taxes and all these things.\n  You can come here and solve the problem. This is the time for work. \nThis is a time when this body, in a bipartisan fashion--I think the \nSenator from Nebraska talked earlier, Senator Kerrey. I do not question \nhis sincerity at all about trying to balance this budget. I think he is \none of the real statesmen when it comes to dealing with the problems of \nentitlement reform and changing the way the Government does business.\n  We differ on priorities, but I think he is one who is sincere about \nthe final objective. I think he knows the importance of that final \nobjective. I think he is someone who we can negotiate with and sit down \nwith.\n  But we need the President. We do not need politics. We do not need \nwaving around budgets that do not balance. It is not the time for \npolitics. You have a whole year, Mr. President, where you can campaign \nfor reelection. The time now is to get serious about doing the business \nof the country. You were elected President. It is time to serve the \nPresidency. It is time to serve your Presidency, not politics. Roll up \nyour sleeves. Come on down here, send your people down and we can get \ngoing. Quit playing games with the American public and trying to \nmanipulate the polls. You may win this November, but if you keep \nplaying that game, you will not win next November.\n  The country will not win, which is a heck of a lot more important \nthan either of those things. We should get down to business. We are \nopen. We are here. We are open for business. We are ready to go. All we \nneed is someone who is willing to step to the plate and make it happen.\n  Later today if we end up getting an agreement to have a bill before \nthe Senate today, I will put forward the President's budget and we will \nhave a debate. I want to make it very clear, as I think we are hearing \nfrom both sides, that this budget is not real. This budget does not do \nanything to balance the budget for the next 7, 10, 20, or 30 years.\n  Get that out of the way. Get the politics and the charades and the \nbroken promises out of the way. Deal with the facts. The fact is, Mr. \nPresident, if you want to balance the budget, get up here and do it. \nQuit running around the country campaigning on what you do not have, \nnot telling the truth to the public about your budget, and get up here \nwhere the action is, where history is being made, and make a \ndifference. \n\n[[Page S15386]]\nServe your Presidency, not your reelection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

Mr. President, we have heard much debate this morning, I \nthink healthy debate, about the budget that is working its way through \nthe House and through the Senate. I sit on the Budget Committee. This \nafternoon we were told by the Republicans that we will have our meeting \nwhere we will then act on the budget bill. As a matter of fact, we are \ngoing to meet in about an hour and a half.\n  I worked very late last night and I never got a copy of the budget. I \nstarted work very early this morning and I do not have a copy of the \nbudget. And the American people need to understand that this budget is \nnot just about numbers. It is about changing laws.\n  For example, in that budget, national standards for nursing homes are \nrepealed. Changes in the laws are made so it will cost students more \nfor college loans. Tax laws are being changed so the working poor will \nhave to pay more taxes. Indeed, 51 percent of the people of America \nwill pay more taxes because of this budget. And they all are on the \nmiddle-income to the poor level of our society. Champagne bottles are \nbeing chilled in penthouses all across the country--except in those \nwhere someone has a conscience. Because if somebody can explain to me \nwhy people who earn millions of dollars a year deserve a tax break, I \nam ready to listen, when we are trying to balance the budget.\n  The attack on elderly in our country is extraordinary. When I was \ngrowing up I learned some basic values. My parents said you have to \nwork hard, you have to play by the rules, you have to respect your \nelders and honor your children.\n  This Republican budget is a slam at every one of those values. We are \nattacking the working poor. We are raising taxes on people who work so \nhard to bring home $30,000 a year or less, and we are hurting those \npeople. Honor work? We are cutting $270 billion out of Medicare. We \nneed to cut $89 billion, we are told by the experts, to make it sound \nand whole. But the Republicans are cutting $270 billion out of Medicare \nand funneling it into the tax cut for the rich--the Republican funnel \nplan.\n  Medicaid--repealing nursing home standards so it is easier for \nnursing homes to make more money, folks. That is what it is about. Why \nelse would you do it? You do not have to be very old to remember the \ndays in the 1980's when the scandals erupted about nursing homes. We \nfound our senior citizens were being drugged, overdosed on drugs so \nthey could be controlled in the nursing homes. They were being scalded \nin hot baths. They were being sexually abused. They had bedsores. They \nwere lying in their own excrement.\n  Well, I made a pledge to my magnificent and beautiful mother, whom I \nlove, a few years ago who spent her last days in a nursing home after \nshe had spent down every penny she had, and all of her dignity, that I \nwould not let this budget go by without telling the American people the \ntruth, that the profits of the nursing homes will not be put over the \nwell-being of the elderly in our society, those who have given birth to \nus, those who have nurtured us, those who worked so hard so we could \nget an education. My mother never graduated from high school, and she \nsacrificed so both her children could go to college.\n  Is this what the American dream is about? Is this what family values \nis about? Well, maybe it is popular to vote for that budget. Maybe I am \nout of step. Maybe compassion is out of fashion. Maybe respecting your \nelders is out of fashion. Maybe believing in your children is out of \nfashion. But not for this Senator. Six million people voted to bring me \nhere, and I am going to stand up and I am going to fight. If it is \npopular, it is, and if it is not, it is not. That is OK, too.\n  The Republicans have put their budget on a fast track--no time. You \ntell me why we have to be on Friday afternoon waiting for the numbers \nwhen we could take this budget home over the weekend, examine it, and \nknow what the heck we are doing on Monday morning. I will tell you why, \nfolks. They want this budget to slip through with the least notice \npossible. They do not want the American people to understand it. And \nPresident Clinton is going to veto it. He is going to veto their \nbudget. He is going to say no to their budget. And he might do it in \nthe name of his mother, a nurse who healed the sick, a woman who died \nof breast cancer, who believed in the values of this society. He is \ngoing to veto this budget. This budget is not in any way including \nthose American values that we learned when we were growing up; to honor \nour elders, to believe in our children.\n  Do we have to do this to balance the budget? We do not. That is not \neven an argument. I voted for two balanced budgets in the Senate--one \nby Senator Bradley and one by Senator Conrad. As a matter of fact, they \ncut even deeper into the deficit than that which the Republicans have \nproduced. But they contained within them some values--family values, \nAmerican values, compassionate values, commonsense values.\n  So this is not about balancing the budget. We all want to balance the \nbudget. We all voted for various amendments that would do that. It is \nabout how do you get there and who gets rewarded and who gets hurt. I \nknow this is a cynical time in America. I know it is a cynical time. \nWhen a Republican stands up, they do not believe the Republican. When a \nDemocrat stands up, they do not believe the Democrat. Look at the \nnumbers. Read the law. That is why they are rushing these things \nthrough. They do not want you to see the numbers. They do not want you \nto read the law. They do not want you to know the nursing home \nstandards are repealed. They do not want you to know they are going to \ncharge people who are waiting for their child support a fee to collect \nthat child support. Imagine. A woman is desperate for her child \nsupport. They finally get it. They are going to make them pay a fee. \nFor what? To give $5,500 a year back to people who earn over $350,000 a \nyear. Have they no shame? Have they no values?\n  We have a funnel Medicare plan. It funnels the money from Medicare \nright to the hands of the rich. We have a Medicaid plan that I call the \nDr. Kavorkian plan. I am not doing it to scare people. I am do it doing \nit because it is the reality. I told you what these nursing homes \nlooked like before. And I will tell you, when faced with that choice, \nwhat would you do?\n  We put a lot of pressure on Newt Gingrich, and he finally changed the \nspousal impoverishment law that he tried to do away with. We are \nlooking at whether or not he really saved it. But can you believe they \nwere ready to do that, too? They were ready to say to an elderly man \nwho put his loving wife of 60 years into a nursing home that he could \nnot keep his house, he could not keep his car, and he could not keep \nhis $1,200 a month; the Government was going to go after it before his \nwife could get help in that nursing home. Family values? I do not think \nso.\n  So I am going to walk into that Budget Committee this afternoon, and \nI am going to talk about the values that I have as a daughter of an \nimmigrant mother who never went to high school but who is as smart as \nanyone in this Chamber. I am going to talk about the sadness I feel \nthat America is turning its back on who we are and what made us great \nas a nation. But I am also going to fight.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

So the bill is brought to the floor, \ncuts spending, changes the Tax Code, and it reconciles.\n   We have substantial differences in priorities and differences of \nopinion about what is important, and that represents the debate. Some \npeople get very upset because there is a debate going on. I think it is \na sign of health. That is what politics is. Politics is not a \npejorative term. It describes the process by which we make public \ndecisions.\n  I said before that John F. Kennedy used to say every mother hopes her \nchild grows up to be President, provided the child does not have to get \ninvolved in politics.\n  Of course, getting involved in politics is a method by which we make \ndecisions in America. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a noble, \nhonorable thing to do, and I happen to feel proud and privileged that I \nam a part of it in the Senate.\n  The Senator from California talked about her heritage, and I was \nthinking yesterday about this. I was on a radio call-in program and \nsomeone called who had read an account of my great grandmother settling \nin North Dakota. I had attended a Scandinavian event and someone in the \npress had done a story about how my grandmother came to North Dakota.\n  The story just in thumbnail sketch was that she, Caroline, and Otto \nmet and fell in love in Oslo, Norway, and got married as young \nNorwegians and then moved to the New World and settled in St. Paul, MN. \nAfter some time Otto died and Caroline, with her children--I believe it \nwas six children--moved to the prairies of North Dakota and pitched a \ntent and with her children built a house and homesteaded 160 acres of \nland.\n  Someone had read that account in a press story last week as a result \nof my attending a Scandinavian festival and they called the radio \nstation I was on and said is it not interesting, the story about your \ngrandmother, this gritty, courageous Norwegian woman who comes from \nNorway to the United States, and then her husband dies and she takes \nher children to go to North Dakota to homestead on the prairie--pitches \na tent, builds a house, raises a family, and homesteads 160 acres.\n  And she said, what do you think would have happened to your \ngrandmother had we had a welfare system back at the turn of the \ncentury? Would there not have been the incentive to do that?\n  I thought about the question. It was an interesting question. I said, \nwho do you think she got the land from? Who do you think created the \nHomestead Act? Who do you think passed a bill that said we are going to \nhave a Homestead Act to say to people if you go out and homestead on \nthe prairies and do the right things, we will give you 160 acres of \nland?\n  Yes, that is right, the Government. The Federal Government. Did it \nplay an instrumental role in my great grandmother's life? You better \nbelieve it did. The Government has played a constructive role in a lot \nof lives. We are the Government, all of us. Every citizen in America is \nthe Government. I know people want to just compartmentalize and say, \nboy, everything is awful, everything is evil, nothing works.\n  The fact is, from the Homestead Act to the GI bill, together, people \nworking together, people making the right choices and right decisions \nabout what is a priority for this country, have had an enormously \nimportant influence in the lives of people.\n  It is the Government, us together, we have built the education system \nin our country. We have something like 140 world class universities in \nthis world. Over 120 of them are stationed where? In the United States \nof America. Let me say that again. We have something like 140 world \nclass universities. Over 120 of them are located in our country. \nChance? Accident? No, it is people working together. A lot of them are \npublic institutions. People working together doing the right thing, \nsaying education is important. We not only have done it at the top \nlevel, building world class universities, the best in the world, judged \nby everyone, but where are people going to school? Are they rushing to \nIraq to go to college? I do not think so. No, people are coming to \nAmerica to attend some of the greatest universities in the world. We \nhave not only done it at the top, but we have done it at the bottom.\n  We created a Head Start Program, and we said to little kids 3, 4, 5 \nyears old, who were in trouble, living in circumstances of poverty, \nliving in dysfunctional families, we are going to give you a head \nstart. We are going to give you an opportunity. And we created a Head \nStart Program to give those little kids an opportunity. And guess what? \nIt works. It works really well. Everybody understands it works.\n  Now, the majority is saying that we cannot afford that. We are going \nto kick 55,000 kids off the Head Start Program. Every one of those kids \nhas a name, and they have in their hearts some hope that things are \ngoing to change in their lives. And Head Start has been helpful to \nthose kids--helped them to hold on to that hope.\n  It is a long way of getting to the point of saying this is all about \npriorities, this debate. It is not a debate, as the Senator from \nWyoming alleged a while ago, about people do not want to balance the \nbudget and people do. What a bunch of nonsense. That is not what the \ndebate is. Everybody in here believes we ought to balance the budget. \nThe question is not whether. The question is how.\n  I voted for a balanced budget in this Chamber. I voted for a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution for that matter. We had two \nversions, one that did not raid the Social Security System and one that \ndid. I voted for that one that did not. But in any event, this is not \nabout those who believe we should balance the budget and those who do \nnot. All of us want the same goal. We want to balance the budget. This \nis about priorities.\n  The priorities that have been chosen by some in this Chamber--and it \nis their business. They have a vote. They have a right to choose \npriorities--say this. When the defense bill came to the floor of the \nSenate, they said to us we are conservative, we are frugal, we are \npenny pinchers, but when it comes to defense we want to spend $7 \nbillion more than the Secretary of Defense asked for. The Secretary of \nDefense says we need a certain number of trucks. These folks say, I am \nsorry, you need a lot more than that. We insist on building you trucks \nyou did not ask for. Ships, we demand that you buy ships you say you do \nnot want. Jet airplanes, F-15's, F-16's, we will write them in. You did \nnot ask for them. Well, we are going to build them for you anyway. How \nabout the B-2 bomber? I supported 20 B-2 bombers. I supported 100 B-1 \nbombers. But now we are told by people who are conservative, penny \npinching, frugal Members of Congress, we want to build 20 more B-2 \nbombers at a cost of $20 billion. It does not matter the Secretary of \nDefense says he does not want them. We insist you take them. And the \nhood ornament on this excess is the star wars program. We insist on an \nastrodome over America, a new star wars program, and we demand, by the \nway, that we go out and put it in the field by 1999, accelerated \ndevelopment--$7 billion they want to stuff in the trousers of the \nPentagon that the Secretary of Defense did not ask for.\n  Again, is this frugal? Is this penny pinching? Is this conservative? \nI do not think so. I think that is reckless, wild-eyed spending. This \nis my judgment.\n\n[[Page S15388]]\n\n  The same people who say we want to build star wars, when it comes to \ntalking about star schools, say we are sorry; we do not have enough \nmoney. And 55,000 Head Start kids, we are sorry, you are out of luck. \nThe poor kid going to school, we say you are no longer entitled to a \nschool lunch in the middle of the day. We are going to remove the \nentitlement. Somebody might not want to give you lunch. As far as we \nare concerned, they do not have to.\n  In the whole series of priorities, including and especially the issue \nof Medicare and Medicaid, do we have to fix Medicare? Yes. There is no \ndebate about that. Is there a solvency problem? You bet. Do we try to \naddress it? Yes. But should we cut $270 billion from Medicare? I do not \nthink so. Some people say, what do you mean, cut? There is no cut in \nMedicare. Of course, there is a cut--$270 billion less than what is \nneeded to fund Medicare in the next 7 years.\n  Now, who do you think that is going to come out of? It is going to \ncome out of somebody. Rural hospitals maybe. Senior citizens are going \nto pay more and get less. That is exactly what is going to happen--pay \nhigher premiums and get less health care. Should we cut health care? \nShould we cut $270 billion? Of course not. Why are we doing that? Why \nthe proposal to cut $270 billion? Because some feel they erected a tent \nwith the center pole being a tax cut. The center pole of this new tent \nis a tax cut. And they insist on a tax cut. In order to pay for a tax \ncut, you are going to have to cut Medicare and Medicaid and those other \nthings with the depth that they are discussing.\n  Let us take the tax cut just for a moment. We are told that the tax \ncut is perfectly appropriate because those who propose it are proposing \nto balance the budget. Well, why then in their proposal do they add \nhundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars to the debt at the same \ntime they are talking about a tax cut?\n  Some of us happen to feel you ought to deserve less. You say, ``Set \nup the table. We will serve dessert first.'' Politically, I guess, it \nis very attractive. I would like to be one of those who say my \nexistence here is predicated on the ability to deliver a tax cut for \nthe people whom I represent. My guess is most of them would prefer much \nlower taxes. They would like a tax cut.\n  But they would also believe, I think, that, just as in a family \nbudget, you should deal with your spending problems first, balance your \nbudget first, and then deal with a tax cut. I think that is how they \nwould feel.\n  Now, with respect to this issue of priorities, I mentioned the other \nday I come from a town of 300 or 400 people. Actually, it was 400, but, \nlike most rural communities in small counties, it is shrinking. But let \nus take this town of 300 or 400 people and use that as an example of \nwhat we are doing here in this Chamber. Let us consider this budget, \nthe budget for my community.\n  Here is what we do. We get in the car, and we get all of our little \nenvelopes telling people what this is going to do to them, and we just \nstart driving around town. First, we come to the part of town where \npeople do not have it so good. The houses are not quite so big. Some \npeople are home because they cannot find work. Some people do not have \nmuch. They are hungry. But it is a part of town where there is not much \nin resources and people are struggling to make ends meet, working hard \nbut not gaining ground.\n  And we stop at their home and we say to them, ``Here is an envelope. \nThis tells you what our plan is for you. Our plan for you is we're \ngoing to cut back on the earned income tax credit. That means you will \npay higher taxes.'' In fact, all families with under $30,000 in income \nlargely will face higher taxes, or put another way, 50 percent of the \nAmerican taxpayers will end up with a slightly higher tax bill.\n  We also say to some of those people that ``Your child is now in Head \nStart, but we cannot afford to keep him or her there. We will have to \ntake your kid out of Head Start. Your grandma is on Medicare. Her \npremiums are going to be increased and she'll have managed care and she \nwon't have the choice of a doctor or hospital anymore. Your daughter \nwho is unemployed is now on Medicaid. We have a problem with Medicaid \nfunding.''\n  We go on down the list in terms of what the bad news is for those \nfamilies who are struggling and not making it very well.\n  But then we keep driving around this same town and when we stop at \nthe biggest houses in town, the folks who have the most money, the \nfolks who have the house on the hill, who have done very well, we say \nto them, ``Here is the envelope for you. Here is what this means. By \nthe way, this is awfully good news for you because you happen to get \nyour income from stocks and bonds. You have been enormously successful. \nAnd you are very wealthy. You get your money from stocks and bonds. So \nwe have decided that people who get their money from stocks and bonds, \nthey need a lower tax rate. So you are going to be blessed with a very \nsubstantial cut in your taxes.''\n  And then we say that when you add all of this up, we come out with a \nbalance. We have taken from those who do not have very much. We have \ngiven to those who have a lot. And then we have established essentially \na balance. But no one is told that in order to get to that point we \nhave taken all the trust funds out of a pension program that existed in \nthat town and brought them over to use them as revenues when we count \nwhether or not we have reached a balanced budget.\n  And that, in a nutshell, is the plan we have coming to the floor of \nthe Senate. Some of us feel there is a better way and a different way \nand a way with better priorities and choices for the future of this \ncountry to address these budget issues.\n  No one disagrees we should reach a balanced budget. And we ought to \nreach a balanced budget, by the way, without raiding the Social \nSecurity trust funds to do so.\n  I had a short discussion with my colleague from Pennsylvania today. I \nshowed my colleague from Pennsylvania the October 18 letter, which was \nWednesday's letter trumpeted on the floor of the Senate, which says \nthis reconciliation bill brought to the floor is going to have a \nbalanced budget, in fact, a slight surplus.\n  Then yesterday, at my request, the same person, the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office, wrote a letter that said, if you count \nthis the way the law requires you to count it--she does not say that, \nbut I asked her that--and do not use the Social Security trust funds, \nbecause they are not part of the budget and shall not be counted, what \nthen do you have? And the answer is, well, in the year 2002 you do not \nhave a balanced budget, you have a $98 billion deficit.\n  Mr. President, we will have a very substantial debate on all of these \nissues. I believe that we have to trim spending in many areas--\nMedicare, Medicaid, they will be trimmed some, the farm program, yes, \nsomewhat--but I do not believe that you take the most vulnerable \nAmericans and put them right smack in the bull's-eye and say, ``By the \nway, when all the dust is settled and all is said and done, you are \ngoing to pay up.'' And then we say to others, ``You have been so \nblessed in this country. By the way, when all the dust settles and all \nis said and done, guess what? You are going to be much better off \nbecause these sets of policies decide that you are more worthy than \nothers.''\n  I think there is a better way. And many of us will offer amendments \nnext week, amendments that will get us to a balanced budget, really get \nus to a balance where it is not misusing the Social Security trust \nfunds but really balancing the budget and doing it with different \npriorities. I do not want the message to be to family farmers, ``You \nare in trouble? Well, move to town. We could not care less.'' ``You are \npoor? Tough luck.'' ``You are poor and old? That is even tougher \nluck.''\n  I mean, I would like our sense of policies to be to say to people \nthat are important, little kids going to Head Start, ``You matter. Your \nlife matters to us. We care about you.'' We can make room in these \npriorities because we can shift some of that money, because we can buy \none less B-2 bomber and maybe not buy the fuel gauge or landing gear as \nspare parts for one B-2 bomber and pay for all of it for 55,000 \nchildren. Maybe that is the priority. Maybe we decide star wars is not \nthe priority. Maybe we accept the judgment of the military people and \nthe \n\n[[Page S15389]]\nSecretary of Defense, who says we should not do this.\n  We say, all right, that is $48 billion. So what could we do with $48 \nbillion? Maybe we reduce the deficit, first of all, or, if you insist \non spending it, did not want to do that, if it is not star wars, how \nabout star schools? How about deciding kids are as important as \nbombers? Those are the priorities that we will debate next week.\n  No one in this country should lament the fact that we are going to \nhave a debate. If we at the end of the day can maybe reach some \nunderstanding between all of us of what the right priorities are, what \nreally advances America's interests, which investments make life \nworthwhile for all Americans, what expands opportunities in our \ncountry, if we can develop better understandings of what achieves all \nof that, then our country is better served, in my judgment.\n  I am not someone who believes the Republicans are all wrong and we \nare all right. That is simply not the case. All of us have made \nmistakes in this country. This country is blessed with people who make \ngood decisions, Republicans and Democrats. And I hope at the end of \nthis reconciliation fight we can find a way to create more of a \nbipartisan approach to addressing some of the wrenching, real problems \nwe have.\n  I have often thought it would be useful, perhaps, for us to restrict \nourselves someday, and it would be useful, probably, for talk radio, \nfor example, to restrict themselves, maybe to have a day a month and \ntalk about what is right with America, what is right with our country. \nWould that not be hard for some people because there are so many who \nare only willing to talk about what is wrong. The fact is, most people \nare coming here, not leaving. Can you think of someplace you would \nrather live? I cannot. This country is the best place in the world to \nlive.\n  The question is, What is right with it? How do we build on what is \nright with it? I think it would be nice for talk radio and, I guess, \nthe U.S. Senate from time to time to set aside a period and say, this \nis a period where we are going to talk about what works and what makes \nit work and how we build on that. And, I mean, maybe someday we can get \nto that kind of discussion, which I would also like to have.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from North Dakota for his \nremarks. And I will pick up on his last point.\n  First of all, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that morning \nbusiness be extended for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15387-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15389-S15390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WHERE IS THE STANDARD OF FAIRNESS?\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate what the \nSenator from North Dakota said about our country. And I would say to my \ncolleague who is presiding, the Presiding Officer, that I have said \nprobably every week, when I go home, to someone that when I come to the \nfloor of the Senate I still get goose bumps. It is a real honor to \nserve in the U.S. Senate and for Minnesota. If you look at these \nbuildings here in Washington, DC, and you think about what they stand \nfor--my father was a Jewish immigrant who fled persecution in Russia. \nIt is a wonderful country, and we ought to emphasize the positive.\n  Mr. President, next week we will have debate--not hate, but rather a \ndebate. And I would like to lay out my framework just for really not \nmore than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I came to the floor of the Senate at the beginning of \nthis Congress, and I had a resolution. It was nothing more than a \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment that it was the sense of the Senate that \nwe would not take any action that could create more hunger or \nhomelessness among children. Actually, it was defeated twice. Then the \nthird time it was passed by a voice vote. I now regret that I accepted \na voice vote, because I think it was a symbolic vote, because if I look \nat this deficit reduction, the issue becomes deficit reduction based \nupon what standard? Is it deficit reduction based on the path of least \npolitical resistance? Are we asking some of the citizens to tighten \ntheir belts who cannot? And are we leaving a lot of special interests \nuntouched? I think we are.\n\n  I certainly will be active in the debate next week with amendments to \nforce some discussions on these issues, and I want to know where \nSenators stand.\n  We have something like $35 billion slated for cuts in nutrition \nprograms for children. Food stamps and the Women, Infants, and Children \nProgram, the WIC Program, is an incredibly important program, because \nif you were to ask me as a former teacher what is the most important \neducation program, I would say to make sure every woman who is \nexpecting a child--I just had a grandson, our third grandchild, a week \nago. That grandson, Joshua Paul, I think is going to have a good life. \nHe was born healthy, but my daughter, Marcia, had an adequate diet. She \nhad the resources to make sure she did.\n  My God, children at birth are not going to have the same chance if \ntheir mothers have not had a decent diet. We are cutting the Women, \nInfants, and Children Program.\n  The Food Stamp Program is not perfect; we ought to make it more \naccountable. The fact of the matter is, imperfections and all, we \ndramatically expanded the Food Stamp Program after the expose on hunger \nand malnutrition in America, and we did it in the early 1970's. We had \nsome national standards, and we implemented this program across the \ncountry. We do not have all the children anymore with distended \nbellies. We do not have the same amount of hunger and malnutrition, \nthough we still have too much. We are cutting into these programs.\n  When it came to the Pentagon budget, which was $7 billion more than \nthe Pentagon asked, when it came to the military contractors, when it \ncame to star wars or Stealth or Trident, we just gave the money away. \nThey have the clout. They are the heavy hitters, they have the \nlobbyists, and they did just fine. But the children in America did not, \nespecially poor children.\n  I just do not think there is a standard of fairness. I think there is \nconsensus that you have to pay off the interest on the debt. That is \nwhat this is all about. There is not a Senator here that could be proud \nof the building up of the debt in this country. The question becomes, \nwhen you make the cuts and you do the deficit reduction, where is the \nMinnesota standard of fairness? That is the question.\n  Mr. President, the Finance Committee met and came out with $245 \nbillion of tax cuts. But here is the interesting thing. If you have \nfamily incomes below $30,000 a year, which is about half the people in \nthis country, you have the earned-income tax credit taken away from you \nand you pay more. You are paying a tax all the way up to families \n$30,000 a year and under. But, by golly, if you are in the top 1 \npercent of this population with incomes over $350,000 a year, you get a \n$5,626 break. And if it is $200,000 a year, you get $3,416. This is a \nsubsidy in inverse relationship to need.\n  If you are at the top of the population income-wise, the top 1 \npercent, you get a huge tax break. If you make over $200,000 you do, \nand if you make over $100,000 you do. But if you make under $30,000 a \nyear, you do not get any break; you pay more. This is like a subsidy in \ninverse relationship to need. Same issue.\n  This is what I am going to zero in on next week: Why have the \nmilitary contractors got everything they wanted? Why do the children \nlose some of their nutritional programs? Who has the power in America? \nWho has power in the Congress? Special interests dominate.\n  Why does the top 1 percent of the population get a huge tax break and \nthe bottom 50 percent of the population get an additional tax? Who has \npower? Who has the lobbyists? Who are the special interests? Who is \nwell represented here? There is no Minnesota standard of fairness in \nthis plan.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I have two other issues to mention. One is \nstudent financial aid. It is not coming up enough. I was a teacher for \n20 years, and when we marked up the cuts in financial aid out of \ncommittee, I asked colleagues--and maybe they have done \n\n[[Page S15390]]\nthis--but I said to colleagues, ``Have you had any town meetings on \nyour campuses? Because the picture you seem to have of students is not \nthe same picture I get from holding community meetings back in my \nState''--Moorhead State, Inver Hills Community College, Minneapolis \nCommunity College, University of Minnesota at Duluth. Because what \nhappens to me is fully half the students, if not more, come up to me \nand they say, either publicly or someone who is not good at speaking in \na public meeting will come up afterwards and say, ``Senator, I'm a \nnontraditional student.'' That is the first sentence.\n  The next sentence, especially at the community colleges, is, ``I am \nolder than you''--they always like to say that--``and I lost my job. I \nam going back to school. I don't have the resources. Don't cut the \nfinancial aid. I am a single parent. I am the welfare mother you say \nyou want to go into workfare. Don't cut my financial aid. Senator, we \ncan't afford it.''\n  Or if it is the 18-to-22-year-old group--many of our undergraduates \nare going to school 6 years, not 4 years and they have two and three \nminimum wage jobs and we are cutting financial aid for students. And \nthen, Mr. President, there are the students who sell plasma to buy \ntextbooks to begin the semester.\n  What in the world are we doing ending the grace period on the \ninterest on loans 6 months after graduation? Why are we ending the \nparent plus loan program for moderate- and middle-income families? Why \nare we putting a tax on the institutions based on their loan portfolio? \nWhy do we not understand that 75 percent of the student financial aid \npackage are loans now, not grants? What in the world are we thinking?\n  The missing piece here is the impact on people. I have held these \ntown meetings on campuses. I do not know, maybe other Senators have \ngotten a different picture from students, but that is the picture I \nget.\n  So, again, $245 billion of tax cuts, but cuts in students financial \naid; $7 billion more than the Pentagon wants, but cuts in student \nfinancial aid.\n  Mr. President, I am not talking about Medicare and Medicaid and \nhealth care today, but I will tell you this, this is a rush to \nrecklessness and it will not work in my State of Minnesota. We have \ndone something of which I am proud. We have 300,000 children that \nreceive medical assistance. It is a safety net program. Is that going \nto be cut?\n  I meet with people from the developmental disabilities community, and \nI have people say to me--I remember a woman in another town meeting. \nAre we holding town meetings? Are we talking to people back in the \nStates that are going to be affected by this? She says to me--and this \nChair is a close friend of mine, I respect the Chair, the Senator from \nNew Hampshire--she says to me, ``Paul, the Americans With Disabilities \nAct is going to be a cruel lie for me if I don't have someone to help \nme get out of bed in the morning, a personal attendant. I can't go and \nown my own small business, and I do own my own small business. I am \nintelligent and I am smart and I live a life of dignity. Do you know \nwhat you are doing with cuts in medical assistance? Are you going to \nrestrict eligibility, less access to personal attendants? Are we going \nto have to be poor to be eligible for any of this? What are you doing? \nThat is the question. Don't be so reckless with our lives.''\n  I hear the same thing in rural Minnesota. I could go on and on, Mr. \nPresident. But the question I have, by way of summary, because I do not \nwant to dominate the floor today, is why, if we are going to do deficit \nreduction, not do it based on some standard of Minnesota fairness? Why \ndo we have a disproportionate number of cuts that affect the most \nvulnerable citizens in this country, the poor, namely women and \nchildren? Why are we cutting financial aid for higher education? Why \nare we cutting into health care and the quality of health care that is \ndelivered to people?\n  I am willing to argue this issue of quality later on for 20 hours \nplus in terms of what this is going to do for Medicare and medical \nassistance. But at the same time, Mr. President, you have the tax cuts \nthat mainly go to people on the top. You have more than the Pentagon \nasked for. And then, finally, and this is going to be the piece that I \nam looking most forward to in this debate, what about all of the \nsubsidies that go to the oil companies and the tobacco companies and \nthe pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies? What about \nall those loopholes in deductions and giveaways?\n  I will tell you something. I think what makes people more angry about \nthe political process in the Nation's Capital is the feeling that some \nof these special interests who are the heavy hitters and hire the \nlobbyists and are the big players and the big givers get their way.\n  This is a perfect example. I am going to come out here on the floor \nand I am going to say--and we are going to have votes on these \namendments--if you want to have deficit reduction, why do you not ask \nsome of these large corporations that get tax giveaways to tighten \ntheir belts? Should they not be a part of deficit reduction? You know \nwhat? Every time you do that, all sorts of colleagues think of a \nmillion reasons why we should continue to give them special tax breaks. \nMiddle-income people do not get these breaks; working people do not get \nthese breaks; low-income people do not get these breaks. But, oh, boy, \noil companies do, pharmaceutical companies do, gas companies do, coal \ncompanies do, tobacco companies do. They all get these breaks.\n  So I think the debate next week ought to be about, where is the \nstandard of fairness? Who is being well represented and who is not \nbeing well represented?\n  We will have a sharp debate, I say to my colleague from Georgia. It \nwill not be hate, it will be debate, because I believe all of us have \nmutual respect for one another. We feel strongly about what we are \ndoing, and I am sure we are all doing it in good faith. But I have a \nlot of indignation about the priorities of this deficit reduction plan. \nI believe it goes against the grain of the basic Minnesota standard of \nfairness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the period for morning \nbusiness be extended for another 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I think everybody would acknowledge \nthat we are entering a very historical moment in America's history, \ncertainly in the context of the Congress of the United States, because \nwe are, over the next 4 to 6 weeks, going to be making decisions--very \nsignificant decisions--about the way the American people are governed.\n  Of course, I always appreciate the remarks of my colleague from \nMinnesota. But it is almost as if he has forgotten that a new Congress \nwas sent here this past November, and with startling results. The \nCongress was not sent here by any large corporation. This new majority \nwas sent here by an overwhelming pronouncement by the American people--\nall these folks he is talking about, such as the workers, who said, \n``We want something different done in Washington,'' and families, \nsaying, ``We do not like what is happening in Washington.'' In \noverwhelming numbers, Americans went to the polls and said, ``We want \nthings in Washington to change.''\n  Every speech I hear from the other side of the aisle, including from \nthe President and the administration, is saying, ``Leave everything the \nway it is, it is just fine.'' Every time you try to change it, we come \nout with some new class of evil Americans who try to frighten America \nfrom the change that has to be made.\n  Let us talk about the President for a moment or two. When the \nPresident ran for President in 1992, he promised the American people, \n``I will give you a balanced budget in 5 years.'' Well, he has been \nhere for a little over 2 years now, and he has not given us a balanced \nbudget in 5 years, in 7 years, in 10 years, in no years. Why did he \nmake \n\n[[Page S15391]]\nthat promise? He made the promise because he knew that the American \npeople overwhelmingly are demanding that this city, this town, this \nCongress balance the budget. But once he got elected, he started \nlistening to speeches like we just heard. We will just keep everything \nthe same. No one will notice.\n  But the new Congress came here and said that we are going to balance \nthe budget in 7 years. I think, somewhat to their surprise, that is \nexactly what we are doing. What is more--and he knows this--it is \nexactly what the America people want us to do. They want us to balance \nthe budget.\n  Well, first, the President said he was not going to offer any budget \nat all after this new Congress got here. Then he went back out into the \ncountry and found out that the American people did not like that, so he \noffered a budget. That budget did not receive a single vote in the \nSenate--from our party or his. It was 99 to 0. No deal. It is not a \nbalanced budget, Mr. President.\n  So then he came and said, well, I am going to offer a budget that is \nbalanced in 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office, who the \nPresident says provide the most reliable numbers we can get, said, ``We \nare sorry, Mr. President, but your budget does not balance in 10 \nyears.'' In fact, it never balances. The President has been traveling \nthe country back and forth saying he is giving us a budget. ``Theirs is \n7, mine is 10.'' But that is just not so. His budget never balances. I \nknow this morning the Senator from Pennsylvania suggested that the \nother side of the aisle go ahead and introduce that budget if they \nbelieve so strongly in it. No one is willing to introduce the budget. \nWhy? Because they know it does not balance. It does not do what the \nPresident said.\n  And then, last week, he said, ``Well, maybe I will do one that is 9 \nyears or 8 years.'' So now we are on about the fifth or seventh \nreincarnation of the President's budget. It is not really that \ncomplicated. It either balances or it does not. The Congressional \nBudget Office can tell us. It has now told us that the Republican \nbudget will balance in 7 years, just like the American people are \nasking us to do.\n  I was fascinated listening to the Senator from Minnesota, because he \nwas talking about students and student loans. I wonder if the Senator \nis aware of the fact that if America--if their Congress--balances the \nbudget, what happens to students who have to borrow money. Let me tell \nyou what happens. A student that borrowed $11,000, or the family that \nhad to borrow $11,000 for that student, if we had balanced budgets, \nwould pay so much less interest for the loan that they would save \n$2,000 on the student loan in lower interest payments. If we balance \nour budgets, interest rates, according to DRI/McGraw, interest rates \nwill drop between 2 and 3 percent. That means that the American \nfamilies that the Senator from Minnesota is talking about will save \nbillions. Well, billions gets to be a number that is so big, it is kind \nof hard to bring down home. But let us say we are talking about an \nAmerican family that had a $75,000 home and mortgage. That family, \nbecause we balanced the budgets and because we had lower interest \nrates, would save between $1,500 and $1,700 every year. And here you \nhave an average family. The average family income in America is \n$40,000. The Government is already taking half of that money between \nFederal, State, and local, leaving them only half to deal with all \ntheir needs, and we can take an act up here that will lower their \ninterest payments on their home $1,500 to $2,000.\n  We have increased their disposable income by 10 percent--increased. \nThere is nothing we could do, there is no Government program, there is \nno new bureaucracy, no new system taking care of people from Washington \nthat will do so much good for the American family--the average family--\nthan lowering the financial burden on that family, which happens if you \nbalance the budget. It does not happen if you do not balance the \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, balancing the budget will do more for every American \nthan any Government program we can think of. We will save them $1,500 \non a home mortgage of $75,000. We will save them $900 in lower interest \nrates if they buy a car. We will save them $2,000 in lower interest \nrates if they are borrowing money to send students to school.\n  The American family knows this. That is why 70 to 80 percent of them \nhave been banging on the door of this town saying, ``For Heaven's \nsakes, get your spending under control. Quit taxing us to death. Quit \nspending money you do not have. Quit spending the future opportunity of \nour children.''\n  Balancing the budget will produce a rainbow and a nest egg in the \nchecking account of every average family in America. Make no mistake \nabout it. The great burden of running this Government falls on the \naverage American family--not on the rich. You could take all the money \nthe rich produce and you could not run this Government.\n  In the end, it is the average American that bears the burden--not the \npoor. It is the average American. The greatest good that we can do for \nthat family is to balance our budget.\n  Now, Mr. President, several days ago the President admitted--which I \nwas shocked about, but he did--the President said in speaking to a \nfundraising audience, ``I will surprise you, because I think I raised \ntaxes too high in 1993.'' That is a pretty big mistake, Mr. President.\n  We raised taxes at a historical level--$250 billion-some-odd in new \ntaxes--the highest in American history, and now the President says \nmaybe that was a mistake. Not maybe it was a mistake, it was a mistake.\n  Why did he raise taxes? So that the Federal Government could spend \nmore so that our deficits would continue to increase, so that interest \nrates are higher on every family, and they are paying thousands upon \nthousands of dollars because we do not have a balanced budget.\n  The President has now said that tax increase was a mistake. We agree \nwith him. What we are saying is we are going to help the President fix \nthat mistake. We are going to lower the economic burden on the American \nfamily.\n  He raised taxes $255 billion. We are going to lower it $245 billion. \nA lot of people try to connect that to the Medicare argument, which is \na totally separate thing. The real connection here is between the \nPresident's tax increase of 1993 and the Republican tax refund of 1995. \nHe raised them $255 billion and we are going to lower it $245 billion.\n  He said it was a mistake. It was. It has affected the economic \nstability of every middle-class family. Now we are going to lower it. \nWe are going to help those very American families by lowering the \neconomic pressure on them and relieving them from the pressure that he \nexacted in 1993.\n  We are going to balance the budget. We are going to lower interest \nrates in every American home. We are going to, therefore, expand the \neconomy and therefore people are going to have shorter lines waiting to \nget a job. We are going to put hundreds of thousands of Americans to \nwork because we balanced this budget.\n  Mr. President, we are going to reform welfare. Every American knows \nit needs to be done. Mr. President, we are going to secure Medicare for \na quarter of a century. The trustees said it will go bankrupt in 6 \nyears, but we are going to change that and strengthen it and keep it \nhealthy for 25 years, according to the CBO yesterday. We are going to \nlower the economic burden and pressure on the American family by \nlowering taxes.\n  Every one of those things that we are talking about, every one of \nthem, the American people want to have happen. Mr. President, it is \ntime the Congress did what the American people wanted up here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak not \nto exceed 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As in morning business?\n  Mr. BYRD. It does not matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I did not mean to give the Chair a short answer. I thought \nmy request covered the situation very well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15390-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15391-S15393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNITY ON BOSNIA POLICY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there has been substantial movement toward a \npeace agreement among the warring factions in Bosnia, and the President \ndeserves great credit for exercising strong leadership for moving this \nprocess forward in the last 2 months. The \n\n[[Page S15392]]\nconflict has gone on too long, and the horrendous spectacle of ethnic \ncleansing and prolonged, widespread inhumanity in the Balkans offends \nand disgusts all civilized society. It is clear that our European \npartners in NATO have been unable to bring the fighting to a halt and \nwill be unable, Mr. President, to bring a lasting peace in the Balkans \nwithout strong American leadership. One might well argue that it is a \nEuropean problem--and it is--and the European nations should be able to \nachieve a peaceful settlement without us--and they should. That would \nbe what I think most people would like to see. But that has \ndemonstrably not been the case over the last 2-3 years of carnage in \nBosnia. Therefore, the President has taken a strong role in leading our \nallies to bring the parties to the peace table. A peace agreement has \nnot yet been reached, but negotiations, so-called ``proximity talks,'' \nwill begin at the end of this month of October, in Dayton, Ohio.\n  Mr. President, Administration officials have testified that the \nUnited States should participate in any NATO operation which would \nimplement an accord that is reached among the warring parties. The \nSecretaries of Defense and State, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, have all testified that the operation would be a NATO \noperation, and that there would be no so-called ``dual key'' command \nand control structure which includes a decision-making role by the \nUnited Nations. Those command and control arrangements were an abject \nfailure in the U.N. operation in Bosnia over the last several years. \nThe United Nations has tried valiantly to play a peaceful role in \nBosnia, but it is clear that up to now there has been no peace to keep \nand that the ferocity and hatreds which have consumed the Bosnian \nfactions have overwhelmed the ability of the United Nations to operate \nin a peace-enforcing role there. Therefore, it is appropriate that NATO \nassume any peacekeeping responsibility, since only the clear promise of \noverwhelming and swift retaliation against any group or individual that \nviolates a peace accord is necessary for such an accord to work in the \nenvironment of the Balkans.\n\n  Mr. President, the question has arisen as to what role the Congress \nwill play in determining the policy and possible deployment of American \nforces to the Balkans in connection with a peace treaty. There is \nsubstantial risk of casualties there, in spite of the fact that the \npurpose of any NATO force would be to police and implement an agreement \namong the parties. Cease fires in the Balkans have been routinely \nentered into and they have been just as routinely violated. The parties \nto the conflict cannot resist, it seems--cannot resist the temptation \nto take advantage of temporary weaknesses of their opponents to gain \nmore territory or to commit more atrocities. Furthermore, the terrain \nis treacherous, made more so by the harshness of winter weather, which \nis the likely season that this accord will be reached, and, hopefully, \nsuch an accord will be reached.\n  I believe that any President, Democrat or Republican, is on dubious \nconstitutional ground in deploying forces to be at risk abroad without \nthe positive action in support thereof, by the Congress.\n  We could debate this all we want to debate it. I know we say, on the \none hand, any President does not need Congress' approval. On the other \nhand, there are those who say he needs congressional approval. And \nthere are arguments to be made on both sides. But I think of the wild \nanimals in the forest, the lion, the tiger, the elephant--the wild \nanimals in the forest. At some point or another they have to come to \nthe waterhole. There is a big waterhole in that forest. Some may have \nto come sooner than others. But eventually they all have to come to the \nwaterhole.\n  Well, the power of the purse is the waterhole in the constitutional \nprocess. The appropriation of money is the waterhole. So we can argue \nall we want, until we are blue in the face. But in the final analysis, \nunless that appropriation is there, unless the funds are provided, the \nuse of military forces would automatically have to be cut off, you see. \nSo that is the waterhole. We can argue all we want, but that power of \nthe purse is the most effective power in the whole constitutional \nsystem--the power of the purse. That is why I have stood on my feet \nmany, many times in the Senate and argued against shifting that power \nof the purse to the executive branch.\n  Well, I will not go further into that at this point. But we should \nall keep in mind the waterhole. All government agencies have to come \ndown to the waterhole, sooner or later.\n  Well, only the Congress can fund such operations, and Congress has \nthe sole responsibility, under the Constitution, to raise and maintain \nland and naval forces. But, aside from this constitutional requirement, \nfrom a commonsense political perspective, I think that any President is \nwell advised to gain the prior support of the Congress, and therefore \nthe American people, before committing forces that risk casualties, \nwhich will result in the expenditure of substantial sums of money, and \nwhich might be employed over a period of rather extended duration. \nRegardless of the differences between this proposed operation and the \nAmerican deployment in 1990 to the Middle East to counter the \naggression of Iraq against Kuwait, the risks, the costs, and the \nduration of peace implementation in Bosnia argue for the same need--the \nsame need--for the President to solicit and gain the support of the \nCongress before going forward. As I wrote to the President on October \n13th, I believe he should welcome the opportunity to rally the Nation \nbehind him and ask for the approval of Congress for this proposed \nmission. As I stated in that letter, ``while this effort, of course, \nrisks rejection, a sure political foundation seems essential to carry \nit over the shoals and storms of difficulties which could possibly \nconfront our forces during an extended period of American military \ninvolvement.'' In my letter to President Clinton, I encouraged him to \nseek Congressional support and endorsement of any deployment of U.S. \nforces to the Balkans which might be required to enforce a peace \nagreement.\n   I am pleased to report to my colleagues that the President has \nresponded to my inquiry, and he has responded in a most positive way. \nHe wrote a letter to me, dated October 19, 1995, in which he says that \nhe ``would welcome, encourage, and, at the appropriate time, request an \nexpression of support by Congress promptly after a peace agreement is \nreached.''\n  Promptly after a peace agreement is reached. Let me say that again. \nHe states that he ``would welcome, encourage, and, at the appropriate \ntime, request an expression of support by Congress promptly after a \npeace agreement is reached. Such an expression of support would be in \nthe national interest.'' Mr. President, I congratulate and commend \nPresident Clinton for taking this position. It will require a debate \nover the detailed plans adopted by the President to lead a NATO \ndeployment, if and when an acceptable peace treaty is reached among the \nparties.\n  I emphasize the preliminary nature of these assurances. Delicate \nnegotiations are underway among the parties, with the strong \nintermediary role played by this Administration and others in the \nEuropean region. We in this body, in what we do and say, need to be \ncognizant of the delicacy of this process. It would be unfortunate if \nCongressional action at this time made that process more difficult. It \nwould be most unfortunate if the peace process were to be derailed by \npremature action here as to what we would or would not do or should or \nshould not do in the event of an agreement. Let us wait and see what \nthe Administration can accomplish with the parties in the upcoming \nnegotiations.\n  Given the preliminary nature of this process, I certainly cannot say \ntoday what my position will be on an American deployment. The President \nwill have to make a clear case and a strong case, and a convincing case \nfor it, if he desires to employ American forces on the ground in \nBosnia. There will be a debate. There will be a thorough examination \nand understanding as to what the American national interests are in \nthat event. I, personally, will approach such a request for \nCongressional support with an open mind.\n  The President goes on in his letter to me to say that ``our foreign \npolicy works best when we are united in purpose . . . I intend to work \nwith the Congress to make this happen.'' Mr. President, there will need \nto be a very \n\n[[Page S15393]]\ndetailed understanding of the risks, duration, the nature of forces to \nbe deployed, the command and control arrangements, the funding, and \nmany other aspects of the ingredients of the participation of our \nforces in implementing any of these treaties involved. There \nundoubtedly will be a major debate, as occurred in the Senate before \nPresident Bush deployed forces in combat against Iraq. Now is not the \ntime for that debate, or for second guessing. Let us let history take \nits course, certain that the President will, as he has promised, \nrequest Congressional support, endorsement, and participation when the \ndetails of an accord are reached and when the allies have determined \nwhether and how NATO should implement it.\n  Mr. President, the President's letter is short. I shall read it into \nthe Record.\n\n       Dear Robert: Thank you for letter regarding whether or not \n     I will seek Congressional authorization prior to committing \n     United States troops to a NATO implementation force in \n     Bosnia. I welcome the opportunity to set forth my position.\n       While maintaining the constitutional authorities of the \n     Presidency, I would welcome, encourage and, at the \n     appropriate time, request an expression of support by \n     Congress promptly after a peace agreement is reached.\n\n  So, Mr. President, what could be more clear as to the President's \nintention?\n\n       Such an expression of support would be in the national \n     interest. I believe, however, action at this time is \n     premature pending the proximity peace talks to be held in \n     Dayton, Ohio at the end of this month. I hope as the peace \n     talks commence we can continue the process begun in \n     Congressional hearings to brief and consult with Congress so \n     that we secure the widest support possible for peace.\n\n  Those hearings have begun. They began in the Armed Services Committee \njust a few days ago, and the able Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. \nSmith], who is presently presiding over the Senate with a degree of \ndignity and grace and skill that is ``so rare as a day in June,'' was \npresent at the hearing, as I was, when we heard testimony.\n\n       As you know, our foreign policy works best when we are \n     united in purpose. We have an historic opportunity in Bosnia \n     to change the course of events, to prevent the spread of the \n     conflict and to end the human suffering that has plagued the \n     people of the region for so long. I intend to work with \n     Congress to make this happen.\n       Thank you again for your words of support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nnot only the President's letter but also my letter addressed to him, \nand to which I have alluded earlier in my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 13, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: Press reports today quote Secretary \n     of Defense William Perry as stating that your Administration \n     will not seek Congressional authorization prior to committing \n     United States troops to a NATO peacekeeping operation in \n     Bosnia, although such authorization would be ``welcome.'' If \n     the reports are accurate, I urge you to reconsider this \n     decision and actively seek prior authorization for this \n     mission.\n       Given the gravity, risks, and costs associated with an \n     extended peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, I think it would \n     be wise to have the support of the American people and \n     Congress behind you. I believe the Congressional majority \n     should share full responsibility, from the outset, for any \n     decision to accept the costs and risks of this proposed \n     operation. As you know, President Bush sought and received \n     the support of Congress and the American people for Operation \n     Desert Storm in Iraq. That support would have been invaluable \n     to him had the initial casualty predictions been realized, or \n     if international contributions had not reimbursed U.S. costs \n     associated with the mission.\n       Without outlining the risks and benefits of U.S. \n     involvement in Bosnia and gaining the consent and cooperation \n     of Congress in advance, it may well be difficult, if not \n     impossible, to sustain or to pay for such involvement, \n     particularly if factional fighting recurs. Secretary Perry \n     was also quoted in the press as saying that it is ``not only \n     a possibility, but likely'' that paramilitary groups would \n     target U.S. forces in Bosnia.\n       I believe you should welcome the opportunity to use your \n     considerable persuasive skills to rally the nation behind \n     you, and that you should ask for the approval of Congress for \n     this proposed mission before it commences. While this effort, \n     of course, risks rejection, a sure political foundation seems \n     essential to carry it over the shoals and storms of \n     difficulties which could possibly confront our forces during \n     an extended period of American military involvement. It \n     should also serve as a signal to those who might consider \n     testing our staying power that a strong measure of bipartisan \n     and popular support underpins it.\n       As always, I appreciate your thoughtful consideration of my \n     views on matters of this importance to our nation and your \n     Presidency.\n       With kind regards, I am.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Robert C. Byrd.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 19, 1995.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I first want to congratulate the Senator \nfrom West Virginia on his fine remarks relative to the issue of Bosnia. \nIt is not my purpose to rise on that issue but I would make a comment \nthat I think it is good that the President is willing to come to the \nCongress for prior authorization, as the Senate is familiar with the \nsense of the Senate which passed last week which I offered requesting \nthe President to come to the Congress for prior approval.\n  I also suggest, however, that, if we wait until the agreement is \nreached on a peace accommodation or a peace accord, we may well be past \nthe time when the Congress can take action effectively; that there has \nbeen discussion of the fact that we would have a very short time after \na peace agreement has been reached to expect troops to be introduced \ninto the region; in fact, 96 to 100 hours has been the discussion. \nObviously, that would give a very short window for the Congress to \nexpress its views on whether or not we should be putting American \nsoldiers at risk on the ground in Bosnia.\n  So I hope that we can take up this subject more substantively before \na peace agreement is reached, if it is reached.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15391-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15393-S15394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with the remarks \nmade earlier in the day by the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSantorum, who was addressing the fact that we have heard a great deal \nfrom the administration on the issue of their budget, and whether or \nnot they have a budget which reaches a balanced budget.\n  As we all know, we on the Republican side of the aisle have produced \na budget that reaches a balance, is scored by CBO as reaching balance \nover the next 7 years, and is the first budget to do so in the last 25 \nyears. It is a budget that does this by reforming--and, I think, \nsignificantly improving--many of the functions of Government. We end \nfor, example, welfare as an entitlement, and say to people in this \ncountry who seek to receive the support of the Government through \nwelfare payments that they are expected to work after a certain amount \nof time on welfare, and they will only have the right to be on welfare \nfor a period of up to 5 years throughout their lifetime.\n  It also addresses the issue of Medicaid by returning the authority \nfor managing Medicaid with the dollars to the States, a major step \nforward in my \n\n[[Page S15394]]\nopinion. For example, in the State of New Hampshire I know that we will \nbe able to deliver better health care to our indigent, to our people \nwho are in need of health care who qualify for Medicaid, and to the \ndisabled, especially young mothers with children, mothers with young \nchildren, and our young men also, in a much more efficient and \neffective way with probably more dollars in those programs by having \nthe State manage that program at the State level and not having it be a \nFederal program.\n  We have in our budget reform improved significantly and strengthened \nthe Medicare Program. In fact, we have taken the Medicare Program--\nwhich is on the brink of bankruptcy, according to the Medicare trustees \nheaded in that direction, and will be there by the year 2002, and will \nbegin next year to spend more money than it takes in, and thus starts \nthis death spiral toward bankruptcy--taking that program, reform it, \nstrengthen it, and will be giving our seniors dramatic new choices \nwhich they do not have today for alternative forms of health care \ndelivery while retaining their right, preserving their right, to \ncontinue in their pre-Medicare delivery system, if they wish it, with \ntheir present doctors.\n  That Medicare reform and strengthening is done in I think a way that \nis fairly consistent with what is happening in the private sector. It \nis using the marketplace, saying to the senior citizens of this \ncountry, ``Listen, you should have the same choices those of us in \nCongress have. You should not be limited in your ability to choose \nother types of health care.''\n  So we have put forward plans which I believe are very aggressive, \nvery effective, and very positive in reforming Government, in \ndownsizing the rate of growth of the Federal Government, and in \ndelivering a balanced budget.\n  Why have we done this? Republicans recognize that, if you do not do \nsomething about the problems of this country in the area of the \ndeficit, we are going to be driving this country into bankruptcy.\n  This chart reflects that fact. The red lines represent entitlement \nspending; the blue lines discretionary spending; and, the yellow line \nis interest on the Federal debt. You will note that the green line \nrepresents the revenues of the Federal Government. You will see from \nthis chart that, if we continue on our present path with the present \nrate of growth as a Government, beginning in the year 2010 we will only \nhave enough money as a Government to pay for interest on the Federal \ndebt and entitlement spending. That means all spending such as defense \nspending, spending on education, and spending on the environment, we \nwill not be able to afford.\n  Beginning in about the year 2017, we will only have enough money to \npay for the entitlement spending of the Federal Government, which means \nwe will not be able to pay interest on the Federal debt.\n  What does that mean? That means we end up like Mexico was about a \nyear and a half ago. We will be insolvent as a nation. We will have \npassed on to our children a country that is essentially bankrupt. It is \nnot fair, not right, not appropriate, and it is not something this \nCongress is going to allow happen. That is why, as Republicans, we came \nforward with this rather dramatic idea of balancing the budget, and we \ndelivered on it. We have produced a budget that is in balance.\n  However, the issue is, has the President done the same thing? Has he \nbeen a substantive player in this process? Has he contributed to it? \nThat is the issue raised earlier today by the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwhen he suggested a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which would \nbasically allow the other side, if they felt confident in the \nPresident's numbers, to put forward the President's budget and say, all \nright, we stand by the President's budget as an approach to balancing \nthe budget.\n  I have not heard anyone from the other side of the aisle take up the \nSenator from Pennsylvania on that issue, and I do not expect we will \nbecause, as a practical matter, the President has not come forward with \nanything that reflects any type of a balanced budget.\n  CBO, which is the fair arbiter of scoring in this institution, and \nwhich the President designated as the fair arbiter of scoring at the \nbeginning of his term in office in his first address to the joint \nsession of the Congress, has calculated that the President's budget as \nsent up in February was out of balance by at least $200 billion per \nyear as far as the eye could see, adding $1 trillion of new debt to the \nbacks of our children over the next 7 years, and that his most recent \nsubmission, which was not sent up in budget form but was sent up \nbasically in outline form, is also entirely out of balance and does not \naccomplish any sort of cloture on the deficit over that same timeframe \nof 10 years, which he professes as being the period when we should be \nbalancing the budget. And so there is no proposal on the table from \nthis administration which would lead us to a balanced budget.\n  That gets to the core of the issue. When you hear from the other side \nof the aisle, as we heard earlier today from the Senator from North \nDakota and the Senator from California and the Senator from Minnesota, \nthat our budget is insensitive, that we are not caring, that we are \ndastardly individuals on this side for trying to balance the budget \nbecause it impacts this group or that group--many of which \nrepresentations, by the way, were inaccurate, especially in reference \nto the WIC Program--but when you hear those allegations, you have to \nask yourself, what is the true insensitivity and unfairness in this \ncountry today? Is it not really that we as a generation, our \ngeneration--I am talking now about the postwar baby-boom generation, \nthe Bill Clinton generation, of which I happen to be a member--is \nrunning up a huge debt for our day-to-day expenses, for expenses which \nwe incur and enjoy the fruits of today but are not willing to pay for \ntoday, that we are taking that bill and passing it on to our children?\n  Is not the true injustice that is occurring today to the people of \nthis country, and especially to the children of this country and to the \nnext generation of this country, that if we continue on our present \ncourse we will be the first, the first generation in the history of \nthis great and wonderful country--now, again I am referring to the \npostwar baby-boom generation--the first generation to pass on less to \nour children than was passed on to us by our elders.\n  That is the true insensitivity, and so we have addressed it, and we \nhave addressed it in a very positive way, I believe.\n  Mr. President, I would simply conclude my remarks by saying that I \nbelieve the President of the United States has an obligation to engage \nin this process substantively rather than politically. He has engaged \nvery well politically. There is no question about that. He has managed \nto go to almost every interest group in this country, including one \ngroup in the Midwest, to this group in the South, to that group in the \nWest, far West, and represent that he is on their side in this budget \nissue.\n  I suggest that he come to the Congress and make specific proposals \nwhich do lead to a balanced budget rather than proposals which are \nsimply structured for his reelection campaign. If he were to come to \nthis Congress with proposals which would lead to a balanced budget, \nwhich were substantive, where he actually put on the table a budget \nwith numbers balanced by CBO, we could close this matter rather quickly \nand, as a result, pass a better opportunity for a good life to our \nchildren, which is our primary obligation as Members of the Senate.\n  I notice the Senator from Louisiana has some guests present, and I \nwould be happy to pause in my comments and in fact yield back my time \nso that the Senator from Louisiana can introduce his guests.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to touch on an article in the \nmorning news relative to how we have historically dealt with the \nproblem of budget deficits. But first, let me touch on the point raised \nby my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire relative to the \nCongressional Budget Office's scoring of the Republican budget as \nbalanced. I hope everyone within the sound of my ears and the view of \nthis particular C-SPAN coverage will look at the Record. Yes, on the \nday before yesterday, on October 18--and you will find it in your \nCongressional Record at page 15263--a letter was included in the Record \nfrom the Director of the Congressional Budget Office doing exactly as \nthe distinguished Senator from New Hampshire claimed. CBO said that not \nonly was the GOP budget in balance but that by the year 2002, there \nwould be a $10 billion surplus.\n  That was day before yesterday. On yesterday, October 19, if you \nplease, Mr. President, another letter was sent from CBO to Senators \nConrad and Dorgan. I ask unanimous consent at this particular point \nthat the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      Congressional Budget Office,\n\n\n                                                U.S. Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Pursuant to Section 205(a) of the budget \n     resolution for fiscal year 1996 (H. Con. Res. 67), the \n     Congressional Budget Office yesterday provided the Chairman \n     of the Senate Budget Committee with a projection of the \n     budget deficits or surpluses that would result from enactment \n     of the reconciliation legislation submitted to the Budget \n     Committee. As specified in section 205(a), CBO provided \n     projections (using the economic and technical assumptions \n     underlying the budget resolution and assuming the level of \n     discretionary spending specified in that resolution) of the \n     deficit or surplus of the total budget--that is, the deficit \n     or surplus resulting from all budgetary transactions of the \n     federal government, including Social Security and Postal \n     Service spending and receipts that are designated as off-\n     budget transactions. As stated in the letter to Chairman \n     Domenici, CBO projected that there will be a total-budget \n     surplus of $10 billion in 2002. Excluding an estimated off-\n     budget surplus of $108 billion in 2002 from the calculation, \n     CBO would project an on-budget deficit of $98 billion in \n     2002.\n       If you wish further details on this projection, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The staff contact is Jim Horney, who \n     can be reached at 226-2880.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. Let me just highlight \nthe pertinent part:\n\n       As specified in section 205(a), CBO provided projections on \n     spending specified in that resolution of the deficit or \n     surplus of the total budget, that is, the deficit or surplus \n     resulting from all budgetary transactions of the Federal \n     Government, including Social Security and Postal Service \n     spending and receipts that are designated as off-budget \n     transactions.\n       As stated in the letter to Chairman Domenici, CBO projected \n     that there will be a total budget surplus of $10 billion in \n     2002. Excluding an estimated off-budget surplus of $108 \n     billion in 2002 from the calculation, CBO would project an \n     on-budget deficit of $98 billion.\n\n  So, unlike 2 days ago, when the CBO scored the GOP budget as having a \n$10 billion surplus in the seventh year, yesterday CBO scored it as \nleaving us with a $98 billion deficit. It piqued my interest because \nthe CBO used the expression in the letter to Senator Conrad ``including \nSocial Security and Postal Service spending and receipts.''\n  What bothers me about that clause is that, this Senator, along with \nmy distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, the former Senator John \nHeinz, cosponsored an amendment that passed the Congress and was \nenacted by the President--namely, section 13301 of the Congressional \nBudget Act, which orders that Social Security funds shall not be used \nin citing in deficits or surpluses of the Government. That particular \nsection puts Social Security off budget and in trust.\n  But today we learn that a mistake was made over at CBO. In \nconsidering the size of the Social Security surplus in the year 2002, \nthey did not catch the fact that the Finance Committee had banked on a \nsmall change in the CPI, otherwise known as the Consumer Price Index. \nIn turn, a reduction in the CPI reduces the amount of cost-of-living \nadjustments paid to Social Security recipients.\n  Under the law, this change in Social Security payments does not \ndivert money to lower the deficit or to fund the general budget. \nInstead, if you save money in Social Security, the money merely adds to \nthe surpluses in the Social Security trust fund.\n  Right now, Mr. President, we have a surplus of $481 billion in Social \nSecurity. We have a surplus in Medicare of $147 billion. And instead of \nrecognizing that fact, we run around knocking over desks to get on TV \nand carry on about things that will happen 7 years from now for \nMedicare, 30 years from now with Social Security. What we don't do is \nto pay attention to the crisis that is happening right this minute.\n  And that brings me to the morning editorial by our friend, Mr. J. W. \nAnderson of the editorial staff of the Washington Post.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial in its entirety, entitled \n``This Is Leadership?'' be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 20, 1995]\n\n   This Is Leadership?--Since 1973, The Deficit Has Been Central To \n                           American Politics\n\n                           (By J.W. Anderson)\n\n       President Clinton's repudiation of his 1993 tax increase, \n     followed by his ungainly scramble to repudiate the \n     repudiation, has inflicted a severe injury on himself and his \n     party. It becomes increasingly difficult to know exactly what \n     he stands for.\n       His first budget with its tax increase and its attack on \n     the deficit is arguably the bravest, and certainly the most \n     useful, of his accomplishments as president. Now, alas, he's \n     running after the Republicans' tax-cut bandwagon and throwing \n     the best of his own record into doubt. But it's not \n     unprecedented. President Bush, running for reelection in \n     1992, repudiated the tax increase that he had accepted in the \n     very constructive budget compromise of 1990.\n       This country seems to be going through a series of \n     presidencies eroded and diminished by the savage politics of \n     intractable budget quarrels. How long will it continue? It's \n     hard to say. The process has been going on for more than 20 \n     years, and progress has been slow.\n       The origins of today's budget fights lie in the pivotal \n     year 1973--the year that the great postwar boom ended.\n       For a quarter of a century, from the late 1940s into the \n     early 1970s, standards of living improved faster than ever \n     before in history. It happened throughout the world, but most \n     spectacularly in the developed industrial democracies. As the \n     long boom continued, governments began to think that they had \n     at last solved the mysteries of economic growth and that they \n     now knew how to keep their economies expanding steadily and \n     rapidly.\n       The only question was the pleasant one of how best to spend \n     the flood of wealth, private and public, that this boom was \n     generating. Most of the democracies decided to put much of \n     the new revenues into new and expanded social benefits--\n     mainly pensions for the elderly and health care. In those \n     years here in the United States, Medicare and Medicaid were \n     enacted, and Social Security was greatly increased. In \n     Western Europe, where the war years had created a hunger for \n     security beyond anything in the American tradition, this \n     expansion of benefits went much farther.\n       Then, in 1973, the boom suddenly ended. Economic historians \n     still aren't quite sure \n\n[[Page S15396]]\n     why it happened. The oil crisis had something to do with it and perhaps \n     the American decision to take the dollar off the gold \n     standard. But whatever the reasons, throughout the rich \n     democracies--here in North America, in Western Europe and in \n     Japan alike--the economic growth rates dropped to half the \n     level of the previous 25 years.\n       The consequences have been huge. One of them was that high \n     growth no longer produced the immense increases in tax \n     revenues on which all those governments had been counting to \n     finance the new social entitlements. But, having put those \n     pensions and health insurance laws in place, they couldn't \n     retreat from them. The result was the era--which still \n     continues--of big budget deficits.\n       The United States is struggling with a deficit that now, \n     counting all levels of government including states and \n     municipalities, comes to about 2.2 percent of gross domestic \n     product. All of the other big industrial democracies have \n     bigger deficits--some of them much, much bigger.\n       The budget deficit has become central to American politics. \n     It's the same in Europe, and more so because all of the \n     European Union countries have agreed to get their deficits \n     down as a condition of joining the common currency at the end \n     of the decade. Most of them clearly won't make it, and they \n     fear being shut out of continental prosperity. Just as \n     deficit politics is weakening the American president, it's \n     having the same effect in Europe. The most notable example at \n     the moment is France's new president, Jacques Chirac, who is \n     caught between economic reality and a series of unwise \n     campaign promises.\n       The strongest political leader in Europe is Helmut Kohl, \n     Germany's chancellor, who has responded forcefully to deficit \n     dangers by slamming a heavy surtax on top of a tax burden \n     that was already high. It's to pay the costs of modernizing \n     formerly communist eastern Germany. Other presidents and \n     prime ministers don't have the advantage of a widely accepted \n     public need like that one.\n       Here in the United States, the past 22 years' record \n     suggests that the country will coast along, weakened and \n     distracted by its budget troubles until they produce a real \n     financial crisis. Americans, and particularly American \n     politicians, are good at meeting crises. Nothing short of a \n     genuine crisis, it seems, can generate enough public \n     attention and concern to make a real solution possible and \n     return the federal budget to the small deficits of the years \n     before 1973.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Summarizing, if you please, Mr. President, Mr. Anderson states that \n``from the late 1940's into the early 1970's, standards of living have \nimproved faster than ever before'' in the history of this Nation. We \nhad surplus moneys, and the only question was ``how best to spend the \nflood of wealth, private and public. . .'' And, as a result, we greatly \nincreased Social Security, health care, Medicare, Medicaid and all \nthese particular programs.\n  Then Mr. Anderson goes on and says, now wait.\n\n       Then, in 1973, the boom suddenly ended. . . (T)he oil \n     crisis had something to do with it, taking the dollar off the \n     gold standard had something to do with it. . . . The budget \n     deficit has become central to American politics.\n\n  He cites how Europe has confronted this particular problem whereby \nthe European countries have agreed that their deficits must be reduced \nas a condition of joining the common currency and, emphasizing, I \nquote,\n\n       The strongest political leader in Europe is Helmet Kohl, \n     Germany's Chancellor, who has responded forcefully to deficit \n     dangers by slamming a heavy surtax on top of a tax burden \n     that was already high.\n\n  Now, that is historic, having the media praise somebody for \nincreasing taxes. Let me go to the concluding sentence here of the \nAnderson article that I included in the Record.\n  And I quote:\n\n       Nothing short of a genuine crisis, it seems, can generate \n     enough public attention and concern to make a real solution \n     possible and return the Federal budget to the small deficits \n     of the years before 1973.\n\n  Now, my point here, Mr. President, is, we have a crisis right here \nand now. The gentleman says, ``Nothing short of a genuine crisis * * * \ncan generate enough public attention.'' The only hope we have is to use \nthe free media to reveal that crisis. The press corps absolutely refuse \nto do it. They continue to report deficits in the terms of what they \ncall a unified deficit, which, contrary to the law, includes the \nborrowing from the trust funds.\n  I can show you what I mean in article after article where $161.4 \nbillion is cited as last year's deficit. The true deficit was $283.3 \nbillion--because that is what you get if you subtract out your Social \nSecurity moneys, your civil service and military retirement, your \nMedicare and all the rest of the trust funds that you are going to have \nto pay back. And as of this minute, we owe the trust funds $1.255 \ntrillion.\n  Now, under the Republican 7-year budget, we are going to use another \n$636 billion of Social Security moneys. So instead of owing Social \nSecurity $481 billion today, in 2002 we are going to owe over $1 \ntrillion all the while beating our breast and saying that we are \nbalancing the budget.\n  We have got to cut out the gamesmanship and get down to truth in \nbudgeting. Mr. President, it is a heck of a note to have to write the \nCongressional Budget Office and ask, ``In accordance with the law, \nwould you please cite the deficit?''\n  On one day, they cite a surplus of $10 billion. Then when we asked \nthem to comply with the law, they said, ``Excuse us, there is a deficit \nof $98 billion.'' Now they have corrected that little mistake and got \nit up to $115 billion.\n  Just the other Sunday, I was listening to Mr. Russert on ``Meet the \nPress'' asking Mr. Panetta: ``Will you withstand those political \ncharges and go along with this reduction in cost-of-living increases in \norder to balance the budget?''\n  Going along, with lowering cost-of-living increases in Social \nSecurity, does not balance the budget. It enhances the Social Security \nsurplus. He said time and again on that particular program to Mr. \nMoynihan.\n  My point is that historically we have gotten into the hands of the \nPhilistines. I saw this start back in West Virginia with our friend, \nPresident John F. Kennedy, when he was Candidate Kennedy. They never \nexpected in West Virginia that upbeat Harvard graduate was going to \nbest the populous Hubert Humphrey. But Jack Kennedy had Lou Harris and \nplayed all the hot-button issues like a Stradivarius.\n  He came out on top, and then the rule of thumb came for all national \nelections, ``Get yourself a pollster.''\n  Our trouble is that the media act in complicity with the politicians. \nThey get irritated or annoyed if you try to explain an issue. They want \na quick, pithy, confrontational answer to any particular item. They do \nnot care about an issue, they do not understand it, and they continue \nto report what is not the fact, namely, that you are balancing your \nbudget when they know otherwise.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the budget table be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  BUDGET TABLES                                                 \n                                              [Outlays in billions]                                             \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                           Gross                \n               Year                  Government  Trust funds    Unified        Real       Federal       Gross   \n                                       budget                   deficit      deficit        debt       interest \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1968..............................        178.1          3.1        -25.2        -28.3        368.7         14.6\n1969..............................        183.6         -0.3         +3.2         +2.9        365.8         16.6\n1970..............................        195.6         12.3         -2.8        -15.1        380.9         19.3\n1971..............................        210.2          4.3        -23.0        -27.3        408.2         21.0\n1972..............................        230.7          4.3        -23.4        -27.7        435.9         21.8\n1973..............................        245.7         15.5        -14.9        -30.4        466.3         24.2\n1974..............................        269.4         11.5         -6.1        -17.6        483.9         29.3\n1975..............................        332.3          4.8        -53.2        -58.0        541.9         32.7\n1976..............................        371.8         13.4        -73.7        -87.1        629.0         37.1\n1977..............................        409.2         23.7        -53.7        -77.4        706.4         41.9\n1978..............................        458.7         11.0        -59.2        -70.2        776.6         48.7\n1979..............................        504.0         12.2        -40.7        -52.9        829.5         59.9\n1980..............................        590.9          5.8        -73.8        -79.6        909.1         74.8\n1981..............................        678.2          6.7        -79.0        -85.7        994.8         95.5\n1982..............................        745.8         14.5       -128.0       -142.5      1,137.3        117.2\n1983..............................        808.4         26.6       -207.8       -234.4      1,371.7        128.7\n\n[[Page S15397]]\n                                                                                                                \n1984..............................        851.8          7.6       -185.4       -193.0      1,564.7        153.9\n1985..............................        946.4         40.6       -212.3       -252.9      1,817.6        178.9\n1986..............................        990.3         81.8       -221.2       -303.0      2,120.6        190.3\n1987..............................      1,003.9         75.7       -149.8       -225.5      2,346.1        195.3\n1988..............................      1,064.1        100.0       -155.2       -255.2      2,601.3        214.1\n1989..............................      1,143.2        114.2       -152.5       -266.7      2,868.0        240.9\n1990..............................      1,252.7        117.2       -221.4       -338.6      3,206.6        264.7\n1991..............................      1,323.8        122.7       -269.2       -391.9      3,598.5        285.5\n1992..............................      1,380.9        113.2       -290.4       -403.6      4,002.1        292.3\n1993..............................      1,408.2         94.2       -255.1       -349.3      4,351.4        292.5\n1994..............................      1,460.6         89.1       -203.2       -292.3      4,643.7        296.3\n1995..............................      1,530.0        121.9       -161.4       -283.3      4,927.0        336.0\n1996 estimate.....................      1,583.0        121.8       -189.3       -311.1      5,238.0        348.0\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: CBO's January, April, and August 1995 Reports.                                                          \n\n\n\n\n                                                    Year 2002 (billion)\n1996 Budget: Kasich Conf.

You can see how the spending has gone up. For example, \nfrom 1995 to 1996, spending goes from $1,530,000,000,000 in spending to \n$1,583,000,000,000 in spending. In other words, while we say that we \nare cutting spending, in fact we have increased spending 53 billion \nbucks.\n  Under the GOP plan we are supposed to cut $45 billion in spending \nthis year. If you see in the last year of their plan you have to have a \nfreeze of $96 billion, additional cuts of $25 billion--cuts in \nentitlements of $159 billion and interest savings of $67 billion, for a \ntotal of $226 billion--plus the Social Security trust fund of $115 \nbillion.\n  Now those are a lot of facts and figures, but what I am saying is you \nhave to have total reductions in 2002 of $462 billion. Let's get real. \nIf you cannot, with a new group of freshmen spurring us to cut, get $45 \nbillion, how are you going to get $462 billion?\n  That is why I told my colleague, the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee, if this particular plan balanced in the year 2002, I \nwould jump off the Capitol dome. There is no chance of that. They know \nit and I know it.\n  In the Commerce Committee, for example, we have presumed to save $15 \nbillion. The truth is--and we all know it in the Commerce Committee--\nthat $4.5 billion of the $15 billion is already expended in the telecom \nbill.\n  That has occurred in a lot of these other committees. In the Finance \nCommittee yesterday, they have a mechanism for Medicare called BELT. \nYou find out that the poor, the sick, and taxpayers in America are the \nones that are going to be belted. That little phrase requires that if \nCongress comes in say $40 billion shy, they push off the heavy lifting \non to the next Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that a chart which I compiled \nearlier this year with respect to ``The Realities on Truth in \nBudgeting,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Hollings Releases Realities on Truth in Budgeting\n\n       Reality No. 1: $1.2 trillion in spending cuts is necessary.\n       Reality No. 2: There aren't enough savings in entitlements. \n     Have welfare reform, but a jobs program will cost; savings \n     are questionable. Health reform can and should save some, but \n     slowing growth from 10 to 5 percent doesn't offer enough \n     savings. Social Security won't be cut and will be off-budget \n     again.\n       Reality No. 3: We should hold the line on the budget on \n     Defense; that would be no savings.\n       Reality No. 4: Savings must come from freezes and cuts in \n     domestic discretionary spending but that's not enough to stop \n     hemorrhaging interest costs.\n       Reality No. 5: Taxes are necessary to stop hemorrhage in \n     interest costs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               1996            1997            1998            1999            2000            2001            2002     \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeficit CBO Jan. 1995 (using trust                                                                                                                      \n funds).................................             207             224             225            253             284             297             322 \n                                         ===============================================================================================================\nFreeze discretionary outlays after 1998.               0               0               0            -19             -38             -58             -78 \nSpending cuts...........................             -37             -74            -111           -128            -146            -163            -180 \nInterest savings........................              -1              -5             -11            -20             -32             -46             -64 \n                                         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total savings ($1.2 trillion).......             -38             -79            -122           -167            -216            -267            -322 \n                                         ===============================================================================================================\nRemaining deficit using trust funds.....             169             145             103             86              68              30               0 \nRemaining deficit excluding trust funds.             287             264             222            202             185             149             121 \n5 percent VAT...........................              96             155             172            184             190             196             200 \nNet deficit excluding trust funds.......             187              97              27            (17)            (54)           (111)           (159)\nGross debt..............................           5,142           5,257           5,300          5,305           5,272           5,200           5,091 \nAverage interest rate on debt (percent).             7.0             7.1             6.9            6.8             6.7             6.7             6.7 \nInterest cost on the debt...............             367             370             368            368             366             360             354 \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Figures are in billions.

Mr. President, I showed the cuts necessary at that time \nand showed that if you wanted to balance the budget without using the \ntrust funds you had to increase revenues as well as cut spending.\n  Governors pay their bills, mayors pay their bills, but not us in \nCongress and the President. We have no idea of paying the bills. We \nblissfully continue this one grand political charade, this one grand \nfraud.\n  The only way I know to expose it is through the free press. Thomas \nJefferson once commented that between a free government and a free \npress, he would choose the latter. You can have a free government, but \nyou cannot hold it long unless you get a free press. But unfortunately, \nthe free press here is a pollster press. In today's paper it says that \nthe best of the best reporters were out eating supper instead of \nlistening to the President's speech in Houston. They do not care. They \nget little snippets and stories, and you cannot get the truth. The \ntruth is, Mr. Anderson, there is no crisis we are going to have to \nreach. We are in crisis now.\n  We have spending on automatic pilot. Next year we will have to pay \n$348 billion in interest costs on the national debt. That is a billion \ndollars a day. If that is not a crisis, I don't know what is. We can \nstraighten out Medicare, but we do not have to devastate the Government \nin doing so. Neither side, including the President, has a balanced \nbudget. The Democrats do not have a balanced budget, and the \nRepublicans do not have a balanced budget. So we should not act like \nthere is a choice at the present time.\n  The truth of the matter is that next year we will pay $348 billion in \ninterest. They say you cannot avoid death and you cannot avoid taxes. \nWell, you cannot avoid interest costs. As such, \n\n[[Page S15398]]\nyou have tax increases on automatic pilot of $1 billion a day. That is \nthe hemorrhage we have to stop. That is the real problem confronting \nus. And we are not doing it. We are arguing whether it is for the \nmiddle class or rich, and who is going to get the political credit. We \nought to stop these shenanigans and get down to the business at hand.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15395-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           POTENTIAL DEPLOYMENT OF AMERICAN TROOPS TO BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this week the Senate and the House began \nconducting hearings on the potential deployment of American ground \nforces to Bosnia and Herzegovina in the event a peace agreement is \nreached. This is the beginning of a very important process of \ncongressional review and debate. I am pleased that the administration \nsent the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff to testify on behalf of the \nadministration's proposal.\n  Any decision to send American Forces into harms' way requires the \nutmost consideration. American interests may justify sending Americans \ninto Bosnia, but the goals must be clear and the risks must be \nunderstood and weighed carefully.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has not yet made the case for its \nproposed operation. Many questions remain unanswered and many answers \nremain ambiguous.\n  The first task must be to persuade the Congress that this is the best \noption of the options available. And let me be clear, there are other \noptions.\n  For over 3 years now, I have called for American leadership. For over \n3 years now, I have called for NATO involvement. But, I am not \nconvinced that exercising United States leadership and deploying NATO \nground forces in support of a peace agreement that partitions Bosnia is \nthe best or only option. We need to know: will American Forces be the \nguarantors of ethnic cleansing? Will they be used to prevent Moslem \nrefugees from returning to their homes in what becomes the Bosnian Serb \nRepublic?\n  With respect to the peace settlement, the administration must be able \nto ensure that any peace reached is a stable and sustainable peace--\nthat there are defensible borders; that the Bosnian Government \nstructure is viable; that this is not just the first step toward a \ngreater Serbia.\n  If there is a genuine peace, there is a real question why tens of \nthousands of peacekeepers, including Americans, are needed? Moreover, \nhow did the administration come up with the number 25,000 for the \nAmerican ground force contribution? Is this solely the result of \nPresident Clinton's speech 2 years ago or is there a military rationale \nfor it?\n  There is a lot of confusion as to what NATO's role will be. Will NATO \nensure the territorial integrity of Bosnia? Who will accomplish the \ntasks that NATO does not wish to be involved in, such as facilitating \nthe return of refugees, the conduct of free and fair elections, \nhumanitarian operations?\n  What will this operation cost? What factors are current cost \nestimates based on? How does the administration plan to pay for such an \noperation? Was Secretary Perry serious when he said that the \nadministration would take funds from missile defense programs--intended \nto protect Americans from the growing threat of missile defenses--for \npeacekeeping?\n  What are the criteria for success of this operation? What is the exit \nstrategy? How do we ensure that the Bosnians can defend themselves once \npeacekeepers leave? Who will arm and or train the Bosnians?\n  It seems to me that developments in recent months have vindicated the \noverwhelming majority in Congress who argued that the Bosnians and the \nCroats were capable of defending themselves if armed. It has also \ndemonstrated that NATO air power can be used effectively and that \nBosnian Serb Forces are not invincible. The military balance began \nshifting in Bosnia, but I am not sure that it has stabilized. In my \nview, lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia is as relevant in a post-\nsettlement situation as it is now. This matter cannot be avoided and \nmust be resolved as part of any peace settlement.\n\n  The bottom line is that Congress is not yet in possession of the \nfacts. Indeed, the administration is not in possession of the facts. \nThere is no settlement yet. But, with that in mind, we must make sure \nthat we do not deploy any forces without clear answers to these \ncritical questions. I am deeply concerned that since current NATO plans \ncall for initial deployments within a few days of a settlement being \nsigned that we may not have all the answers--and that the \nadministration will go ahead and deploy forces and try to figure out \nwhat they will be doing after they are already on the ground.\n  In view of these many unanswered questions--and those I have raised \nare by no means all-inclusive--I would strongly urge the administration \nto cooperate with the Congress and provide us with the information we \nneed to make an informed judgment.\n  Furthermore, I strongly urge the administration to seek congressional \nauthorization for any deployment of United States ground forces to \nBosnia. This was my view prior to the gulf war, and it is now. It is \nessential that the American people are behind any undertaking that \nplaces thousands of our soldiers in a dangerous environment for a \nprolonged period of time.\n  Mr. President, let me also express my deep concern about other \naspects of the diplomatic process and the talks that are due to begin \non August 31 in Dayton, OH. The agenda does not include Kosova which \nhas been under martial law for over 6 years now. This is not just a \nmatter of human rights, but a question of Kosova's status. Even in the \nformer Yugoslavia, Kosova had autonomous status--the people and their \nassembly could make their own decisions. Today, there are 2 million \nAlbanians there under an apartheid-like system--A large majority \nterrorized and oppressed by a small minority.\n  We cannot let Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic off the hook for \nKosova, or for his continued support of paramilitary forces which are \nreported today to have slaughtered hundreds of Moslem men and boys in \nnorthern Bosnia. Milosevic is no peacemaker, rather the mastermind \nbehind ethnic cleansing, oppression, and aggression in the former \nYugoslavia. As early as 1992, senior U.S. Government officials accused \nhim of war crimes. But today, he has been invited by this \nadministration to the United States to participate in peace talks. I \nbelieve that this was a serious error in judgment which calls into \nquestion the administration's commitment to the prosecution of war \ncriminals in the former Yugoslavia. Sure, Milosevic has not yet been \nindicted by the war crimes tribunal, but, there is no doubt that he has \ngiven support and safe haven to some of the most notorious war \ncriminals. Slobodan Milosevic should not be issued a visa. If the \nadministration insists on this, at the very least, it should ensure \nthat any visa issued to Milosevic confines him to Wright Patterson Air \nForce Base. He does not deserve to be treated like other foreign \ndignitaries.\n  Finally, there should be no comprehensive sanctions relief on Serbia \nuntil there is a satisfactory resolution of the situation in Kosova. \nUnless there is a comprehensive settlement including Kosova, there will \nbe no stability in the region--one of the key objectives presently \nbeing cited by the administration. The sanctions on Serbia are the only \nleverage the United States and the international community have been \nwilling to use on the Belgrade regime.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the administration will address my \nconcerns and those of my colleagues, and cooperate with the Congress so \nthat together we can determine what is in the best interest of the \nUnited States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15398-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15398-S15399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXTENSION OF TIME FOR MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

I, too, am about to speak about the situation in Bosnia \nand am glad to follow on the remarks of the majority leader and the \nSenator from West Virginia, both of whom have expressed a concern about \nthe role of Congress as we go forward with this possible commitment of \ntroops into the situation in Bosnia.\n  This week, administration officials testified before the Senate \nForeign Affairs Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, the \nHouse International Relations Committee, and the House National \nSecurity Committee on the issue of the deployment of United States \ntroops as a part of NATO's implementing force in the Republic of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina.\n  While the testimony laid out some of the proposals the administration \nis contemplating, it opened up many, many questions for consideration, \nsome of which the majority leader just listed. The most constructive \nforum, in my view, to debate those issues, though, is through the \nconstitutional process embodied by the War Powers Act by which Congress \nis required to authorize the deployment of troops into imminent \nhostilities. For that reason, I am pleased that just today the \nPresident has indicated that he will seek congressional approval of the \nmission, as Senator Byrd just reported. I am not completely satisfied, \nhowever, that the President will request authorization prior to the \ntime that he has actually made a commitment. I want to be sure that he \ndoes not sign a peace treaty with that commitment in it and then come \nback and say, ``By the way, I need your approval to go forward.''\n  If Congress is going to really be a partner in the process envisioned \nunder the Constitution then we should either vote on an authorization \nprior to the commitment to deploy is made, or alternatively, the \nPresident should clearly state that any commitment he makes for U.S. \ntroop deployment during negotiations is contingent upon congressional \napproval. One way or the other, the President has in effect rendered \nCongress' role meaningless.\n  To ensure that this most necessary exchange takes place in the most \nconstructive sequence, Mr. President, I am going to introduce a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution today which would express our intention to \nvote on a resolution of approval prior to the commitment to introduce \nUnited States forces in Bosnia as a part of IFOR. My resolution does \nnot approve or disapprove of the administration's proposal. Rather, it \nrequires the Senate to debate and vote on it before we are presented \nwith a commitment to deploy. What I am trying to avoid, Mr. President, \nis being presented with a fait accompli to authorize a deployment, and \ntherefore undermine the important debate that we should have had.\n  Mr. President, in many respects this is a bit of a rehash of the war \npowers debate, the debate about whether this body has the right and the \nresponsibility to authorize the use of American troops. Indeed, the \nmere fact that this resolution is needed indicates the institutional \ncrisis we face in this country about how we make the gravest of \ndecisions--the decision about whether to send American men and women in \nharm's way overseas.\n  This is a debate we face every time American troops are called to \nactive duty. Unfortunately, it is not a question we have seriously \nsought to resolve. Instead, we seem to muddle through each crisis and \ntry to work out sort of a case-by-case understanding between the \nCongress and the President, somehow hoping that the skeleton of war \npowers will stay hidden in the closet just until the current crisis \ngoes away, as if there is not going to be another crisis in the future.\n  Mr. President, the issue of war powers will not go away because its \npurpose really makes too much sense to ignore. While the War Powers Act \nhas certainly failed as a mechanism for implementing article I of the \nConstitution, its intention should be heeded, and Bosnia is a perfect \nexample of why.\n  The Constitution and the War Powers Act were both crafted to take \nadvantage of the collective wisdom and power of both the President and \nthe Congress in making some of the most serious decisions we face. Our \ndemocracy does not vest in one person so much power that he or she \nalone can use military force to accomplish their own goals. Rather, our \nsystem splits such an awesome power by charging the President with \ncommanding the Army, the Navy, and giving Congress both the power to \ndeclare war and the responsibility to appropriate funds for military \naction.\n  Mr. President, Congress is not simply supposed to be consulted on \nsuch matters or just be a rubberstamp for such actions. Congress is \nsupposed to be an active partner in this process.\n  Mr. President, I think this is shared power worth protecting. While I \nhave no doubt of President Clinton's motives in committing 20,000 \ntroops to Bosnia, I want to ensure that some other future President \ndoes not have the unilateral authority to send 80,000 troops for some \nreason that she or he alone supports. We have to remember that how we \nproceed here can and will set a precedence on how troops are deployed \nfor other peacekeeping or peace-enforcing missions.\n  Mr. President, this process is also important for marshaling public \nsupport for any military operation--which, as any of our veterans will \ntell you, is a critical element for success for any mission. It is \nthrough the authorization process that the mission is explained and \nrefined to the American people generally, and specifically for those \nfolks that are asked to serve their country and risk their lives. The \nquestions are answered, fears are alleviated, and the American people \nare given an opportunity to air their views on what the mission means \nand is worth to them.\n  In this case, in this case of Bosnia, there are many, many, \nunanswered questions at this point, many good questions that the \nPresident will want to answer in building support for this mission.\n  Mr. President, these are very, very crucial questions. They are fair \nquestions. Their answers hold great consequences for this country, for \nNATO, for the Balkans, and perhaps for the world.\n  Certainly, if we are going to do something as drastic as deploy U.S. \ntroops, we have to create a process by which the Congress and the \nexecutive work together to forge a workable and attainable mission.\n  Mr. President, my main point is that consultations are not going to \nbe enough. Authorization that comes just after a commitment to the \nparties has already been made is not sufficient, either. Congress has \nto have this debate before the President is authorized to commit \ntroops, and any commitment he makes prior to congressional approval, I \nbelieve, has to be explicitly conditioned upon subsequent congressional \nconsent.\n  This is the only way to ensure that article I of the Constitution is \nrespected and that the awesome decision of placing U.S. troops into \nimminent hostility is one that is jointly made by the executive and the \nlegislative branches. Our troops must have the confidence that, if they \nare going to be sent to Bosnia, they are doing it with the support of \nthe American public through their elected Representatives. If they \ncannot get that, then perhaps we may actually say that their mission \nmay not be worth the risk.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15399-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15399-S15401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL ENDOWMENTS\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I find it both ironic and disheartening to \nbe standing here 30 years after the establishment of the National \nFoundation on the Arts and the Humanities--30 years distinguished by \nsuccess in preserving and nurturing the arts and scholarship of our \nNation--defending the very principles upon which the legislation was \ncreated. As one of the founding sponsors of the legislation authorizing \nthe National Endowments, I am deeply concerned about the future of \nthese extraordinary agencies. \n\n[[Page S15400]]\n\n  I am told that the old arguments no longer work. Opponents dismiss \nthe overwhelming evidence that a national infrastructure results in \ngreater public access to our culture. They gloss over the fact that \nAmerican creative excellence influences the way we are perceived as a \nNation and remembered when the history of our civilization is \ndocumented. They ignore the many studies which demonstrate how the arts \nhave stimulated local economies by revitalizing downtown areas, \nattracting tourism and providing jobs and taxable income.\n  Yet, who can deny that Americans of all ages from every corner of the \ncountry have a tremendous thirst to learn, enjoy and participate in the \ngreat diversity of our Nation's culture? The public is aware that the \nEndowments have brought a great value to millions of Americans. The \nvoices acknowledging this are no longer silent, but are being heard in \nincreasing numbers. And what the people seek is not to be found in the \ncommercial marketplace. Throughout the ages, the great legacies of art \nand scholarship have been created, sustained and preserved with some \nform of patronage. They should not now be expected to pay for \nthemselves.\n  I am proud when our American artists are recognized for their \nexcellence with invitations to demonstrate their work abroad. I am \nequally proud when a child remains in school and improves his grades as \na result of the positive experience he has had with a school-based arts \nprogram. The National Endowment for the Arts fosters American \ncreativity just as the National Endowment for the Humanities stimulates \nlearning. I firmly believe that regardless of our differences of \nwealth, race, religion and political belief, our cultural development \nbinds us together, develops our character as Americans and establishes \nour common heritage.\n  The Endowments were founded and have been sustained over the years \nwith bipartisan support. Hearings before the full committee earlier \nthis year demonstrated that the trend can continue. What has happened \nto this bipartisanship elsewhere in Congress? Why has the divisive \ntactics of a few led to so much time being devoted to such a small \namount of money?\n  While critics eager to further polarize our parties have focused on a \nvery few controversial grants, perhaps they have missed the fact that \nthe Arts Endowment Design Program led the way in convening a design \npanel to plan the post-bombing redevelopment of downtown Oklahoma City. \nPerhaps they did not know that a world-class American dance company \nperformed in their home town or that young members of a string quartet \ngave a series of workshops in their schools. Perhaps they are unaware \nthat many grateful constituents remember the role of both Endowments in \nbringing hope, joy, inspiration, knowledge and healing to their own \ncommunities.\n  Perhaps, too, the critics did not notice the valuable changes in the \nagency's procedures instituted by National Endowment for the Arts \nChairman Jane Alexander last year that go a long way toward addressing \nthe public's concerns by strengthening the Chairman's oversight of \nEndowment grantees and making the Endowment respond more effectively to \nthe needs of the people. I fully understand that many Americans are \ntroubled when they hear of works distasteful to them that are funded \n(or rumored to be funded) in part with their tax dollars. Nevertheless, \nwhile the Endowment has awarded well over 100,000 grants, fewer than 40 \nhave resulted in any controversy. The remaining 99.96 percent of all \ngrants made are testament to the Endowment's success.\n  As each of my colleagues know from their own constituents, the \npublic's investment in a relatively small Endowment grant is often the \nkey to stimulating the release of large amounts of State and local \nfunds and private contributions. Unlike most Federal programs, the \nNational Endowment for the Arts initiatives leverage 12 non-Federal \ndollars for each Federal dollar invested. Similarly, the National \nEndowment for the Humanities stimulates an average of $70 million in \nprivate support annually. In all probability, this money would never \nhave become available to the recipients without the initial Endowment \nrecognition. Donors look to the Endowments for leadership when they \ndecide how to allocate their funds, and it is these private funds that \nguarantee the survival of the best of our country's arts and \nscholarship. In short, removal of the national recognition and the \nstimulation of partnerships offered through Federal grants will \ndramatically reduce all forms of State and local cultural support.\n  Can we not move beyond the ideology of a few? Last July, the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources voted 12 to 4 in favor of an \namendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 856 to improve and extend \nthe National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965, the \nMuseum Services Act, and the Acts and Artifacts Indemnity Act. The \ncommittee report reaffirms the Government's commitment to, and interest \nin, supporting arts and humanities projects throughout the Nation well \ninto the future. After four hearings and lengthy debate, the committee \ndetermined that the agencies do provide valuable service to the \nAmerican public and should be maintained.\n  October is National Arts and Humanities Month. Let us use the \noccasion to reflect upon the eloquent words of President Kennedy \ndelivered shortly before the Endowments were founded:\n\n       I see little of more importance to the future of our \n     country and our civilization than full recognition of the \n     place of the artist. * * * I look forward to an America which \n     will reward achievement in the arts as we reward achievement \n     in business and statecraft. I look forward to an America \n     which will steadily raise its standards of artistic \n     accomplishment and which will steadily enlarge cultural \n     opportunities for all of its citizens.\n\n  I believe that the National Endowment for the Arts has been \nremarkably successful in furthering this ideal. Arts is no longer the \nprivileged domain of a relatively few practitioners and connoisseurs; \nit no longer exists in a remote and rarefied atmosphere. It can no \nlonger be considered as incidental or peripheral to our way of life. It \nis central to the life we cherish and to the beliefs we hold; for as a \nnation we are reaching toward maturity, and the surest sign of maturity \nlies in the growing expression of an indigenous and creative national \nculture.\n  The Arts Endowment provides critical assistance in creating and \npresenting our Nation's music, theater, dance, literature, painting, \nsculpture, photography, film and video, design arts and folk arts. \nWithout this funding, many popular programs would simply not exist, let \nalone be made available to millions. Even the very limited funds \nappropriated for the Endowment help keep ticket prices reasonable, thus \nenabling lower income citizens, young people, the elderly and the \ndisabled to gain access to our common culture.\n  The Humanities Endowment has supported and preserved the work of an \nextraordinary group of scholars and historians, and stimulated a wide \narray of new scholarship--all of which has served to expand our \nNation's collective knowledge of history, literature, philosophy, \nlanguages, and religion. Many know of the agency's role in sponsoring \nthrilling interpretive exhibitions and informative films on public \ntelevision. It has also helped to fund such diverse projects as a \ndictionary of American language, an encyclopedia of bioethics, the \npublication of George Washington's papers, the distribution of the \n``Civilization'' series to 2,000 colleges, the microfilming of over \n600,000 brittle books and repair of 100,000 additional volumes, \ntraining for conservators, summer seminars for teachers, the \nintroduction of various new technologies to the classroom, and repairs \nto museum, library, and school collections damaged by Hurricane Andrew \nand the Midwest floods.\n  Parents and teachers know the importance of arts and humanities \ncurricula; and studies confirm that they teach young people creativity, \nincrease self-discipline, develop analytical and communication skills, \nand are a critical means of passing on an understanding of American \nculture and civilization to the next generation.\n  I urge my colleagues to stop using the Endowments as pawns in an \nideological war and move to reaffirm the Government's support of the \narts and humanities. It is very important that we act on the \nreauthorization of the National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities \nAct of 1995 this year and I fervently hope that our leadership will \n\n[[Page S15401]]\nschedule a time to consider bill S. 856 as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15399-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15401-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15401-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:08 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2425.

A bill to require the periodic review of Federal \nregulations; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                   THE REGULATORY REVIEW ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the \nRegulatory Review Act of 1995, which I introduce today on behalf of \nmyself and Senators Heflin, Lott, Nickles, Hutchison, Craig, and Kyl.\n  It is only common sense that the utility of a rule may change as \ncircumstances change. Under current law, however, a rule enjoys eternal \nlife unless the agency that promulgated it takes affirmative steps to \nterminate it. And in fact agencies rarely choose to burden themselves \nwith the task of reexamining the rules they have promulgated. As a \nresult, our rulebooks are littered with rules that are obsolete, \ninconsistent with other rules, or just plain unnecessary.\n  The weight of this heap of outdated rules rests most heavily on the \nsmall businesses of this country. Unlike larger firms, small businesses \ncannot spread the costs of regulation over a large quantity of output. \nNor can they pass their regulatory headaches on to an accounting \ndepartment, legal counsel, or human resources division. Instead, in \ncase after case the entrepreneur himself must spend innumerable hours \nattempting to comply with the mandates of Federal regulators. It comes \nas no surprise, then, that problems relating to regulation and \nGovernment paperwork were the fastest growing areas of concern in a \nrecent survey conducted by the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses.\n  The Regulatory Review Act would solve the problems caused by \nunnecessary rules. Under the act, the Administrator of the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and \nBudget would coordinate and supervise agency reviews of covered rules, \nwhich largely would be rules that impose annual costs of $100 million \nor more. Covered rules not reviewed by the end of their review period \nwould terminate. The duration of review periods under the act would be \nup to 7 years, plus a possible extension of 6 months. Finally, the act \nitself would sunset after 10 years.\n  There are several reasons why OIRA should be given supervisory \nauthority over the regulatory review process. Obviously, the review \nprocess will involve determinations as to whether the rules \n\n[[Page S15402]]\nof one agency conflict with or duplicate those of another agency. Those \ndeterminations will require a global, interagency perspective that \ncomes much more naturally to OIRA than to the individual agencies \nthemselves. Additionally, vesting this authority in OIRA, rather than \nscattering it among the various agencies, will provide a timely \nreaffirmation of what Alexander Hamilton called the unity of the \nexecutive in Federalist No. 70.\n  It is also worth noting that the act avoids two areas of contention \nthat arose during debate on S. 343, the regulatory reform bill. First, \nthe act contains no decisional criteria; instead, rules would be \nreviewed according to whatever criteria already exist under current \nlaw. Second, the act would not affect the availability of, or standards \nfor, judicial review of final agency action. Thus, at bottom, the act \nstands for the commonsense principle that agencies should be required \nto review their rules periodically.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to address this issue without delay. \nThe small businesses represented by the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses, which strongly supports the Regulatory Review \nAct, demand no less.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COATS:\n  S. 1347.

A bill to promote increased understanding of Federal \nregulations and increased voluntary compliance with such regulations by \nsmall entities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n             THE SMALL BUSINESS FAIR TREATMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nSmall Business Fair Treatment Act of 1995, a measure designed not only \nto afford regularly relief to our Nation's small businesses, but also \nto begin to change the attitude of Government regulators who are often \nviewed by small business as adversaries rather than as sources of help \nand guidance.\n  Mr. President, the regulatory structure that has developed over the \nyears performs important safety, health, and consumer protection \nfunctions.\n  Just 2 years ago, a cryptosporidium outbreak in the city of \nMilwaukee's water supply left 104 people dead and over 400,000 people \nseriously ill.\n  That was a tragic reminder of how just one small crack in the \nregulatory process can have devastating consequences for a community \nthat until then had never experienced any such problems.\n  The need for strong, effective regulations is undeniable.\n  At the same time, few would dispute that the current regulatory \nsystem needs meaningful reform.\n  Mr. President, I have held over 175 listening sessions in my home \nState of Wisconsin during the 2\\1/2\\ years that I have been a Member of \nthis body.\n  Countless times I have had constituents stand up at these meetings \nand express their tremendous frustration and anger with a regulatory \nprocess that too often is impractical, impersonal, and needlessly \nburdensome.\n  This body debated a regulatory reform proposal earlier this summer \nthat sought to respond to this widespread frustration and anger.\n  But many of the proposals that were offered on the floor of the \nSenate during that regulatory relief debate earlier this summer focused \nmore on changes in the actual rulemaking process and featured solutions \nthat if not entirely Washington-based at least took a Washington \nperspective in addressing the issue.\n  The central devices that evolved in that debate as the tools by which \nthe regulatory process would be improved, such as judicial review and \nthe petition process, were approaches to regulatory relief that \nreflected a large corporation, Washington lobbyist, Washington law firm \nbased approach to solutions.\n  Mr. President, there certainly is a role for our Nation's larger \ncorporate citizens to play in the regulatory climate of this country, \nbut those interests do not always represent the interests of all \nbusinesses, and the solutions to the regulatory problems of large \nbusinesses are not always appropriate or effective for smaller \nbusinesses.\n  While a multinational corporation with substantial resources might \nfind it reasonable to devote funds to an enhanced petition process, \nthat kind of solution might mean little for a small, family owned \nbusiness with a fraction of the resources of a large firm, and little \nworking knowledge of the rulemaking process.\n  As well, Mr. President, solutions proposed during the regulatory \nrelief debate did little to focus on the day-to-day, practical problems \nof regulation with which small businesses must contend.\n  By contrast, this legislation focuses on small business, and on the \npractical problems of dealing with Government agencies and regulations.\n  It contains a number of provisions that make it easier for small \nbusinesses to comply with Government regulations, including several \nthat are similar to some excellent ideas offered as part of legislation \nsponsored by the chair of the Senate Small Business Committee, Mr. \nBond, as well as others that have been implemented at the direction of \nPresident Clinton.\n\n[[Page S15403]]\n\n  The bill requires agencies to publish compliance guides that provide \na straightforward, plain language description of a rule or regulation \nwith which a small business must comply.\n  These guides would be required to be published and disseminated by \nthe agency before any enforcement action was brought.\n  Beyond the obvious help these guides could be for businesses affected \nby a Government regulation, requiring an agency to think out and \ndescribe a new regulation in a clear and understandable way will only \nenhance the ability of that agency to administer the regulation.\n  The bill also requires agencies to establish procedures for the use \nof so-called no action letters. These are letters issued by an agency \nin response to a specific request of clarification from a small \nbusiness trying to comply with that agency's regulations.\n  The bill requires agencies to make a timely determination whether or \nnot to issue such a no action letter, and if such a letter is issued, \nthe bill establishes that the business could rely on it in an \nenforcement action related to matters laid out in the letter.\n  In addition to providing specific direction to a small business in \ndealing with subjective interpretations of agency regulations, a no \naction letter also establishes a record to which other businesses can \nturn in seeking guidance on how a particular regulation should be \ninterpreted.\n  A body of no action letters also ensures consistency in the \ninterpretation of regulations by an agency, something that can only \nfurther enhance compliance.\n  Mr. President, the bill also allows small businesses to request an \naudit from a regulator without the fear that the findings of such an \naudit would be used in any enforcement action.\n  The findings from such an audit would not be used in any enforcement \naction, if correction of any identified problem were made within 180 \ndays, except if the basis of the enforcement action were a violation of \ncriminal law, or if the voluntary audit was requested for the purpose \nof avoiding disclosure of information required for an investigative, \nadministrative, or judicial proceeding that, at the time of the audit, \nwas imminent or in progress.\n  In listening to small businessmen and women in Wisconsin, one of the \nmost troubling complaints that is raised with respect to Government \nregulation is the feeling that Government agencies too often take a \nconfrontational or adversarial approach in dealing with the business.\n  Whether or not this feeling is justified in every instance, in many \ninstances, or in only a few, it is honestly felt and reveals a problem \nthat needs fixing.\n  When the relationship between those who oversee and enforce \nregulations and those who must observe them deteriorates in this \nmanner, it only hinders compliance.\n  By allowing businesses to request a review of their operations, \nwithout fear that the results would be used against them, we can begin \nto improve that relationship, and change the way business perceives \nregulators from adversaries to sources of help.\n  Mr. President, another provision in the bill allows small business a \n6-month grace period to correct violations of Environmental Protection \nAgency regulations after they have been identified, unless there is \nimminent risk to public health or worker safety.\n  This proposal has already been implemented at the direction of \nPresident Clinton, and in my own State of Wisconsin, small businesses \nhave informed me that this extra time has allowed them to work with EPA \nto develop a plan of action to deal with an identified problem.\n  We should codify this directive, and this bill does just that.\n  Another Presidential directive that we should codify is allowing \nregulators to waive up to 100 percent of the punitive fines on small \nbusinesses for first-time violations where the firm acts quickly and \nsincerely to correct the problem.\n  While as a general rule, we should ensure that rules and regulations \nare enforced uniformly, it makes sense to provide regulators some \nflexibility in addressing the first-time regulatory infractions of a \nsmall business.\n  Small businesses trying to comply with regulations should be allowed \nto devote scarce resources to correcting problems instead of paying \nfines.\n  Here again the target of this measure is not only to provide \nregulatory relief to small business, it is to improve and enhance the \nrelationship between small businesses and Government agencies.\n  Though these last two provisions have been implemented by executive \norder, enacting them into law will give them permanence, and will \nprevent future Presidents from simply rescinding them through \nsubsequent Executive order.\n  An additional directive of the President's that merits the full force \nof Federal law is a prohibition against using personnel practices that \nreward agency employees, directly or indirectly, based on the number of \ncontacts made with small entities in pursuit of enforcement actions, or \non the amount of fines levied against small entities to enforce agency \nregulations.\n  The section responds to comments made to my office by small business \npeople who have reported that agency personnel have felt compelled to \nfind something wrong, even if it is small, in order to justify their \nvisit to the firm.\n  This goes to the heart of what the role of a regular is. Personnel \npractices based on these kinds of performance incentives may quite \nnaturally provoke adversarial relationships. Regulators need to remain \nindependent from the entities they oversee, but unnecessary antagonism \ncan actually hinder efforts to ensure compliance with the rules.\n  Mr. President, I want to reiterate my sincere and spirited support \nfor reforming the regulatory process that is currently in place.\n  The current system is not acceptable; the need for reform is clear \nand imperative.\n  And though the larger regulatory reform legislation has bogged down, \nI very much hope a compromise can be worked out and a meaningful reform \npackage can be enacted into law.\n  But, Mr. President, even if a compromise can be hammered out, it is \nlikely that it will still reflect a process-oriented approach that may \nprovide large corporate interests with avenues for relief, but does \nlittle to address the day-to-day problems facing small business.\n  Nor does such legislation address the very real feeling of small \nbusinesses that Government regulators too often act as adversaries \nrather than to provide guidance in helping firms to comply with the \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, the provisions of this bill are designed to help do \njust that.\n  The provisions outlined in this measure both provide some practical \nregulatory relief and can improve the relationship between businesses \nand agencies. The process reforms of other regulatory reform measures \nmerit our consideration, but I urge my colleagues not to allow that \napproach to dominate a debate which should rightly be focused on that \nportion of the business world that is most severely burdened by \nGovernment regulation--small business.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1350\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to encourage the furnishing of health care services \nto low-income individuals by exempting health care professionals from \nliability for negligence for certain health care services provided \nwithout charge except in cases of gross negligence or willful \nmisconduct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                the charitable medical care act of 1995\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce \nthe Charitable Medical Care Act of 1995. This legislation is designed \nto ensure that licensed providers, who, in good faith, provide medical \ntreatment without compensation, are not sued. Currently, because of \nmalpractice concerns, health care professionals have a disincentive to \nvolunteer their services. This act does not apply in situations of \ngross negligence or willful misconduct.\n  Protection from liability for voluntarily providing uncompensated \ncare is not a new idea. Currently, eight States, including my home \nState of Illinois, have laws in place that free doctors, who practice \nvoluntarily and in good faith, from at least some part of malpractice \nliability. These States include: Virginia, Utah, North Carolina, \nFlorida, Kentucky, South Carolina, Iowa, and Washington, DC.\n  My legislation builds upon existing Good Samaritan laws. Good \nSamaritan laws prevent an individual who acted \n\n[[Page S15405]]\nin good faith from liability in the event a mishap occurs. In 1959, \nCalifornia enacted the Nation's first Good Samaritan statute. Today, \nall 50 States, and Washington, DC, have adopted some form of a Good \nSamaritan statute. These statutes exempt the volunteers from tort \nliability for ordinary negligence in rendering emergency aid to an \nindividual. The rationale for these laws is to encourage health \nprofessionals to aid persons in need of assistance.\n  The need for free clinics and voluntarism by health professionals has \nnever been more striking. There were 41 million uninsured Americans in \nthis country last year. Voluntarism by health care professionals has \nbeen instrumental in providing health care to the uninsured. Free \nclinics have a preventative and primary care focus. They offer an \nalternative to emergency rooms, which have become family doctors to far \ntoo many. They also represent an enormous savings to the entire health \ncare system. In the tradition of family doctors, these clinics offer a \nprimary care continuum.\n  Free clinics supplement community clinics that provide care to those \nwithout insurance as well as those on Medicaid. Together these clinics \nprovide the majority of care in underserved communities. More than \n1,500 free and community clinics serve over 10 million individuals each \nyear in this country. In my State of Illinois last year, 17,350 people \nwere served and over $600,000 worth of care was provided. The potential \nimpact of charitable care is not insignificant. It is estimated that \ncharitable medical care provides care to 30 percent of the currently \nuninsured population.\n  Free clinics have served a valuable service and will continue to \nprovide vital access to health care to the poor. While I am a firm \nsupporter of universal coverage, it appears that, at least for a while, \nmillions of Americans will remain uncovered. The number of uninsured \nAmericans increased from 37.4 million in 1993 to 41 million in 1994, an \nincrease of nearly 4 million individuals. Proposed changes in Medicaid \nand Medicare will most certainly increase this number.\n  The role of free clinics and voluntarism by professionals is, and \nwill remain, an important part of the health care delivery system. This \nis particularly true in urban and rural underserved areas. Thus far, \nfree clinics have been very successful in serving the community. Their \nsuccess is due to their broad-based community support and the \nvoluntarism of the medical community. Medical liability suits are very \nrare.\n  Doctors and other medical personnel who voluntarily provide quality \nmedical care to the poor are an essential component of free/community \nclinics. Free clinics can not provide services, however, if barriers to \nvoluntarism remain. One of the best ways to increase voluntarism is \nthrough some protection from liability. It is critical that we \nencourage doctors to volunteer their services to those who cannot \nafford such care. I believe the legislation I am introducing today will \ngo a long way toward achieving this goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 1352. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to make \ntechnical corrections in maps relating to the Coastal Barrier Resources \nSystem; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n              coastal barrier resources system legislation\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I introduce legislation with my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Moynihan, which would correct a technical \nerror that has prevented certain residents of my State from \nparticipating in the National Flood Insurance Program. Specifically, \nthis bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to make technical \ncorrections in the current maps of the Coastal Barrier Resources System \n[COBRA]. A companion to this bill, H.R. 2005, was introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives by Congressman Michael Forbes on July 11, 1995 \nand was approved by the House Committee on Resources on September 27, \n1995. This necessary legislation is supported by the administration.\n  In 1990, the Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service \nmade a technical error when it designated part of the Point O'Woods \ncommunity on Fire Island in New York as part of an otherwise protected \narea [OPA]. As a result of this technical error, homeowners in this \npart of the country are restricted from protecting their properties \nthrough the purchase of Federal flood insurance.\n  Mr. President, the Fish and Wildlife Service concedes that the \ndesignation of these residences as part of an OPA was erroneous. The \nadministration testified in support of the House version of this \nlegislation before the Oceans, Fisheries, and Wildlife Subcommittee of \nthe House Committee on Resources. The inadvertent error in the COBRA \nmap has greatly complicated community efforts to relocate houses away \nfrom high erosion zones and otherwise practice effective coastal \nbarrier management. This legislation would allow the Point O'Woods \ncommunity the opportunity, which other American homeowners in similar \nareas currently have, to participate in the Federal Flood Insurance \nProgram. The Federal Government actively encourages participation in \nthis important program in order to minimize taxpayer costs in the event \nof a natural disaster.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter \nwritten to me by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in support of this \ncorrection and the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1352\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CORRECTION TO MAP.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior shall, \n     before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, make such corrections to the map \n     described in subsection (b) as are necessary--\n       (1) to move on that map the eastern boundary of the \n     excluded area covering Ocean Beach, Seaview, Ocean Bay Park, \n     and part of Point O'Woods to the western boundary of the \n     Sunken Forest Preserve; and\n       (2) to ensure that on that map the depiction of areas as \n     ``otherwise protected areas'' does not include any area that \n     is owned by the Point O'Woods Association (a privately held \n     corporation under the laws of the State of New York).\n       (b) Map Described.--The map described in this subsection is \n     the map that is included in a set of maps entitled ``Coastal \n     Barrier Resources System'', dated October 24, 1990, that \n     relates to the unit of the Coastal Barrier Resources System \n     entitled Fire Island Unit NY-59P.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                    Fish and Wildlife Service,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 1995.\n     Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator D'Amato, At the request of staff on the Senate \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works and the Committee \n     on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, I am writing to \n     inform you of the position of the Department of the Interior \n     on legislation to modify unit NY59P of the Coastal Barrier \n     Resources System. This letter is consistent with testimony \n     before the House Committee on Resources, which I have \n     enclosed.\n       The House Resources Committee is in the process of \n     reviewing H.R. 2005, a bill introduced by Congressman Forbes \n     making technical corrections to maps relating to the Coastal \n     Barrier Resources System. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service \n     supports passage of H.R. 2005 in its current form and agrees \n     with the removal of a portion of unit NY59P from the Coastal \n     Barrier System to correct a technical error. However, we \n     would oppose the addition of other provisions dealing with \n     any other units to this bill without full opportunity for \n     Service review.\n       H.R. 2005 seeks to remove a portion of unit NY59P, Fire \n     Island, New York, from the Coastal Barrier System. This unit \n     is part of the Fire Island National seashore and is mapped as \n     an otherwise protected area. Otherwise protected areas are \n     defined by the CBRA as coastal barriers which are ``included \n     within the boundaries of an area established under Federal, \n     State, or local law, or held by a qualified organization as \n     defined in Section 170(h)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1954, primarily for wildlife refuge, sanctuary, recreational, \n     or natural resource conservation purposes.'' The Department \n     of the Interior recommended to Congress that otherwise \n     protected areas not be included in the System and therefore \n     no further refinement of the mapped boundaries were made. \n     However, with the passage of the 1990 legislation, Congress \n     prohibited the sale of Federal flood insurance within \n     otherwise protected areas thus retaining these units in the \n     System. The property owned by the Point O'Woods Association \n     in unit NY59P is not part of this otherwise protected area \n     and therefore, was mistakenly included in the System.\n\n[[Page S15406]]\n\n       The Service recommends that the boundary of NY59P be \n     modified to remove the Point O'Woods property from within the \n     boundary of NY59P, and we support H.R. 2005 in its current \n     form. Please feel free to contact me or our Office of \n     Congressional and Legislative Services if you have questions \n     or require further information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             ------ ------ ------,\n\n                     Assistant Director, External Affairs.\n\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. \n        Lautenberg):\n  S. 1353. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to require the \ntransfer of certain Federal highway funds to a State highway safety \nprogram if a State fails to prohibit open containers of alcoholic \nbeverages and consumption of alcoholic beverages in the passenger area \nof motor vehicles, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n               The National Drunk Driving Prevention Act\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the National \nDrunk Driving Prevention Act which will put an end to our Nation' s \npolicy of tolerating open alcoholic containers in vehicles. I am \npleased that a strong bipartisan group of my colleagues are joining me \nin this effort as original cosponsors: Senator Boxer, Senator Bumpers, \nSenator Chafee, Senator DeWine, Senator Lautenberg, and Senator Murray.\n  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, it \nis still legal in 26 States in this country for passengers in a vehicle \nto have open containers of alcoholic beverages in vehicles while the \nvehicle is in operation. In six States it is perfectly legal for a \ndriver of a car to put one hand on the steering wheel and with the \nother, grab a bottle of whisky and drive off drinking. In my judgment, \nthis is unacceptable.\n  It seems to me that we should make it a matter of national policy \nthat there ought to be a strict separation between drinking and \ndriving. By tolerating drinking of alcoholic beverages in cars we are \nignoring one of the most deadly causes of traffic deaths in this \ncountry--people drinking while they drive.\n  During the period 1982 through 1993, approximately 266,000 persons \nlost their lives in alcohol-related traffic accidents. In 1993, over \n17,000 people died on our Nation's roads in alcohol-related accidents--\nthat's an average of 1 every 30 minutes. That figure is about 40 \npercent of the total number of traffic fatalities in the United States \nin 1993. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration \n[NHTSA], estimates that over 1 million persons a year are injured in \nalcohol-related crashes--an average of 1 person every 26 seconds.\n  Especially disturbing is the fact that drunk driving is a major \nkiller of youths. According to the National Commission Against Drunk \nDriving, alcohol-related traffic fatalities hit the youth more than any \nother group. In 1993, youths were killed at a rate of 11 alcohol-\nrelated traffic fatalities per 100,000 license drivers compared to 8 \nper 100,000 for adult drivers. Traffic crashes are the greatest single \ncause of death for every age between the ages of 6 and 32--almost half \nof these crashes are alcohol-related.\n  This legislation would make the roads throughout the Nation safer by \nrequiring all States to enact open container laws. If a State does not \ncomply within 4 years, 1.5 percent of its Federal highway construction \nfunds would be transferred to its Federal allocation of highway safety \nfunds.\n  The 1991 ISTEA legislation--Intermodal Surface Transportation and \nEfficiency Act--authorized incentive grants to States which would allow \nStates a 5-percent increase in highway traffic safety allocations if \nthat State has enacted legislation prohibiting open containers. The \nfact is that incentive grants have not worked--over half of the States \ncontinue to permit open containers in vehicles. I think the results \nspeak for themselves.\n  It seems to me that stronger efforts must be made. Since half the \nStates have not enacted open container laws, the Congress must do \nsomething at the Federal level to urge States to take action. Incentive \ngrants have been available for some time and we seem to have not made \nmuch progress under that approach.\n  Earlier this year, I offered an amendment to S. 440, the National \nHighways Systems Designation Act, which was very similar to this \nlegislation. This bill differs in that it provides States with 2 more \nyears to comply. Under this legislation, States would have until 1999 \nto enact laws prohibiting open containers in vehicles.\n  Drinking and driving cannot be seen as a personal moral decision. \nWhen someone decides to drink and drive, that person is not simply \nputting himself and others in danger. That person is a threat to \ninnocent drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. The odds are that 2 out \nof every 5 Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related traffic \naccident, regardless of their drinking habits.\n  The fact is that every third drunk driving fatality is an innocent \nvictim--a nondrinking driver, passenger, or pedestrian. Under the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, the Federal \nGovernment is requiring States to enact laws requiring the use of seat \nbelts and helmets, which are matters of personal safety, in the \ninterest of traffic safety. Allowing individuals to mix drinking and \ndriving is not just a matter of personal safety--it is a matter of \npublic safety with serious public concerns. All the more reason, I \nbelieve, for the Congress to require States to address this concern.\n  This legislation takes a positive step and makes good public policy. \nThis bill provides a strong incentive for States to enact laws \nprohibiting the insane behavior of drinking in a moving vehicle. If \nStates fail to comply, States would not lose any Federal funds. Rather, \nStates would have 1.5 percent--in fiscal year 1999--or 3 percent--in \nany fiscal years thereafter--transferred to its Federal allocation of \nhighway safety funds.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1353\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, with the rise of democracy all over \nthe world, \n\n[[Page S15408]]\nU.S. companies are facing greater competition than ever before in \ninternational markets. Over the next several decades, Asia will \nrepresent one-half of the world's new electric capacity. As India and \nPakistan move to free market economies they will quadruple their \nelectricity supply over the next 20 years.\n  As emerging nations design energy policy and negotiate global \nsecurity, they look to the United States for counsel. Secretary \nO'Leary's expertise has been sought to lead energy discussions in \ninternational forums by world leaders such as Indian Prime Minister \nRao, Pakistan Prime Minister Bhutto, and South African President Nelson \nMandela. As the United States competes aggressively for market share \nagainst European companies, Secretary O'Leary's personal visits to \nthese distant markets have given American business a competitive \nadvantage.\n  Past trade missions to India led to $10 billion in trade agreements \nbetween the United States and India, as well as opened the channels of \ncommunication for an ongoing discussion on nuclear safety and \ndeveloping a sustainable energy future for India.\n  During her 1994 visit to Pakistan, Secretary O'Leary advanced $4 \nbillion in United States business and signed three agreements designed \nto encourage the global exchange of ideas. Her involvement also helped \ncreate the United States-Pakistan Energy Committee which looks to \nexpand commercial activities in the environmental sector in both \ncountries.\n  Secretary O'Leary's 1995 visit to China culminated in $4.6 billion \nworth of trade agreements, averaging nearly 20,000 jobs in the United \nStates. During this trip, the Secretary signed five agreements between \nthe DOE and the Government of China to encourage energy efficiency and \nrural electrification.\n  Secretary O'Leary has brought together the best of American energy \ncompanies and government specialists to expand U.S. influence in the \ngrowing global market. Her visits have created thousands of jobs here \nin the United States, as well as promoted sustainable energy \ndevelopment in emerging nations. We should applaud Secretary O'Leary's \noutstanding efforts on behalf of U.S. energy interests in international \nmarkets. Her past achievements and future accomplishments are worthy of \nbipartisan support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15407-5", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO KICKAPOO HIGH SCHOOL\n\n   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute \nto Kickapoo High School in Springfield, MO. On October 25, Kickapoo \nHigh School will celebrate its 25th anniversary. Since opening its \ndoors in 1971, over 8,000 students have graduated from Kickapoo High \nSchool, and about 75 percent of those graduates have gone on to attend \ncollege.\n  These graduating students have attained many honors and excelled in \nmany areas ranging from earning exceptional scholastic achievements to \nparticipating in community service programs for credit. Students have \nalso benefited from independent study programs in advanced and \nspecialized fields, foreign language programs, and the Career Center \nand the Learning Resource Center designed for students with special \nneeds.\n  Kickapoo High School was designated by the U.S. Department of \nEducation as a secondary school that represents educational excellence. \nIt has received a AAA classification by the Missouri State Department \nof Elementary and Secondary Education. I commend Kickapoo High School \nfor its dedication to providing the highest quality education to our \nyoung people. I also congratulate the men and women educators for 25 \nyears of service and wish them only success in the next 25 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15408-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO REV. JOE VICKERS\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \nTennessean who has played an important role in the community of \nGoodlettsville for nearly 35 years. Since 1961, Rev. Joe Vickers has \nbeen the pastor of Goodlettsville Cumberland Presbyterian Church. On \nSunday, October 29, Reverend Vickers is retiring as pastor and \nbeginning a new stage of his life. Today, I would like to thank Joe \nVickers for his longstanding commitment to his church, his family, and \nhis community, and wish him well as he begins his retirement.\n  Originally from Memphis, TN, Reverend Vickers graduated from the \nUniversity of Mississippi on a football scholarship. After serving in \nthe Army, Vickers entered the 4-year seminary program at Bethel College \nand became a Presbyterian minister.\n  Mr. President, when Joe Vickers came to Goodlettsville, his church \nhad 70 members. During his tenure as pastor, the Goodlettsville \nCumberland Presbyterian membership has grown dramatically. Now, that \nchurch is 1,000 members strong, and should continue to thrive in the \nyears to come.\n  As a minister, Reverend Vickers nurtured his congregation well, but \nhe also nurtured his community. For 35 years, Vickers was a neighbor, \nan adviser, a leader, and a friend to the people of Goodlettsville. His \nservice to the community and church was an example of strong faith for \nmany children and youth. He joined couples in marriage, consoled those \nwho experienced a physical, emotional or spiritual loss, and taught the \nlessons of life alongside of the lessons of Christ. Those who know Joe \nVickers know that even in retirement, he will remain a friend, an \nadviser and a leader to many people in the area.\n  Mr. President, after he retires, Joe Vickers will continue to live in \nGoodlettsville with his wife Mary Catherine, and will remain active in \nthe church as its minister emeritus. He will also remain a vital part \nof the community. And on Sunday, October 29, members of Reverend \nVickers' family, his church family, and his friends in the community \nwill gather to honor this man and his accomplishments. And as he \nretires, they will look at the foundation Reverend Vickers has laid for \nhis family, his church, and the city of Goodlettsville, and they will \nsee that it is strong and solid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15408-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, we are waiting for one response from the \nother side of the Senate, but it will be my intention to ask for \nconsent that at 12 noon the Senate proceed to S. 1322 regarding the \nEmbassy in Israel. Therefore, votes can be expected to occur in \nrelation to that bill, but not to occur prior to the hour of 5 p.m. \nMonday. I will not make that request at this time because we are \nwaiting for one call.\n  But in addition to that bill, the Senate could be asked to turn to \nany of the following items on Monday and Tuesday of next week: S. 1328, \nregarding Federal judgeships; S. 1004, Coast Guard authorization; S. \n325, technical corrections in laws relating to Native Americans.\n  By Wednesday of next week it will be the leader's intention to begin \nthe reconciliation bill, which all Members know has a statutory \nlimitation of 20 hours. Therefore, late nights can be expected next \nweek.\n  Mr. President, let me state that it was our intention to bring up S. \n1322 today. But we have been in negotiations most of the morning in my \noffice and part of this afternoon, and there are negotiations going on \nnow with interested parties, parties interested in S. 1322, with \nrepresentatives at the White House, representatives of the \n\n[[Page S15409]]\nPresident, and we believe that by Monday we will be in a position to \nindicate to our colleagues on both sides that we have reached some \nagreement. But, if not, we will proceed with S. 1322 in its present \nform. The reason for asking consent--which we are still waiting for--is \nthat otherwise I would need to file cloture today on a motion to \nproceed. So, if consent is not obtained, then we will proceed on that. \nI think we will have consent here momentarily.\n   So if we can obtain that consent, there would be no further business \nto come before the Senate except brief remarks by the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair advises the Senator from North Dakota that we have been \noperating in morning business on a Senator-by-Senator basis, so if he \ncan ask unanimous consent for the time he will need.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield? Will he ask in his request that \nthe Senator from California be allowed 15 minutes following the \nSenator?\n  Mr. CONRAD. And I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nCalifornia be granted 15 minutes after I conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We believe it has severe consequences for \nthe people in this country. We believe there are very sharp cuts in \nMedicare and Medicaid that are going to mean increased burdens for our \nsenior citizens, are going to mean hospital closures all across \nAmerica, and especially in rural America, that there are going to be \nmany people who are elderly, who are ill, who are not going to have the \nkind of care that they deserve.\n  Much of that is being done in order to provide a tax reduction that \nwill go disproportionately to the wealthiest among us. Many on our side \nof the aisle, I believe everyone on our side of the aisle, believes \nthat is an inappropriate set of priorities.\n  One thing our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said, \nand said repeatedly, is that they are balancing the budget by the year \n2002. Mr. President, that is not accurate. Senator Dorgan and I, 2 days \nago asked the head of the Congressional Budget Office for an analysis, \nif the law of the United States is followed, will the reconciliation \nplan put forward by the Republicans balance the budget in the year 2002 \nor not?\n  The head of the Congressional Budget Office reported to us in a \nletter yesterday, with a revised letter today, that if the law of the \nUnited States is followed--that is, if Social Security surpluses are \nnot included in the calculation, which under our law is specifically \nexcluded; that is, we are not to count Social Security surpluses in \ndetermining whether or not the budget of the United States is in \nbalance--when that calculation is made, the head of the budget office \ntold us in a letter dated today, ``excluding an estimated off-budget \nsurplus of $115 billion in 2002.''\n  Again, let me read that phrase, ``excluding an estimated off-budget \nsurplus of $115 billion in 2002,'' that is primarily Social Security \nsurpluses, if those are excluded ``from the calculation, CBO would \nproject an on-budget deficit of $105 billion in the year 2002.'' Not a \nsurplus, not a balanced budget, a $105 billion deficit in 2002.\n  Let me just say, I think anybody who knows anything about accounting \nwould understand you do not count Social Security surpluses in \ncalculating whether you have balanced the budget or not. Why is that? \nThat is because the Social Security trust fund has been set up to run \nsurpluses in preparation for the time the baby boom generation retires.\n  Unfortunately, all those surpluses are being spent, and what is \nhappening is we are using that money today instead of saving it or \npaying down the existing debt to better prepare ourselves to meet that \ndemographic time bomb. That is a profound mistake.\n  Let me just make clear, if any company in the United States tried to \ntake the retirement funds of its employees and put them into the pot to \nbalance the budget, they would be in violation of Federal law. Indeed, \nthat is precisely what has been happening in the United States. It has \nbeen going on since 1983. It should not be permitted to continue. We \nhave already run up almost $500 billion of IOU's, but that is going to \ngrow geometrically over the next 18 years.\n  We have a chance to get our house in order. We have a narrow window \nof opportunity, and we ought to take advantage of it. We should not be \nlooting and raiding the Social Security trust funds in order to assert \nthat we are balancing the budget. That is not truthful. And I am \npleased to say the Congressional Budget Office has now acknowledged \nthat the budget will not be in balance by 2002 but, in fact, will have \na $105 billion deficit in that year.\n  I think there are other reasons the Republicans in the Budget \nCommittee at least were not eager to have a further discussion of the \nreconciliation bill. I think there are a lot of things they would \nprefer the American people not hear before votes are held and cast on \nthat measure.\n  One of the things they may not be eager for the American people to \nhear is that there is going to be a $1.3 trillion increase in the \nnational debt under the Republican plan. That is the cumulative \nincrease in the debt that is being added to the $4.9 trillion in debt \nwe already have in this country. They are going to add, under their \nplan, another $1.3 trillion of debt. Yet, they insist on a tax \nreduction, a tax cut, primarily going to the wealthiest among us, which \nwill add to this debt.\n  What sense does that make? I can say to my colleagues that when I \nqueried the people of my State, they made it clear to me to balance the \nbudget first before there is any tax cut. We can have tax cuts after we \nbalance the budget. We are not balancing the budget, No. 1; No. 2, we \nare adding $1.3 trillion to the national debt, and $245 billion of that \nis tax cuts which, again, primarily go to the wealthiest among us.\n  Let me just go a little further so that people have a chance to hear \nwhat is in this tax package that has just passed, because we have heard \non the other side of the aisle the assertion that this is a significant \ntax cut that would go to American families. I wish that were true. I \nwish it were true that it was really directed at the middle class, \nbecause while I believe it is not the time for tax cuts, when you are \nadding $1.3 trillion to the national debt and you have not really \nbalanced the budget in 7 years, and even with that I think we could \nlook more kindly upon a tax cut if it were really directed at the \nmiddle class. That is not where this tax cut is directed.\n  In fact, what we learned yesterday is that the Senate Republican plan \nwould mean tax increases for everyone earning under $30,000 a year. \nThose earning under $30,000 a year, which are 51 percent of the \nAmerican people, get a tax hike. They get their taxes increased. I will \ndemonstrate that point by asking unanimous consent that the tables be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tables were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                                                                                                                        \n\n[[Page S15410]]\n      TAX PROVISIONS IN THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE, CHAIRMAN'S MARK FOR REVENUE RECONCILIATION AND THE EITC PROVISIONS PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE      \n                                                                      COMMITTEE\\1\\                                                                      \n                                                                  [1996 INCOME LEVELS]                                                                  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              Federal taxes under current law\\2\\      Change in Federal taxes\\3\\       Total Federal taxes after change \n                                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             As a        As a                    As a        As a                    As a        As a   \n Family economic income class\\4\\ (thousands)    Amount    percent of  percent of    Amount    percent of  percent of    Amount    percent of  percent of\n                                               (billion)    pre-tax    after-tax   (billion)    pre-tax    aFter-tax   (billion)    pre-tax    after-tax\n                                                            income      income                  income      income                  income      income  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0 to 10.....................................        $5.7         8.0         8.7        $0.2        0.3         0.4         $5.9         8.4         9.1\n10 to 20....................................        21.5         8.8         9.7         0.8        0.3         0.3         22.2         9.1        10.0\n20 to 30....................................        50.1        13.3        15.4         1.3        0.4         0.4         51.4        13.7        15.8\n30 to 50....................................       156.3        17.5        21.2        -5.7       (0.6)       (0.8)       150.6        16.8        20.4\n50 to 75....................................       224.0        19.9        24.8       -10.4       (0.9)       (1.1)       213.6        19.0        23.7\n75 to 100...................................       196.1        21.1        26.7       -10.0       (1.1)       (1.4)       186.1        20.0        25.3\n100 to 200..................................       303.0        22.0        28.1       -12.5       (0.9)       (1.2)       290.5        21.1        27.0\n200 and over................................       316.6        23.7        31.1        -9.5       (0.7)       (0.9)       307.1        23.0        30.1\n                                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total\\5\\................................     1.275.1        20.1        25.2       -45.8       (0.7)       (0.9)     1,229.3        19.4        24.3\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Department of the Treasury Office of Tax Analysis, October 18, 1995.                                                                            \n\\1\\This table distributes the estimated change in tax burdens due to the tax provisions in the Senate Finance Committee Chairman's Mark (JCX-44-95,     \n  September 16 1995); and the EITC provisions adopted by the Committee on September 30, 1995.                                                           \n\\2\\The taxes included are individual and corporate income, payroll (Social Security and unemployment) and excises.

Capital gains are computed on an accrual basis, adjusted  \n  for inflation to the extent reliable data allow, inflationary losses of lenders are subtracted and of borrowers are added. There is also an adjustment\n  for accelerated depreciation of noncorporate businesses. FEI is spent on a family rather than on a tax return basis. The economic incomes of all      \n  members of a family unit are added to arrive at the family's economic income used in the distribution.                                                \n\\5\\Families with negative incomes are included in the total line but not shown separately.                                                              \n                                                                                                                                                        \n\n\n\nDISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS OF REVENUE RECONCILIATION PROVISIONS OF THE CHAIRMAN'S MARK SCHEDULED FOR MARKUP IN THE FINANCE COMMITTEE ON OCTOBER 18, 1995 AND\n                                                        PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED CHANGES IN THE EITC\\1\\                                                       \n                                                                  [Calendar year 2000]                                                                  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      Change in Federal      Federal taxes\\3\\ under    Federal taxes\\3\\ under     Effective tax rate\\4\\ \n                                                          taxes\\3\\                 present law                proposal         -------------------------\n               Income category\\2\\                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Present law    Proposal \n                                                    Millions     Percent      Billions     Percent      Billions     Percent     (percent)    (percent) \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLess than $10,000...............................         $879          9.6           $9          0.7          $10          0.7          8.6          9.4\n$10,000 to $20,000..............................          922          2.2           42          3.0           43          3.1          9.0          9.2\n$20,000 to $30,000..............................          417          0.5           86          6.1           87          6.3         13.6         13.6\n$30,000 to $40,000..............................       -4,221         -3.4          125          8.9          121          8.8         16.7         16.2\n$40,000 to $50,000..............................       -5,347         -4.0          132          9.4          127          9.2         18.4         17.6\n$50,000 to $75,000..............................      -11,740         -4.2          280         19.9          269         19.5         20.5         19.5\n$75,000 to $100,000.............................       -5,814         -2.8          209         14.8          203         14.8         22.9         22.1\n$100,000 to $200,000............................       -3,850         -1.6          246         17.5          242         17.6         24.1         23.4\n$200,000 and over...............................       -2,792         -1.0          277         19.7          274         19.9         29.8         28.8\n    Total, all taxpayers........................      -31,546         -2.2        1,407        100.0        1,375        100.0         20.4         19.7\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\Includes the tax credit for children under age 18, student loan interest credit, marriage penalty relief, IRA changes, long term care, capital gains \n  deduction, treatment of adoption expense, aviation fuel exemption, and repeal of the wine and flavors credit as well as EITC changes previously       \n  adopted by the Senate Finance Committee.                                                                                                              \n\\2\\The income concept used to place tax returns into income categories is adjusted gross income (AGI) plus: [1] tax-exempt interest, [2] employer       \n  contributions for health plans and life insurance, [3] employer share of FICA tax, [4] worker's compensation, [5] nontaxable social security benefits,\n  [6] insurance value of Medicare benefits, [7] alternative minimum tax preference items, and [8] excluded income of U.S. citizens living abroad.       \n  Categories are measured at 1995 levels.                                                                                                               \n\\3\\Federal taxes are equal to individual income tax (including the outlay portion of the EITC), employment tax (attributed to employees), and excise    \n  taxes (attributed to consumers).

They go, disproportionately, to the wealthiest among of us; 48 \npercent goes to people earning over $100,000 a year. We can see on this \nchart that the top 5 percent of the people, 2.8 million families making \nover $200,000, get, on average, a $3,400 tax break. People earning over \n$200,000 a year get a $3,400 tax break. The richest 1 million families \nin America, those making over $350,000, get a $5,600 tax break.\n  Mr. President, I say to you, I do not think that is fair. I do not \nthink it is fair to increase the taxes of those earning less than \n$30,000 a year in order to concentrate tax breaks on those who are the \nwealthiest among us, to give a $3,400 tax break to the top 5 percent, \nthose earning over $200,000, and a $5,600 tax break to the top 1 \npercent, those earning over $350,000 a year.\n  Mr. President, this is the chart that was provided for us yesterday \nthat shows the distributional effect of tax provisions in the Senate \nFinance Committee chairman's mark for revenue reconciliation and the \nearned income tax provisions previously adopted by the committee. When \nyou take into consideration previous changes in the earned income tax \ncredit and the changes in this package, one finds that people earning \nup to $30,000 all experience a slight tax increase under this plan. But \nthose who are earning above that amount experience a tax reduction. But \nlet us see who gets what. Those earning from $30,000 to $50,000 a year \nget less than $250 of tax reduction a year, while those earning over \n$200,000 a year, get $3,400 in tax reduction. That does not strike me \nas fair. It does not strike me as balanced. It does not strike me as \nthe kind of targeted tax relief that is seriously intended to help \nhard-pressed middle income families in this country.\n  Mr. President, this redistributional effect, taking from those who \nare of more modest income, those earning up to $30,000 a year, and \ngiving them a tax increase and reducing taxes for the wealthiest among \nus, giving 48 percent of the benefit to those who are earning over \n$100,000 a year, continues a trend that I think ought to concern us \nall, and that is the concentration of wealth in this country in the \nhands of fewer and fewer people.\n  This chart shows the share of wealth of the top 1 percent of the \nhouseholds in America. In 1969, 20 percent of the wealth in this \ncountry was in the hands of the top 1 percent. By 1979, 30 percent of \nthe wealth of this country was controlled by the top 1 percent. But by \n1989, 39 percent of the wealth of America was held in the top 1 percent \nof this country.\n  Mr. President, anybody who has studied history knows what this trend \nmeans. When wealth is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few, \nit leads to political instability, it leads to, I think, a threat to \nall of our institutions. It is no wonder that people are angry across \nAmerica, as they see the wealth of the Nation concentrated in fewer and \nfewer hands. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been \nquick to accuse the Democrats of being for redistribution of income. \nLet me say that our friends on the other side of the aisle have been \nthe champions of income and wealth redistribution.\n  Over and over and over, in committee after committee, our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle have pursued \n\n[[Page S15411]]\npolicies that concentrate wealth in the hands of those who are already \nthe wealthiest among us. I ask the simple question, how much wealth do \nthe top 1 percent want to have in their hands? They have nearly 40 \npercent now. Do they want 60 percent of the wealth of America in the \nhands of just 1 percent of the people? Do they insist on 80 percent of \nthe wealth in the hands of just 1 percent of the people? I do not think \nthis is good social policy. I do not think it is good economic policy. \nI think it threatens the future of the country.\n  Mr. President, 73 percent of the American people pay more taxes in \npayroll taxes than they pay in income taxes. Yet, what is happening \nunder the Republican plan is to take payroll taxes--the only way to \njustify payroll taxes at their current levels is if you are building \nsurpluses to prepare for the day when the baby boom generation retires. \nBut all of those moneys are being spent, not saved. They are being \ntaken and spent in other areas of the budget. And so what is really \nhappening is an enormous redistribution of wealth. Make no mistake \nabout it. We are taking payroll tax money, generating surpluses and not \nsaving them, but spending them. And we are spending part of them to \ngive a big tax reduction to the wealthiest among us, so we are taking \npayroll taxes that are regressive. That simply means lower income \npeople pay a higher percentage of their income in payroll taxes, taking \nmoney from them and flushing it back out in a tax cut to the wealthiest \namong us. Forty-eight percent of the benefit goes to the top 1 percent.\n  That is what is going on here. It is an enormous redistribution of \nwealth, going from middle-income people, because under the Republican \nplan, 51 percent of the people, those earning less than $30,000 a year, \nare going to experience a tax increase. The money is being taken from \nthem in payroll taxes and other taxes, and part of it is then being \nused to give a big tax cut to the wealthiest among us. I do not think \nthat is fair or right. I do not think it represents American values.\n  Mr. President, I think that is the reason the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee was so swift to gavel the Budget Committee into adjournment, \nbecause they did not want to see and hear these facts being provided to \nthe American people.\n  They want to pass this in the dead of night without a chance for the \nAmerican people to see and hear what these plans will mean for the \npeople of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Would the Senator from California yield to me for a few \nmoments to put the final words in the Record?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Of course, as long as I do not lose my right to 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Helms). The Senator's rights will be \npreserved.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure \nSenator Murray has 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President. It is unusual for Senators to \ntake to the floor on a Friday afternoon long after the Senate has \nconcluded most of its business when there are no votes.\n  Today is an unusual day for members of the Budget Committee. We have \nheard from the Senator from North Dakota who has worked so long and \nhard to present a truly balanced budget--not only to the committee but \nto the Senate and to the American people. It was my privilege to \nsupport him.\n  He showed, as did Senator Bradley from New Jersey, that it is, in \nfact, possible to balance the budget in America over 7 years, do it \ntruthfully, not relying on Social Security surplus, and do it with a \nheart and with compassion, with common sense, with caring, with pride, \nthat really reflects the values of America.\n  What are those values? You reward hard work, as in the earned-income \ntax credit. You make sure that your children have a chance to get the \nproper immunizations as in Medicaid. We make sure that when our kids \nare students they could get college loans. We make sure that if our \npeople run into trouble and they have to collect child support, that \nthe Government does not penalize them for it.\n  We make sure that large corporations pay a tax, as in the alternative \nminimum tax, which is repealed by the Republicans. We make sure large \ncorporations are good citizens and do not raid pension funds. \nRepublicans do that, too.\n  And we make sure that when our people reach the age of 65, they can \ncount on Medicare. If they are having to go into a nursing home, that \nthere are decent standards for those nursing homes, which are repealed \nby the Republicans. I will talk more about that.\n  Today, the Democrats and the Republicans came around a long table in \nthe Budget Committee. When we walked in, we saw a bill that was so \ntall--of course, I am not very tall, that is true--but this bill was so \ntall that I could barely see my next door neighbor on the committee, \nSenator Murray. I kind of used it as a chin rest.\n  That is the size of this Republican revolution. That is the number of \nthings they are doing in this budget reconciliation bill. That is why \nwe Democrats felt it was important to hear from some of the people who \nrepresent those in America, our great country, who will be impacted by \nthis 1992 revolution, if you will.\n  So our ranking member, Senator Exon, a Senator who has served here \nwith great distinction--and I might add, is in his senior years--asked \nin a very nice way if, in fact, four people could be heard before we \nstart to vote on this package.\n  Who are those four people? One was an honor student who happens to be \nin a wheelchair, a quadriplegic, who counts on Medicaid for his very \nbreath. We found out that in the Republican plan--and I ask my friend \nto correct me if I am incorrect in this--the Medicaid cuts are so deep \nthat no longer will people like that who are trying so hard to build \nthe American dream--an honor student--will not be able to count on \ntheir oxygen supply.\n  I found that out today. I did not know it when I walked into the \nroom. \n\n[[Page S15412]]\n We needed more time. I told my friend in North Dakota, and I am sure \nhe would help me, along with my friend from Washington State, that we \nought to have an amendment, take away 5 cents a year from the people \nover $350,000, from the tax break they are getting, and pay for oxygen \nfor people like this.\n  Who else wanted to speak? Two elderly women who live on Medicare. By \nthe way, in my home State of California, the average woman of 65 earns \n$8,500 a year. In California, that is brutally hard. She already spends \na third of her income on health care. Think about that. Do the math on \nthat.\n  How could she possibly be asked to spend another $1,000 to $2,000 a \nyear? That is what the Republican plan calls for. We in the Budget \nCommittee, Democrats, wanted to hear from a person who could give us \nthe truth.\n  Then there was a woman who had served 20 years in the military. Her \nchild is very ill. On a military salary she needs to count on Medicaid \nfor her child. We wanted her to be here. Well, no. It was interesting, \nbecause it was the first time in my life--I have been in the Congress \nfor 13 years--that a chairman of a committee adjourned us without \nallowing us to vote on whether to hear these people. He ruled that they \nhad no right to be heard, and when we appealed the ruling of the Chair \nhe refused to honor that and gavelled us down. He said he was very \ndisappointed we did not just vote on that budget.\n  Well I am glad we have the weekend for Americans to look at what is \nin it.\n  I am going to go to a couple of charts to give the big picture on \nthis. This is the basic bill that already passed the House of \nRepresentatives, a $58 billion increase in the military. We are talking \nhere between 1996 and 2002, 7 years--that is $30 billion more than the \nPentagon asked for.\n  All the admirals and generals said ``Yes, we need some more,'' but \nRepublicans gave them $58 billion. The nondefense money that we spend \non education and transportation, environmental protection, food safety, \nhighways, airport safety, those kind of things, on a cut of $499 \nbillion, how is that for symmetry?\n\n  Now we move to what we call entitlements, things we do to help people \nbecause this is America and we want everyone to get a chance. So, $270 \nbillion cut in Medicare, $182 billion cut in Medicaid, $13 billion cut \nin ag, $10 billion cut in student loans, welfare, earned income tax \ncredits. Food stamps, that is another $100 billion. That is the budget \nthat they are so proud of.\n  Now, what happened was that Newt Gingrich promised the crown jewel of \nthe Republican contract would be a tax break for the wealthiest people \nin America. And he had to figure out a way to get the money for it, \nbecause it was going to cost a lot of money. He wanted the people over \n$350,000 to get back about $20,000 a year. By the way, he settled for \nabout $5,500 a year.\n  Let me repeat that. Newt Gingrich wanted the people who earn over \n$350,000 a year to get back $20,000 a year, and he had to find the \nmoney. So he thought, how can I find the money? Aha, where is there \nmoney? Medicare and Medicaid. So let us try and scare the people into \nthinking we have to cut that much out of it, and then we will turn \naround and just give all that money to the wealthiest among us.\n  What I have here is the trustees' reports on the Medicare trust fund, \ngoing back to 1970. I want to point out that, from 1970 to the present, \nit was only twice that the trustees reported we did not have to do \nsomething to save Medicare. In other words, this is a routine thing \nthat happens with the trust fund. But people do not know this. So the \nRepublicans said, ``Let's make a big hoopla out of this year's \ntrustees' report.''\n  So, clearly, we know we have to act to save Medicare. We know how \nmuch we have to cut. In order to save Medicare we need to cut $89 \nbillion. We need to cut $89 billion out of Medicare. And, by the way, \nit is not that easy to do it, but we can find the savings. We can make \nthe adjustments. My goodness, there is enough fraud there we can go \nafter, so we think we can do that without pain. So, remember that \nnumber, $89 billion is what we need to save Medicare.\n  But, remember what I told you, they need a lot of money for a tax \ncut. So they decided to cut $270 billion from Medicare. Keep it in \nmind. We needed $89 billion; they are cutting $270 billion. And why? \nNot because the trustees' report says to do that. We know the trustees' \nreport indicates where we need to cut $89 billion. Here is why, the \nnext chart will show it.\n  They need $245 billion for their tax cut. For their tax cut. But, \nguess what, in their zeal they made a big mistake, as the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has said. They did not really do their homework, because \nin the end they are producing a tax increase for 51 percent of the \npeople, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Wall Street Journal \nis, in fact, a party that is not known to stand up and fight for \nDemocrats. On the contrary. And the Wall Street Journal says those \nearning $30,000 and below, in our country, will see a tax increase as a \nresult of Newt Gingrich's revolution. And who will benefit the most? \nThe people who earn over $350,000 a year. And let me tell you, they are \nchilling the champagne bottles tonight in those board rooms and those \npenthouses.\n  Now, we set them back a little because we stopped it in the Budget \nCommittee. We said the American people have to see the truth. We took \nthe light and we shined it on this budget, and we are telling the \nAmerican people, in dollars and cents, what it means.\n  I want to show you a chart that reflects what has happened in America \nwith our tax policy since the 1940's. It is very interesting. I got \nthis chart out of a story in the New Yorker that basically asked the \nquestion, ``What has happened to the middle class?'' The middle class \nis going away.\n  It is fascinating to see this chart. From 1947 to 1973, taxpayers in \nevery single quintile--and each quintile represents an income bracket. \nSo from the very lowest income bracket, No. 1, to the highest, No. 5, \nevery one went up at about the same rate, from 1947 to 1973. What does \nthat mean? We all prospered together. We all are in this together and \nwe all did well together.\n  I always thought there was an agreement among Republicans and \nDemocrats that that was best for our country. Yes, when the poor do \nwell and the middle class do well and the wealthy do well, we are all \nbenefiting from this great Nation. That is the way it should be.\n  Look what happened, starting in 1973, to 1993. We turned this picket \nfence into a staircase. But look at it. It is Robin Hood in reverse. \nThe ones who were doing the worst are poorest, the first two quintiles. \nAnd by far, this little cat--some might say fat cat--sitting on the \nlast quintile, that is the one that goes up to millions and billions, \nthat did by far the best.\n  What America is better for our people? One in which we all prosper, \nor one in which only the very wealthy prosper? That is the question I \nwant the American people and the people of California to ponder over \nthis weekend. Since we were able to get a little bit of time, we are \ntaking the floor of the U.S. Senate to bring these issues home.\n  Let me tell you, buried in this budget are some awful things for \nfolks. I have heard from hospitals in my State of California who are \ndesperate, desperate about the cuts that will come to them, from \nseniors who are frightened about the cuts that will come to them, from \npeople who have moms and dads in nursing homes who are frightened to \ndeath what will happen to their parents.\n  By the way, we call them the sandwich generation. They are caught in \nthe middle. Their teenage kids have to go to college. How can they \nexperience a day in peace, worrying about their kids on the one hand \nand all the challenges we have, economic and otherwise, raising our \nkids, and our parents on the other.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator is granted 2 additional minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  So, this budget is a slam at American values. It is a slam at family \nvalues. It repeals nursing home standards. Why do we have them? Because \nwe learned in the 1980's what happens to old people who are helpless. \nAnd we needed to put national standards in place so they would not get \nbed sores, so they would \n\n[[Page S15413]]\nnot be scalded, so they would not be abused physically, sexually, so \nthey could have a little dignity in a very difficult time, after they \nraised their kids.\n  Family values? This is the opposite of family values. This is turning \nour backs on our people whom we are here to fight for. Nursing \nhomeowners? Or the people? I do not know what is popular today or what \nis unpopular. But I know where I stand. I stand with my colleague for \nthe people, for the people of my State and the people of my Nation. I \nam a first-generation American. I was taught by my parents hard work, \nplay by the rules, stand up and fight for what you believe in, honor \nthe children, honor the elderly, and have love in your heart for those \nwho may not be as fortunate as you.\n  So this budget debate is very important. And when the budget chairman \nslammed down that gavel and said ``adjourned, we are not listening \nanymore, we do not want to hear it, we do not want to hear it,'' it \nsent a chill up and down my spine. But I believe that my Democratic \ncolleagues on that committee are more resolved than ever to show that \nwe can balance the budget and do it in a smart way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, might I have 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I just want to thank my colleague from California. I hope the people \nfrom California know what a fighter they have in the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer. I am so proud to be a member of the Budget \nCommittee with her because over and over during these discussions and \ndebates, she has stood up and fought for the middle class and the \nworking families, and said, ``Now, wait a minute. Let us understand \nwhat the implications are of these policies that are being pursued. Who \nwins? Who loses? Who is helped? Who is hurt?''\n  I just want to say once again that I appreciate the strong stance she \nhas taken to say we ought to have a policy that is fair. That is an \nAmerican standard; that is an American value; that we stand up and \nfight for something that is fair in this country, that asks everybody \nto contribute in this budget battle, not just to say to the working \nclass and middle-income people get in the front lines of this budget \nbattle, but to say to those who are the wealthiest among us as well \nthat you ought to participate, too. That is the American way.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Madam President. I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak in morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you.\n  Madam President, I am here today to join my colleague from North \nDakota and my colleague from California to express my surprise and \noutrage at the actions of the Budget Committee today. To have citizens \nof this country come before us to tell us their personal stories about \nhow this budget would impact their lives, their very fragile lives, and \nnot allow them the opportunity to speak for 5 minutes each to me was \nvery un-American and a very sad moment in this Senate's history.\n  These people represent literally thousands of people across this \ncountry who are as concerned as we are about the real life impacts of \nthis budget. We did not hear from the senior citizen. We did not hear \nfrom a young man in a wheelchair who uses Medicaid dollars to continue \nbreathing. We did not hear from a young man who is trying to get his \neducation who is fearful that his student loan is going to go away and \nhe will not be given that American dream, that American opportunity to \nfinish his college education. We, in fact, have not heard from that \nwelfare mother, that single mother who is off welfare with two little \nchildren in this country. She does not have the time to fly out here. \nShe does not have the ability to pay. We have not heard from them. And \nthis budget is going to impact them throughout America.\n  Madam President, I ran for the Senate in 1992. I moved from my home \nState 3,000 miles away and brought my family with me to do this \nterrifically difficult job because I sat at home one day not that long \nago, 3 years ago, and I looked across this country, and I said, ``Is \nanybody on that floor addressing the real issues that affect people \nlike me?'' I am that sandwich generation. I have two kids at home. I \nhave two parents who are seriously ill who rely on Medicare to continue \nliving. And I know what it is like to worry about whether or not my \nkids will have the ability to go to college because of money. I know \nwhat it is like to get that phone call from a parent who says, ``I do \nnot have enough money to go to the doctor.'' I know what it is like for \nmy husband and I to both work every single day to pay our mortgage, to \nput food on the table, and who do not have time, like thousands of \nAmerican citizens, to know what is in this budget.\n  Yet, we are to know what is in that budget when it came before us \nbefore the Budget Committee in a stack this high, and we were told we \nhad to vote on it in that minute. This budget will impact the lives of \nevery single American working family in a dramatic and difficult way. \nIt will mean that our kids will not have preschool education and Head \nStart. It will mean that there will be kids without immunization. It \nwill mean kids who cannot go to college. It will mean Medicaid \nrecipients--one out of five children in my State--who will not have \nhealth care coverage. It means senior citizens who will not have health \ncare in this country anymore. And it means that those of us who will \nhave to make a difficult decision about whether or not our parents need \nto go into a nursing home will not be able to know what the standard of \ncare is there for them when they need it.\n  This budget is what I came back here to fight for. As a U.S. Senator, \nwe deserve the time, both as citizens in this country who come here to \ntestify and as citizens on the floor of this Senate and as U.S. \nSenators, to have the opportunity to tell the American people what is \nin this budget.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield? I just want to say to the Senator \nbefore I leave the floor how much I appreciate her contribution to this \nU.S. Senate. She ran as a mom in tennis shoes. She stayed true to the \nreason she came to this Senate. The fact that she was sitting on the \ncommittee that will make these decisions is a great tribute to this \nNation. And she and I know if we were not here tonight, if we were not \nspeaking out against this budget, we would not be true to ourselves. I \njust want to thank her for adding a voice in this debate.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from California.\n  I just want to point out, because I think this is the family who has \nbeen forgotten--we talked about them in the welfare debate. We said \ntheir mother has to go to work in this country. We passed that bill out \nof the Senate. It is passed out of the House. This is the single mother \nwith two children who earns $12,000 a year. This is how this budget \nwill impact this mother. She is going to lose her earned income tax \ncredit. She is going to lose $373 a year under this budget. This mother \nis going to lose $300 a year on food stamps. This mother is going to \nlose $2,400 a year that pays for Medicaid and health care coverage for \nher children. And she is going to have to pay $480 to her State in \norder to collect child support from her missing husband.\n  This budget will cost this single mother with two young children \n$3,553. As my colleagues have pointed out, she is going to lose. And \nwho is going to win? The richest 1 percent of Americans will get a tax \nbreak every single year.\n  I ask my colleagues. Who do we value in this country? Do we value a \nyoung mother who is working and trying to raise her kids? Are we going \nto ignore her in this budget process? I think it is critical that we \ntake the time to evaluate it, and it is critical that we listen to the \npeople across this country about the priorities that we are going to \nset in the future.\n  I join my colleagues on the Budget Committee in expressing our \noutrage at what is occurring. I thank my colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I would like to thank my colleague from \n\n[[Page S15414]]\n  Washington for the great work she has done on the Budget Committee.\n  At its root, at its bottom, a budget is the priorities of America. \nThis represents the choices we make about the priorities for the money \nthat we are going to spend over the next 7 years.\n  These are critically important choices, and the Senator from \nWashington has been loud and clear with respect to what those \npriorities ought to be--priorities that favor the middle class and \nworking families in this country who are struggling to get by, saying \nto the students who want to further their education there ought to be \nan opportunity for a student loan. We should not, as the Republican \nplan calls for, increase the cost of that student loan $3,100 over the \nnext 7 years.\n  It says to that struggling senior, yes, there have to be savings out \nof Medicare; we understand that, but not these kinds of draconian cuts \nthat mean a further burden on seniors and that will threaten the \nclosing of hospitals throughout the rural parts of America.\n  To say to others who count on Federal programs in order to survive, \nas that young man who was in the wheelchair this afternoon who relies \non Medicaid for his very breath, that is an American priority, that is \nsomeone we care about in the American family.\n  Senator Murray has been right there making these points and carrying \nthis fight. I thank her very much for the effort she makes every day to \nmake certain that the budget reflects the priorities of the American \npeople.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/20/senate-section/article/S15411-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11 A.M.
