Mr. President, today, there will be a period for the \ntransaction of morning business until the hour of 1 p.m. Following \nmorning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 440, the \nNational Highway System bill. The cloture vote on the motion to proceed \nto the highway bill, originally scheduled today at 3 o'clock, has been \nvitiated. There will be no rollcall votes today. We have been able to \nwork out a process where we do not need the cloture vote. We notified \neverybody Friday afternoon, so I do not think anybody was \nunaccommodated because of that change.\n  We will have amendments this afternoon and debate on amendments. If \nthere are rollcall votes requested on any amendments, they will occur \ntomorrow morning. We hope to get an agreement on amendments, if we can, \nthis afternoon.\n  This is an important bill. We would like to finish consideration of \nthe bill tomorrow evening, if possible. I know the managers will be on \nthe floor at 1 o'clock. There are a number of key amendments, but \nbeyond that, we do not see any real problems with the bill now that we \nhave agreed on the Davis-Bacon amendment. That has been withdrawn from \nthis bill. That debate will happen in a more general way on a later \nbill coming from the Labor Committee.\n  So I urge my colleagues on both sides, if you have amendments to S. \n440, to contact the managers so that we can move as quickly as we can \nthis afternoon and this evening on debating some of the amendments. If \nrollcall votes are requested, they will occur tomorrow.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to take an opportunity as we \nwait to go on the highway bill to talk a bit more about the budget. It \nseems to me there will be nothing this year that we will deal with more \nimportant than the budget. One aspect of it, of course, is the ``why'' \nof balancing the budget. Certainly I do not think anyone would suggest \nthat continuing to spend more than we take in is a responsible fiscal \nor moral position. This Congress has not balanced the budget for 25 \nyears.\n  When there is discussion of a balanced budget amendment, we always \nhear people say: I am for a balanced budget; I sure want a balanced \nbudget, but we do not need an amendment; all we have to do is do it.\n  Well, we have a chance to come to the snubbing post this time and \nfigure out if we can do it. And we have before us from the Senate as \nwell as the House potential outlines that do balance the budget.\n  Not only is balancing the budget important, Mr. President, but I \nthink also, of course, the budget and spending and taxes help to shape \nthe form of Government. I think they respond to what I believe was a \nvery clear statement of the voters in 1994 that Government is too big \nand spends too much. And certainly the test of good Government is \nwhether or not the Government responds when voters have sent that sort \nof a message. So nothing will be more important than the budget \ndiscussions this year and the result of those deliberations.\n  I am pleased to welcome the President of the United States to the \nbudget debate. I am disappointed that it took this long for him to \nparticipate in it. He sort of falls into the follow-the-leader type of \nconcept.\n  I am disappointed that the budget recommended by the administration \ndoes not, in fact, balance the budget, even though it is extended to a \nperiod of 10 years. I am also disappointed that it appears to yield to \nthe political notion of endloading, where almost all of the pain is \nsomewhere in the future, somewhere 10 years from now, which puts \nbalancing the budget at great risk. It's likely that in the next 10 \nyears there will be another budget and all the benefits will come early \nand the price we have to pay for it as taxpayers will not show up until \nlater and the budget ends up never being balanced.\n  So, Mr. President, I am glad we are launched. I am glad the President \nof the United States has come into the discussion. However, the \nCongress has already done most of the heavy lifting by passing a \nbalanced budget weeks ago. I am very proud of what the Senate did. I am \nnot on the Budget Committee, but I think Senator Domenici and others \ncame face up to the task, and their cuts start soon; they start to do \nwhat has to be done without putting it off the way the President does--\nthe political way of tough talk, the political way of giving the \nbenefits and doing the tax adjustments early on and letting the hard \nwork, the heavy lifting go until later, make it until even after the \nturn of the century, which is only 5 years from now, maybe until after \nthe next Presidential election, not this one in 1996 but the next one \nin the year 2000. Most of the heavy lifting in the President's budget \ncomes after that--coincidence, I am sure.\n  We are told that the President's budget cuts discretionary programs \nexcept defense and education by $200 billion in 7 years.\n  What we are not told is in the last 3 years the discretionary budget \nis cut by $178 billion, so basically almost all of the cuts come in the \nlast 3 years, not in the early years.\n  We are told there are no cuts in defense, but after the year 2005, \nthere are an additional $65 billion in defense cuts. Most of the \ndiscussion this year has been that this is not a peaceful world, and it \nis not a time to continue to reduce defense expenditures.\n  In addition, what was not said in the President's budget was in the \nlast 3 years Medicare is cut by $167 billion, more than all of the \nproposed cuts in the first 7 years.\n  So I think it is fair to say that this budget proposal is endloaded. \nEven the Washington Post, which is not exactly a pillar of \nconservatism, indicates that given more time, it is always easier to do \nthe budget reduction.\n  A full 85 percent of the President's promised reductions would occur \nin the next century. I would argue that chances are pretty good before \nwe come to actually paying for the changes we ask for, there will be \nother changes. In the next 7 years, as a matter of fact, the promises \nmade in the President's budget for cuts are slightly smaller than the \nbudget he submitted in February.\n  So Martha Phillips, who is the executive director of the Concord \nCoalition, said, ``It is a funny thing about those elusive outyears; \nthey never seem to arrive.''\n  I think one of the difficulties, Mr. President, in recent years--\nperhaps always, but it seems particularly ironic now--is that in an era \nin which we have the greatest, quickest communications system the world \nhas ever known, it is very, very difficult to get facts to you and me \nas voters in Casper, WY;\n that the information is usually put forth by advocates on either side \nand spun whichever way they choose to spin it to where it is extremely \ndifficult for people to really get a handle on what is happening.\n\n  I noticed in just the last couple of months that the folks who come \nto our office who belong to nationwide organizations usually get a \nbriefing. Frankly, when they come to the office and explain their point \nof view from the basis of the briefing, you hardly recognize it from \nwhat you have seen in the budget.\n  What we need more than anything, of course, is really straight talk, \nsome real facts. The idea that we are going to balance the budget with \nno pain is an illusion. Of course, there is going to be some pain. Of \ncourse, there are going to be some changes.\n  The idea that we accomplished great things in 1993, for example, when \nmost of the deficit reduction came from bookkeeping changes. We changed \nwhat was anticipated in losses in the RTC. We changed what was \nanticipated in losses in Medicaid. About 18 percent of the change was a \npolicy change, and that was a tax increase. [[Page S 8599]] \n  Spending in 1993, when we talk about the deficit reduction, went up \nand continues to go up at 5 percent. When you are talking about $1.5 \ntrillion, 5 percent of that is a very large amount of money.\n  But I am encouraged now that the President has endorsed the idea of \nbalancing the budget that we should get there as quickly as possible. \nIt is a little hard to imagine that in a $7 trillion economy that a $60 \nbillion change in Government spending is going to hurt our prosperity. \nI think George Will said that it was very hard to figure out how that \ncan discombobulate a $7 trillion economy.\n  So we should move boldly. We have the chance to move boldly. We have \nthe chance to do the things that we talked about for a very long time, \nthat almost everyone talks about on the campaign trail--balance the \nbudget, reduce Government, reduce spending. But when we get here, there \nare arguments about who does it, where it ought to be, and we end up \nnot doing the things that you and I know need to be done.\n  We can balance the budget. Very likely we will find 6.1 million more \njobs, we will lower interest rates on student loans, and on mortgages.\n  Mr. President, I think that we are going to hold the administration's \nfeet to the fire. His track record does not indicate a great deal of \nconfidence. His actions do not match the rhetoric that we have been \nhearing. The President promised a 5-year balanced budget plan as a \ncandidate, then rejected a 7-year budget plan, and now proposes a 10-\nyear budget plan. The budget deficit reduction in 1993 he talks so much \nabout was a matter of increasing taxes.\n  So we have a history of more taxes, more spending--spending has never \nbeen reduced--and more Government. As a matter of fact, in the 1993 \ndeficit reduction bill, domestic discretionary spending actually \naccelerated rather than decreased.\n  In addition, this administration last year made an effort to have the \nGovernment take over health care. We have to do something about \nMedicare. Americans rejected the idea of a Federal Health Care Program. \nWe have now an opportunity to save Medicare. If we do not do something, \naccording to the trustees--some of whom are Cabinet members--in 2 years \nwe will be into the reserves and in 5 more years it will be broke. So \nit is not a question of whether we do something, it is a question of \nwhat we do and how we do it. If we want to have Medicare, if we want to \nhave health care for the elderly, we have to change the program. Yet \nthe administration only keeps Medicare solvent for 3 more years, until \n2005.\n  So I certainly hope that the President of the United States joining \nthe debate will cause us to move toward a balanced budget. I am \ndecidedly pleased he has moved away from the February budget proposal \nwhich was rejected 99 to zip in this body.\n  We need to use the Congressional Budget Office's [CBO] numbers. The \nPresident suggested 2 years ago that those were the better numbers. Now \nwe find he chooses to use other numbers which actually reduce the need \nby about $200 billion per year, and according to most people's \naccounting, would come up at the end of the 10 years still hundreds of \nbillions in arrears. We have the best chance in memory to take a real \nbona fide look at doing something about overspending, about doing \nsomething with the size of Government, and we can do it this year, Mr. \nPresident.\n  So I welcome the President's entry, his recognition that we do need \nto balance the budget, and some of the ideas that he has, but I suggest \nto you we have to be honest and fair about it. We cannot wait until the \nnext century to have the pain come. We have to start now and do the \nthings that most people agree need to be done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have just had an opportunity for the \nchairman of the committee, the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee] \nmyself, and the distinguished Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] to \nmeet with Mr. Rodney Slater, the Administrator of the Federal Highway \nAdministration, and he will soon be forthcoming with some \nclarifications of the positions of the administration on a series of \namendments.\n  The Secretary of Transportation did forward to all Senators today a \nletter respecting a special interest in the safety provisions in the \npending bill, and at an appropriate time, I will introduce that letter \ninto the Record.\n  But I encourage all Senators who have a particular interest in this \nlegislation to come forward today when we have the opportunity to work \nout a number of amendments and to, hopefully, have arguments on others \nand hold over until tomorrow, pursuant to the decision of the majority \nleader and Democratic leader on the time for the votes.\n  So, at any time, this Senator and, I am sure, my distinguished \ncolleague would be pleased to interrupt our remarks to allow a Senator \nor Senators to pursue their individual interests with respect to \namendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8598-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE SECOND TIME--S. 939\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 440, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 440) to amend title 23, United States Code, to \n     provide for the designation of the National Highway System, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there are some 20 amendments of which the \nmanagers have notice. There may be more. I know it is the intention of \nthe majority leader and the Democratic leader that we proceed as \nexpeditiously as possible to bring this pending matter to a conclusion \nin the Senate. Again, I urge all Senators having an interest to come to \nthe floor and take up those matters.\n  This legislation is critically important to maintaining the \ntransportation planning and construction programs in our several \nStates, to providing for the efficient and timely movement of American \nproducts carried by commercial activities, and to the safety of the \nmotoring public.\n  As provided in the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation and \nEfficiency Act, known as ISTEA, the Congress must approve the National \nHighway System map by September 30, 1995. With the cooperation of all \nmembers of the Committee on the Environment and Public Works, we were \nable to expedite this bill such as the Senate has it at this particular \ntime, well in advance of the deadline created by ISTEA.\n  Now, if Congress does not meet the deadline, $6.5 billion in \ninterstate maintenance and National Highway System annual \napportionments will be withheld from the several States. Therefore, we \nmust not permit this penalty to be further imposed on our States.\n  In February of this year, I introduced this legislation, along with \n14 of my colleagues, to ensure prompt action on the National Highway \nSystem. Today, this legislation enjoys the bipartisan support of 26 \nSenators.\n  The Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure, which I am privileged [[Page S 8600]] to chair, held \nfour hearings on the importance of the National Highway System. The \nsubcommittee also heard testimony on the impact of various \ntransportation mandates, such as metric sign conversion and the use of \nrubberized asphalt. We also examined innovative financing proposals to \nincrease State flexibility to maximize the use of highway dollars by \nallowing public funds to leverage nontraditional, private sources of \nfunding for infrastructure development.\n  This is very definitely the direction in which our Nation must go if \nit wishes to continue to modernize our transportation system.\n  The subcommittee's hearings clearly demonstrated that continuing \nFederal investment, with our State partners and new private ventures, \nin our Nation's infrastructure is crucial to improving America's \nmobility and the efficiency of our surface transportation network.\n  The National Highway System reaffirms the Federal commitment to this \nlimited network of highly traveled roads to provide for the consistency \nof road engineering and safety for commercial and public travel.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues who may be asking, ``What is the \nNational Highway System?''--a legitimate question--let me take this \nopportunity to offer some historical perspective and a brief \ndescription about the system.\n  We are particularly fortunate today that the manager on the minority \nside is the distinguished Senator from New York, who really has spent \nmuch of his career in the U.S. Senate on this subject. I look forward \nto hearing his remarks about the historic concepts of this system.\n  In the 1950's, President Eisenhower challenged the transportation \ncommunity to provide an effective system of highway connections among \nthe 50 States. Thus, the era of the Interstate Highway System was born, \nand for the next 25 years, Federal transportation policy focused on the \ncompletion of the Interstate Highway System.\n  There is a little anecdotal history here that is interesting. My \nunderstanding of the reading is that Eisenhower, when he was a young \nmajor in his very late thirties, was instructed by the chief of staff \nof the U.S. Army to determine what would be the best route and, indeed, \nwhat difficulties might be incurred if a military envoy left one coast \nand traveled all the way to the next. And then Major Eisenhower was \nsomewhat appalled by the system and how inadequate that system was to \ntransfer military cargo, military troops, equipment, and other systems \nessential to our national defense, and at that time the major was also \nquite knowledgeable of the rapid advancement in Germany, under Nazi \ncontrol in those days, and the Autobahn system.\n  So at that time, apparently, he determined at some future date he \nwould have a hand in developing a system for the United States which \nwould ensure, for the purposes of national security and other purposes, \nan adequate interstate highway system.\n  During the debate on ISTEA, the future role of the Federal Government \nin surface transportation was debated at length as the completion of \nthe Interstate System neared. The debate questioned the level of \nFederal obligations to the maintenance of the Interstate System and \nother primary routes, the appropriateness of providing greater \nflexibility and responsibility to the States, and the most effective \nmeans of ensuring the safety of our surface transportation system for \nthe traveling public.\n  I happen to have been a member of the committee and a member of the \nconference on ISTEA, and the distinguished Senator from New York was \nthen the chairman of the Committee on the Environment and Public Works \nof the U.S. Senate and took a very active role in that ISTEA \nconference.\n  I concurred in the Senate's view that a National Highway System \nshould be established to maintain a minimum level of Federal \ninvolvement with our State partners. Ensuring the efficient performance \nand consistency of our existing road system between individual States \nremains the foremost Federal responsibility.\n  As provided in ISTEA, the National Highway System map consists of \n159,000 miles. Of this amount, 44,000 miles are interstate highways; \n4,500 miles are high priority corridors identified in ISTEA; 15,700 \nmiles are noninterstate strategic highway network routes; and 1,900 \nmiles are strategic highway network connectors.\n  The remaining 91,000 miles were identified by the Federal Highway \nAdministration and the States in cooperation with local governments.\n  May I stress, Mr. President, this is not a map concocted by the \nCongress. We are, essentially, about to confirm and ratify the work of \nthe Federal Highway Administration in full cooperation with the \ncounterpart authorities in each State, and down to the very local \nlevel. Many Senators have taken an active participation as it relates \nto their particular States.\n  The product of this 2-year dialog is the map before us, which must be \nenacted, as I said, by the Congress promptly to meet the September \ndeadline.\n  The committee-reported bill commends the successful efforts of the \nseveral States, the Federal Highway Administration, and the local \nauthorities in developing the NHS map, and provides authority for this \nprocess to continue to evolve.\n  May I pause to say this is not a static situation. It is a continuing \nsituation, Mr. President. As new roads are constructed and State \ntransportation priorities change, the States and the Federal Highway \nAdministration can continue to make necessary adjustments to the map.\n  The National Highway System, as developed by our States, contains \njust 4 percent of America's 4 million miles of public roads. I would \nlike to repeat that, Mr. President: The National Highway System, as \ndeveloped by our States, contains just 4 percent of America's 4 million \nmiles of public roads. This 4 percent, however, carries over 40 percent \nof all highway traffic and 70 percent of all truck freight traffic.\n  Most of the NHS roads are already built, and the system reflects a \nfair distribution of mileage between rural and urban roads.\n  I am committed to the National Highway System because it will \nincrease economic opportunities to communities not served directly by \nthe interstate system. Also, it will provide a direct link with roads \nin Canada and Mexico, uniting the North American commercial links. This \nis particularly appropriate in view of the American free-trade zone \nwith a high-performance, continental road network.\n  For the first time, the NHS will allow States to focus their \ninvestments on connecting air, rail, commercial water ports, freight \nfacilities, and highways so that the performance of the entire system \ncan be maximized. In other words, we combine in this new map all of \nthose essential parts to make up the infrastructure for this highway \nsystem. These intermodal connections will provide our entire \ntransportation system with the flexibility needed to cope with the \nchanging economic geography for this decade and beyond.\n  Reinforcing this economic backbone is the fact that nearly 85 percent \nof the Nation's freight travels at least part of its journey over a \nhighway. As American companies rely more and more on just-in-time \ndelivery to get raw materials to plants, and as American wholesalers \nand retailers count on rapid delivery to keep their inventories lean, \nthe economic importance of an efficient, national transportation \ninfrastructure is actually growing every day.\n  Mr. President, in February, when this legislation was introduced, I \nalso indicated my intention to respond to the concerns raised by our \nState partners and other users of the system to increase the \nflexibility to use Federal highway funds and to reduce Federal \nmandates.\n  I am pleased that the bill before the Senate today provides relief \nfrom costly and burdensome mandates by the following:\n  First, repealing the usage requirement for the crumb rubber in hot \nmix asphalt;\n  Second, repealing the requirement that States convert transportation \nsigns to metric measurements;\n  Third, repealing the requirement that States implement management \nsystem;\n  Fourth, repealing the national maximum speed limit; [[Page S 8601]] \n  Fifth, repealing the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage mandate on federally \nfunded transportation construction projects. The Chair will note, as of \nthe close of business on the preceding day of Senate business, namely, \nFriday, that amendment was taken out of this bill. So it no longer \napplies.\n  Sixth, streamlining the transportation enhancement process;\n  Seventh, clarifying that transportation conformity requirements apply \nonly to Clean Air Act nonattainment areas;\n  Eighth, modifying the commercial motor vehicle hours of service \nrequirements as applied to the drivers of groundwater drilling rigs.\n  In responding to the need to increase State flexibility of highway \napportionments, the committee bill:\n  First, allows for larger transfers from the highway bridge program to \nother accounts;\n  Second, expands Federal aid eligibility to public highways connecting \nthe NHS to intermodal facilities;\n  Third, provides for a soft match which allows private funds, \nmaterials, and services to be donated and applied to the State matching \nshare;\n  Fourth, allows States to use advance construction funds for projects \nbeyond the ISTEA authorization period;\n  Fifth, permits bond costs to be eligible for reimbursement as a cost \nof construction;\n  And sixth, allows States to use NHS and congestion mitigation and air \nquality funds for an unlimited period of time on intelligent vehicle \ntransportation system projects.\n  Mr. President, another section of this legislation responds to the \nFederal need to move forward on a replacement facility for the Woodrow \nWilson Bridge, located here in the greater metropolitan Washington \narea. The proposal the committee puts forward accomplishes three major \nobjectives:\n  First, it offers an opportunity for the Federal Government to \ntransfer ownership of the bridge to a regional authority established by \nVirginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, thereby relieving the \nFederal Government of the sole responsibility for this facility.\n  Second, it provides a framework that will stimulate additional \nfinancing to facilitate the construction of the alternative identified \nin the environmental impact statement.\n  Third, with less than 10 years of useful life remaining on the \nexisting bridge, this approach addresses the need to provide for the \nsafety of the traveling public and for the efficient flow of commerce.\n  I cannot emphasize too strongly, Mr. President, that particular \nprovision as it relates to the Wilson Bridge. I have been down and \npersonally inspected it. I talked to the appropriate authorities.\n  Mr. Herrity, the distinguished public servant here in northern \nVirginia, has actively written on this subject. I ask unanimous consent \nto have his statement printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 11, 1995]\n\n                       Put the Pedal to the Metal\n\n       On the Wilson Bridge Reconstruction of the Woodrow Wilson \n     Bridge is essential not only to our region's economic health \n     but to maintain the sanity of this area's commuters. We don't \n     have time for the usual bureaucratic crawl toward \n     completion--engineering experts say the bridge will be \n     unusable in 10 years.\n       An interim proposal has been floated to prolong the \n     bridge's life by closing it to truck traffic in the next two \n     to five years. That, however, would be a disaster in terms of \n     time and money. Ask any Beltway commuter what he or she \n     thinks of diverting 18,000 trucks to the Cabin John Bridge. \n     And all of us would see costs for the delivery of fuel, \n     furniture, groceries etc. go up.\n       To build any road or bridge, first you plan and design it, \n     then you find money. Finally, you build it. But we are moving \n     too slowly. In the case of the Wilson Bridge, we must do all \n     three steps quickly--and simultaneously. We don't have the \n     luxury of a common bureaucratic timetable of 15, 20 or even \n     25 years.\n       The good news is that we already have taken steps to plan, \n     design and find money for the reconstruction. In 1991, the \n     Interstate Study Commission was established to find ways to \n     raise money from Virginia, Maryland and the District \n     (combined with federal government money) to own, construct, \n     operate and maintain a new Wilson Bridge. Last December this \n     commission recommended the creation of a regional authority \n     to finance the construction. Maryland, Virginia and the \n     District have passed or soon will pass legislation to allow \n     the creation of such an authority, which will require \n     amendments next year. As part of these amendments, the \n     governors of Maryland and Virginia and the mayor of the \n     District must select someone from each of their respective \n     transportation departments to expedite:\n       The selection procedures for design engineering.\n       The procedures for right-of-way acquisition.\n       The bid procedures for expedited construction.\n       A coordinated and privatized effort can produce quick \n     results. For example, the privatized Dulles Greenway (the \n     Dulles Toll Road extension to Leesburg) is taking only 24 \n     months to construction; it would have taken four to five \n     years through normal bureaucratic channels.\n       A committee charged with recommending a bridge plan has \n     selected three design options and soon will narrow its choice \n     to two. Its recommendations will go to the Transportation and \n     Planning Board of the Council of Governments, which will have \n     the final say. At that point, the authority will be activated \n     to get the bridge built.\n       We don't need a new bureaucracy for a bridge authority. \n     Instead, the authority should be able to rely on the \n     professional staffs of existing agencies. Then Virginia, \n     Maryland and the District could work toward a common goal: \n     the rapid rebuilding of a link vital to them all, the Woodrow \n     Wilson Bridge.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I conclude, Mr. President, by saying the goal of the NHS \nis to leave a legacy for the next generation. That legacy is an \nintermodal transportation system, a system that is not fragmented into \nseparate parts, but rather one that works to serve the many diverse \ninterests of Americans, to serve the growing demands of the competitive \nglobal marketplace, and to help ensure the safety of the traveling \npublic.\n  I also feel there are certain national security interests involved in \nhaving an efficient system. I will address that particular section at \nanother time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I express my appreciation to the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Virginia for his masterly account of \nthe provisions in our bill and for his very thoughtful statement about \nthe continuity of this act, S. 440, with the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1991, which had among other purposes \nthe declaration that the Dwight D. Eisenhower Interstate and Defense \nHighway System, had been built, finished. It took quite a bit longer \nand a very great deal more than we had expected. But we had done it.\n  I would like to make just a slight modification to my friend's \naccount because it is relevant. President Eisenhower would tell this \nstory, and it is related in his book ``At Ease: Stories I Tell to \nFriends.''\n  It is 1919, a young Army lieutenant colonel, soon to revert to his \npeacetime rank of captain, Dwight D. Eisenhower, was given command of a \nserious military exercise. He was to assume that wartime events had \ndisabled the railroads. He was to lead a convoy of army trucks across \nthe country from Fort Meade, just out on the edge of the District, in \nMaryland, technically, to the Presidio in San Francisco. It took him 2 \nmonths. The convoy averaged less than 7 miles per hour. It proved that \nyou could cross the continent by truck if you had to, but not if it was \na wartime emergency. He wrote in his book:\n\n       To those who have known only concrete and macadam highways \n     of gentle grades and engineered curves, such a trip might \n     seem humdrum. In those days we were not sure it could be \n     accomplished at all. Nothing of the sort had ever been \n     attempted.\n\n  The idea for an interstate system emerged, if I could be just a \nlittle parochial, out of the 1939 World's Fair in Flushing Meadow, in \nQueens, NY, at the great General Motors Futurama exhibit. I can \nremember sitting there as a child, in one of those gliding contraptions \nthat moved around and you saw this great scene of highways, with what \nwe would come to call cloverleaf intersections crossing over one \nanother, going through mountains. President Roosevelt who, along with \nmost others here in Washington, was very much concerned that the \nDepression of the 1930's would resume with the end of World War II, in \n1944 got a national interstate highway system authorized. But it was \nnothing more than that, an authorization. In New York we built the \nfirst segment as the Thruway, starting immediately in 1946, but the \nsystem lagged elsewhere.\n  When President Eisenhower came to office he very much had that early [[Page S \n8602]] command in mind, and he hit upon the idea with Jim Wright of \nTexas, a young Congressman at that time, to have a gasoline tax and \ndedicate it to the construction of this system. And, by golly, we did \nit. But there came a time when we in fact had done it, built the \nsystem, and yet a certain inertia, you might say, pushed us on and on, \nand we would just build another segment and yet another.\n  We finally came up with a better idea, though, as the chairman has \nindicated--a new national highway system which would supplement the \nEisenhower interstate system. It would consist of only about 4 percent \nof the Nation's road mileage, but it would carry 40 percent of its \ntraffic. And it would be a combined, cooperative effort of State \ngovernments and the Federal Government at its best.\n  In 1991, President Bush very much wanted to have this National \nHighway System, but in fact the Department of Transportation had not \nyet drawn it. We had a big meeting down at the Executive Office \nBuilding with a map of the country and lots of red lines over it, but \nit did not represent real highways. It just indicated what would be \nsomeday.\n  That someday has come. We will have until the 1st of October--am I \ncorrect?\n  Mr. WARNER. The 30th of September.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes, the 30th, the end of this fiscal year, to \nauthorize this system. And this legislation does that. It does it in a \ntimely manner, as anticipated. We have funds available. And we have \nvery real needs.\n  We are not building new highways. We are maintaining and improving \ntheir capacity. The intermodal system was very explicit on the idea \nthat you do not want to add to the mileage of the system, you want to \nmake it more efficient. We made very clear our view that a free good--\nand these are freeways--will be overconsumed. We made it clear that we \nwere not in the least alarmed by the idea of pricing this good, as we \ndo in points of congestion like tunnels and bridges.\n  We began the legislation--the conference report and the legislation \nitself--with a declaration of policy for the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act. It said:\n\n       The National Intermodal Transportation System must be \n     operated and maintained with insistent attention to the \n     concepts of innovation, competition, energy efficiency, \n     productivity, growth, and accountability. Practices that \n     resulted in the lengthy and overly-costly construction of the \n     Interstate and Defense Highway System must be confronted and \n     ceased.\n\n  We went so far, Mr. President, as to require that this table of \nprinciples be printed up and provided to every member of the Department \nof Transportation--and they were. In this system, in the present bill, \nwe find continued reference to those principles. We find ourselves \ncompleting the 4-year work that we were asked to do.\n  Note, ``intermodal.'' It is one of the ironies of President, then \ncaptain, Eisenhower's journey across the country that to assume the \nrailroads had been destroyed and you find you could not get from here \nto there in any effective way without them led to an interstate highway \nsystem which pretty soon had destroyed the railroads. And not \nnecessarily a good idea.\n  We, of course, made it clear that by intermodal we mean not just \nvehicle transportation. We talk about rail. We talk about air links. We \ntalk about sea links. In this particular legislation there is a \nspecific provision, ``Sec. 126, Intermodal Facility In New York. [The] \nengineering, design, and construction activities to permit the James A. \nFarley Post Office in New York, New York, to be used as an intermodal \ntransportation facility and commercial center.''\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will my colleague allow me to observe?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Surely.\n  Mr. WARNER. He said something about the destruction of the railroads? \nI am not sure the distinguished Senator from New York wanted to \nindicate the interstate highway system destroyed the railroads. I would \nthink there was a period of time when there was a decline of passenger \ntravel, but the railroads today are very strong in terms of freight \ntransportation. And many of the things that Eisenhower was concerned \nabout in terms of heavy equipment being moved--I am glad the Senator \nbrought it back. It did jog my memory. I, too, went to the World's Fair \nof 1939 with my father. It was a memorable trip. But it was formulating \nin Eisenhower's mind through all those years. This was always in the \nrecess of his mind.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. He got it built. General Motors thought it up, you \nmight say.\n  And the Senator, the chairman, is highly correct. What we have seen \nis not the disappearance of the railroads but their disappearance as a \nprincipal mode of passenger transportation, save on certain corridors \nwhere it is efficient. If you were looking for the major reason for \nthat--well, probably the airlines did it to continental transport, and \nthe automobile. Although we may have overdone it. We had a very \nefficient rail system in Los Angeles, for example, which they closed \ndown around 1950 and they wish they could get it back, now that it is \nprobably too late.\n  In any event, with tribute to my friends once again, the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works brings to this floor a near unanimous \nmeasure. I have been 19 years in that committee, and I do not think I \ncan remember many times in which we have had a party-line vote. We have \ntried to think about the environment. We have tried to think about \npublic works in terms of national interests. If we have not always \nsucceeded, it is not for lack of trying. Once again, we have done that, \nand very much to be congratulated and thanked at a time when partisan \nissues rise, as they ought--but they rise a little higher even as we \napproach Presidential years. This is a good example of the capacity of \nthe Senators between the different parties, different regions, \ndifferent interests to cooperate and produce a fine bill.\n  I for my part want to congratulate all those involved. Senator Baucus \nis necessarily absent or he would be saying substantially the same \nthings from the point of view of the High Plains even as I speak from \nthe point of view of the island of Manhattan.\n  Mr. President, with great appreciation for all of the work that the \nSenator from Virginia has done, and with the expectation that we will \nnow go forward and get it through the Senate in the same period, I want \nto thank him.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to reciprocate and thank again my \ndistinguished colleague from New York. It was simply because he \ncertainly handled the ISTEA legislation, and that in many respects gave \nrise to this national evolution of the highway system.\n  Mr. President, we are anxious to have Senators come to the floor for \npurposes of amendments. We will accommodate them as they arrive.\n  At this time, I see our distinguished colleague from Georgia who \nwishes to address the Senate I believe on a different subject.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, before I speak briefly on another subject, I \nwould like to congratulate my friends from Virginia and New York on \ntheir leadership in this important area, and I think that they have \nindeed worked together very carefully and prudently in the Nation's \ninterest. I congratulate them for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8599-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8602-S8606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE SITUATION IN BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like to speak just a few moments \nabout the situation in Bosnia today and share with my colleagues some \nof my thoughts on the subject.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee, under the leadership of Senator \nThurmond, the chairman of the committee, has had a series of four \nhearings on the subject of Bosnia. We heard from a number of, I think, \nvery well-informed witnesses.\n  We heard from, of course, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Bill \nPerry, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Shalikashvili, the \nformer Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, Al Haig, and former \nPresident of the United States, President Carter, and another former \nSupreme Allied Commander in Europe, Gen. Jack Galvin, now retired, [[Page S \n8603]] former Secretary of Defense, Jim Schlesinger, former top \nofficial in the State Department, Richard Armitage, and retired Col. \nHarry Summers, a frequent writer on this and many other national \nsecurity subjects.\n  Mr. President, I would like to express my disappointment--unrelated \nto the hearings but which took place simultaneously with our hearings \nlast week--with the actions of the Clinton administration when they \nlast week first delayed a vote in the U.N. Security Council, and then \nvoted for the deployment of the French, British, and Dutch rapid \nreaction force to Bosnia which they at first opposed, but then \ndeferring a decision on the financial cost for that force.\n  I understand this action on the part of Clinton administration was \ntaken primarily because of a letter from Senate Majority Leader Dole \nand House Speaker Gingrich objecting to U.S. financing of the rapid \nreaction force.\n  I believe this is a serious mistake on the part of the Clinton \nadministration, and on the part of the congressional leadership. I \nbelieve we will pay a price for this combined Presidential and \ncongressional position in the years ahead with our allies.\n  Mr. President, the United States during the administrations of both \nPresident Bush and President Clinton voted for every U.N. Security \nCouncil resolution on Bosnia, and endorsed and supported the efforts of \nour NATO allies who are participating on the ground in Bosnia as a part \nof the U.N. Protection Force or UNPROFOR.\n  I myself disagreed with numerous actions that have been taken in \nBosnia by both the United Nations and by NATO. Yet, we voted for it. \nBoth Presidents--President Bush and President Clinton--voted in the \nSecurity Council for every one of these resolutions. Now we have our \nallies in difficulty. They are in difficulty on the ground. And that \ndifficulty could intensify with the rapid reaction force that is now \nbeing inserted by our allies--not by America, but by our allies--which \nwill be an integral part of UNPROFOR, and the cost should be \nunderwritten to the same extent and in the same manner as all U.N. \npeacekeeping forces.\n  We will have another day and another time to determine how much the \nUnited States should pay for U.N. peacekeeping assessments. But that is \na long-term challenge. The question now is whether or not we are going \nto support in any way financially a crucial force that is being put in \nto protect the U.N. peacekeepers and the NATO peacekeepers that we \nourselves voted to put in Bosnia. It is the ultimate irony for our \ncongressional leadership and for the Clinton administration to not \nfully support a much stronger NATO-U.N. rapid reaction force.\n  Mr. President, if the U.N. forces withdraw from Bosnia, the President \nof the United States has declared that he is going to help them with \nUnited States forces. The United States forces that would be placed \nthere to help with this withdrawal would be working with this rapid \ndeployment force. I think it is very important for us to understand the \nconsequences of our not being willing to help pay for a rapid reaction \nforce. That force, deployed by our allies and working with the United \nStates forces assisting in the withdrawal, would help alleviate some of \nthe responsibility for the United States forces in that situation and \nmake it possible for a lot less United States forces to be placed in \nBosnia to help with the withdrawal, and finally, greatly reduce the \ndanger to United States forces that may be interjected there if and \nwhen the withdrawal comes about.\n  So I find it ironic that we have congressional leadership as well \nas--at least at the beginning of last week--the administration \nleadership opposing the force that would help reduce the forces which \nthe United States has to put in to help with withdrawal and also would \ncertainly reduce the danger of U.S. forces being placed in that \nsituation. I find that ironic.\n  I hope that both the leadership in the Congress and in the \nadministration will reconsider their position on this because I think \nwe will pay a severe price for this--if not in Bosnia, then in other \nparts of the world where we ask our allies to help us. Alliances are \nnot simply for good times and for when things are going smoothly. \nAlliances and allies have to stick together when things are not going \nwell and certainly when things are getting to the dangerous stage as \nthey certainly are in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I would like to explain to my colleagues my views as \nto the policy that should be followed with respect to Bosnia. I would \nfirst state--and my friend from Virginia, who yielded the floor, \nparticipated in every one of the hearings and he certainly, I know, \nwould agree with this statement--that every single witness we had \nbefore our committee for 4 days opposed the United States unilateral \nlifting of the embargo while our allies remain on the ground in Bosnia. \nEvery single witness--not one supported the unilateral lifting of the \nembargo; 4 days of hearings in the Armed Services Committee, and not \none single witness favored the unilateral lifting of the embargo while \nour allies are still in harm's way on the ground in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, my own views about where we go from here--and there \nare no good answers here--my views are heavily influenced by my support \nfor NATO and my observation of NATO over the last four decades where it \nhas been the strongest alliance in the history of the world. NATO has \nhelped bring about the end of the cold war on peaceful terms without an \nexplosion, and it has helped bring about the freeing of millions of \npeople behind the Iron Curtain without huge bloodshed, which could have \neasily happened. So my views are influenced by both the history of NATO \nand also what we are going to need NATO to do in the future.\n  I also believe that we should do everything in our power to prevent \nBosnia from further eroding the NATO alliance, any further than has \nalready occurred. Make no mistake about it. It is entirely possible for \nus to erode NATO's credibility and viability without saving Bosnia. I \nstart with the view that there is no good answer in Bosnia. A number of \nmistakes have been made which I will not recount here. And we have to \ndeal with the situation as it presently exists where we have \npeacekeepers on the ground with no peace to keep, and with the warring \nparties apparently not wanting peace. One side views the peacekeepers \nas shields from which to launch an attack, and the other side that is \ntaking most of the territory views NATO and U.N. forces as hostages for \nleverage and protection.\n  I favor one final round of diplomacy to ascertain if there is any \npossibility for a negotiated peace as called for last week in testimony \nbefore our committee by former President Carter, former NATO commander, \nGeneral Galvin, and former Secretary of Defense, Jim Schlesinger.\n They all testified that we ought to have one more vigorous round of \ndiplomacy. All of them had different emphases, but that was one common \ndenominator of those three witnesses.\n\n  I also strongly agree with Dr. Schlesinger's comments that this \npeacekeeping mission cannot continue under present circumstances and \nthat both NATO and the United Nations should acknowledge that, absent a \nnear-term diplomatic breakthrough, it is time to withdraw the U.N. and \nNATO peacekeepers from Bosnia.\n  If after a reasonable period of time--and I favor setting a finite \ndate for progress on the negotiated peace--if after that period of time \nthere is no substantial progress, the U.N. forces should be withdrawn \nin an orderly manner. That is not going to be an easy task. U.S. forces \nshould participate, in my view, in a NATO-led operation, as pledged by \nPresident Clinton, to assist in the U.N. withdrawal, and U.S. forces \nshould come to the rescue of the forces of our allies if there is an \nemergency and if they come under an attack and there is no other \ncapability available to rescue them. In other words, in a last-resort \nemergency situation, I would certainly favor supporting our allies on \nthe ground when they are in extreme need.\n  Once the U.N. forces have been withdrawn from Bosnia, the arms \nembargo on the Government of Bosnia should be lifted, multilaterally if \nat all possible.\n  While this is all taking place, we should join with our NATO allies \nin a concrete plan of action to contain the conflict from spreading any \nfurther.\n  Secretary of Defense Bill Perry made it clear in our committee that \nthe spread of that conflict would be against [[Page S 8604]] America's \n``vital\" interests. He used that term carefully. ``Vital'' means \ninterests that are so important we are willing to go into conflict in \norder to protect them.\n  The spread of the conflict would engage both U.S. and NATO interests \nin a very important way. And I think we ought to make it abundantly \nclear, while we are making one last effort for a diplomatic solution \nand while we are preparing for an orderly withdrawal of U.N. forces--\nand I hope our allies will come to that view--we should make it \nabsolutely clear that we intend as an alliance to prevent that conflict \nfrom spreading and to hold Serbia--by this I mean Belgrade, Serbia--\nresponsible for any breach of borders beyond what has already occurred \nin that region.\n  Finally, those calling for withdrawal should realize that there will \nbe a high price to be paid once the U.N. forces are withdrawn from \nBosnia. This is no free ride here. This is going to involve some real \nconsequences in all likelihood. Once the U.N. forces have been \nwithdrawn, there is a high potential for atrocities, particularly in \nand around the eastern enclaves.\n  Even recognizing what may occur, it is, in my view, however, past \ntime to face the reality on the ground. The international community has \nfailed to restore peace. That failure must be acknowledged. Unless \nthere is a near-term diplomatic breakthrough, the warring parties must \nbe left to fight it out until one party prevails or until they are \nexhausted and ready at last at some point in the future to negotiate a \npeace agreement.\n  Mr. President, I repeat, there are no easy answers in Bosnia, and I \nhope that we will not search for easy answers but, rather, for a course \nof action that will do whatever we can to alleviate the suffering \nthere, within reason, but to acknowledge, first and foremost, that the \nNATO alliance is an important alliance and we should not further erode \nthat alliance.\n  I repeat, Mr. President, I hope that the congressional leadership, as \nwell as the Clinton administration, will review the position that they \nhave taken, with lukewarm support and no financial support, for a rapid \nreaction force now being deployed there by our allies. That will \nalleviate some of the responsibility the U.S. forces might otherwise \nhave, and that will certainly reduce the danger of any kind of harm to \nU.S. forces that may have to be injected into that country to help with \na withdrawal of U.N. and NATO personnel. I find it supreme irony that \nwe would not be willing to pay our part for other people deploying \ntroops that will be to our direct benefit and an activity that has been \nvoted for by both President Bush's and President Clinton's \nadministrations at every single turn in the U.N. Security Council.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank my colleagues for letting me continue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could I detain the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia for a minute.\n  We were together at a private meeting with President Chirac, and \ninformation has come to my attention with regard to a meeting that \nPresident Chirac had here on Capitol Hill with the majority leader of \nthe Senate and the Speaker of the House. I am told that in that \nmeeting, President Chirac made it clear, after being specifically asked \nby the two leaders, that the rapid reaction force was not--and I \nemphasize not--being deployed to pave the way for an UNPROFOR \nwithdrawal--indeed, had no relationship with NATO withdrawal plans.\n  I do not recall that subject being specifically addressed at the \nmeeting that the Senator from Georgia and I had.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Virginia, I read some of that in \nthe newspaper, but I got a contrary impression. I always hesitate to \nquote a foreign leader in a private meeting, but I must say my \nimpression was not consistent in the meeting we had, which was at the \nFrench Embassy, was not consistent with the reported statements of the \nPresident of France at the meeting with the congressional leadership \nthat took place on the Hill. I did not hear anything like that in the \nprivate meeting that I had.\n  He also made it clear, I believe, that he hoped that the U.N. forces \nwould be able to remain. But I did not hear any statement that would \nindicate that those rapid reaction forces would not be used if and when \nthere was a withdrawal. As a matter of fact, those forces would provide \nthe very first protection if U.S. forces had to go in to help in the \nwithdrawal. This is the first time the United Nations has put a much \nmore heavily prepared force in there, which has been one of the \nproblems all along. When you have a lightly armed force, as the Senator \nfrom Virginia well knows, they are nothing but hostage invitations and \nthat is what has happened. So I know that probably the leadership of \nsome of our allied countries would prefer not to withdraw, but I \nbelieve that all of them would acknowledge if withdrawal is necessary, \nthis rapid deployment force will be the key ingredient in the early \nstages of withdrawal.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I remember, in response to a question that \nI posed, that there was some discussion at our meeting with President \nChirac about the mission of the rapid reaction force. And I am also \ntold that same discussion took place here in the Capitol, at the \nmeeting with the two leaders. When President Chirac was asked by the \nleaders what the mission of the rapid reaction force would be, \nPresident Chirac said that the rapid reaction force would not be \ndeployed to implement the U.N. mandate to protect the safe havens, such \nas Sarajevo. The rapid reaction force would only be deployed to protect \nUNPROFOR.\n  It is my understanding that while Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich \ndid express support for the right of our allies to protect their \ntroops, the leaders did not support the United States being assessed 31 \npercent for this European operation, given, in the judgment of the \nleaders, the futility--and I think the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia expressed the same judgment--of the UNPROFOR mission at this \ntime.\n  So I hope, Mr. President, there will be some clarification of this in \nthe very near future. I was also led to believe that the United Nations \nwould soon be announcing some specific mission statements with regard \nto the new forces.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Virginia, I share his feeling on \nthis subject. I do not know what the President of France said in the \nmeeting that I did not attend. I would not try to have any conjecture \non that. But I do know that common sense tells us--I have met with the \nMinistry of Defense in Britain, I have met with the JCS staff here, the \njoint staff--I know that the withdrawal of those U.N.-NATO forces is \ngoing to be extremely complicated and complex.\n  But one thing the people in the eastern enclaves may feel is that it \nputs them in great jeopardy of being in harm's way after those forces \nleave. It may be very difficult to disentangle from those eastern \nenclaves. So it is going to be a very difficult situation.\n  I know something like this rapid reaction force will be essential--it \nhas to be augmented--but it is an essential first step if there is to \nbe a withdrawal. That is basic common sense. For us to be in a position \nof having pledged to come in and help with the withdrawal and urging \nwithdrawal--and I think there are an increasing number of people urging \nwithdrawal--and then not helping, or at least to even look like we are \nnegative on the first step, which is for the allies to protect \nthemselves, it seems to me that is contrary to our own best interest.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could just discuss one other point \nwith my colleague. He referred to the Administration's proposal to \nallow U.S. forces to perform emergency missions, and he will recall in \nthe hearing before our committee when Secretary of Defense Perry and \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Shalikashvili were \ntestifying, they put up a chart concerning the use of U.S. forces in an \nemergency situation. I think both my friend from Georgia and I were \nsomewhat unclear as to exactly the context in which they were using \n``emergency.''\n  If I can restate my concern and perhaps he can restate, once again, \nhis use of the term here, it was not clear to me whether or not we \nwould involve ourselves in emergency missions only if those emergency \nmissions were a part of a withdrawal operation, or whether we would \ninvolve our ground forces in emergency missions prior to the \ndetermination to withdraw UNPROFOR. [[Page S 8605]] \n  Can the Senator clarify exactly what he said today with reference to \n``emergency''?\n  Mr. NUNN. I can clarify what I said. I hesitate to try and clarify \nwhat was said at that hearing, because I think there was at least \nimplied conflict between what the Secretary of Defense was saying and \nperhaps what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs said, although I thought \nlater in the hearing Secretary Perry made it much clearer as to what \nthe administration had in mind.\n  I must say, in announcing that new dimension of possible U.S. ground \nforce involvement, which occurred about a week prior to that, I did not \nthink the administration ever made it clear as to what they intended. I \ncan only give you my view, therefore, and that is I hope the United \nStates will not have to put in any ground forces at all, but we clearly \nare pledged by the President of the United States to put forces in to \nhelp with the withdrawal.\n  If there are emergencies related to that withdrawal, we would be, I \nam sure, part of any effort to come to the relief of our allies. But \nassuming, before there is a withdrawal, there is some dire emergency, \nthat our allies get into an extreme situation--and I hope that is not \ngoing to happen--with jeopardy to the lives of perhaps a number of \npeople that are basically under a U.N. mandate, under those dire \ncircumstances where there is no other force available, I personally \nwould favor the President of the United States having that authority \nand he probably would assert that under his Commander in Chief \nauthority, whatever we do in the Senate, he is able to come to the aid \nof our allies in that situation.\n  I just do not think you can have a successful alliance, if your \nallies get into an extremely dangerous situation, which you voted for \nand encouraged, and you leave them at their own peril to die in a \nsituation where you could have taken steps to help alleviate that \ndanger. So those are clearly my views. I do not say I speak for anyone \nelse on that subject.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my colleague in expressing support \nfor U.S. participation in an operation to withdraw UNPROFOR, if our \nparticipation is requested by our allies and necessary for the \nsuccessful conclusion of the mission.\n  It is also my view that I hope we do not have to put ground forces \nin. But I think our President has indicated that they would be \navailable to assist in such a withdrawal operation, if necessary. \nClearly, under those circumstances, I would support the use of our \nground and air forces to help in emergency situations associated with \nthe withdrawal. But prior to the decision to withdrawal UNPROFOR, the \nuse of our forces in an emergency situation can have serious \nconsequences, because the word ``emergency'' is really not definable. \nWhile it might be one situation, it could be another and another and \nanother, and very shortly, prior to a withdrawal decision, if we are \ninvolved in a succession of emergency situations, we are in it. Plain \nand simple, we are in the battle at that time. It would be a clear \nperception worldwide, and the use of the term ``emergency'' as \njustification, I feel, would disappear.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Virginia, I understand his position \non this. I think it is an area where I hope we do not have to get \ninvolved. Of course, in an emergency situation we already are involved. \nWe are flying flights over Bosnia. I think the situation the Senator is \ndirecting his comments to is ground forces as opposed to air forces. We \nhave been participating for a year or two. The fact is that we lost a \nplane and, fortunately, thankfully, we rescued the pilot.\n  I would call that an emergency situation. In that situation, we put \nair forces in--helicopters--and were prepared to put ground forces in \nat that time, and possibly had some on the ground at that time, to \nrescue a pilot. I hope if we needed the French to rescue that American \npilot they would have been there. I would think if a French pilot went \ndown tomorrow and they needed us and there was no other way, we would \ngo in there and help that pilot. That is what an alliance is all about.\n  Mr. WARNER. I associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished \nSenator. There an emergency is very clear. A downed aviator, no matter \nwhat nation he may come from, is clearly in an emergency situation. But \nI am concerned about the gray area of other situations as it relates to \nthe disposition of the UNPROFOR forces all over that region, oftentimes \ntwo or three individuals by themselves.\n  Mr. NUNN. I think the Senator makes a good point. I hope that kind of \na situation would not develop. It may very well be that if we have some \nresolution on the floor, that we ought to leave that point without \nspecific authority, perhaps, but leaving it up to the President's \nconstitutional authority as Commander in Chief with consultation with \nCongress. It is hard to authorize that situation specifically, but to \nme it would be a fundamental error to preclude it, to block the \nresolution here. The Senator just acknowledged, if there was a British \nor French pilot that went down, we would want to help.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is part of a NATO operation. I think \nat this point we should also indicate the United States is also \nactively involved in a naval embargo in the Adriatic. In two ways, we \nare a very active participant in those NATO actions.\n  Mr. NUNN. The Senator is entirely correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair for allowing a colloquy with my good \nfriend from Georgia.\n  In conclusion, we point out two areas that require further \ndefinition; namely, the purpose for the rapid reaction force, as well \nas the meaning of ``emergency.'' Those are areas in which I hope \npersons will step forward and provide clarification.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, before the Senator from Georgia leaves \nthe floor, I would like to address a question to him along the lines of \nmy colleague from Virginia. I, too, was at the hearing they were \ndiscussing earlier and I, too, raised questions about the emergency \nhelp that was being discussed and perhaps being offered by U.S. \nforces--the Senator from Georgia must catch a train and will not be \nable to stay, but perhaps I can talk to my colleague from Virginia, \nbecause I know he has some of the same concerns that I do.\n  I raised a question about the emergency nature of what our commitment \nwould be: Would it be only in conjunction with the evacuation, or would \nit be any emergency that might arise in a reconfiguration effort?\n  It was my understanding in the hearing that we really were looking at \nany emergency, and I worry about that description because I believe \nthat leaves us open to any conflict on the ground in Bosnia.\n  But then the Senator from Georgia also raised the issue of the air \nflights in which we do now participate, and I am concerned that we are \nnot doing everything necessary to protect our forces in those \noverflights. For instance, the question was asked at that hearing--I am \nsure the Senator from Virginia remembers--the question was asked:\n Are we going to take out the missiles, or are we going to stop the \noverflights until there is cover? I would like to ask the Senator from \nVirginia if he, too, is concerned about the continuing flying efforts \nif we do not at least have an understanding about what our role is \ngoing to be, if we are going to take out the missile sites before we go \nforward, or if we are going to continue to put our flights in jeopardy?\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for joining \nus in this very important colloquy. Indeed, we serve together on the \nArmed Services Committee, and she has taken a very active role in the \npolicy formulations of the committee on this tragic situation in that \npart of the world.\n  Just recently, I say to my good friend, the Senator from Texas, I \npublicly said that our committee, the Armed Services Committee, has a \nresponsibility to investigate very clearly the circumstances under \nwhich Captain O'Grady's mission was not performed in the accompaniment \nof other aircraft--aircraft which are specifically designed and \nequipped for suppression of ground-to-air missiles. And we will have to \nlook into that, because no member of the Armed Forces of the [[Page S \n8606]] United States, wherever he or she may be in the world today, \nshould ever be subjected to a risk, which risk can be lessened to some \nextent by the utilization of other assets possessed by the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  The Senator will recall that General Shalikashvili said that some \n69,000 missions had been flown successfully without a loss, such as \nCaptain O'Grady, and that this particular mission was a longer route, \nwhere there had been--I think I quote him accurately--``no detection of \nground-to-air systems,'' such as to justify the inclusion of other \nassets. Now, that is something we have to determine, because \nsubsequently thereto in those reports and the testimony of the general \nbefore the committee on which the Senator from Texas and I sit, came \nthe reports that there had been some collection of signals in another \narea of our intelligence which lent themselves to the theory that there \nwas present on that particular flight path a ground-to-air system. And \nin fact there was. So that is one of the things we have to ascertain. \nTwofold: Was there a breakdown in intelligence if in fact those signals \nwere collected and confirmed? And, second, exactly what policies and \nprocedures does the Department of Defense employ at such time as they \nput our uniformed people in a situation of great risk?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will just add to the two points that \nhave been made by the Senator from Virginia that I think we also should \ninquire about exactly what flights we are going to participate in and \nif we are going to take some action to make sure that we either take \nout the missiles which had been suggested by NATO and vetoed by the \nUnited Nations earlier in this process, or if we should stop \nparticipating in those overflights, over that disputed territory, \nbefore we get into a situation where we have another of our young men \nshot down, as we witnessed.\n  Thank goodness we had a good result, because we now have Captain \nO'Grady back safe and sound. But I think these are very important \npoints that the Armed Services Committee should look into before any \nkind of authorization is given, and I think there are a lot of \nquestions to be asked. I thank the Senator for his leadership in this \neffort.\n  The Senator from Virginia has really been a wonderful conscience for \nthis conflict. I appreciate the work he has done on the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas for her \nthoughtful remarks, and indeed I could say the same about the Senator \nfrom Texas and her participation in her years on the committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8602-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8606-S8607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM DESIGNATION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to know what the status \nof floor action is, because I have two amendments that are technical \nand have been agreed to by both sides, which I would like to propose.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the matter before the Senate is the \nunderlying bill, am I not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Amendments are now in order, and I note that the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas has several amendments, as reflected \non the documents submitted to us. This would be an appropriate time to \ntake those into consideration.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1424\n\n(Purpose: To change the description of a rural access project in Texas)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1424.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1  . RURAL ACCESS PROJECTS.\n\n       Item 111 of the table in section 1106(a)(2) of the \n     Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 \n     (Public Law 102-240; 105 Stat. 2042) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Parker County'' and inserting ``Parker \n     and Tarrant Counties''; and\n       (2) by striking ``to four-lane'' and inserting ``in Tarrant \n     County to freeway standards and in Parker County to a 4-\n     lane''.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is indeed a technical amendment. \nIt just adds Tarrant County to the list of what counties may be \nincluded in this rural access projects. The reason is because a little \nbit of work needs to be done in Tarrant County for the Parker County \nproject that was already approved.\n  ISTEA section 1106(a)--rural access projects--contains a project to \nupgrade an existing highway to four lane divided highway in Parker \nCounty, TX. In order to complete this project as envisioned, some work \nmust be undertaken in neighboring Tarrant County.\n  However, ISTEA makes no mention of Tarrant County in the project \nauthorization and there is a question at TXDOT as to whether it can \ncomplete the project through Tarrant County with the ISTEA-authorized \nfunds since Tarrant is not specifically named in ISTEA by virtue of \noversight.\n  I am offering a technical amendment to ISTEA which extends \nauthorization to complete the project as intended in Tarrant County. \nThis amendment does not authorize any additional funds.\n  Passage of this language has become critical because work undertaken \nunder the ISTEA rural access authorization has reached the Tarrant \nCounty line and Congress must clarify that it may continue so that the \nTexas Department of Transportation may complete the project.\n  The House has included this technical correction in every original \nlegislation in 1991. It also was included in last year's NHS bill and \nwill likely do so again in this year's version. I thank the chairman \nand ranking minority member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee for their support in rectifying this small, but important, \nproblem in Tarrant County.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand that amendment is essentially a technical \ncorrection to the ISTEA legislation. The managers are prepared to \naccept it. I would like to await the arrival of my comanager before \ndoing so.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside so that I may offer another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1425\n\n (Purpose: To change the identification of a high priority corridor on \n                 the National Highway System in Texas)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1425.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 36, strike lines 2 and 3 and insert the following:\n       Interstate System.'';\n       (2) in paragraph (18)--\n       (A) by striking ``and''; and\n       (B) by inserting before the period at the end the \n     following: ``, and to the Lower Rio Grande Valley at the \n     border between the United States and Mexico''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this amendment would extend high-\npriority corridor 18 from where it currently ends in Houston, TX, all \nthe way to the Mexican border in the lower Rio Grande Valley.\n  Under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, \ncorridor 18 now extends from Indianapolis, IN, through Evansville, IN, \nMemphis, TN, Shreveport/Bossier, LA, terminating in Houston, TX. \nCorridor 18, along with corridor 20--from Laredo to Houston--are \ntogether popularly referred to as I-69.\n  Extending corridor 18 to the Rio Grande Valley will expedite the \nshipment of goods traded between Mexico, the United States, and Canada \nby providing a direct link from the Canadian border to the Mexican \nborder through the heart of the United States. Eighty [[Page S \n8607]] percent of United States trade with Mexico is land-based. \nBecause of geography, economic development, and commerce on both sides \nof the border, Texas is the funnel through which the majority of land-\nbased United States-Mexico trade must pass.\n  More than 50 percent of that traffic crosses the border at the Rio \nGrande Valley and Laredo; that number is expected to increase to almost \n75 percent over the next decade. This amendment would give the growing \ntraffic on the high-priority corridor system convenient access to the \nentire United States-Mexico border.\n  Currently there are 9 existing border crossings in the lower Rio \nGrande Valley, with a total of 30 lanes. In 1994, they handled \napproximately 28.3 million crossings. Given the number of existing and \nplanned bridges, the lower Rio Grande Valley is an increasingly \nsignificant center for cross-border commerce.\n  Extending corridor 18 to the lower Rio Grande Valley will provide a \ndirect link for the eight States along the I-69 corridor--which \naccounted for $50.6 billion or 38 percent of the dollar value of United \nStates trade with Mexico and Canada in 1993.\n  It will maximize the use of our border crossings. It will create a \nfirst-rate extended route that will distribute border traffic over \nseveral entry points, allowing for cost-efficient cross-border movement \nof goods.\n  Extending corridor 18 to the lower Rio Grande will create an \ninfrastructure that will enable the United States to maximize economic \ndevelopment through all of the States that I have just mentioned, as \nwell as our ability to move goods and better capitalize on \ninternational trade.\n  Finally, the development of corridor 18 to the lower Rio Grande \nValley will link up with infrastructure development in Mexico. \nCurrently, the Mexican State of Tamaulipas is advancing plans to \nconstruct a gulf highway corridor from the industrial center of Mexico \nCity to the Rio Grande Valley.\n  I want to say how much I appreciate the assistance of the chairman, \nthe ranking minority member of the Environmental and Public Works \nCommittee, and the distinguished Senator, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, from Virginia, in this matter and say that this is truly \ngoing to enhance our ability to capitalize on NAFTA. It will affect all \nof the States that are going to have the ability to have the traffic \nand increase the trade between Mexico and the United States and Canada. \nThis is a win for everyone.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator from \nVirginia, the Senator from Rhode Island, and the Senator from Montana, \nin allowing me to put forward these amendments that I think will \nincrease the economic benefit to all three countries that are \nparticipating in NAFTA.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas that we indeed commend the Senator for diligently looking \nafter the interest of the State of Texas as it relates to the \ninterstate highway system.\n  These are two very important changes. They do not involve new NHS \nmiles. However, they are essential for the purpose of the use of this \nsystem in your State.\n  I commend the Senator for bringing them to the attention of the \nSenate. I urge the adoption of the amendments presented by the Senator \nfrom Texas. They are agreed to by the managers on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment numbered 1425.\n  The amendment (No. 1425) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1424\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, may we proceed to the second amendment, and I urge \nits adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nnumbered 1424.\n  The amendment (No. 1424) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. We thank the Senator from Texas and we appreciate the \nparticipation of all Senators in moving along this legislation.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to join in the commendation \nto the Senator from Texas for the vigor with which she has handled \nthis. She certainly is a strong proponent for her State, rightfully so, \nand she does an excellent job. I congratulate her.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I did not know the Senator from Rhode Island had come \nback to the floor. I had mentioned him before, but I could not have \nasked for more cooperation in getting these two amendments through than \nI have seen from the chairman of the committee, the Senator from Rhode \nIsland. He is doing a terrific job in shepherding this very important \nbill through.\n  This bill actually is going to enhance our infrastructure in this \ncountry. It is going to create jobs. It is going to lower costs and \nincrease productivity. It will improve air quality. There are so many \nside effects for this bill that are going to be good for everyone. I do \nappreciate the leadership of the Senator from Rhode Island in getting \nit through.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I noted a short while ago that three or \nfour of my colleagues were addressing themselves to the most recent \nevents in the former Yugoslavia. I myself wanted to take this occasion \nto do the same, because the events there, which have been \nheartbreaking, tragic, frustrating, and infuriating in various degrees \nfor the last 3 years, seem to only get more so.\n  I rise today, as I have on numerous occasions over the past years to \ntalk about the tragedy which continues to unfold in Bosnia. There seems \nto be no end to the suffering of innocent people in that war-torn land. \nNo end to the senseless murder of women and children in once-beautiful \ncities like Sarajevo. I saw a news clip this weekend; in the midst of \nthe firing on the city that went on, the flowers come up--remembrances \nof times that were better there. Even today, as people have to go to \nrivers running through the town to try to get some water with which to \nwash themselves, perhaps to boil it for drinking water or for cooking. \nNo end to the outrageous, illegal, and fundamentally immoral conduct of \ninternational outlaws who are operating under the banner of the Bosnian \nSerbs from their headquarters in Pale. No end to the humiliation of the \nUnited Nations and to the brave soldiers wearing the blue hats of \nUNPROFOR who are beleaguered in every spot where they have been \nstationed in Bosnia. No end to the chaos, confusion, and indecisiveness \nof the international community which has allowed this situation to \ndeteriorate to its current, tragic, pathetic low point. Regrettably, \nU.S. policy has been part of this sad story.\n  Mr. President, the headlines of today's New York Times highlight the \ndepths to which the policies of the West have fallen--``Captives Free, \nU.N. Gives Up Effort to Shield Sarajevo.''\n  So what has happened here? International outlaws--the Serbs--seize \nU.N. soldiers--peacekeepers, supposedly, wearing the blue helmets, \nnoncombatants--seize them as hostages. And what is their reward? Their \nreward is that the United Nations ceases to enforce a U.N. resolution \nwhich compelled U.N. forces to protect Sarajevo and other safe areas in \nBosnia. In other words, internationally, at least in Bosnia, crime does \npay. The most outrageous, inhumane crime.\n  And of course, the seizing of the U.N. personnel was not the worst of \nit. Capt. [[Page S 8608]] Scott O'Grady has become quite justifiably \nand, thank God, a national hero for his courage, for his steadfastness, \nhis extraordinary resourcefulness, for the skill of the American \nmarines who came to his aid, for the effectiveness of American \ntechnology that, combined with his bravery, created the circumstance in \nwhich he could be liberated, could be saved. But, Mr. President, let us \nnot forget what happened. Captain O'Grady, was on a patrolling mission, \nnot a hostile mission. He was on a mission to enforce a U.N. resolution \nthat there be a no fly zone over Bosnia, that fixed-wing aircraft not \nfly. And he was shot down in a hostile act by Serbian missiles. And \neven after those days of eating grass and bugs to keep himself alive, \ncovering himself face-down in the dirt so that the Serbian soldiers \nwalking by would not find him, finally he gets the message out, and \nthose two CH-53E Super Stallions come in with the Marines to rescue \nthis American hero, and what happens? They are fired on by the Serbs--\nreally an act of war. The domestic equivalent to this would be, what \nwould happen if criminals in a city in our country seized police who \nwere walking or riding on a routine mission, and then when other police \ncame to take them out, fired on those other police. What would our \nreaction be? We would go in with all we had to get them out; we would \nfeel that we had an obligation in the interest of law to punish them. \nWhat happens here? Nothing. The Serbs got away with it.\n  So this is the headline, ``Captives Free, U.N. Gives Up Effort to \nShield Sarajevo.'' The captives obviously are the U.N. peacekeepers who \nwere held as hostages for these past weeks. While their return marks \nthe end of one more crisis in Bosnia, it also demonstrates all too \nclearly why the U.N. forces should no longer be on the ground in \nBosnia. There is no peace for these supposed peacekeepers to keep. \nBarely equipped for self-defense and left in positions where they are \ncontinuously vulnerable to Serb humiliation and manipulation, these men \ndo not lack for individual courage, but their hands have been tied by \nOrwellian U.N. policies where appeasement of the Bosnian Serbs is seen \nas a virtue and self-defense by the United Nations is seen as a vice. \nAnd so the last of these so-called peacekeepers have been returned from \ntheir illegal and immoral imprisonment. But at what price?\n  Apparently in exchange for the release of these hostages, the United \nNations has now withdrawn from all of the heavy weapons-collection \nsites around Sarajevo and withdrawn into the city. And now, they too \ncan become targets once again of the wanton Serb artillery, rocket, \nmortar, and sniper fire that lands on Sarajevo. It is precisely this \nSerb use of civilians, hospitals, apartment buildings, schools, and \nplaygrounds for target practice which yesterday cost another 7 people \ntheir lives and wounded 10 others, I gather, seeking water, at the very \ntime the U.N. hostages were being released. Many of these people were \nelderly Sarajevans standing in line for water--water that has become \never scarcer as the Serb stranglehold on Sarajevo continues unabated. \nAnd what is the understanding that is worked out between the United \nNations and the Serb positions from which the artillery came? Only that \nthey allow the water to be turned on again.\n  And so the ultimatum which the United Nations issued early last year \nto protect the people of Sarajevo has now gone the way of all of the \nUnited Nations' efforts in Bosnia--it has been trampled under the heel \nof the Serbian indifference, the Serbian flouting, the Serbian \ndisregard--I cannot find a noun strong enough for what I feel--of the \nrule of law and the conduct of civilized States at the end of the 20th \ncentury. This follows aggression. This follows genocidal acts against \npeople singled out only because of religion, in this case Moslem. Two \nhundred thousand dead, two million refugees taken from their homes, \nincreasingly under the cover of a U.N. mission that was supposed to \nbring peace, but has not brought any of it and has, unfortunately, \nincreased the suffering. The top U.N. official in Bosnia, Yasushi \nAkashi, has now declared that UNPROFOR will adhere strictly to \npeacekeeping principles; thus, the use of force will, apparently, no \nlonger be considered by the United Nations. In fact, Mr. Akashi \nindicated last week, 10 days ago, that the United Nations would only \nact when they had Serb permission to do so. Mr. Akashi, I say to you \nthat it is time to wake up and look around at the ashes of what once \nwas a multiethnic society in Bosnia--there is no peace to keep. Why is \nUNPROFOR remaining in Bosnia to perform a mission which by definition \ncannot be performed there?\n It is as if these courageous, but ill-fated soldiers wearing the U.N. \nuniform had been thrown in by the nations that control the United \nNations as a kind of stop-gap measure to answer the question, ``What \nare you doing to stop the aggression and slaughter and genocide in \nBosnia?'' And so the peacekeepers have been thrown in, where there is \nno peace, without the capacity to defend themselves, bringing \nhumiliation on the United Nations and on the rule of law and civility \nin international relations. It is time for the U.N. leadership and the \nheads of the countries with forces in the UNPROFOR to acknowledge that \nin spite of everything else that has gone on, it is time for UNPROFOR \nto get out. The UNPROFOR mission should be terminated de jure as well \nas de facto, because de facto, it is over, it does not stand for \nanything, it is not helping anyone, as the events of the past week \ncoming right down to yesterday, show. With the withdrawal of UNPROFOR, \nthe international community will again have the opportunity to act to \nlift the immoral arms embargo of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an embargo \nthat has left one side with heavy weapons, the other side ill prepared \nto defend families and country. If other countries will not go along \nwith what is perhaps the last, best hope not only for the people of \nBosnia but for the rule of law, for the standards of international \nopposition to aggression and genocide, then the United States, I hope, \nwill lift it unilaterally, without delay. But, of course, if the United \nNations is out, the traditional excuse, rationalization of our allies \nin NATO for not supporting a lifting of the embargo, which is that it \nmight lead to the seizing of hostages, will be eliminated. Hostages \nhave been taken. With the United Nations out, there will be no more \nhostages to take. To deny the legitimate Government of Bosnia the right \nto defend its sovereignty and the lives of its people is simply wrong.\n\n  Mr. President, last week Prime Minister Silajdzic of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina was in Washington. Many of us had the chance to hear him, \nto meet with him. I must say, I have seen him several times here in \nWashington. I have never seen him so grim. I have never seen him so \nfrustrated. I have never seen him so deeply concerned, depressed about \nthe suffering which his people continue to endure without hope of that \nassistance that they continue to feel and pray for is just around the \ncorner, particularly from the United States of America, the last, best \nhope for people who suffer as the Bosnians have.\n  I have also never seen Prime Minister Silajdzic so determined that \nBosnia will continue to fight for its rights as a sovereign state. \nBecause no one else will come to their aid. If they are not for \nthemselves, literally, who else will be? And if not now, when? The \nPrime Minister made clear once again that he does not want American \nsoldiers on Bosnian soil. He wants to have the ability--the weaponry--\nfor the brave Bosnians to fight their own fight. What they seek is the \nright to obtain those weapons which will enable them to defend \nthemselves against those who have committed aggression and genocide \nagainst them.\n  Time has been running out for the people of Bosnia for too long now. \nThe United Nations has not been willing or able to stop the bloodshed. \nIt is time for the United Nations to step aside. What is left is for \nthe people of Bosnia to fight their own fight with our assistance: at \nleast with us untying their hands, which we have tied behind their \nbacks by the continued imposition of this embargo, which originated at \na time when the State of Bosnia did not exist, as an attempt to avoid \nthe expansion of war by keeping arms out of the area. But it is the \nSerbs in Belgrade who control most of the war-fighting industrial \ncapacity that was Yugoslavia's. It is the Bosnians who are left to \nfight tanks with light arms. [[Page S 8609]] Mr. President, the \ngrotesque advantages that have been given to the aggressor here, as we \ncontinue to declare a kind of neutrality which amounts to immorality, \ndefies all standards of decency and international law. The time is at \nhand for us finally to answer the call for help which has been coming, \nbut has been unanswered, from Bosnia for too long. I hope that my \ncolleagues in both parties in this chamber will be able to play a \nleadership role in supporting, encouraging, as rapidly as possible, the \nwithdrawal of the U.N. forces from Bosnia, the lifting of the arms \nembargo, and the selective use of Allied air power to protect not just \nthe sovereignty of a nation, Bosnia, that has been invaded by a \nneighbor, but to protect the rule of law, in Europe and throughout the \nworld. In that, we here continue to have a vital national interest.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gramm).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the \nnational highway bill. I believe it is a good bill. But I believe there \nis one provision of the bill that, quite frankly, needs to be changed. \nSo tomorrow, Senator Lautenberg and I will be offering an amendment to \nretain the current maximum national speed limit.\n  The bill as it is currently written totally repeals this law. I \nbelieve this action of repealing this law clearly flies in the face of \nreality, commonsense, logic, and history because I believe that on this \nissue the facts are in and they are conclusive.\n  Let us talk a little history. In 1973, 55,000 people died in car-\nrelated fatalities in this country. In 1974, the next year, Congress \nestablished the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit.\n  That is very same year highway fatalities dropped by 16-percent--a 16 \npercent reduction the very next year after Congress imposed the 55-\nmile-per-hour speed limit. Fatalities that year dropped from 55,000--in \n1973--to 46,000 in 1974.\n  Mr. President, according to the National Academy of Sciences, the \nnational speed limit law saves somewhere between 2,000 and 4,000 lives \nevery year. So there have been as many as 80,000 lives saved in this \ncountry because of this law since 1974.\n  Mr. President, another historical fact moving forward to 1987: When \nthe mandatory speed limit was amended in 1987 to allow the 65-mile-per-\nhour speed limit on some of the rural interstates in this country, the \nfatalities on those highways went up 30 percent more than had been \nexpected. Increasing the speed limit to 65 miles per hour on rural \ninterstates cost 500 lives per year. Those highways are among the \nsafest roads in America. What happens when we totally repeal that law, \ntotally repeal the 55 miles per hour, not just on the rural interstates \nbut in the urban interstates as well? I think we will continue to see \nit go up, and it will go up at a much faster rate--the fatalities.\n  If we were to see just the same increase--30 percent--that we saw on \nthe rural highways in the rest of the interstate system because of this \nparticular law, the Department of Transportation estimates an \nadditional 4,750 people would die every single year.\n  I think that is clearly not the direction we need to go in in the \narea of highway safety. I believe that we need to go in the opposite \ndirection because there are obviously far too many Americans dying on \nthe highways of this country every year.\n  In my home State of Ohio in 1993 a total of 1,482 people were killed \nin car accidents. Over 20 percent of those accidents were speed \nrelated. Nationwide, excessive speed is a factor in one-third of all \nfatal crashes.\n  Mr. President, I believe the old adage got it exactly right. Speed \ndoes kill. And even if interstate highways were designed for 70-mile-\nper-hour travel, people are not. People are not designed to survive \ncrashes at that speed. As speed increases, driver reaction time \ndecreases. The distance the driver needs, if he is trying to stop, \nincreases. When speed goes above 55 miles per hour, every 10-mile-per-\nhour increase doubles--doubles--the force of the injury-causing impact. \nThis means that at a 65-mile-per-hour speed, a crash is twice as severe \nas a crash at 55 miles per hour. A crash at 75 miles per hour is four \ntimes more severe.\n  A speed limit of over 55 is a known killer. Let us face that fact and \ndo the right thing right here as part of this bill. That means I \nbelieve voting ``aye'' on the amendment which Senator Lautenberg and I \nwill propose tomorrow. [[Page S 8610]] \n  I intend to come to the floor again tomorrow to talk at further \nlength about this particular amendment. But I do believe that what we \ndo in this body has consequences. I do not think anyone should be led \nto believe that passing the bill as it is currently written, passing a \nbill that flies in the face of 20 years of statistics, 20 years of \nhistory, 20 years of saving lives, makes any sense. I think each one of \nus, as we cast our vote tomorrow on this particular amendment, needs to \nthink about it and needs to think of young people and old people whose \nlives have been saved over the past 20 years because of this law. To \nrepeal it with no real compelling urgency, and no real need to do this, \nI think would be a very tragic mistake.\n  Mr. President, I will, along with my colleague, be offering this \namendment tomorrow. I plan on debating this at length tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from Ohio \nwould remain on the floor for just a moment, I would like to \ncongratulate him for his remarks. I will be one of many Senators \nsupporting him. This is very much a part of the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1991.\n   But just to add to the remark, the Senator speaks of the fatalities. \nAnd could I suggest also that since 1965, when we established the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration and began the work on \nvehicular design and crashworthiness, there has been the whole idea of \nseat belts, and now, of course, air bags, and the redesigning of the \nautomobiles' interiors and such like; is very important work. Dr. \nWilliam Haddon, whom I had worked with in Albany in the 1950's, became \nthe first Director of that Administration.\n  The idea that there are two collisions when a car hits a tree--\nnothing gets hurt unless you have a thing about trees. It is when a \nperson in the car--hits the inside of the car that you have a personal \ninjury.\n  We have done a very great deal of work in this regard over what is \nnow a generation such that collisions which would once have been \nroutinely fatal would now simply be seriously injurious.\n  When we think of the number of lives that are at risk by raising the \nspeed limit, which I think is the case, we could compound that by a \nfactor, probably of tenfold, of injuries which need not be minor, which \ncan be crippling, can be permanent, can be hugely costly, and can be \navoided by maintaining the commonsense regulations we have in place, \nwhich we put in place by a long hard process of learning about what \nreally was involved in managing this particularly implicitly dangerous \nsystem.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the Senator \nfrom New York not only for his long interest in this area going back \nfor several decades but for the work he has done.\n  I read an article by the Senator a few months ago talking about the \nfact that there are really two things we always have to deal with in \ntrying to reduce auto fatalities. And one is driver behavior but the \nother is the design of the car, and things that are external to that \ndriver.\n  As the Senator pointed out--I cannot recall whether it was an article \nor an op-ed piece--tragically it was something that we should not be \nsurprised by. It is easier many times to alter the car, to alter the \nspeed limit, and to do other things than to alter the behavior of the \ndriver. Certainly, the Senator has been a real leader in the efforts to \ndo that, in the efforts to develop the change in design of the car, the \nseat belts, and air bags, and the other things that every single day \nare saving lives in this country, not to say that we do not want to \ncontinue with the work on driver behavior. It is something that we all \nhave to work on.\n  But the Senator from New York has been a real leader in this whole \narea. I want to congratulate him, and I appreciate his comments and am \nlooking forward to working with him on the floor tomorrow.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It is very generous of the Senator.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I join in the commendation of the Senator \nfrom Ohio with the effort he is going to undertake tomorrow with the \nSenator from New Jersey in restoring the speed limit, which the \ncommittee of jurisdiction eliminated.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the speed limit currently is 55 miles an \nhour on interstates except 65 miles an hour on rural interstates. I \nthink this has worked well. Anybody who has given any thought to this \nmatter has seen the tremendous destruction of lives and equipment and \nlost time and horrible injuries that have arisen from speeding and the \naccidents that result therefrom.\n  Just think of it. In our country, on the highways, 40,000 people a \nyear are killed. That is an astonishing figure. I think the total \ndeaths in Vietnam were something like 57,000, and that is a shocking \nfigure. But that occurred over some 5 years. Every year, 40,000 people \nare killed. And those are the deaths. I think you can extrapolate \nsomething like four times that for the serious injuries; in other \nwords, the people who live but are seriously injured.\n  And so I think this is no time, Mr. President, to change the speed \nlimit. But it was the view of the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks that we should change it. I congratulate the Senator from Ohio. \nIt is my understanding, am I not correct, that the Senator will be \njoining with the Senator from New Jersey to restore the speed limit?\n  Mr. DeWINE. That is correct.\n  The thing I point out to the Senate and my colleagues is it is really \nrestoring the status quo. It is restoring it to something that has \nclearly worked. As the Senator from New York has also pointed out, this \nhas worked. This has saved lives. Without any compelling reason, to \nturn back the clock and to ignore 20 years of history, over 20 years' \ndemonstrated experience of saving lives, really makes absolutely no \nsense. I think the consequences of what we do tomorrow are very \nsignificant. A lot of times, we do things in this Chamber, and we act \nas if they are important, but they are really not. What we do tomorrow \non this vote will make a difference and lives, I believe, will be \naffected. I am absolutely convinced the evidence shows that if we raise \nthe speed limit from the national perspective, people will die. People \nwill die who would not have died if we had kept the law the way it is.\n  That may sound brutally blunt, but I think at times we have to be \nblunt. And I think the facts clearly show that is what we are talking \nabout. So I appreciate my colleagues' comments very much.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if I could detain my friend from Ohio \nand the distinguished chairman just another moment, we say that there \nare 40,000 lives lost a year on highways. When we began working on the \nepidemiology of automobile crashes--not accidents; they are not \naccidents; they are predictable events in a complex system--we were \nalready approaching 50,000 deaths a year. In the interval since we \nbegan changing design with passive restraints and such, we cannot have \nbut doubled the number of automobiles and doubled the number of miles, \nbut the number of deaths has actually dropped.\n  I make a point that this idea of passive restraints, where you build \nsafety into the system, you will find in the Bible. And in the best \ntradition of this institution, I would like to cite--this was first \nfound by William Hadden, Jr., the Dr. Hadden I mentioned. It is in \nDeuteronomy, chapter 22, verse 8:\n\n       When thou buildest a new house, thou shalt make a \n     battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine \n     house, if any man fall from thence.\n\n  It is a simple idea. Have a railing so in the dark you do not step \noff and land 40 feet below. It is elementally good sense, but it is \namazing how much argument it can take, and we shall hear more such \nargument tomorrow. But I wish the Senator from Ohio great good fortune.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am impressed by the quote from \nDeuteronomy, and I think that will help our cause greatly.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to say to the Senator from Ohio that \nnot [[Page S 8611]] only do I commend him for his efforts in connection \nwith the speed limit, but I also would draw his attention to another \nsafety measure that will probably be attempted to be undermined here \ntomorrow, and that is the legislation we have which passed in 1991 in \nconnection with the interstate transportation legislation fathered by \nthe distinguished Senator from New York, and that legislation \nencourages States to pass mandatory seatbelt laws and mandatory \nmotorcycle helmet laws.\n  Every single Senator on this floor, in connection with health, if \nasked: ``Are you for preventive medicine?'' would say, ``Yes. Sure, \ncertainly I am for preventive medicine.'' But if there ever was \npreventive medicine of a very dramatic type, it is the mandatory \nseatbelt laws and the mandatory helmets for motorcyclists.\n  Let us just take the motorcycle helmets. The correlation between the \ndecline of deaths for motorcyclists and the passage of laws dealing \nwith mandatory helmets absolutely exists. That correlation is there.\n  Example: California. California, I suppose, has more motorcyclists \nper capita than any State in the Nation. And the California \nLegislature, the General Assembly in California three times had passed \nmandatory helmet laws, but the Governor, prior to Governor Wilson, a \nRepublican, vetoed that legislation, and the veto was not overridden.\n  Governor Wilson, then a Senator here, sponsored or joined in \nsponsoring legislation mandating the use of helmets, mandatory helmet \nlaws. He then was elected Governor of California, and as Governor of \nCalifornia, when that legislation mandating motorcycle helmets passed, \nGovernor Wilson signed it, despite the fact that the motorcyclists, \nsome 3,000 or 4,000 strong, circled the capitol in Sacramento \nprotesting. So again Governor--former Senator--Wilson signed the \nlegislation.\n  Now, what has been the result? The result has been a decline in \ndeaths of motorcyclists of 36 percent, from 1 year to the next. It \nfollowed the years following that legislation.\n  That is extraordinary. There is no reason it can be ascribed to other \nthan that law. Maryland is the same way. Maryland passed the law--a 20 \npercent decline. And nearly all the populace States have passed that \nlaw--Texas, and Florida. I regret that my State has not passed it. We \nare certainly not one of the more popular States.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Populace.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Populace States. Oh, a very popular State, but not \npopulace. And Ohio, likewise, has not passed it. But I have urged the \npassage of that legislation in my State. Certainly, I am going to vote \nto retain the requirement--it is not a requirement. What it is is a \nfactor in the law, a provision in the law which says States that do not \npass that legislation will have to devote a certain amount of their \nhighway funds to education and training for safety purposes--safety\n in helmets, safety in motorcycles, safety in automobiles.\n\n  I will be very candid, the States do not like that because it takes \nsome of their highway funds that they would rather spend on highways \nthan on education.\n  You might ask, ``What is the Federal Government doing in this anyway? \nIsn't this a States rights matter? Why doesn't the Federal Government \nstay out of this?''\n  The reason we are in it, and deeply into it, is because we pay \nMedicaid. There is not a State where we do not pay 50 percent of \nMedicaid and, in most instances, pay more than that. So if we are \npaying the piper, we have a right to call the tune.\n  These motorcyclists--I will say more on this tomorrow when the \namendment comes up--but these motorcyclists who are laid up in \nhospitals, grievously injured, many in a coma because they have head \ninjuries because they did not wear a helmet, they are being maintained \nin these hospitals by Medicaid. They do not have fancy insurance \npolicies. They are being maintained by Medicaid, which you and I and \nyou and you and you and the people in the galleries and elsewhere are \npaying. They are paying the bill.\n  I think if we are paying the bill, we have a right to require at \nleast that these motorcyclists wear helmets and, to the extent it can \nbe monitored, that the seat belts be used in the vehicles.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the distinguished chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I sure will. I just want to say, I know the Senator from \nOhio may be leaving. I am proselytizing him for his vote in connection \nwith that particular measure.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Perhaps he will stay long enough to hear this question.\n  The distinguished chairman, sometime Secretary of the Navy, was a \ncombat marine in the Second World War; is that not right?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is true.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. A combat marine.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Although all marines would say they are a combat marine, \nsince there is no such thing as a noncombat marine.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. When you were in combat with those marines, were there \nmarines who thought it was somehow unmanly to wear helmets?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I cannot remember any.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. ``I'm macho, I will take this helmet off.''\n  Mr. CHAFEE. No; not for long anyway.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank you for the answers to my questions.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. As a matter of fact, many a marine would be delighted if \nhe could have crawled into his helmet. It somehow had a protective \nfeeling, a helmet.\n  So, there we are, Mr. President. Unless anybody else has anything \nfurther to say, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New York \nand I are here. We are ready to do business. There are 15-plus \namendments that are on the agreement for tomorrow. I see no reason why \nwe cannot dispose of some of them now. Some might be agreed to, some \nmight be contested, at least they can be debated. We will not have any \nvotes, but it is a good time to have a discussion. I think it is too \nbad we are whiling away the day here with no action.\n  As I say, the Senator from New York and I are here and the store is \nopen and looking for customers. So, Mr. President, I hope the call will \ngo out near and wide to come on over and offer your amendments.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I simply would like to restate the \nrequest, if I may put it in those terms, certainly the invitation, of \nour chairman, noting once again Senator Baucus is necessarily absent. \nWe have a long list of amendments. There is work to be done. On the \nother hand, it could be that people feel the product of the committee \nis so finely crafted that it would really be superfluous, if not at \nsome level diminishing, to change it now that it has come to the floor, \nin which event we can be out of here in this regard by noon tomorrow.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1426\n\n       (Purpose: To ensure that High Priority Corridor 18 is \n     included on the approved National Highway System after \n     feasibility study is completed)\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Mr. Bumpers and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan], for Mr. Bumpers, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1426.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       [[Page S 8612]]\n       \n     SEC.   . INCLUSION OF HIGH PRIORITY CORRIDORS.\n\n       Section 1105(d) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-240; 105 Stat 2033) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``The Secretary of Transportation shall include High \n     Priority Corridor 18 as identified in section 1105(c) of this \n     Act, as amended, on the approved National Highway System \n     after completion of the feasibility study by the States as \n     provided by such Act.''\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this is a clarifying amendment. It \nestablishes that high-priority corridor 18 is in fact included in the \nNational Highway System. This had been a presumptive fact, but \ncircumstances have arisen which make it prudent and in the interest of \nthe State of Arkansas that this be so stated in statute.\n  I believe this amendment will be agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Members on this side are in agreement \nwith this amendment and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is an agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1426) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8609-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FRANCE TO CONDUCT NUCLEAR TESTS\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I was disturbed, almost alarmed, when I \nsaw that the new President of France had said that France was going to \nconduct eight nuclear tests. It is not at all certain, from the press \nreleases I have seen, what the magnitude of those tests will be--that \nis, how much plutonium will be used and what the kilotonnage will be.\n  Second, I would like to say that I think President Chirac is off to a \nvery bad start. The precedent that he is setting is certainly going to \ninfluence people in this country who, for no sound reason, think we \nshould also begin testing again. And sure enough, this morning, I read \nan account--I think maybe from Reuters--that our Secretary of Defense, \nWilliam Perry, has said that he is getting ready to present the \nPresident with a series of options for resuming tests, from 4 pounds of \nplutonium to a full-scale test. He does not say how many tests will be \nconducted. But the argument is the same as that being used by France, \nthat is, we have to determine the reliability of our deployed weapons \nand our stockpiles.\n  Now, bear in mind, Mr. President, that we test our ballistic missiles \nevery year. I have been arguing on the floor of the Senate for 3 years \nthat we are buying more D-5 missiles than we can possibly use on our \nTrident submarines. And in my arguments, I have always insisted that \nthe number I think we should procure is not only adequate for the \npurposes, but also allows the Defense Department to continue testing \nanywhere from three to five D-5 missiles every year to determine their \nreliability.\n  I understand that this falls in the category of things that the \nDefense Department would like to do but does not have to do.\n  We are coming up on a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which is \nsupposed to go into effect in 1996, and we are all trying to get under \nthe wire now with these little tests which were portrayed as to be ``so \nsmall as to be insignificant,'' at least for the French, just prior to \nasking every other nation to be good scouts and obey what has been \nagreed to in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  I hope the President of the United States will have the courage to do \nwhat he did the first year he was in office and say, ``No more \ntesting.'' He first said no testing for 15 months. When 15 months was \nover, he said no more testing, indefinitely. This is an indefinite ban \non testing by the United States.\n  He no more had the words out of his mouth, and the Defense Department \nsays it is absolutely essential to determine the reliability of our \nweapons, and we must start testing all over again.\n  Now, Mr. President, I will say, I know the makeup of this body. I \nknow the makeup of the House. Unless the President says ``No,'' and is \nprepared to stick with it, we will start testing.\n  That sends a message to every two-bit dictator in the world. We have \nbeen pleading with nations that we know are involved in trying to \ndevelop nuclear weapons, we have been pleading with them ``Don't do \nit.'' Now what kind of a message does it send to those same nations \nwhen we start testing again? The United States and France will be the \ntwo most irresponsible nations on the planet Earth--if we join France \nand start testing again.\n  I do not intend to call the President. He has a lot of things to do. \nHe knows my feelings about it. I have discussed it with him on previous \noccasions. I just think it would be a terrible thing for the United \nStates, a terrible precedent, here 1 year away from the implementation \nof the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, before the Senator yields the floor, \nwould he yield to me for a question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Sir, the distinguished senior Senator from Arkansas \nwill recall that in 1974, the Republic of India detonated a nuclear \ndevice.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I remember it well.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The second-most populated nation in the world, and in \nthe 20 years since, they have never yet detonated a second--not because \nthey are members of the Test Ban Treaty, but because they feel there is \nan international constraint in place and it would be in some way \ninappropriate. Not that they could not or that they would not like to. \nThey have not done it.\n  Would the Senator consider whether or not our now presumed testing, \nand French testing in the Pacific, would not put pressure on regimes \nsuch as that of India, or regimes which are clearly capable of nuclear \ndevices, such as Pakistan?\n  Is that what we want started?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator makes my point better than I made it myself.\n  I must say, the Senator has given me a piece of information, as \nclosely as I try to follow this issue, that I did not realize, and that \nis that India has never tested since their first test.\n  With some respect, we expect this sort of thing from the Chinese. In \nthe world diplomacy, the Chinese have never been quite as concerned as \nto how the nations of the world community might feel about what they \ndo. They test when they are ready. As far as I know, China is the only \nnation that has tested since the President took that bold initiative in \n1993.\n  It does not endear them to me, but they have always danced to their \nown tune, marched to their own drummer.\n  I thought it was irresponsible for them to start testing, but be that \nas it may, our thinking about testing sends a terrible signal to every \nnation on Earth. It seems we are doing our very best to torpedo both \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Non-proliferation \nTreaty.\n  I might also say, incidentally, on the other side of the coin, once \nIndia tested, Pakistan decided it needed nuclear weapons. The Senator \nis all too familiar with the problems we have with Pakistan and India, \nnow. It is never ending. The Pakistanis will never be satisfied until \nthey think they are coequal in the nuclear game with India.\n  Every time somebody joins the field, some other nation that has a \n1,000-year history of animosity with that nation immediately goes to \nwork--Iran and Iraq, and so it goes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8612-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8612-S8613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNITED STATES ROLE REGARDING BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Now, Mr. President, I want to make a point on a \ndifferent subject that has been discussed here several times today \ndealing with Bosnia. I heard the distinguished Senator from Georgia, \nSenator Nunn, a moment ago. I must say I thought the Senator made some \nvery cogent points about what the United States role should be. [[Page S \n8613]] \n  Even though I have steadfastly opposed the introduction of ground \nforces in Bosnia, I think the British and the French are on fairly \nsolid ground when they chastise the United States for trying to tell \nthem how to conduct themselves there. And they remind us periodically, \nthat we have not been facing the same kind of threat they have. They \nare the ones who have had their troops taken hostage. They are the \npeople who have had people killed. We have not.\n  If it is determined that we are going to withdraw the UNPROFOR forces \nfrom Bosnia, then I think the United States has a role to play. I am \nnot sure, and I am not prepared today to define it in any detail, but \ncertainly in my opinion we have a financial role to play.\n  We have been neglecting our dues to the United Nations because there \nis a trend in this country that thinks that somehow or another the \nUnited Nations is subversive.\n  I watched some of that militia hearing the other day. I never heard \nas many cockamamie theories in my life in such a short period of time \nabout what a terrible Government we have. I wanted to ask, why is \neverybody in the world scratching and clawing and swimming the ocean to \ntry to get here, if it is such a terrible place?\n  Back to Bosnia. We have an obligation. We are part of NATO. We are \npart of the United Nations. We have not been nearly as diligent as we \nshould be in our commitment to our dues to the United Nations, or \npaying for the peacekeeping operation.\n  I think the Senator from New York will be much more familiar with \nthis than I am, but as far as I know, the part of our dues we are \nfurthest behind on is in the peacekeeping area. Yet we have championed \nall of these peacekeeping operations.\n  I spent a day at the United Nations a couple of years ago, and at \nthat time I was shocked to find the United Nations has something like--\nI hesitate to say--20, 25 peacekeeping operations going on in the world \nright now.\n  We only know about the Golan Heights, and Bosnia, and some of the \nmore visible areas, but the United Nations has peacekeeping operations \nall over the world, trying to keep people from fighting. A very \nlaudable undertaking.\n  Let me remind those people who always want to denigrate the United \nNations and the whole concept of world cooperation that time and again \non this floor I have applauded President George Bush for going to the \nUnited Nations and getting that body's approval of Desert Storm and for \nrecruiting a lot of the countries in the United Nations to assist in \nthat operation. It was essentially a U.S. effort, but we had tremendous \nhelp from other nations because we were operating as a group of nations \nthat the United Nations had endorsed for this operation.\n  Now, I have about reached the conclusion. About the time I wrote an \nop-ed piece in my own State newspaper, I read an article by Tom \nFriedman in the New York Times. Tom Friedman had been in Lebanon and \nwrote a magnificent book called ``From Beirut to Jerusalem.'' A \nmagnificent book.\n  He pointed it out in this New York Times piece last week, that in \nBosnia, as in Lebanon, we have religion as one of the centrally \ndividing issues--they are not different ethnically.\n  It is my understanding during the Ottoman Empire the Turks said to \nthe Bosnians, ``You may be blond and blue-eyed but you will be \nMoslem.''\n  I can tell the Senator from New York is not agreeing with me on that. \nHe is the historian, so it must not have been the Ottoman Empire. It \nmay have been later.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield for a question? Sharing his \ngreat regard for Tom Friedman's comments in this respect, I think the \nBosnians were of a religious group within the Catholic Church which was \nbeing excommunicated, and they chose to affiliate with Islam in that \nsetting.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I was not quoting Tom Friedman on that point.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It was, in a certain sense, a voluntary conversion.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Perhaps so. But his bottom line was when the Serbs and \nthe Bosnian Moslems tire of fighting each other, they will reach some \nkind of an accord.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. And then the United Nations might be able to help.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. And while I want to support the foreign policy of the \nPresident and the Secretary of State, we may very well have reached the \ntime--the President made a compelling point the other day in support of \nhis position. Everybody says our policy in Bosnia now is an unmitigated \ndisaster.\n  The President responds by saying, in 1993, I guess it was, 92,000 \npeople were killed in Bosnia. In 1994, 3,000 were killed. So it is \ndifficult to say the policy is an unmitigated disaster when that many \nlives are being saved.\n  But there is not any question, the six Bosnian Moslem enclaves, are \nthreatened. They are going to starve. Something is going to happen. \nSome of them have not been resupplied in months, and something is going \nto have to give.\n  I am almost of the opinion that perhaps we should withdraw. While we \nmight not be, as a nation, actively involved in arming Bosnian Moslems, \nother nations are perfectly willing to do that if we can figure out a \nway to get the weapons to them. That does not mean that war is going to \nreach a stalemate. It does not mean the Bosnian Moslems are going to be \nwinners ultimately. But at least it would help equalize the sides. The \nthing is totally unfair now to them.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Bosnia is a member of the United Nations. It has been \ninvaded by another country and in support of an internal dispute. The \nYugoslavian Army, out of Belgrade, is clearly involved. We now learn \nthat it was computers in Belgrade that brought down Captain O'Grady's \nF-16. Under the United Nations Charter it is elemental that Bosnia has \nthe right of self-defense. And for the United Nations to impose an arms \nembargo on a member state which has been invaded is to put the charter \nin jeopardy. Would the Senator not agree?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Absolutely. The Senator makes a very, very compelling \npoint that I should have started off with.\n  So, to allow a member nation to be systematically choked to death \nwhile other U.N. members, as well as NATO, essentially look on and \nallow it to happen is totally unacceptable. Either we get involved or \nwe get out. I doubt very seriously the people of this country would \nstand very long for our entry into the war. I saw a poll last week that \nsaid 61 percent of the people in this country are now saying they would \nnot oppose the introduction of American ground troops in Bosnia. I do \nnot happen to be a member of that 61 percent, because I realize what a \nsticky wicket this can be. But I was shocked by that number.\n  Mr. President, I found the Senate in a quorum call and I thought I \nwould just make these few comments regarding those two issues.\n  I thank the Senator for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8612-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM DESIGNATION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and \nissue coins in commemoration of the 125th anniversary of Yellowstone \nNational Park; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n THE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK 125TH ANNIVERSARY COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk and ask that it \nbe referred appropriately.\n  I am pleased to say that Senators Simpson, Craig, and Campbell are \njoining me to sponsor the Yellowstone National Park 125th Anniversary \nCommemorative Coin Act.\n  Yellowstone National Park, of course, is largely in my State of \nWyoming. It is, I think, the crown jewel of the National Park System. \nIt is the first national park having had its 100th anniversary sometime \nback. It consists of about 3,400 square miles, the largest national \npark. We believe that we are joined by most to think it is the crown \njewel of the Park System.\n  We have had--and we continue to have, Mr. President--substantial \nfinancial strain on our national parks, some of it due to the expansion \nof the authorization of parks far beyond our ability to pay for them. \nWe have this expansion continuing to go on with a debt of about $4 \nbillion in authorized expenditures which have not been able to have \nbeen appropriated.\n  There is increased wear and tear on 500 miles of roads in Yellowstone \nPark, 1,000 miles of trails, and countless public facilities. And, \nfrankly, there is a need for $600 to $700 million to do the kind of \nmaintenance that is necessary over a period of time. That will be very \ndifficult to extract from the budget.\n  The bill that we offer is one that would authorize and provide for \nthe minting and issue of 500,000 $1 silver coins for Yellowstone's \n125th anniversary in 1997. For the taxpayers, this is a budget-neutral \nproposition. It does not cost the taxpayers anything.\n  The surcharges from the sale of the coins will be split evenly, 50 \npercent going directly to Yellowstone Park and 50 percent to the Park \nService for distribution among other parks.\n  The sale of the coins could potentially raise $2.5 million for \nYellowstone's needs.\n  Mr. President, chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in this \ncommonsense approach to provide the needed resources for Yellowstone \nPark and properly honor our oldest national park.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8614-9", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8614-S8615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 160\n\n  At the request of Mr. Shelby, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Thomas] was added as a cosponsor [[Page S 8615]] of S. 160, a bill \nto impose a moratorium on immigration by aliens other than refugees, \ncertain priority and skilled workers, and immediate relatives of United \nStates citizens and permanent resident aliens.\n\n\n                                 S. 256\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from Mississippi \n[Mr. Lott] was added as a cosponsor of S. 256, a bill to amend title \n10, United States Code, to establish procedures for determining the \nstatus of certain missing members of the Armed Forces and certain \ncivilians, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 426\n\n  At the request of Mr. Sarbanes, the names of the Senator from Iowa \n[Mr. Harkin] and the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 426, a bill to authorize the Alpha Phi Alpha \nFraternity to establish a memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr., in the \nDistrict of Columbia, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 457\n\n  At the request of Mr. Simon, the names of the Senator from Utah [Mr. \nHatch] and the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 457, a bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality \nAct to update references in the classification of children for purposes \nof United States immigration laws.\n\n\n                                 S. 526\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gregg, the name of the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Smith] was added as a cosponsor of S. 526, a bill to \namend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to make \nmodifications to certain provisions, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 641\n\n  At the request of Mr. Specter, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nS. 641, a bill to reauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act of 1990, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 758\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Missouri \n[Mr. Ashcroft] was added as a cosponsor of S. 758, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for S corporation reform, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 877\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Hutchison, the name of the Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Thomas] was added as a cosponsor of S. 877, a bill to \namend section 353 of the Public Health Service Act to exempt physician \noffice laboratories from the clinical laboratories requirements of that \nsection.\n\n\n                                 S. 925\n\n  At the request of Mr. Mack, the name of the Senator from New York \n[Mr. D'Amato] was added as a cosponsor of S. 925, a bill to impose \ncongressional notification and reporting requirements on any \nnegotiations or other discussions between the United States and Cuba \nwith respect to normalization of relations.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8614-10", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 136--AUTHORIZING REPRESENTATION BY LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. DOLE (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, on June 14, 1995, I filed, on \nbehalf of myself and my distinguished colleague and vice chairman of \nthe Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator Kerrey, a bill which \nauthorizes appropriations for fiscal year 1996 for the intelligence \nactivities and programs of the U.S. Government. The Select Committee on \nIntelligence approved the bill by a unanimous vote on May 24, 1995, and \nordered that it be favorably reported.\n  This bill would:\n  First, authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1996 for (a) the \nintelligence activities and programs of the U.S. Government; (b) the \nCentral Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System; and (c) \nthe Community Management Account of the Director of Central \nIntelligence;\n  Second, authorize the personnel ceilings as of September 30, 1996, \nfor the intelligence activities of the United States and for the \nCommunity Management Account of the Director of Central Intelligence;\n  Third, authorize the Director of Central Intelligence, with Office of \nManagement and Budget approval, to exceed the personnel ceilings by up \nto 2 percent;\n  Fourth, permit the President to delay the imposition of sanctions \nrelated to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction when necessary \nto protect an intelligence source or method or an ongoing criminal \ninvestigation;\n  Fifth, provide for forfeiture of the U.S. Government contribution to \nthe Thrift Savings Plan under the Federal Employees Retirement System \n[FERS], along with interest, if an employee is convicted of national \nsecurity offenses;\n  Sixth, restore spousal benefits to the spouse of an employee so \nconvicted if the spouse cooperates in the investigation and \nprosecution;\n  Seventh, to allow employees of the excepted services to take an \nactive part in certain local elections;\n  Eighth, amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to permit the Federal \nBureau of Investigation to obtain consumer credit reports necessary to \nforeign counterintelligence investigations under certain circumstances \nand subject to appropriate controls on the use of such reports; and\n  Ninth, make certain other changes of technical nature to existing law \ngoverning intelligence agencies.\n  The classified nature of U.S. intelligence activities prevents the \ncommittee from disclosing the details of its budgetary recommendations. \nHowever, the committee has prepared a classified supplement to the \nreport, which contains: First, the classified annex to the report; \nsecond, and the classified schedule of authorizations which is \nincorporated by reference in the act and has the same legal status as a \npublic law. The classified annex to the report explains the full scope \nand intent of the committee's actions as set forth in the classified \nschedule of authorizations.\n  This classified supplement to the committee report is available for \nreview by any Member of the Senate, subject to the provisions of Senate \nResolution 400 of the 94th Congress.\n  The classified supplement is also made available to affected \ndepartments and agencies within the intelligence community.\n\n\n                       scope of committee review\n\n  As it does annually, the committee conducted a detailed review of the \nadministration's budget request for the National Foreign Intelligence \nProgram [NFIP] for fiscal year 1996. The committee also reviewed the \nadministration's fiscal year 1996 request for a new intelligence budget \ncategory, called the Joint Military Intelligence Program [JMIP]. The \ncommittee's review included a series of briefings and hearings with the \nDirector of Central Intelligence [DCI], the Acting Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security, and other senior \nofficials from the intelligence community, numerous staff briefings, \nreview of budget justification materials, and numerous written \nresponses provided by the intelligence community to specific questions \nposed by the committee.\n  In addition to its annual review of the administration's budget \nrequest, the committee performs continuing oversight of various \nintelligence activities and programs, to include the conduct of audits \nand reviews by the committee's audit staff. These inquiries frequently \nlead to actions initiated by the committee with respect to the budget \nof the activity or program concerned.\n  The committee also reviewed the administration's fiscal year 1996 \nbudget requests for the Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities \n[TIARA] Program aggregation of the Department of Defense. The \ncommittee's recommendations regarding these programs are provided \nseparately to the Committee on Armed Services for consideration within \nthe context of that committee's annual review of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n\n\n                  followup to the ames espionage case\n\n  In the wake of last year's controversy surrounding the Ames espionage\n   case, the intelligence community leadership pledged renewed \ndedication to the counterintelligence mission. In the testimony he gave \nbefore the committee at his confirmation hearing in open session, DCI \nDeutch stated that counterintelligence was one of the four principal \npurposes toward which the intelligence community should direct its \nefforts.\n\n  The committee and CIA Inspector General reports on the Ames espionage \ncase published last year identified several serious shortcomings on the \npart of the Central Intelligence Agency. The committee held a closed \nhearing with intelligence community officials on January 25, 1995, to \nreview progress made to date in implementing counterintelligence \nreforms recommended by the aforementioned reports by DCI Woolsey. The \ncommittee also focused on the adequacy of counterintelligence programs \nand activities in the context of its review and markup of the \nadministration's fiscal year 1996 budget request and provides several \nrecommendations to enhance U.S. capabilities in this critical area in \nthe classified annex accompanying the report.\n  Another issue raised by the Ames case is the apparent failure of the \nintelligence community to weed out poor performers. That Aldrich Ames \nwas not only retained but promoted despite clear problems with alcohol \nand marginal performance is testament to a personnel process in need of \nreform. The committee has included in this bill a provision requiring \nthe DCI to develop for all civilian employees in the intelligence \ncommunity personnel procedures to provide for mandatory retirement for \nexpiration of time in class and termination based on relative \nperformance, comparable to sections 607 and 608, respectively, of the \nForeign Service Act of 1980.\n\n\n                      focus on high-priority areas\n\n  Notwithstanding the rhetorical priority placed on critical \nintelligence topics such as proliferation, terrorism, and \ncounternarcotics, the committee has identified areas where insufficient \nfunds have been programmed for new capabilities, or where activities \nare funded in the name of high-priority targets which make little or no \ncontribution to the issue. Therefore, in the classified annex \naccompanying the report, the committee recommends a number of \ninitiatives to enhance U.S. capabilities in the areas of proliferation, \nterrorism, and counternarcotics.\n\n\n           creation of a joint military intelligence program\n\n  As noted above, this year the administration submitted a modification \nof the existing budgeting structure for intelligence activities and \nprograms, by adding a third budget category--the Joint Military \nIntelligence Program--to supplement the existing NFIP and TIARA. The \nadministration acted to resubordinate formerly national and tactical \nprograms under JMIP and created a new management structure to oversee \nJMIP that includes senior officials of the intelligence community and \nDefense. The JMIP Program executive is the Deputy Secretary of Defense, \nwho also chairs the new Defense Intelligence Executive Board [DIEB]--a \nsenior management body providing planning, programming, and budget \noversight of defense intelligence. JMIP was initially established by \nSecretary of Defense memorandum dated May 14, 1994, which was \nsuperseded by Department of Defense directive 5205.0, dated [[Page S \n8617]] April 7, 1995. The administration is submitting the first JMIP \nbudget request to the Congress in fiscal year 1996.\n  The committee does not yet endorse the decision by the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence [DCI] to \ndevelop a new set of funding criteria for intelligence activities. The \ncommittee understands the Defense Department's requirement to exercise \nmore top-down oversight and control of defense intelligence programs \nand to create a management forum for evaluating these activities. \nAdditionally, advances in technology have made the former definitions \nof national and tactical less meaningful to the budget process. \nHowever, the committee has reservations about whether the \nadministration proposal for three intelligence programs is the optimal \nsolution. Further, the committee is not convinced that the presence of \nthe Director of Central Intelligence on the DIEB, or the joint review \nprocess undertaken by the DCI and Deputy Secretary of Defense, will \nensure that both intelligence community and Defense Department equities \nare served in the planning, programming, and management of all \nintelligence activities and programs. The committee plans to review the \nappropriate budgeting structure for intelligence as part of its review \nof the roles and missions of the intelligence community later this \nyear.\n  In addition, the committee is concerned that the fiscal year 1996 \nbudget request includes many programs that are budgeted in one \nintelligence program but more appropriately belong in another \nintelligence program according to the definitions set forth by the \nDeputy Secretary of Defense and the DCI. A partial listing of such \nprograms is provided by the committee for illustrative purposes:\n  Programs belonging in NFIP because they serve multiple departments:\n  Cobra Dane, which this fiscal year is programmed in the \nadministration's budget request for the Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency. The committee recommends returning funding responsibility for \nthis important arms control monitoring capability to the NFIP;\n  Air Force's Cobra Judy, a specialized shipborne reconnaissance \nprogram, funded in TIARA;\n  Navy's P-3C Reef Point, a specialized airborne reconnaissance \nprogram, funded in TIARA.\n  Programs belonging in JMIP because they serve multiple DOD \ncomponents:\n  Army's Guardrail and airborne reconnaissance low programs, funded in \nTIARA;\n  Air Force's E-8C joint surveillance tracking and reconnaissance \nsystem, funded in TIARA;\n  Air Force's space-based infrared system, funded in TIARA.\n  Programs belonging in TIARA because they serve single military \ndepartments:\n  Army's European command combat intelligence readiness facility, \nfunded in the NFIP;\n  Navy's fleet ocean surveillance information facility in the European \ntheater, funded in the NFIP.\n  With the exception of Cobra Dane, the committee makes no \nrecommendations this fiscal year to transfer any of these programs, \nprimarily to avoid confusion and the potential for an unintended \nappropriated-not authorized situation. Further, the committee does not \nnecessarily agree that last year's decision by the administration to \nconsolidate funding for spaceborne and airborne reconnaissance \nacquisition in the NFIP and JMIP respectively--regardless of the \nintended customer base--makes sense in light of the new definitions for \nprogramming and budgeting intelligence activities and programs.\n  The committee believes that the DCI and Deputy Secretary of Defense \nshould review jointly the budget categories of these and other programs \nprior to the submission of the fiscal year 1997 budget request and make \nthe appropriate adjustments. Further, the DCI and Deputy Secretary of \nDefense should consider whether split funding arrangements; that is, \nfunding provided by more than one intelligence budget category, are \nrequired for those organizations charged with acquisition of \nintelligence platforms; that is, the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance \nOffice and the National Reconnaissance Office, on the grounds of \nimproved management efficiency without regard to the consumer base as \ndefined by Executive Order 12333 and Department of Defense Directive \n5205.0. The committee requests that a report assessing these issues and \noutlining any specific programmatic adjustments made in the President's \nfiscal year 1997 budget request to more accurately reflect the intent \nof the new budgeting system be provided to the Intelligence and Defense \nCommittees by March 1, 1996.\n\n\n                   committee recommendations on jmip\n\n  Unlike the activities of the National Foreign Intelligence Program \nwhich the committee also authorizes, many activities funded by the new \nJoint Military Intelligence Program are unclassified. However, the \namount of the total fiscal year 1996 budget request for JMIP, like that \nfor the NEIP, is classified, as is any comprehensive treatment of JMIP \nelements. Given these facts, and in order to provide for the greatest \ndegree of openness possible, the committee provides in the following \nsections its unclassified recommendations on JMIP elements. Further \nrecommendations, as well as classified details on these unclassified \nrecommendations, are provided in the classified annex accompanying this \nbill.\n\n\n                   airborne reconnaissance priorities\n\n  The committee believes that it is vital to maintain a robust airborne \nreconnaissance force that is capable of collection satisfying priority \nintelligence requirements in peacetime, crisis, and war. The committee \nalso understands that, in a zero sum gain budget environment, choices \nneed to be made between upgrades to current manned system and the \ndevelopment of new unmanned platforms. Due to the increasing demands \nand requirements placed on our Nation's current generation of manned \nreconnaissance systems, the committee makes the following \nrecommendations to redirect resources requested for unmanned aerial \nvehicle development activities to several manned reconnaissance \nupgrades which the committee views as essential in order to provide \nmission-capable forces to the warfighting commanders-in-chief [CINC's].\n  Accordingly, the committee recommends changes to the administration's \nfiscal year 1996 budget request to terminate one of five unmanned \naerial vehicle [UAV] programs currently under development by the \nDefense Airborne Reconnaissance Program [DARP] and, instead, to \nreallocate these resources to provide for the upgrade of existing \nmanned reconnaissance platforms.\n\n\n                Conventional High Altitude Endurance UAV\n\n  The committee recommends termination of the conventional high \naltitude endurance unmanned aerial vehicle [CONV HAE UAV] development \neffort, a reduction to the DARP in fiscal year 1996 of $117 million. \nThe committee believes that the CONV HAE UAV will not provide an \nincreased capability over\n the current U-2 airborne reconnaissance fleet and is therefore not \nrequired. The U-2 is an operational system currently supporting \nwarfighting and national intelligence requirements. The CONV HAE UAV is \nan advanced concept technology demonstration [ACTD] project and has not \nachieved first flight.\n\n  In fact, the U-2 is a much more capable multisensor reconnaissance \naircraft today than the CONV HAE UAV is designed to be. The U-2 fleet \nprovides radar, electro-optical, and film imagery as well as electronic \nintelligence collection support to national, theater, and tactical \ncommanders. The CONV HAE UAV will have only imagery sensors, and these \nwill be less capable than those on-board the U-2. The U-2 has a much \ngreater payload capacity than the CONV HAE UAV design. The U-2 affords \na deeper look capability than planned for the CONV HAE UAV. Further, \nthe committee understands that the CONV HAE UAV operational concept, \nnow under development, is virtually identical to that of the U-2.\n  Cost comparisons are difficult to make because the U-2 is an existing \nasset flying missions on a daily basis and the CONV HAE UAV is an ACTD \nand has no flight experience. However, information provided to the \ncommittee by the DARP indicates that the flying hour costs of the UAV \nare comparable to the U-2.\n  The committee believes that development by the DARP of the low \nobservable high altitude endurance unmanned [[Page S 8618]] aerial \nvehicle [LO HAE UAV] as a complementary system to the U-2 will provide \nthe most capability to national policymakers and the warfighter. The \ncommittee strongly suggests that the Department investigate increases \nin capability that can be achieved in the LO HAE UAV if the goal for \nunit fly-away cost is increased from $10 to $20 million. The committee \nrequests that the DARO prepare an analysis on this alternative and \nprovide it to the intelligence and defense committees by March 1, 1996.\n\n\n                 RC-135V/W Rivet Joint Engine Upgrades\n\n  Rivet Joint is an Air Force reconnaissance program which provides all \nweather, worldwide signals intelligence collection support to theater \ncommanders. The committee has become concerned with the high OPTEMPO of \nthe RC-135V/W Rivet Joint reconnaissance fleet. The RC-135 airframes \ncurrently are logging an extraordinary number of annual flight hours. \nAdditionally, the schedule frequency and the extended mission times of \nthe Rivet Joint program contribute significantly to the fuel and \noperating costs of the aircraft. Further, the current engines do not \nmeet State III noise levels or EPA emission standards.\n  The committee is aware that the Air Force is considering the \nestablishment of a reengining program for the RC-135 aircraft. \nReengining with the CFM-56 engines common to the tanker fleet and \ncommercial airlines would increase RC-135 nominal operating altitudes \nconsiderably, thereby greatly enhancing sensor field-of-view and area \ncoverage, decreasing fuel consumption, increasing on-station time, and \nimproving short-field capability for contingency operations. Current \ntanker support requirements and tanker flying could also be reduced \nsignificantly.\n  Therefore, the committee recommends an authorization of $79.5 million \nin fiscal year 1996 to begin reengining the RC-135 fleet. The committee \nexpects the DARP to budget the additional funds required to continue \nreengining in fiscal year 1997 and beyond.\n\n\n                              u-2 upgrades\n\n  While the committee is supportive of the DARP initiative to define a \njoint airborne SIGINT architecture [JASA], there is concern about the \naffordability of this approach for the military departments. The \ncommittee is also concerned with the Defense Department's apparent \ndecision not to continue upgrading current platforms while focusing \nfunding exclusively on a new development program. Therefore, the \ncommittee recommends an authorization of $20 million in fiscal year \n1996 for the DARP to initiate a sensor upgrade program for the U-2 \nfleet. Further details about the proposed upgrade are contained in the \nclassified annex accompanying this bill. The committee expects the DARP \nto budget for the remaining funds required to complete this upgrade in \nfiscal year 1997 and beyond. The committee also believes that this \nupgrade should be fully compliant with JASA standards.\n  The committee also makes a recommendation to improve the defensive \ncapabilities of the U-2 fleet and provides $13 million in fiscal year \n1996 for this purpose. Details of this initiative are included in the \nclassified annex accompanying this bill. As with the proposed sensor \nupgrade, the committee expects the DARP to budget for the remaining \nfunds required to complete this upgrade in fiscal year 1997 and beyond.\n\n\n         defense intelligence counter drug analysis initiatives\n\n  In line with the committee's efforts to enhance intelligence \ncapabilities in the area of counternarcotics and other high-priority \nissues, the committee recommends an authorization of an additional $7 \nmillion in fiscal year 1996 to the Defense Intelligence Counterdrug \nProgram [DICP]. These funds should be\n applied against a variety of high-priority, counterdrug analysis, and \nconnectivity programs identified by the DICP program manager. Details \nof this initiative are included in the classified annex accompanying \nthis bill.\n\n\n                      information systems security\n\n  While the administration's fiscal year 1996 budget request for DOD's \nInformation Systems Security Program provides for a significant \nincrease over the amounts requested in fiscal year 1995, the committee \nnotes that information security [INFOSEC] personnel and resources will \nstill have declined by roughly 40 percent since 1987. Meanwhile, in \nplanning for future conflicts, the Department of Defense is \ndeliberately placing increased reliance on information systems to \ncompensate for a reduced force structure.\n  The committee does not believe that the Department of Defense has \nadequately assessed U.S. information security requirements. Further, it \ndoes not believe that there is a coherent plan or program to rectify \nthe vulnerabilities identified by the Joint Security Commission, the \nCommission on Roles and Missions, and independent organizations such as \nthe Rand Corp. An effective and comprehensive U.S. policy needs to be \ndeveloped in order to prepare an integrated response that recognizes \nnot only the vulnerabilities of U.S. Government communications, but the \nvulnerabilities of the underlying public switch network [PSN]. In that \nregard, it is not clear what benefits can be achieved through increased \nDOD spending on information security when over 95 percent of DOD \ncommunications travel over PSN and the PSN is not protected against \nattacks that sophisticated adversaries may employ in future conflicts. \nIn sum, a comprehensive U.S. INFOSEC plan urgently needs to be \ndeveloped.\n  The committee therefore, in its report, requests the DCI and the \nSecretary of Defense to prepare a comprehensive report which: (a) \nidentifies the key threats to U.S. computers and communications \nsystems, including those of both the Government and the private sector; \nthat is, the public switch network upon which the Government heavily \ndepends; and, (b) provides a comprehensive plan for addressing the \nthreats described in section (a), to include any necessary legislative \nor programmatic recommendations required to protect Government or \nprivate U.S. information systems. The report is to be provided to the \nIntelligence and Defense Committees not later than March 1, 1996. In \nthe absence of such a plan, the committee remains skeptical regarding \nthe benefits that can be achieved through increased funding for the \nDepartment of Defense Information Systems Security Program.\n\n\n                  commercial off-the-shelf technology\n\n  It is the sense of the committee that, to the extent practicable, all \nhigh performance computing and communications [HPCC] equipment and \nproducts purchased with funds authorized in this act should be \ncommercial-off-the-shelf [COTS] or modified COTS.\n  The Department of Defense has already adopted a COTS policy in its \npurchase of high performance computing and communications systems, with \nsignificant cost savings to the taxpayers and with excellent \nperformance results. Moreover, the Department's September 1994 defense \ntechnology plan, prepared by the Director of Defense Research and \nEngineering, recommends the utilization of more commercially viable \ntechnologies in the purchase of high performance computer systems. \n(Computing and Software, Defense Technology Plan.)\n  The committee also believes that the application of a COTS technology \npolicy among the intelligence agencies should be adopted and \nimplemented beginning in fiscal year 1996. The committee is hopeful \nthat a COTS policy for the procurement of high performance computing \nand communications equipment could save millions of dollars and \nmaintain the quality and performance standards required by the \nintelligence agencies both now and in the future.\n  Therefore, the committee included in the report a request that the \nagencies receiving funding authorized in this bill begin the process of \nadopting COTS technology procurement procedures in their high \nperformance computing and communications programs and report, through \nthe DCI, to the Intelligence and Defense Committees not later than May \n1, 1996, regarding compliance with this request.\n\n\ntechnologies to improve sound processing devices used by the profoundly \n                                  deaf\n\n  Recent technological advances have made it possible for the medical \ncommunity to provide substantial hearing to profoundly deaf individuals \nwho cannot benefit from conventional hearing aids. Surgically implanted \nelectrodes, combined with external speech processing devices, have the \ndemonstrated ability to provide sound information across the frequency \nrange even at low [[Page S 8619]] volume; that is, 30 decibels. Some \nchildren and adults, who would have had no option other than to use \nsign language, now have access to spoken language and can function in \nschool and the workplace without any use of sign language. While the \nbenefits can be enormous, it is also true that the quality of sound \nprovided by cochlear implants is still crude compared to normal \nhearing. Remarkable progress has been made, but many technical issues \nremain, including the reliability, size, and the effectiveness of the \nhardware and software used by manufacturers of sound processing \ndevices.\n  The intelligence community, and the National Security Agency in \nparticular, is a world leader in speech and signal processing. It is \nquite possible that some of the sophisticated technologies employed by \nthe intelligence community could increase the signal-to-noise ratio in \nthe sound processing devices used by the profoundly deaf. The committee \nhas recently seen how imaging technology developed by the intelligence \ncommunity can be adapted to cancer screening by the medical community, \nand it is the committee's hope that similar success can be achieved in \nthis area. In the report accompanying this bill, therefore, the \ncommittee requests the intelligence community to contact U.S. \nmanufacturers of cochlear implant devices, review their technical \nneeds, and identify any technologies that might be shared with such \nmanufacturers in order to improve the quality of hearing for the \nhearing impaired. The committee also requests a report outlining the \nresults of the intelligence community's review, to include \nidentification of any capabilities that should be shared with U.S. \nmanufacturers of cochlear implants, not later than May 1, 1996.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The text of the bill follows:\n                                 S. 922\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this \n     Act may be cited as the ``Intelligence Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 1996''.\n                    TITLE I--INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, on June 5, 1995, the Bergen \nRecord, the flagship of one of New Jersey's most successful family-\nowned businesses, turned 100 years old.\n   Since John Borg bought the paper in 1930, it has flourished to \nbecome New Jersey's third largest daily newspaper with a daily \ncirculation of 172,000 and a Sunday circulation of 246,000. New \nJersey's readers have been well served by an editorial policy that \nencourages thoughtful, objective reporting on issues of importance to \nour State's most populous county. [[Page S 8622]] \n   The Bergen Record is the cornerstone upon which the Borg family \nbuilt its burgeoning media business, Macromedia Inc., which includes \nthe Bergen Record Corp., the News Tribune, Magna Media Advertising, \nInc., and Gateway Communications.\n   But what is special about this company is that, through all of this \ngrowth, the Borg family has continued the tradition started by John \nBorg of fostering an employee-oriented business. The chairman of the \nboard, Malcolm Borg, is known by his first name and all 1,200 employees \nknow that he has an open-door policy.\n   This attitude extends outward to the community with programs such as \nthe in-house tutoring program for Hackensack Middle School Students and \nthe scholarship program for the children of Record employees. In \naddition, advertising space is regularly donated to benefit and promote \nsuch worthy causes as Food Action of New Jersey and Help the Heartland. \nEmployees are encouraged to volunteer their time for worthy causes.\n   A commissioner on the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, Malcolm \nBorg has taken a lead role in moving to protect Sterling Forest, the \nlargest contiguous forest in New York. The aquifers in this forest \nsupply one quarter of New Jersey's population with drinking water. Mac \nBorg's commitment to this project is instrumental in our fight to \nprotect this land from a planned development which includes 14,000 \nhomes and light industrial and commercial space.\n   Mr. President, I would like to recognize the enormous contributions \nto Bergen County and New Jersey made by the Borg family, the Bergen \nRecord and the employees of the paper. They have served their community \nwell and I congratulate them.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8621-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8622-S8624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     ON THE VALUE OF PUBLIC SERVICE\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to \nshare with my colleagues the thoughtful comments of National Labor \nRelations Board Chairman, William B. Gould IV, to graduates of the Ohio \nState University College of Law. In his remarks, Mr. Gould reminds us \nof the satisfaction one obtains through service to one's community and \nof the many opportunities available for us to do so. His inspiring \ncomments make clear the value and importance of this commitment to \nassisting those around us.\n  A remark by philosopher Albert Schweitzer has never failed to kindle \nmy enthusiasm for work in the field of public service. Mr. Schweitzer \nonce told an audience:\n\n       I do not know what your destiny will be, but one thing I \n     know: the only ones among you who will be truly happy are \n     those who will have sought and found how to serve.\n\n  I thank my colleagues for this opportunity to make Mr. Gould's \nremarks a part of the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n[From the National Labor Relations Board, Washington, DC, May 14, 1995]\n\n NLRB Chairman Gould Urges Law School Grads To Consider Public Service \n                                Careers\n\n       In a commencement address on May 14 at the Ohio State \n     University College of Law, National Labor Relations Board \n     Chairman William B. Gould IV encouraged the graduates to \n     consider careers in public service ``even in this period of \n     government bashing by the 104th Congress'' and as the legal \n     profession is under attack.\n       ``My hope is that many of you will dedicate yourselves as \n     lawyers or in other careers to a concern for the public \n     good,'' Chairman Gould said in the graduation observance in \n     Columbus, Ohio. ``Now, when Oklahoma City has made it clear \n     that the idea of government itself as well as the law is \n     under attack, it is useful to reflect back upon what \n     government, frequently in conjunction with lawyers, has done \n     for us in this century alone in moving toward a more \n     civilized society.'' He stated:.\n       ``What would our society look like without the trust \n     busters of Theodore Roosevelt's era and the Federal Reserve \n     System created by Woodrow Wilson? Regulatory approaches to \n     food and drug administration, the securities market, the \n     licensing of radio and television stations, labor-management \n     relations (with which my agency is concerned) and trade \n     practices are all part of the Roosevelt New Deal legacy which \n     few would disavow in toto.''\n       Mr. Gould said ``the challenge of public service in \n     Washington has never been more exciting or inspirational,'' \n     as a result of ``the Clinton Administration's commitment--not \n     only to helping the less financially able to use available \n     educational opportunities and to provide a higher minimum \n     wage to those who are in economic distress--but also, most \n     particularly, through the National Service,'' He added:\n       ``My sense is that there is a great opportunity for lawyers \n     to serve the public good through the public service today--\n     even in this period of government bashing by the 104th \n     Congress. More than three decades ago President John F. \n     Kennedy called upon the sense of a `greater purpose' in a \n     speech at the University of Michigan when he advocated the \n     creation of the Peace Corps during the 1960 campaign. \n     President Bill Clinton's National and Community Service Trust \n     Act (AmeriCorps.), designed to allow young people tuition \n     reimbursements for community service, echoes the same spirit \n     of commitment set forth by President Kennedy--and at an \n     earlier point by President Roosevelt through the Civilian \n     Conservation Corps.''\n       Tracing his own interest in the law and government service, \n     Mr. Gould said he was inspired by the Supreme Court's \n     landmark 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, the \n     NAACP's anti-discrimination efforts in the South, and \n     ``[m]ore than anything else . . . the struggle in South \n     Africa made me see the connection between the rule of law and \n     dealing with injustice.'' He also spoke of the ``trilogy of \n     values'' at his ``inner core'' that has guided his life and \n     fostered his philosophical allegience to the New Deal, the \n     New Frontier and the Great Society.\n       The first of these values is the idea from his upbringing \n     in the Episcopal Church of ``our duty to live by the \n     Comfortable Words and to help those who `travail and are \n     heavy laden.' The second was the belief, inspired by his \n     parents, that ``the average person needs some measure of \n     protection against both the powerful and unexpected \n     adversity.'' The third value, Mr. Gould continued, was \n     ``based upon personal exposure to the indignity of racial \n     discrimination which consigned my parents' generation to a \n     most fundamental denial of equal opportunity.''\n       The NLRB Chairman, on leave as the Charles A. Beardsley \n     Professor of Law at Stanford Law School, said he was proud of \n     the agency's prominent role in the Major League Baseball \n     dispute where ``the public was able to obtain a brief glimpse \n     of the Board's day-to-day commitment to the rule of law in \n     the workplace.'' On March 26, the Board voted to seek \n     injunctive relief under Section 10(j) of the Act requiring \n     the owners to reinstate salary arbitration and free agency \n     while the parties bargain a new contract. He said further:\n       ``What may have been overlooked in the public view was the \n     fact that the Board was able to proceed through a fast track \n     approach and make the promise of spontaneous and free \n     collection bargaining in the workplace a reality. I hope that \n     the players and owners will now do their part and bargain a \n     new agreement forthwith!''\n       ``I am particularly proud to head an agency which is \n     celebrating its 60th anniversary this summer and which, from \n     the very beginning of its origins in the Great Depression of \n     the 1930s, has contributed to the public good through \n     adherence to a statute which encourages the practice and \n     procedures of collective bargaining. . . .''\n                                                                    ____\n\n   Serving the Public Interest Through the Rule of Law: A Trilogy of \n                                 Values\n\n                 (By William B. Gould IV, May 14, 1995)\n\n       Ladies and gentlemen. Members of the faculty. Honored \n     guess. I am indeed honored to be with you here today in \n     Columbus and to have the opportunity to address the graduates \n     of this distinguished College of Law School as well as their \n     parents, relatives, and friends on this most significant rite \n     of passage. Looking backward 34 years to June 1961, my own \n     law school graduation day was certainly one of the most \n     important and memorable in my life. It was the beginning of a \n     long involvement in labor and employment law as well as civil \n     rights and international human rights.\n       But I confess that today I am hardly able to recall any of \n     the wise words of advice that the graduation speaker imparted \n     to us that shining day at Cornell Law School in Ithaca, New \n     York. So, as I address you today I don't have any illusions \n     that what I say is likely to change the course of your lives. \n     But my hope is that my story will provide some context \n     relevant to the professional pathways upon which you are \n     about to embark.\n       Both governmental service and the furtherance of the rule \n     of law by the legal profession have possessed a centrality \n     and thus constituted abiding themes in my professional life. \n     I hope that my remarks to you here today will induce some of \n     you to consider government as an option at some point in your \n     careers, notwithstanding the anti-government tenor of these \n     times.\n       The tragedy of Oklahoma City has dramatized the \n     contemporary vulnerability of these values to sustained \n     attack, both verbal and violent. As the New York Times said \n     last month, we must ``confront the reality that over the past \n     few years the language of politics has become infected with \n     violent words and a mindset of animosity toward the \n     institutions of government.'' The columnist Mark Shields has \n     noted that this phenomenon has been fueled by the idea that \n     the ``red scare'' should give way to the ``fed scare.''\n       My own view is that government does best when it intervenes \n     to help those in genuine need of assistance--but I am aware \n     that this point does not enjoy much popularity in Congress \n     these days. Again Shields, in discussing recent comments of \n     Senator Robert [[Page S 8623]] Kerry of Nebraska, put it well \n     when he characterized the conservative view of the nation's \n     problem: ``The problem with the Poor is that they have too \n     much money; the problem with the Rich is that they have too \n     little.''\n       Although I cannot recall the Great Depression and its \n     desperate circumstances, a trilogy of values have always made \n     up my inner core. The first of these is the idea that I heard \n     in Long Branch, New Jersey's St. James' Episcopal Church \n     every Sunday, i.e., that it is our duty to live by the \n     Comfortable Words and to help those who ``travail and are \n     heavy laden.'' Fused together with this was a belief, \n     inculcated by my parents, that the average person needs some \n     measure of protection against both the powerful and \n     unexpected adversity. The third was based upon personal \n     exposure to the indignity of racial discrimination which \n     consigned my parents' generation to a most fundamental denial \n     of equal opportunity. It is this trilogy of values which \n     fostered my philosophical allegiance to the New Deal, the New \n     Frontier and the Great Society.\n       Simply put, I came to the law and Cornell Law School \n     because of my view that law any lawyers can reduce arbitrary \n     inequities and the fact that Chief Justice Earl Warren's May \n     17, 1954, opinion for a unanimous Supreme Court in Brown v. \n     Board of Education represented an accurate illustration of \n     that point. As you know, the holding was that separate but \n     equal was unconstitutional in public education.\n       A unanimous Court rendered that historic decision--in some \n     sense a corollary to President Harry Truman's desegregation \n     of the Armed Forces--which possessed sweeping implications \n     for all aspects of American society. The High Court's ruling \n     prompted a new focus upon fair treatment in general and \n     discrimination based upon such arbitrary considerations as \n     sex age, religion, sexual orientation and disabilities in \n     particular.\n       As a high school senior reading of NAACP Counsel Thurgood \n     Marshall's courageous efforts throughout the South--and one \n     who was heavily influenced by the Democratic Party's \n     commitment to civil rights platforms in `48 and `52, as well \n     as President Truman's insistence upon comprehensive medical \n     insurance--I thought that the legal profession was one in \n     which the moral order of human rights was relevant. The \n     prominence of lawyers in political life, like Adlai Stevenson \n     who ``talked sense'' to the American people, was also a \n     factor in my choice of the law as a career.\n       More than anything else, though, the struggle in South \n     Africa made me see the connection between the development of \n     the rule of law and dealing with injustice. I watched the \n     United Nations focus its attention upon that country when a \n     young lawyer named Nelson Mandela and so many other brave \n     activists were imprisoned, or, worse yet, tortured or killed \n     for political reasons. My very first publication was a review \n     of Alan Paton's ``Hope for South Africa'' in ``The New \n     Republic'' in September 1959. In the early `90s I had the \n     privilege to meet Mr. Mandela twice in South Africa--and then \n     to attend President Mandela's inauguration just a year ago in \n     Pretoria.\n       The Brown ruling, its judicial and legislative progeny and \n     the inspiration of lawyers dedicated to principles and \n     practicality--lawyers like Marshall, Mandela, Stevenson and \n     President Lincoln in the fiery storm of our own Civil War--\n     promoted my belief in the rule of law. And the fact is that \n     my faith in the law as a vehicle for change has been \n     reinforced and realized over these many years through the \n     opportunities that I have had to work in private practice, \n     teaching and government service.\n       My sense is that there is a great opportunity for lawyers \n     to serve the public good through the public service today--\n     even in this period of government bashing by the 104th \n     Congress. More than three decades ago President John F. \n     Kennedy called upon the sense of a ``greater purpose'' in a \n     speech at the University of Michigan when he advocated the \n     creation of the Peace Corps during the 1960 campaign. \n     President Bill Clinton's National and Community Service Trust \n     Act (AmeriCorps), designed to allow young people tuition \n     reimbursements for community service, echoes the same spirit \n     of commitment set forth by President Kennedy--and at an \n     earlier point by President Franklin D. Roosevelt through the \n     Civilian Conservation Corps.\n       This sense of idealism and purpose was at work in the New \n     Deal which brought so many bright, public spirited young \n     people to Washington committed and dedicated to the reform of \n     our social, economic and political institutions. The same \n     spirit has been rekindled by both President Kennedy as well \n     as President Clinton since the arrival of this Administration \n     in Washington almost two-and-one-half-years ago.\n       In a sense, this has come about by virtue of the Clinton \n     Administration's commitment--not only to child immunization \n     initiatives and helping the less financially able to use \n     available educational opportunities and to provide a higher \n     minimum wage to those who are in economic distress--but also, \n     most particularly, through the National Service.\n       You have an unparalleled opportunity in the '90s to serve \n     the public good. Your course offering which includes Social \n     and Environmental Litigation, Right of Privacy, Society, \n     Deviance and the Law, Foreign Relations Law, Employment \n     Discrimination Law and Law of Politics, to mention a few, \n     reflect our times and provide you with a framework that my \n     contemporaries never possessed.\n       Though most of my words today are focused upon government \n     or public service as a career or part of a career, the fact \n     is that your commitment to the public interest and the rule \n     of law can be realized in a number of forms. It is vital to \n     the public interest that those committed to it are involved \n     in a wide variety of legal, business and social careers--\n     representing, for instance, corporations, unions, as well as \n     public interest organizations.\n       But our commitment to law and the public interest is made \n     more difficult given the fact that our legal profession is in \n     the midst of a tumultuous and confusing environment. On the \n     one hand, lawyer bashing, sometimes justified and sometimes \n     not, seems to be moving full steam ahead. Part of this \n     phenomenon seems to be attributable to the fear that the \n     production of so many law students will soon result in too \n     many lawyers for a society's own good.\n       Only two years ago a National Law Journal poll showed that \n     only five percent of parents, given the choice of several \n     professions, wanted their children to be attorneys. \n     Undoubtedly, this unpopularity is what has fueled a number of \n     the legal initiatives undertaken by the Republican Congress \n     to the effect, for instance, that the loser in litigation \n     should pay all costs, that caps be devised for punitive \n     damages, etc.\n       A 1993 ABA poll comparing public attitudes toward nine \n     professions ranked lawyers third from the bottom, ranking \n     higher than only stockbrokers and politicians in popularity. \n     In attempting to discover the reasons for the low public \n     opinion of lawyers the poll asked what percentage of lawyers \n     and of five other occupations lack the ethical standards and \n     honesty to serve the public.\n       The results revealed an appalling ethical image of lawyers. \n     Lawyers ranked well below accountants, doctors and bankers \n     and barely above auto mechanics. According to the ABA poll \n     half of the public thinks one-third or more of lawyers are \n     dishonest, including one in four Americans who believe that a \n     majority of lawyers are dishonest. The pollster concluded \n     that ``the legal profession must do some soul searching about \n     the status quo, resolve to make some sacrifices to ensure a \n     positive future, and, above all, clean up its own house.''\n       One way for the profession to clean its own house is to \n     find new substitutes for lengthy litigation, frequently both \n     wasteful and unnecessarily acrimonious, such as alternative \n     dispute resolution--particularly in my own area of employment \n     law. More than a decade ago I chaired a Committee of the \n     California State Bar which recommended that new methods be \n     devised for many employment cases, and that where employees \n     could have access to economical and expeditious procedures, \n     it was appropriate to limit or cap damages. But the difficult \n     balance involved is to avoid limitation of the basic rights \n     of ordinary people to sue for the enforcement of consumer and \n     employment related legislation.\n       Attitudes towards lawyers are inevitably affected by one's \n     view of the law and the legal process. I hope that you will \n     look very seriously at government service as you seek to use \n     your newly acquired skills to better the position of your \n     fellow human being. This is the most basic contribution that \n     lawyers can make to society--and it is obvious that an \n     increased commitment to government or, if you choose private \n     practice or some other area of activity, pro bono work is \n     central to this effort.\n       I am particularly proud to head an agency which is \n     celebrating its 60th anniversary this summer and which, from \n     the very beginning of its origins in the Great Depression of \n     the 1930s, has contributed to the public good through \n     adherence to a statute which encourages the practice and \n     procedure of collective bargaining--as well as in other \n     portions of our law. Since its inception, the National Labor \n     Relations Board has possessed a culture of commitment to hard \n     work, excellence, and to the promotion of a rule of law which \n     is designed to allow both workers and business to peaceably \n     resolve their difficulties through their own procedures.\n       Illustrative of this process was the NLRB's prominent role \n     in the baseball dispute. It was not the Board's job to take \n     sides between the players and the owners or to determine \n     whose economic position ought to prevail. Consistent with \n     this approach, it was our job to decide whether there was \n     sufficient merit, as reflected by the facts and law, to \n     proceed into federal district court to obtain an injunction \n     against certain unilateral changes in conditions of \n     employment made by the owners. The Board handled the baseball \n     case as it does any other case.\n       Nor is it our job to take into account policy arguments \n     arising out of the peculiarities of this industry, the income \n     or status or notoriety of particular individuals on\n      either side. The statute applies--properly in my judgment--\n     to the unskilled and the skilled, to those who make the \n     minimum wage and those who are financially secure.\n       In the baseball case, the public was able to obtain a brief \n     glimpse of the Board's day-by-day commitment to the rule of \n     law in the workplace. Where parties are involved in an \n     established collective bargaining arrangement, our mandate \n     under the statute is to act in a manner consistent with the \n     fostering of the bargaining process--and I believe that we \n     discharged our duty in baseball in a manner consistent with \n     that objective.\n       What may have been overlooked in the public view was the \n     fact that the Board was [[Page S 8624]] able to proceed \n     through a fast track approach and make the promise of \n     spontaneous and free collective bargaining in the workplace a \n     reality. I hope that the players and owners will now do their \n     part and bargain a new agreement forthwith!\n       Our March 26 decision to seek an injunction seems to have \n     facilitated the resumption of baseball and thus was a great \n     victory for the public in renewing its contact with the game \n     which, like the Constitution, the Flag, and straight-ahead \n     jazz is so central to the essence of the country. Hopefully, \n     it will have the effect of promoting the collective \n     bargaining process sooner rather than later.\n       Frequently, the public gains its impressions of lawyers and \n     law from such high visibility cases and from exposure through \n     television rather than books. I can tell you that another \n     factor stimulating my interest in the law was watching the \n     McCarthy-Army hearings in the spring of 1954, that fateful \n     spring when Brown was decided. The hearings focused upon the \n     Wisconsin Senator's investigation of alleged Communist \n     infiltration of Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey, where my father \n     worked. Because of ideological hysteria, ``guilt'' by \n     association and rank anti-Semitism, many of our closest \n     friends were dismissed--and, indeed, I feared that this would \n     be my father's fate, particularly because of his announced \n     sympathy for Paul Robeson, a hero to so many black people of \n     his generation.\n       Later I had the opportunity to attend the so-called Watkins \n     Hearings in the following September in Washington which \n     ultimately led to MaCarthy's censure. Ft. Monmouth and the \n     McCarthy-Army hearings demonstrated how excessive government \n     authority can trample upon individual civil liberties--and \n     the aftermath of the Watkins Hearings redeemed our country's \n     constitutional protection of individual rights of belief and \n     association.\n       Since then, I think that televised Congressional hearings, \n     the Watergate hearings for instance, have contributed to the \n     public's understanding about the rule of law and its \n     relationship to the preservation of this Republic's \n     principles. Though, regrettably less conclusive, it may be \n     that the Iran-Contra hearings of 1988 and the Hill-Thomas \n     hearings of October 1991 performed a similar function in that \n     the assumption underlying both proceedings was that \n     government, like private individuals, must adhere \n     unwaveringly to the rule of law.\n       Again, this is to be contrasted with the spectacle of law \n     as show business on television. In my state of California, \n     the O.J. Simpson trial has treated the nation to an episodic \n     soap opera which appears to be more about the business of the \n     money chase than the real substance of law and the legal \n     profession. As Attorney General Janet Reno said about the \n     trial:\n       ``I'm just amazed at the number of people who are watching \n     it. If we put as much energy into watching the O.J. Simpson \n     trial in America . . . into other issues as Americans seem to \n     have done in watching the trial, we might be further down the \n     road.''\n       A recent Los Angeles Times Mirror poll reported by Peter \n     Jennings last month revealed that only 45 percent of adults \n     surveyed said that they had read a newspaper the previous \n     day, and a quarter of those responding said they spent so \n     much time watching the Simpson trial that they did not have \n     time for the rest of the news. At best, the siren song of \n     sensationalism is a distraction--and, at worst, it reinforces \n     excessively negative perceptions of law and lawyers.\n       My hope is that many of you will dedicate yourselves as \n     lawyers or in other careers to a concern for the public good. \n     Now, when Oklahoma City has made it clear that the idea of \n     government itself as well as the law is under attack, it is \n     useful to reflect back upon what government, frequently in \n     conjunction with lawyers, has done for us in this century \n     alone in moving toward a more civilized society.\n       Justice Holmes said, ``Taxes are what we pay for civilized \n     society,''--an axiom often forgotten in the politics of the \n     mid-'90s. What would our society look like without the trust \n     busters of Theodore Roosevelt's era and the Federal Reserve \n     System created by Woodrow Wilson? Regulatory approaches to \n     food and drug administration, the securities market, the \n     licensing of radio and television stations, labor-management \n     relations (with which my agency is concerned) and trade \n     practices are all part of the Roosevelt New Deal legacy which \n     few would disavow in toto.\n       It should not be forgotten that all three branches of \n     federal government took the lead in the fight against racial \n     discrimination and other forms of arbitrary treatment. And as \n     Judge (now Counsel to the President) Abner Mikva has noted: \n     ``The history of the growth of the franchise is a shining \n     example of why we needed . . . [the] federal approach.''\n       Today, the challenge of public service in Washington has \n     never been more exciting or inspirational. As I have \n     indicated, President Clinton's National Public Service echoes \n     anew the similar initiatives undertaken by both Roosevelt and \n     Kennedy.\n       I urge you to think of the government as a career in which \n     you can use your legal experience in pursuit of the public \n     interest. That does not mean that you have to be a Washington \n     or ``inside the Beltway'' careerist, although that is another \n     way in which to make a contribution. Many of you may choose \n     to serve in your communities throughout\n      the country and, at a point where your career is well-\n     developed, elect to serve through an appointment such as \n     mine.\n       In particular, if you accept such an appointment consisting \n     of a limited term (in the case of the Board five years), I \n     hope that you will keep in mind President (then-Senator) \n     Kennedy's characterization of eight law makers who were the \n     subject of this book, ``Profiles in Courage.'' Said the \n     junior Senator from Massachusetts:\n       ``His desire to win or maintain a reputation for integrity \n     and courage were stronger than his desire to maintain his \n     office . . . his conscience, his personal standards of \n     ethics, his integrity or morality . . . were stronger than \n     the pressures of public disapproval.''\n       This is a particularly vexatious problem for those who are \n     appointed and not elected because of the inevitable and \n     appropriate subordination of appointees--even in the arena of \n     independent regulation--to the people's elected \n     representatives. My own view on serving in Washington is to \n     do the very best you can to implement the public interest in \n     the time allotted in your term, with the expectation that you \n     will return to your community, reestablish your roots and \n     feel satisfied that you have--to paraphrase President \n     Kennedy--done your duty notwithstanding some of the immediate \n     ``pressures of public disapproval.''\n       While I consider the term limits issue to be an entirely \n     different proposition--the people ought always to be able to \n     freely choose their elected leaders amongst the widest \n     possible number of candidates--my view is that the proper \n     standard for those who are subordinate to such leaders is \n     that attributed to Cincinnatus, the Roman general and \n     statesman of the fifth century, who upon discharging his \n     public duty, returned to his community rather than taking the \n     opportunity to seize power and perpetuate himself in office.\n       The independence of administrative agencies might be \n     enhanced by legislation limiting Board Members or \n     Commissioners to one term of service. The temptation to \n     please elected superiors might decline accordingly.\n       Of course, all of us cannot win victories within 15 days, \n     like Cincinnatus, and be back on our farms or in our \n     communities so quickly. But true public service involves a \n     self-sacrifice which rises above the immediate pressures. Do \n     the best that you can to serve the public good.\n       This does not assure success or complete effectiveness. But \n     it does allow you to make use of your acquired expertise for \n     the best possible reasons. And this, in turn, puts you in the \n     best position to see it through to the end with a measure of \n     serenity that comes when you have expended your very best \n     effort despite setbacks and criticisms you may endure in the \n     process.\n       As President Lincoln said:\n       ``If I were to try to read, much less answer, all the \n     attacks made on me, this shop might as well be closed for any \n     other business. I do the very best I know how--the very best \n     I can and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If the end \n     brings me out all right, what is said against me won't amount \n     to anything. If the end brings me out wrong, ten angels \n     swearing I was right would make no difference.''\n       You graduate from a distinguished institution in the most \n     exciting political period since the reforms undertaken by the \n     Administration of the 1960s. I hope that some of you will be \n     attracted to public service and help advance our society \n     through the rule of law.\n       As you embark upon the excitement of a new career and \n     challenges in the days ahead, I wish you all good luck and \n     success on whatever path you choose.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8622-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8624-S8625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            ROBERT P.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for this \nopportunity to recognize the longstanding service of Mr. Larry Hobart, \nthe executive director of the American Public Power Association. Mr. \nHobard joined the APPA 35 years ago. Today, he is recognized nationally \nas an innovator and broker of solutions to complex problems in the \npublic power industry.\n  I have come to know Mr. Hobart through our work together to address \nissues facing public power generally and Bonneville Power \nAdministration in my home State of Oregon in particular. Mr. Hobart has \nnever failed to bring constructive expertise to the table in our \nefforts to resolve differences among parties. I have valued \ntremendously the knowledge, creativity, and experience he contributes \nto the process.\n  In addition to his work in the power industry, Mr. Hobart serves as \nvice president and a member of the board of directors of the Consumer \nFederation of America, the largest consumer organization in the United \nStates.\n  I was sorry to learn that Larry will be retiring from the American \nPublic Power Association. I know I am joined by many other members of \nthis body in expressing regret at his departure but great thanks for \nhis many valuable contributions to the legislative process on behalf of \npublic power.\n  I appreciate this chance to share with my colleagues a speech Hobart \ngave on a recent trip to the Northwest. His remarks demonstrate a \ncomprehensive grasp of the complex energy and natural resource issues \nfacing the Pacific Northwest that only decades of active involvement \nand much thoughtful consideration can provide. I ask that it be printed \nin the Record.\n  The speech follows:\n               Update From Your Changing Nation's Capitol\n\n                           (By Larry Hobart)\n\n       A lot of things have changed for public power in the past \n     few years. Let me tick off six of them of importance to the \n     Pacific Northwest:\n       1. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 was passed by Congress. \n     Now the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can order any \n     transmitting utility, including Bonneville Power \n     Administration under certain circumstances, to provide \n     transmission services for any entity--utility or non-\n     utility--generating electricity for sale for resale inside or \n     outside of the region. FERC decisions encourage network \n     access, comparability in pricing, and creation of Regional \n     Transmission Groups. A more competitive bulk power supply \n     market has developed with bidding pitting utilities against \n     independent power producers against IOU subsidiaries against \n     federal power marketing agencies.\n       2. Because of federal requirements, the price of salmon \n     protection rose to an annual rate of $500 million a year, and \n     combined with the effects of drought and lost revenues due to \n     releases to flush fish, shoved BPA rates\n      up near or beyond the point of noncompetitiveness, and \n     raised the question for some preference customers as to \n     whether federal power is the best buy.\n       3. Federal court interpretations of the Endangered Species \n     Act reinforced the rigid nature of that statute, and \n     suggested that there is no way short of an amendment by \n     Congress that will prevent the imposition of an open-ended \n     expense on power users that could ultimately price BPA power \n     right out of the market and leave taxpayers to swallow an $8 \n     billion investment.\n       4. Provisions of the Pacific Northwest Electric Power \n     Planning and Conservation Act passed by Congress and signed \n     by President Carter 15 years ago began to look increasingly \n     obsolete because regional planning has been eroded by \n     individual utility purchases in a competitive bulk power \n     supply market, environmental demands placed on the federal \n     power system have escalated costs, demand-side management \n     approaches are now focused more on cost-effectiveness and \n     customer information, and renewable resources must meet the \n     economic test of gas-fired generation.\n       5. Global competition for sales of goods and services in \n     international markets caused industries and businesses to \n     engage in continuing rounds of down-sizing and cost-cutting; \n     electric bills--even for firms that are not considered \n     energy-intensive--became important expense items, and for \n     some utilities, the principle for structuring rates for big \n     users became ``whatever it takes to keep the consumer.'' \n     Retail competition became a reality across the nation. \n     Failure to meet the challenge can now mean loss of industrial \n     customers or even loss of the franchise.\n       6. And lastly, the Republicans took control of the U.S. \n     Senate and House of Representatives. The Pacific Northwest \n     has nine new U.S. Representatives. Tom Foley is gone as \n     Speaker of the House, but seniority still gives your region \n     important Republican representation. Mark Hatfield is \n     chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bob Packwood \n     heads the Senate Finance Committee, Frank Murkowski chairs \n     the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Ted \n     Stevens controls the Senate Rules and Administration \n     Committee, and Don Young leads the House Natural Resources \n     Committee.\n       Republicans attempted to ``nationalize'' issues in the \n     campaign, running on a ``contract with America'' that \n     stressed a balanced budget, tax cuts, and a build-up of \n     national defenses. Meeting these goals will call for some \n     form of new ``revenues,'' which currently includes sale of \n     four federal power marketing agencies--the Alaska Power \n     Administration, the Western Area Power Administration, the \n     Southwestern Power Administration, and the Southeastern Power \n     Administration.\n       This morning I want to talk to you about some questions I \n     think you must consider in the face of these facts as you \n     plan the future of public power in the Pacific Northwest.\n       How can we avoid flushing down the river North America's \n     greatest renewable energy resource--the Bonneville Power \n     Administration?\n       Who is responsible for saving the system?\n       What steps need to be taken now?\n       Why should we worry about it?\n       We face a different situation than we confronted last year. \n     Last year, the problem was political and the answer was \n     economic: BPA critics charged that historically low interest \n     rates constitute a subsidy, and BPA supporters responded with \n     a scheme to restructure repayment. This year, the problem is \n     economic, and the answer is political: BPA rates have become \n     noncompetitive, and turning around the situation requires \n     congressional decisions to change the ground rules.\n       If BPA's rates are not competitive, consumer-owned electric \n     systems in the Pacific Northwest will increasingly turn to \n     other less expensive sources of wholesale power. As the bulk \n     power supply market expands with open access transmission, \n     the opportunities for ``shopping'' the market will become \n     greater, intensifying interest in suppliers other than BPA. \n     Loss of load will leave BPA with the same fixed costs but \n     fewer customers to share the burden. Even higher rates could \n     result, giving other systems a reason to depart. The dismal \n     reading is a ``death spiral'' in which BPA collapses like the \n     pull of gravity into a black hole.\n       BPA is taking the business steps that any such threatened \n     institution is expected to initiate in similar circumstances. \n     It has backed away from a number of deals where power costs \n     loomed larger than market prices at the margin, including a \n     unit at McNary Dam, a gas-fired generating plant to be built \n     by an IPP, and purchase of power from the province of British \n     Columbia. It is seeking to control and cut costs, it is \n     reducing personnel, it is restructuring to streamline \n     operations, it is scaling back transmission line construction \n     and improvements, it is emphasizing customer relations, and \n     it is promoting packages of power at prices it hopes will \n     hold in place existing markets. But the job is a tough one. \n     BPA must deal with a significant body of statutory law that \n     dictates how it operates, including 42 pages of dense\n      language contained in the Pacific Northwest Electric Power \n     Planning and Conservation Act. BPA must follow federal \n     personnel practices, and accept the dictates of \n     policymakers in the Department of Energy, the Office of \n     Management and Budget, and the White House. It has looked \n     at restructuring itself as a federal corporation, but the \n     Office of Management and Budget and some members of \n     Congress simply see such a solution as the first step \n     toward privatization. BPA is the target of plenty of \n     advice within the region from the regional council \n     appointed by four governors, the press, and interest \n     groups of all kinds.\n       But right now, the overriding fact about BPA economics is \n     its open-ended obligation to pay for salmon survival. While \n     the expenditures posted or postulated have produced \n     questionable results in terms of fish, the one sure thing is \n     that they represent the marginal measure of BPA's economic \n     trouble. If these costs are not capped and cut back, their \n     continued escalation poses the federal equivalency of \n     bankruptcy with the loss of a source of revenue to repay \n     taxpayer investment, the elimination of monies that might be \n     employed to preserve fish under a practical program, and the \n     disappearance of the regional asset at a ``going out of \n     business'' sale.\n       What's the answer? The answer is congressional legislation, \n     either through amendment of the Endangered Species Act or a \n     specific statute limiting BPA's financial responsibility to \n     an amount that allows it to price power at levels that permit \n     a competitive response to current conditions.\n       Is this a special subsidy for BPA? No way! What is \n     happening is that federal fish figures, activist jurists, and \n     environmental groups are force-feeding BPA with experimental \n     programs and giving no consideration to the costs versus the \n     benefits.\n       Let's get real about this matter. Saving salmon with the \n     methodology now in place is going to result in no money for \n     repayment or fish. Randy Hardy said it right in testimony \n     before a congressional committee earlier this year. ``In \n     today's competitive utility [[Page S 8626]] marketplace, \n     Bonneville must first succeed as a business if it is to serve \n     its wide-ranging regional mission and meet its federal \n     responsibilities,'' he said. ``Without revenues from the \n     power side, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to \n     continue to fund the region's fish, wildlife, conservation \n     and renewables programs.''\n       If the situation were not serious, it might be viewed as \n     silly. The Direct Service Industries reported recently that \n     under the Endangered Species Act, at least 214 West Coast \n     salmon subspecies are potential candidates for ESA listing, \n     even though they were members of four healthy species of \n     salmon. ``The listing of just three of those 214 subspecies \n     has already created regional economic unrest and a greater \n     than $500 million per year recovery price tag.'' The recently \n     released National Marine Fisheries Service Snake River Salmon \n     Recovery Plan suggests that doubling the 2,000 adult wild \n     salmon now returning to the Snake to spawn could cost \n     $300,000 a fish--assuming the plan works and that BPA can \n     generate the money to finance the plan.\n       Where is the money to come from? If power users decline to \n     pay higher prices to BPA than those charged by competitors, \n     will fish interests cough up the cash? The navigators? The \n     irrigators? The flood control beneficiaries? Federal \n     taxpayers? In the current federal budgetary environment, is \n     the U.S. Treasury likely to spawn money for salmon eggs? Not \n     likely.\n       Power users cannot be forced to make electricity choices \n     that are not in the interests of their consumers.\n       The Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and \n     Conservation Act, enacted December 5, 1980, declares ``that \n     Congress intends that this Act not be construed to limit or \n     restrict the ability of customers to take actions in \n     accordance with other applicable provisions of Federal or \n     State law, including, but not limited to, actions to plan, \n     develop, and operate resources and to achieve conservation, \n     without regard to this Act.''\n       ``Cost-effective'' is defined by the Act to mean handling \n     of the needs ``of the consumers of the customers at an \n     estimated incremental system cost no greater than that of the \n     least-cost similarly reliable and available alternative \n     measure or resource, or any combination thereof.'' Put \n     differently, if consumers of public power systems and rural \n     electric cooperatives would benefit from less expensive \n     purchases made elsewhere, that would be the ``cost-\n     effective'' decision.\n       What is happening in the wholesale bulk power segment of \n     the electric industry is that it is undergoing a fundamental \n     transformation from a monopolistic segment of the economy, \n     regulated on a cost-of-service basis, to an open access, \n     competitively priced, commodity-oriented activity. \n     Competition has created within regions a ``market clearing'' \n     price--a charge that represents the lowest marginal rate \n     within a marketing area. This can cause ``stranded \n     investment''--that portion of the cost of a utility's \n     facilities that is more expensive than the market price of \n     electricity will support.\n       Who bears the cost if customers switch? Here are the four \n     possibilities:\n       Write it down against utility shareholder equity\n       Charge to remaining customers through rates\n       Levy a ``wires charge'' by moving the investment to \n     transmission\n       Create a ``competitive transition'' assessment\n       Some non-power interests are arguing that if consumer-owned \n     electric utilities diminish their take from BPA, they must \n     pay an ``exit fee'' to cover costs of WPPSS #2, renewable \n     energy resources, conservation programs, and fish recovery \n     plans. There is no requirement in law or contract that public \n     power systems and rural electric cooperatives make payments \n     of this type, and to do so would be detrimental to the \n     interests of their consumers. To the extent that the charges \n     equaled the differential between BPA prices and that of other \n     suppliers, competition in the bulk power supply market would \n     be diminished.\n       A ``wires charge'' is totally inequitable because it \n     arbitrarily moves the cost of investment in generation--the \n     principal element of ``stranded investment''--and renames it \n     ``transmission.'' Furthermore, doing so is tantamount to \n     creating a tying arrangement illegal under the antitrust \n     laws.\n       Use of a ``competitive transition'' assessment punishes \n     customers for a condition they did not create--the advent of \n     a more competitive market driven by open access transmission, \n     surplus capacity among utilities, and the development of gas \n     turbine generation with short lead-times, high efficiencies, \n     and low costs. The arrival of this competitive market is not \n     a surprise--the trend has been evident for years--and where \n     consumer-owned electric utilities choose to exercise their \n     contractual options to switch or supplement a supplier to \n     decrease consumer costs, they should not be penalized for \n     doing so.\n       As APPA told FERC recently, the imposition of stranded cost \n     payments--be they ``wires'' or transition'' fees--would have \n     anticompetitive effects in the marketplace because they:\n       erect artificial restrictions on new entry for alternative \n     suppliers and trades;\n       discriminatorily favor individual entrenched suppliers and \n     their shareholders;\n       give that entrenched competitive a paid-off asset with \n     which to punish rivals;\n       distort relative transmission prices if charges are placed \n     there;\n       reduce electricity consumption to suboptimal levels and \n     distort the investment of electricity-using industries into \n     more labor-intensive technologies; and\n       slow the diffusion of new technology.\n       Exit fee proposals skirt the real issue. The real issue is \n     maintaining a competitive price for BPA power.\n       ``Exit fees'' are a solution advocated where monopolists \n     wish to preserve the status quo by enforcing their will; BPA \n     has no legal or economic power to implement this approach. \n     Furthermore, it is completely contrary to the thrust of the \n     National Energy Policy Act passed by Congress in 1992 and now \n     being carried out by the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission. The likelihood that, at this juncture, Congress \n     would decide to circumvent that law and write into statute a \n     special deal for BPA is virtually nil.\n       There is no apparent authority for BPA to assess an ``exit \n     fee.'' While BPA's rates are subject to ``confirmation and \n     approval'' by FERC that they are sufficient to assure \n     repayment of the Federal investment over a reasonable number \n     of years and are based on total system costs, this authority \n     is unlikely to mean that ``stranded investment'' can be \n     encompassed. If the issue comes to a head at the Commission, \n     it is perhaps more likely to result from application of the \n     FERC's regulations dealing that transmission.\n       The Energy Policy Act of 1992 specifies that FERC has the \n     authority to ``order the Administrator of the Bonneville \n     Power Administration to provide transmission service and \n     establish the terms and conditions of such service.'' While \n     provisions of ``otherwise applicable Federal laws'' continue \n     in full force and effect, FERC is charged with determining \n     that ``no rate for transmission of power on the system shall \n     be unjust, unreasonable, or unduly discriminatory or \n     preferential.'' Administrative procedures for requesting \n     transmission services from BPA are outlined in the law, and \n     BPA cannot be required to provide transmission service ``if \n     such order would impair the Administration's ability to \n     provide such transmission services to the Administrator's \n     power and transmission customers in the Pacific Northwest.''\n       BPA is defined under the National Energy Policy Act as a \n     ``transmitting utility'' because it ``owns or operates \n     electric power transmission facilities which are used for the \n     sale of electricity at wholesale.''\n       It's important to understand what FERC is doing in the area \n     of transmission.\n       The Commission has issued a major proposed rule on this \n     issue.\n       Under the proposal, IOUs are required to file generic \n     nondiscriminatory open access transmission tariffs that will \n     assure ``comparability'' between use of transmission systems \n     by the transmitting utility and third party transmission \n     customers.\n       The tariffs would functionally ``unbundle'' wholesale \n     transmission from wholesale bulk power sales.\n       Each utility must have a tariff for network service, and \n     for firm point-to-point service, including the necessary \n     ancillary services.\n       The tariffs would include a duty to expand transmission \n     capacity where necessary, and reassignment rights for firm \n     point-to-point service.\n       Firm service requests would have the same priority as new \n     transmission service for the utility's native load.\n       Utilities must also make available to potential \n     transmission users the same electronic network information \n     they use for their own transmission activities.\n       All transmission tariffs will contain a reciprocity clause.\n       With respect to ``stranded investment,'' FERC postulates \n     two situations:\n       1. Wholesale contracts executed after July 11, 1994, would \n     be subject to recovery only if specifically provided for \n     under contract.\n       2. For existing wholesale requirements customers, IOUs may \n     seek recovery of stranded costs through transmission rates if \n     (a) the contracts do not\n      explicity address such recovery, and (b) the utility can \n     show it had ``a reasonable expectation'' of continued \n     service to the customer beyond expiration of the contract \n     term. There is a rebuttal presumption that if contracts \n     contain notice provisions, the utility had no reasonable \n     expectation of continuing to serve the customer beyond the \n     notice period.\n       The IOU must attempt to ``mitigate'' stranded investment, \n     by absorbing, marketing or selling it, over a reasonable \n     period of time, and the customer must be given advance notice \n     of the maximum charge if no mitigation occurs.\n       FERC's proposal provides that utilities that are not \n     private power companies but are ``transmitting utilities'' \n     can file a request to recover stranded investment under \n     sections of the Federal Power Act dealing with transmission. \n     However, they would be required to make the same evidentiary \n     demonstration that is required of private power companies \n     seeking extra-contractual stranded investment cost recovery.\n       In April, Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon held a hearing on \n     BPA problems. I think some of the material presented by \n     public power is significant. Here are some pertinent parts:\n       While debt of the Washington Public Power Supply System is \n     controlled and is actually declining due to refinancing and \n     other cost control measures, making it a predictable and \n     certain future customer obligation, fish costs are \n     uncontrolled and escalating. Since 1990, the annual fish cost \n     (both capital and [[Page S 8627]] revenue expenditures) have \n     more than doubled and continue to increase each year.\n       Forty percent of BPA's fish and wildlife costs are for the \n     direct cost of the program, while 60 percent of the cost of \n     the program is attributable to the cost of power purchases to \n     meet flow requirements and revenues foregone because of spill \n     or altered hydro availability. Fish and wildlife costs are 19 \n     percent of EPA's total costs.\n       Reducing the generating capability for the Columbia River \n     Hydro System is not a stranded investment subject to an exit \n     fee concept. It is a change of water use by the federal \n     government which should be subject to a recalculation of the \n     repayment obligation. Transmission under the 1992 changes in \n     the Energy Policy Act is a common carrier which should not be \n     subject to external costs not related to construction and \n     operation of transmission services.\n       BPA's resource base is 12,000 MW of installed, renewable \n     and low-cost hydro. The advantage of purchasing power long-\n     term from BPA is that it gives a utility access to this \n     federal hydroelectric system, which is insulated from changes \n     in energy costs due to changes in fuel prices. Gas prices and \n     the price of alternate suppliers will not stay low forever \n     while BPA;s costs will decline as the Supply System debt is \n     paid off. This is reason to believe that the BPA will \n     continue to provide cost-effective electricity in the future. \n     A long-term contract with BPA lessens the amount of decision-\n     making on power supply that a utility needs to make. This \n     creates a sense of ``one-stop shopping'' versus being an \n     active participant in the market place. If BPA;s one \n     environmental externality (fish and wildlife concerns) can be \n     addressed in an economically sustainable fashion, this system \n     looks very good for a very long time.\n       BPA's future is not the only issue before Congress of \n     interest to public power in the Pacific Northwest. For \n     instance, Senator Slade Gorton of Washington is circulating a \n     discussion draft of legislation to remove the public power \n     exemption from regulation of pole attachments by the Federal \n     Communications Commission. If his proposal were enacted into \n     law as part of the telecommunications legislation pending in \n     the Senate, FCC staff in Washington would decide what you \n     could charge for use of your facilities and rights-of-way.\n       As many of you know, earlier this month, the House of \n     Representatives, by a vote of 309-100, approved an amendment \n     to the Clean Water Act that affirms the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission's proper role as a final arbiter over \n     hydro-project licensing cases where Section 401 conditions \n     conflict with FERC's responsibilities under the Federal Power \n     Act. The people who helped make that happen include \n     Representative Randy Tate and Representative Norm Dicks of \n     Washington and Representative Helen Chenoweth of Idaho. The \n     focus now shifts to the Senate, where we again need to \n     explain the need for a final decision-maker to resolve \n     federal-state disputes.\n       But Bonneville is the big issue. I think the stakes are \n     large and immediate. If the hemorrhaging of water and money \n     cannot be stopped, the agency is not a viable institution. It \n     is unlikely that federal taxpayers will subsidize the \n     operation, and it is unreasonable to expect Northwest \n     electricity consumers to pay more than the going price for \n     power. If the worst happens, Congress is likely to endorse an \n     asset sale of a failing business. That shouldn't happen, and \n     it doesn't need to happen. But your involvement in preventing \n     it from happening is the essential ingredient.\n       It is important to understand a change in relationships \n     that has taken place in the Pacific Northwest in recent \n     years.\n       A long-term paternalistic resource planning and acquisition \n     role for BPA is no longer sustainable in an era where \n     planning horizons have shortened to five years and there are \n     literally scores of potential suppliers, some with offerings \n     that cost only \\1/2\\ of Bonneville's current rates.\n       Technology choices have changed. Gas-fired combustion \n     turbines can be ordered and brought on-line in less than a \n     year, supplying power with efficiencies of up to 60 percent \n     and prices lower than new hydro.\n       The partnership of BPA and preference customers cannot be \n     the same when federal power costs more than purchases from \n     IOUs.\n       Consumer-owned utilities have made payments to BPA over \n     five decades and have built up the significant equity in the \n     system. They have a continuing interest in protecting and \n     enhancing that investment, but like BPA, they must adjust to \n     a world where competitive bidding has replaced sole source \n     suppliers.\n       BPA will have a more limited role in providing load growth \n     services to its customers. In the future, this will more \n     likely be the province of utilities, acting alone or in \n     concert to diversify supply and reduce risk.\n       You have your responsibility to your user-owners. BPA has \n     its responsibility to taxpayers. But both of you benefit from \n     working together. And that effort needs to take place \n     now.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8625-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      THE 1995 ABERDEEN PHEASANTS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, when I was growing up, professional \nbaseball flourished in South Dakota. I remember many games from the \nnow-defunct Basin League. Those teams stimulated and nurtured my love \nof America's greatest pastime. Therefore, as a lifelong baseball fan, I \nam very pleased to announce that professional baseball has returned to \nAberdeen, SD, after a 24-year hiatus.\n  Last Friday night, June 16, the Aberdeen Pheasants won their home \nopener at Fossum Field against Saskatchewan's Regina Cyclones, 7-3. \nSince opening their 71 game season on the road on June 9 against \nManitoba's Brandon Greyowls, the Pheasants have played brilliantly, \nwinning eight of their first nine games. They are tied for the lead in \ntheir division. I am confident the team's early success is an \nindication of great seasons and thrilling action in the months and \nyears ahead.\n  The 1995 Aberdeen Pheasants are part of the newly formed Prairie \nLeague, an eight-team independent professional baseball league \nconsisting of four American and four Canadian teams. The Pheasants' \nownership committee has a distinct local flavor consisting of 20 \nAberdeen residents. The committee's executive leadership consists of \nJeff Sveen, Dr. Scott Barry, and Keith Kusler will work closely with \nArthur Bright, the vice president of operations and Rich Bosma, the \nteam's general manager. I congratulate them and the entire ownership \ncommittee for bringing baseball back to Aberdeen, and for their team's \nearly success this year.\n  Mr. President, I also am proud, though not surprised, how the entire \nAberdeen community has rallied behind the effort to return pro baseball \nto the area. The Pheasants are the talk of the town. Friday's home \nopener was very well attended. Knowing the enthusiasm for baseball in \nthe area, I am sure fan support will remain strong throughout the \nseason.\n  The 1995 Pheasants are the latest chapter in the long and proud \nhistory of Aberdeen professional baseball. The city had a class D \nbaseball team in the 1920 South Dakota League and from 1921 to 1923 in \nthe reorganized Dakota League. In 1946, the Aberdeen Pheasants joined \nthe old Northern League as a farm team for the Baltimore Orioles and \nremained in the Northern League until the entire league collapsed after \nthe 1971 season.\n  During this 25-year period, as many as 40 Pheasant players went on to \nplay in the Major Leagues. Among the notable Pheasant alumni were Hall \nof Fame pitcher Jim Palmer; Don Larson, who pitched a perfect game in \nthe 1956 World Series; 1958 Cy Young winner Bob Turley and New York \nYankee all-star player Lou Piniella. In addition, Cal Ripken, Sr., \nmanaged the Pheasants prior to assuming the same duties for the \nBaltimore Orioles. I am confident present Pheasants manager Bob Flori, \nassistant Coach Joe Calfapietra, and their crew of young, talented \nplayers will carry on the great traditions established by these \nplayers. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record \nthe team roster of the 1995 Aberdeen Pheasants at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the people of South Dakota, I want to \nwelcome back the Pheasants to Aberdeen and wish them the best of luck \nin their inaugural season. Gentlemen, play ball!\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8627-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8627-S8628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO HELEN COLE\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize an \noutstanding woman whose hard work and dedication have touched the lives \nof many individuals. Indeed, it is rare to discover a character so \nwilling to offer one's talents solely to serve and improve the lives of \nothers.\n  Thus, I would like to take this time to express appreciation for an \nextraordinary citizen of Nicholas County, Summersville, WV, Helen Cole. \nRecently, Helen was honored at the Muddlety-Glade Creek Ruritan Club \nwhere she received numerous awards, including the prestigious Clara \nBarton Award, which is known to be the highest award given to volunteer \nworkers. Currently, Helen is employed by Love, Inc., where she helps \ncounsel financial management.\n  Helen, born in Ansted, WV, located in Fayette County, has been a \nlifelong resident of West Virginia. Helen has received a bachelor of \nscience degree in home economics as well as a master's degree in \nextension education. In time, she became employed by WVU and USDA \nextension agents in Nicholas [[Page S 8628]] County, where she taught \nhome economics in the field and in the home. In addition, Helen \nconducted radio educational programs in Nicholas and Fayette Counties \nand performed ``Friends and Neighbors,'' an educational television \nprogram. Furthermore, Helen assisted as eastern regional director for \nthe National Home Demonstration Agents Association [HDAA], and also \nserved as State president of the West Virginia chapter of HDAA.\n  However, Helen's true colors are revealed through her in-depth \ninvolvement with the Nicholas County chapter of the American Red Cross. \nIn the past, Helen has been a Red Cross volunteer for many years and \nhas primarily been responsible for locating volunteers to manage \ncrucial programs, such as blood services, first aid and CPR educational \nprograms, service to military families, and disaster relief assistance. \nFrom 1976 to 1981, Helen served as the volunteer executive secretary of \nthe American Red Cross. In December 1980, Helen retired after 34 years \nof teaching home economics to extension homemakers and soon after \naccepted the dual positions of full-time chapter managers and \ntreasurer.\n  Although Helen recently retired in December 1994 from her office of \nchapter manager of the American Red Cross in Summersville, she still \nremains involved in various volunteer activities in addition to her \nemployment by Love, Inc. For example, Helen continues to volunteer at \nthe Nicholas County chapter of the American Red Cross, where she holds \nthe position of executive secretary and is a member of the board of \ndirectors. Also, she occasionally still teaches classes through \nprograms under the WVU extension service concerning lesson leader \ntraining. Helen, since 1981, has volunteered with the Food Pantry of \nthe Summersville Ministerial Association, where she organizes food \nsupplies for the pantry. Furthermore, Helen reviews applications for \nemergency assistance at the Federal Emergency Management Agency program \nin Summersville. Also, since 1942, Helen has been a Sunday school \nteacher and continues to teach an adult women's class at Memorial \nUnited Methodist Church in addition to a weekly Bible study class.\n  Helen Cole's accomplishments deserve notice and praise. Her \nenthusiasm and concern for humankind provide a model we should all \nstrive to follow.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8627-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    TEMPORARY STORAGE OF CIVILIAN SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL AT THE HANFORD \n                    RESERVATION IN WASHINGTON STATE\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I wish to discuss a serious and \nimportant issue facing the Nation: Our growing supply of civilian spent \nnuclear fuel that has no home. My friend from Alaska, Senator \nMurkowski, submitted a statement for the record before the Senate \nadjourned for the Memorial Day recess. In it, he discussed a number of \npolicy options to be employed for interim storage. Hanford, WA, and \nSavannah River, SC were two sites he mentioned as possible interim \nstorage facilities for civilian spent nuclear fuel.\n  Located in the southeastern part of Washington State, the Hanford \nReservation is home to over 80 percent of the Nation's spent plutonium \nfuel--2,132 metric tons by Senator Murkowski's count. The most potent \nof that waste sits hundreds of yards from the Columbia River in 50-\nyear-old concrete pools. These pools are not sophisticated and \ncertainly not designed to store some of the deadliest materials \nproduced by man.\n  Hanford faces a particularly difficult situation. This year the site \nhas incurred serious criticism for the waste and inefficiencies that \nhave become associated with Hanford cleanup. Much of this criticism is \nwell deserved. Some, however, is off-base and ignorant of the \nmonumental task at hand. Hanford has a mission--it is to follow through \non the noble and worthy effort this Government undertook to win World \nWar II. The site must be cleaned--that is the task at hand.\n  Adding more waste to Hanford, as I have said before, makes little \nsense. As the chairman of the Energy Committee, Senator Murkowski has \njoined the ranking member, Senator Johnston in introducing a bill that, \nI fear, would impede ongoing cleanup efforts at the site. So it is \npuzzling, when my friend suggests Hanford can barely tie its own shoes, \nbut in the next breath, he says the site should be burdened with \nmassive amounts of additional waste. There is a disconnect. I believe \nHanford's mission is to focus on cleanup. So let me be clear: Shipping \nspent civilian nuclear fuel to Hanford sets a dangerous, and perhaps \nirrevocable, precedent. And unfortunately, despite Senator Murkowski's \nassurances to the contrary, when dealing with waste that has a half-\nlife of thousands of years, ``interim'' takes on an entirely new \nmeaning.\n  Senator Murkowski, fortunately, understands there is considerable \nroom for debate on this issue. He is absolutely right to point out the \nproblems the country faces in light of the impending spent fuel storage \ncrisis. I also sympathize with the Senator from Alaska's frustration at \nboth DOE and the President's lack of progress at Yucca Mountain. As he \ncorrectly notes, over $4.2 billion has been spent on the Yucca Mountain \nproject to date--with nothing to show for the effort.\n  Rather than abandon this program altogether--which the House \nessentially does in its budget resolution this year--does it not make \nmore sense to push through and finish a project that has absorbed \nsignificant time and money? Quite clearly, the United States must build \na long-term storage facility for its high-level nuclear waste. Yucca \nMountain, by most indications, is the logical choice.\n  As the Senator from Alaska emphasized in his statement, both an \ninterim storage site and transportation system at Yucca Mountain must \nbe developed. If it is the intention of the Federal Government to send \nwaste to Yucca Mountain eventually, why not send the spent fuel there \ntemporarily, until the permanent depository is ready? It is remote, \narid, and has had a mission of testing nuclear devices for over 40 \nyears. And perhaps most important, by placing a temporary facility at \nYucca Mountain, transporting this deadly material across the Nation is \nlimited to one voyage.\n  My intent today is not to solve the interim storage problems that the \nNation faces with its growing stockpile of spent civilian nuclear fuel. \nI do, however, want to point out an inconsistency this Congress is \ncontemplating: Cleaning Hanford while simultaneously adding more waste \nbegs common sense. And I urge my colleagues to keep this in mind in \ntheir deliberations.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8628-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THE FOSTER NOMINATION\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to renew my call for \nthe majority leader to schedule a vote on the nomination of Dr. Foster \nto be Surgeon General of the United States. The Senate has had ample \ntime to review Dr. Foster's record since his nomination was sent to us \nin February--over 3 months ago. It is time to take the next step and \nvote. We should not keep Dr. Foster or our Nation waiting.\n  America needs a strong and experienced voice on public health issues. \nHistorically, the Surgeon General has always played that role. In the \n1930's the Surgeon General launched a campaign to educate the public on \nthe dangers of venereal disease. In the 1960's the challenge facing the \nSurgeon General was smoking; in the 1980's it was AIDS; today, the \nchallenge is teen pregnancy, tuberculosis, and disease prevention.\n  I am confident that Dr. Foster has what it takes to make his mark in \nhistory and to lead us in working on the many public health issues that \nwe face. So do many of my colleagues in this Chamber. Let's remember \nthat Dr. Foster's nomination was favorably reported out by the Senate \nLabor and Human Resources Committee on a 9-7 vote.\n  There should be no delays and no more evasion of responsibility. It \nis time for the full Senate to vote on Dr. Foster's nomination for the \nposition of Surgeon General.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8628-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8628-S8629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL ACT\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, no politician likes to admit that he \nmade a mistake in voting for any bill. But, in life and politics, it is \nusually better to be right than to be consistent. [[Page S 8629]] \n  I voted for the Independent Counsel Act when it was enacted in 1978. \nAnd I voted for it again--although with increasing trepediation--when \nit was reauthorized in subsequent years. But, as many have said, \nexperience is the best instructor. And experience has demonstrated to \nmy eyes that the Independent Counsel Act is worse than the disease it \nwas meant to cure. I have come to the conclusion that it is time for \nthe Senate to reconsider--and perhaps even eliminate--the office of the \nindependent counsel.\n  To be sure, the act was born of good intentions. It was designed to \ncounter the conflict of interest--or at least the appearance of a \nconflict--that existed whenever a Federal prosecutor pursued one of the \nPresident's own officials. It was meant, in short, to ensure that such \ninvestigations would be carried out solely with the public's interest \nin mind.\n  Nonetheless, as Prof. Gerald Lynch of Columbia University argued in \nthe Washington Post, the act has not put to rest the charges of bias in \npolitically tinged cases. Instead, what has become painfully clear is \nthat virtually any suit against a major political player will involve \ncharges of favoritism and partisanship, whether or not an independent \ncounsels is appointed.\n  Even worse, says Professor Lynch, the act has encouraged overzealous \nprosecutions: ``Ordinarily, a prosecutor must ask whether it is fair to \ntreat this case as a felony compared to others where the defendant was \nnot politically prominent. The special prosecutor has no such \nconcerns.'' Three distinguished Attorneys General--Edward Levi, Griffin \nBell, and William French Smith--have made similar criticism, noting how \nthe act ``exacerbates all of the occupational hazards of a dedicated \nprosecutor: the danger of too narrow a focus, the loss of perspective \nof preoccupation with the pursuit of one alleged suspect.''\n  In short, 20 years of experience have demonstrated that the cost of \nmaintaining the Independent Counsel Act far outweighs its benefits. It \nhas aggravated, rather then calmed, the prevailing anti-Government mood \nthat prevails in this Nation. As Gerald Lynch concludes, ``instead of \npurifying our governing institutions, special prosecutors play into a \npathology that thrives on an appetite for scandal and a distrust of our \nsystem of government.'' And that is perhaps the strongest reason of all \nto reconsider the wisdom and efficacy of the act in its current form.\n  I ask that the article by Prof. Gerald Lynch be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n                 Special Prosecutors: What's the Point?\n\n               (By Gerard E. Lynch and Philip K. Howard)\n\n       Just about everybody in the country was focused on \n     terrorism in Oklahoma, but the president of the United States \n     had other pressing business: He was being questioned by \n     independent counsel Kenneth Starr about Whitewater.\n       Nothing unusual there. In fact, there has hardly been a \n     time, since passage of the Ethics in Government Act in 1978, \n     when a special prosecutor and his target have not been in the \n     news. Justifying the smallest details of a past transaction \n     or decision has become part of the job description for high \n     executive office, always with the suggestion of public \n     scandal and personal ruin.\n       The progress of the manhunt is chronicled in the daily \n     headlines (``Investigation Moves One Step Closer to the \n     President''), but the titillating prospect of bringing down \n     important leaders is not a healthly sign. Instead of \n     purifying our governing institutions, special prosecutors \n     play into a pathology that thrives on an appetite for scandal \n     and a distrust of our system of government.\n       The stakes were small in early independent counsel \n     investigations. Who cared whether Hamilton Jordan used \n     cocaine at Studio 54? But the Reagan-Bush administration \n     provided an investigative feast: Did Michael Deaver, Lyn \n     Nofziger or Ed Meese violate conflict-of-interest rules? Did \n     Samuel Pierce preside over a corrupt housing department? Did \n     Iran-contra extend past North, Poindexter and McFarlane to \n     the secretary of defense, perhaps even to Reagan and Bush?\n       Cries for new independent investigations have dogged the \n     Clinton administration practically every month. This month \n     it's the secretary of commerce who gets his own special \n     prosecutor. And why not Ira Magaziner--who knows whether he \n     told the whole truth? Future occupants of the White House can \n     expect the same.\n       As for actual law enforcement, however, it has been slim \n     pickings. Does anyone remember Thomas Clines, the only Iran-\n     contra figure who went to jail? Deaver pleaded to minor \n     charges, and Nofziger's conviction was reversed. Meanwhile, a \n     lot of apparently innocent people have been investigated \n     intensively for a long time. The anemic results are obscured \n     by all the noise and speculation around new investigations, \n     which consume staggering amounts of taxpayer funds (about $10 \n     million so far with Whitewater) and whose primary effect is \n     to divert our leaders from the task of governing.\n       What, we might reasonably ask, is the point?\n       Good government orthodoxy has it that ``special'' \n     prosecutors are needed because the regular Justice Department \n     prosecutors, reporting to a politically appointed attorney \n     general, can't be relied on to prosecute the president's \n     cronies. Special prosecutors supposedly ensure impartiality.\n       These premises, plausible enough on the surface, happen to \n     be backward. Deciding to prosecute is not a simple matter of \n     finding that a law has been violated. It is a far more subtle \n     decision, made against the reliable backdrop of hundreds of \n     other cases. Judgment and discretion are at the heart of a \n     prosecutor's job. In a world in which regulations are piled \n     so high that many well-meaning people trip over them, \n     prosecutors must decide every day whether a particular \n     violation is merely technical or is one that requires the \n     awesome step of criminal prosecution. Decisions to prosecute \n     are inextricably bound up in priorities--prosecutors \n     regularly allocate scarce resources to violent and drug \n     crimes at the expense of nonviolent white-collar cases--and \n     necessarily draw on society's norms and values.\n       The premise that professional prosecutors will tend to \n     favor the politically powerful is also wrong. Ordinary \n     assistant U.S. attorneys in Maryland brought down Spiro \n     Agnew. Regular Justice Department employees in New York \n     indicated John Mitchell and Maurice Stans. It was one of Rudy \n     Giuliani's assistants, not an ``independent'' prosecutor, who \n     called sitting Attorney General Ed Meese, his own boss, a \n     ``sleaze'' in a prosecution of one of Meese's closest \n     friends.\n       The real pressures distorting prosecutors' judgment are the \n     opposite of what reporters and good government editorialists \n     perceive. High officials are the most tempting targets for \n     young prosecutors. Fame and glory (and ultimately a lucrative \n     private law practice) come from handling cases in the \n     headlines.\n       But what of the ``appearance'' of partiality? Surely a \n     nonpartisan figure of great repute ensures, if nothing else, \n     that the investigation will be ``above politics.'' Two words \n     refute this claim: Lawrence Walsh. The Iran-contra \n     investigation proved the impossibility of taking a \n     politically sensitive case ``above politics.'' Here we had a \n     special prosecutor of the president's own party, with a long \n     history of moderation and professionalism, a respected and \n     independent figure with a lifetime of achievement in law \n     practice and public service. Surely, his conclusions would be \n     respected by all.\n       Hardly. When Judge Walsh began to conclude the president's \n     men were crooks, he was vilified by the president's allies \n     (spearheaded by the Wall Street Journal) as politically \n     motivated and biased. Judge Walsh was predictably defended as \n     impartial by Democrats, but he was no more able to escape \n     imputations of bias than regular prosecutors would have been. \n     Indeed, Judge Walsh became a political symbol.\n       The Whitewater case provides an even more extreme example \n     of the elusive search for nonpartisan appearances. The \n     original special prosecutor, Bob Fiske, another establishment \n     lawyer with Republican credentials and a reputation for \n     unimpeachable integrity, drew criticism from Republicans when \n     he did not seem impressed with the case against Clinton. \n     Fiske was then replaced on the impeccable logic of taint-by-\n     association: He was not quite ``special'' enough because he \n     had been appointed by Clinton's attorney general. The New \n     York Times, formerly a vigorous proponent of that pristine \n     logic, promptly noted the right-wing Republican connections \n     of the judge heading the panel that dumped Fiske, and \n     attacked his replacement, Ken Starr--another lawyer of high \n     standing and great integrity--as a Republican hack.\n       The lesson is clear: Partisan arguments intrude into all \n     decisions involving the political arena. The intense \n     spotlight of the special prosecutor does not illuminate so \n     much as blind.\n       In the ordinary case, the U.S. attorney has to ask himself: \n     Is it fair to treat this case as a felony, as compared to how \n     we treated other, similar cases where the defendant was not \n     politically prominent? The special prosecutor has no such \n     concerns. He has only one investigation to pursue, and the \n     unnatural intensity inevitably skews the decision. The \n     smallest infraction can take on a life of its own.\n       In the words of three distinguished former attorneys \n     general--Edward H. Levi, Griffin B. Bell and William French \n     Smith--the independent counsel only exacerbates ``all the \n     occupational hazards of a dedicated prosecutor: the danger of \n     too narrow a focus, of the loss of perspective, of \n     preoccupation with the pursuit of one alleged suspect.''\n       There may be disputes of constitutional dimesion--\n     Watergate, perhaps--where the benefits of special counsel are \n     worth the accompanying diversion and disequilibrium. But in \n     practically all other cases, the discretion and balance found \n     in our ordinary law enforcement system is far superior. And \n     if the people believe that a president or an attorney general \n     has distorted that system to favor his friends, retribution \n     at the hands of political enemies and media interests is \n     never far off.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8628-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S 8630]]\n\n           AUTHORIZING REPRESENTATION BY SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

HENRY FOSTER\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, earlier today I met with Dr. Henry Foster. \nAt our meeting we discussed a number of subjects, including the \ninfamous Tuskegee syphilis study, the inconsistent statements from the \nWhite House and from Dr. Foster himself concerning the number of \nabortions Dr. Foster has performed, and Dr. Foster's role in \nsterilizing several mentally retarded women during the early 1970's.\n  I would just say that we had a very frank discussion. The discussion \nlasted 30 to 40 minutes.\n  I indicated earlier I felt, as the majority leader, that Dr. Foster \ncertainly is entitled to an opportunity to speak to me. We went over \nprobably 15, 20, 25 different questions. He answered each of the \nquestions. Some had been answered during his nomination consideration \nbefore the Labor Committee.\n  I told Dr. Foster we were trying to work out some procedure on the \nSenate floor so that we could have two votes: one on cloture; if \ncloture was not invoked after two votes, that the nomination would go \nback on the calendar; and, if cloture were invoked, then, of course, we \nwould have the debate. We have not reached an agreement, but I hope to \nvisit tomorrow morning with the distinguished Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle.\n  But I would say that our phones are ringing off the wall. Just \nbecause you meet with someone--some people do not even want you to meet \nwith nominees because they have different views than the nominee. My \nview is that they are entitled to that regardless of whether I agree or \ndisagree.\n  I do not support Dr. Foster's nomination, but my view is that he is \nentitled to that courtesy. And we had a good meeting as far as covering \ndifferent points that I wanted to cover, and he had an opportunity to \nmake his own statements.\n  So, hopefully, tomorrow we can announce a process that will lead us \nto consideration--at least the first step in the process, whether or \nnot cloture will be invoked, and, second, if it is, what will follow.\n  It will be my intention to try to make that announcement sometime \ntomorrow.\n  I see the Senator from Missouri is here [Senator Bond].

Mr. President, I have been very troubled during the past \nfew months by the debate over the proposal to eliminate the Department \nof Commerce. Much of the debate has focused on the need to eliminate \nthe so-called corporate welfare programs of the International Trade \nAdministration and the Bureau of Export Administration. I would like to \naddress these proposed cuts today.\n  Congress is embarked on a long overdue effort to make real cuts in \nGovernment programs and move toward balancing the budget by 2002. This \neffort deserves strong support from every member of this body, because \neliminating the budget deficit is the primary responsibility facing \nMembers of Congress today. The debt is a burden on the backs of the \nAmerican people, on the future of our children, and on the \ncompetitiveness of U.S. companies trying to win in today's competitive \nworld marketplace. That is why I voted for the budget in committee and \nagain on the Senate floor, and that is why I support it strongly.\n  Certainly, the Commerce Department--like most of the Federal \nGovernment--can stand some significant trimming, and I applaud efforts \nto weed out outdated and inefficient programs at Commerce as well as at \nother departments. I believe, however, the attacks on these two trade \nagencies are misguided and misinformed.\n  As we enter the 21st century, it is clear the future of our Nation's \neconomy depends on the international marketplace. If we are to remain \nthe world's leading economy, then we will have to dominate the \ninternational market as well as our own. The competition will be \nintense, and companies from other nations will come to the field \nequipped with a wide array of tools provided by their nation's \ngovernments--from concessional financing, to market research, to high-\nlevel sales help from senior government officials. If our companies are \ngoing to remain competitive, they must have at least some access to the \nsame tools. The International Trade Administration is the agency that \nhelps to provide that edge.\n  At the same time, it is just as critical that we ensure other \ncountries are trading fairly and playing by the rules. That is the job \nof the U.S. Trade Representative. However, all of the trade negotiators \nat USTR operate with significant support from the Commerce Department. \nThe loss of that support would have a crippling impact on our ability \nto ensure our interests. BXA, the Bureau of Export Administration, and \nITA, the International Trade Administration, are the engine that drive \nthe rest of the Federal Government's trade agencies. Without them, the \nother agencies will cease to function properly, and effectively to help \nour businesses gain jobs and the revenues that they need from the world \nmarket.\n  For that reason, when the Senate considers legislation to abolish the \nDepartment of Commerce, I will offer an amendment to create a new, but \nvery small Department of International Trade which will consist solely \nof the current Commerce Department trade agencies--the Bureau of Export \nAdministration and the International Trade Administration.\n  There are a wide range of reasons for retaining the trade functions \nin a Department of International Trade. I would like to take a few \nmoments to discuss the most important ones:\n  First, Senators need to understand that the International Trade \nAdministration is responsible for supporting the activities of the \nOffice of the U.S. Trade Representative with sectoral and technical \nexpertise. The proposals to eliminate the Commerce Department appear \nnot to recognize this fact.\n  Everyone seems to agree that USTR is a successful agency which \nperforms a critical function, and which must be retained. But too few \nseem to realize that USTR is made up of a mere 170 people. They could \nnot possibly handle all of our trade negotiations without significant \nsupport from other agencies, particularly the International Trade \nAdministration.\n  When we are negotiating an auto parts deal with Japan, for example, \nthere will be a USTR official sitting at the bargaining table leading \nthe team. Behind that person, however, are almost certain to be experts \nfrom the Office of Automotive Affairs and the Office of Japan Trade \nPolicy. The proposals to abolish the Commerce Department would \neliminate both of these offices, which would leave the USTR negotiator \nunsupported, and unable to counter the Japanese negotiator on the other \nside of the table. We would\n have our head handed to us in these negotiations, and every other \ninternational trade negotiation we undertook. The result would be a \nloss of U.S. jobs as our ability to negotiate fair trade agreements is \neroded.\n\n  The important role that ITA plays in trade negotiations is \nillustrated by looking at the NAFTA talks on which ITA experts spent \nmore than 50,000 hours in the last year of the negotiations alone.\n  It should also be noted that ITA plays the lead role in a wide range \nof trade talks. For example, ITA led the negotiations that opened \nJapan's construction and government procurement markets to United \nStates firms. ITA experts developed the negotiating positions for all \nU.S.-E.U. standards barrier talks since 1990.\n  It is also important to note that the International Trade \nAdministration is the Federal agency with primary responsibility for \nmonitoring bilateral and multilateral trade agreements. Elimination of \nthe network of ITA specialists would severely hamper our ability to \nmonitor trade agreements and ensure that other countries are playing by \nthe rules.\n  Second, the proposals to eliminate the Commerce Department would \neffectively remove the Federal Government from providing export \npromotion and assistance for nonagricultural exports.\n  Now I realize there are many of my colleagues who would applaud that \ndevelopment, but I would like to take just a moment to review the \nimpact it would have on American companies.\n  The economic battleground has moved solidly to the international \nmarketplace. Our future economic growth depends, in large part, on \nAmerican firms winning their share of the new markets developing in \nplaces like Indonesia, India, Brazil, and China. These countries have \nhuge populations which are hungry for development. The infrastructure \nneeds is these nations are staggering. Investment in roads, bridges, \ntelecommunications systems, power generation, and other infrastructure \nprojects is estimated to be $1 trillion over the next 5 years in Asia \nalone. The competition for these projects will be intense. Companies \nfrom Germany, Japan, Canada, and other nations will aggressively seek \nto win them; and they will go after them with strong tools provided by \ntheir governments. These tools will include not only concessional \nfinancing, but also market research, industry expertise, and the high-\nlevel marketing help of senior government officials. Already our \ncompanies go into this battle with fewer resources available from the \ngovernment than their foreign competitors. If we send them in unarmed, \nthey will simply get stomped.\n  We must also recognize that the markets in these countries are not \nlike ours. Almost all of these infrastructure contracts will be awarded \nby governments, not by private firms. The officials responsible for \nmaking the buying decisions are used to dealing with other Government \nofficials, rather than with businessmen. U.S. Government support is \nneeded to support the business effort so that they can win in these \nmarkets.\n  I know of many examples from my personal experience in which ITA \npersonnel played a key role in helping to clinch huge exports for \ncompanies in my State. In one, Black & Veatch, a Kansas City \nconstruction firm teamed with General Electric, won a $250 million \npower generation project in Malaysia last year with the active support \nof the Foreign Commercial Service officer in Kuala Lumpur, who spent 3 \nyears on the project. The result was a win for the United States \nagainst a Japanese firm offering concessional government financing. The \nproject has the potential to bring in a total of $1 billion in business \nif the American companies win the follow-on work. They would never have \nhad a chance of winning without the active, on-the- [[Page S \n8632]] ground support of the U.S. Government.\n  Commerce assistance is just even more important for small firms. \nEarlier this year, I received a letter from one businessmen in St. \nLouis who summed up the important role the US plays in supporting \nexports by small companies.\n  I might add here, Mr. President, we all know the major exporting \ncompanies, large companies in America are very competitive in the world \nmarket. They need help to stay on an equal footing with Export-Import \nBank assistance and other financing, but when it comes to getting into \nthe world market our medium- and small-sized businesses do not have the \nresources to mount an effective campaign for a small business. This \nletter reads as follows, and I quote:\n\n       Four years ago, acting as vice president of a 65-year-old \n     small business in St. Louis, Mo., I watched in horror as more \n     and more of our independently owned retail customer base \n     began closing. I then observed the exit of our largest single \n     account, which accounted for 10% of our total company sales. \n     After studying the competitive nature of U.S. business, I \n     decided to investigate foreign markets as a possible answer \n     to our declining sales problems.\n       I did not know one single thing about international trade, \n     I did not know where to look for possible customers, how to \n     find them or how to communicate with them if, indeed, one was \n     to be found. To a first-time potential exporter, the world \n     looked like a very big place indeed, and I thought I had no \n     way of knowing how to access it.\n       One single seminar sponsored by the Department of Commerce, \n     a two-hour lecture on international shipping, started my \n     company once again on the road to financial stability. For \n     during that two-hour meeting, and during the subsequent small \n     talk that followed, I was introduced to the world through the \n     eyes of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service and \n     the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n       Within only one year's time, our company exports climbed to \n     $110,000. With continued tutelage from various members of the \n     US, the second year of exporting yielded $263,000. Year \n     three saw our sales climb to $473,000. Year four saw $576,000 \n     in international sales alone.\n\n  Mr. President, those are significant amounts for a small company. \nThey are very significant for any community. They are vitally important \nfor the workers who make the products that are sold in the world \nmarket. If we multiply it across the tens of thousands of small firms \nthat could be exporting, you would see the enormous impact on our trade \ndeficit and our overall economic well-being that these functions of the \nDepartment of Commerce serve.\n  It is for that reason, Mr. President, I believe, when we take a look \nat weeding out the chaff and cutting out unnecessary activities, we \nmust be well advised to keep those things which are working, to keep \nthose things which are vitally important for ensuring the continued \ncompetitiveness of small- and medium-sized firms in the world market. \nIf we do not help these firms, they will wither and die.\n  We must recognize, however, that small companies like this one are \nnot going to export without help. They do not have the people, they do \nnot have the time, and they do not have the resources to devote to \nentering the often-difficult international marketplace. If we take away \ntheir access to Commerce Department assistance, they are not going to \ngo out and hire private lawyers and accountants--instead, they are \ngoing to forgo exporting, and cede valuable markets to foreign firms.\n  Third, the proposals to eliminate the Commerce Department would \ndestroy the Import Administration. The Import Administration is the \nAgency responsible for enforcing and administering the laws against \ndumped and subsidized exports of other countries. Actions initiated by \nthe Import Administration have played a key role in the revitalization \nof several U.S. industries.\n  The proposal that has been introduced in the House to abolish the \nCommerce Department would transfer the functions of the Import \nAdministration to USTR which is not a proper agency to be making such \ndeterminations, and which will not have the manpower to handle the job.\n  A fourth problem with the plans that have been put forward is that \nthey would transfer the responsibility for licensing dual use exports \nfrom the Bureau of Export Administration, to either the State \nDepartment or Defense Department.\n  Under the current system of export controls, the Commerce Department \nis responsible for licensing dual-use exports such as machine tools, \ncomputers, and telecommunications. The State Department has the \nresponsibility for licensing weapons sold overseas. Over the past \nseveral years, as Congress has considered proposals to rewrite the \nexport control system, a primary goal of exporters has been to ensure \nthat as many exports as possible fall under the jurisdiction of the \nCommerce Department rather than the State Department. There are several \nreasons for this move. State is seen as not being friendly to \nexporters. It is seen as something of a black hole where export license \napplications can disappear until sales are lost to foreign firms by \ndefault.\n  Further, exporting is not the primary concern of the State \nDepartment. Instead, the Agency is focused on foreign policy concerns. \nIt is easy to imagine a scenario in which an export application might \nbe denied due to foreign policy interests rather than commercial \ninterests.\n  Finally, State is in the process of taking cuts in its primary \nprograms. As that happens, there is almost certainly not going to be an \nadequate number of people assigned to noncore functions such as export \nlicensing. The result will be a further loss of jobs for American \nfirms.\n  The alternate proposal to move the licensing function to the Defense \nDepartment is similarly problematic. DOD has responsibility for \nnational security, not exporting. They do not have there expertise to \ndeal with dual-use commercial items such as machine tools, computers, \nand telecommunications items. The result is certain to be that they \nwill err on the side of caution and deny all licenses--or at least a \nmajority of them.\n  Fifth, the proposal would transfer the responsibility for enforcing \nexport controls from Commerce to the Customs Service. Now I am a strong \nsupporter of the Customs Service. I think they are doing a fine job \nwith the limited resources we give them. I have visited several of \ntheir facilities, I have watched them in action at the border. We can \nbe proud of the job they are doing, particularly in keeping illegal \ndrugs out of our country.\n  I am concerned, however, that the proposal to split enforcement from \nexport licensing and transfer it to Customs will weaken our effort to \ncontrol the spread of weapons of mass destruction. No matter how good a \njob Customs does, and they have done some good work in this area, they \nwill still not be focused on it as their primary function, as the \nagents in Commerce are currently. Also, I fear that export enforcement \nwill take back seat to the more visible activity of combating the \nspread of illegal drugs.\n  I should like to turn for a moment to the proposal to transfer \nseveral of these functions to USTR. I simply do not think that will \nwork.\n  USTR is part of the Executive Office of the President. For 2 years \nnow, we have told the President that he must cut the White House staff \nback significantly. Now some are coming forward with a proposal that \nwould reverse any progress that has been made, by transferring hundreds \nof new employees to the White House. That does not make a whole lot of \nsense.\n  Just as important, USTR is not an appropriate home for these agencies \nor functions. USTR is a policy agency designed to advise the President \nand play the role of honest broker between other trade agencies. \nTransferring the functions of the Import Administration, the Foreign \nCommercial Service, and other agencies to USTR will make it a line \nagency with significantly broader responsibilities than it currently \nhas. I question whether that is a step we want to be taking. I, for \none, do not think so.\n  And there are other problems that are sure to arise. I am sure \nagricultural interests will be concerned that this proposal will put \nsome of Commerce's manufacturing and services trade specialists into \nUSTR. Since we would not be doing the same for the commodity \nspecialists in the Department of Agriculture, they are certain to see \nthis move as tipping the balance of interest in the White House away \nfrom agriculture interests.\n  As I stated earlier, if we are in fact going to eliminate the \nCommerce Department, I believe the solution to this [[Page S \n8633]] problem is to create a very small, but very effective Department \nof International Trade made up solely of the existing functions of the \nInternational Trade Administration and the Bureau of Export \nAdministration, and represented in the Cabinet. Creation of this agency \nwill allow us to continue to remain effective in the international \narena without spending more money than we are now. It keeps BXA and ITA \ntogether, thereby preserving the synergy that comes from keeping trade \nin one agency; and it allows exporters to continue to have a place at \nthe cabinet table.\n  This new Department of International Trade would not be the \nbureaucratic monster that today's Commerce Department has become. It \nwould have a budget of less than $400 million--not even one-tenth of \nthe current Commerce Department budget.\n  My plan would not consolidate other existing trade agencies. It would \nleave USTR, the Export-Import Bank, OPIC, and TDA as independent \nagencies. Senators may ask why I do not consolidate them into this new \nagency, and my answer is very simple, they work, and I have long \nsubscribed to the old adage, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. They are \nsmall agencies, performing critical functions, and we ought to leave \nthem alone to continue that fine work.\n  As I have said already, trade is the key to our economy's future. If \nwe toss in the towel right now, we can give up on the hope of remaining \nthe world's most important economy. We simply will not be able to do \nso. I am not willing to toss in the towel, and I bet a majority of \nSenators agree with me.\n  In closing, I would note that a number of wild charges have been \ntossed around by those opposed to the so-called corporate welfare \nprograms of export promotion and finance. I would like to focus on just \none of those wild charges.\n  The report accompanying the House budget resolution references a CBO \nreport which states:\n\n       [a]ll increases in exports * * * resulting from ITA's * * * \n     activities are completely offset by some mix of reduced \n     exports of other industries and increased imports.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not know which rocket scientist at CBO came \nup with than analysis, but it is one of the most ludicrous assertions I \nhave come across in my time here in Washington--and trust me I have \nheard some good ones.\n  When the people at ITA work to see that a foreign airline buys Boeing \n747's or McDonnell Douglas MD-11's rather than Airbus aircraft, is that \nincrease in our exports offset by reduced exports or increased imports? \nNo.\n  When a US officer in Kuala Lumpur helps to ensure that American \nfirms win a major power project against their subsidized Japanese \ncompetitor, does that result in reduced exports somewhere else in our \neconomy? Of course not.\n  Mr. President, the world trade pie is huge. The United States has a \nlarge part of it, but we should have an even larger part. Attitudes \nlike the one expressed by this bureaucrat at CBO show a complete lack \nof understanding of this fact. If we make the mistake of believing \nthem, we will condemn this Nation to lost jobs, a declining economy, \nand a lower standard of living as we enter the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the indulgence. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/19/senate-section/article/S8631-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
