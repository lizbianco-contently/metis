Such \n     sums shall remain available until expended.\n       (2) After the plan required in subsection (b) is submitted, \n     and for each of the 14 fiscal years thereafter, there are \n     authorized to be appropriated to the Trust not more than the \n     amounts specified in such plan. Such sums shall remain \n     available until expended. Of such sums, not more than $3 \n     million annually shall be available through the Trust for law \n     enforcement activities and services to be provided by the \n     United States Park Police at the Presidio in accordance with \n     section 4(h) of this Act.\n       (b) Within one year after the first meeting of the Board of \n     Directors of the Trust, the Trust shall submit to Congress a \n     plan which includes a schedule of annual decreasing federally \n     appropriated funding that will achieve, at a minimum, self-\n     sufficiency for the Trust within 15 complete fiscal years \n     after such meeting of the Trust.\n       (c) The Administrator of the General Services \n     Administration shall provide necessary assistance to the \n     Trust in the formulation and submission of the annual budget \n     request for the administration, operation, and maintenance of \n     the Presidio.\n\n     SEC. 6. GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE STUDY.\n\n       (a) Three years after the first meeting of the Board of \n     Directors of the Trust, the General Accounting Office shall \n     conduct an interim study of the activities of the Trust and \n     shall report the results of the study to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the United States Senate, and the Committee \n     on Resources and Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives. The study shall include, but shall not be \n     limited to, details of how the Trust is meeting its \n     obligations under this Act.\n       (b) In consultation with the Trust, the General Accounting \n     Office shall develop an interim schedule and plan to reduce \n     and replace the Federal appropriations to the extent \n     practicable for interpretive services conducted by the \n     National Park Service, and law enforcement activities and \n     services, fire and public safety programs conducted by the \n     Trust.\n       (c) Seven years after the first meeting of the Board of \n     Directors of the Trust, the General Accounting Office shall \n     conduct a comprehensive study of the activities of the Trust, \n     including the Trust's progress in meeting its obligations \n     under this Act, taking into consideration the results of the \n     study described in subsection (a) and the implementation of \n     plan and schedule required in subsection (b). The General \n     Accounting Office shall report the results of the study, \n     including any adjustments to the plan and schedule, to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee \n     on Appropriations of the United States Senate, and the \n     Committee on Resources and Committee on Appropriations of the \n     House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Aaron \nWatkins, a congressional fellow employed by the Department of the \nInterior, and assigned to the staff of the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, be granted privilege of the floor for the duration \nof the consideration of H.R. 1296, a bill to provide for the \nadministration of certain Presidio properties at minimal cost to the \nFederal taxpayers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that A. J. \nMartinez, a fellow from the Department of the Interior, be granted \nprivilege of the floor during consideration of H.R. 1296, and all votes \ntaken thereon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, in the absence of Senator Murkowski, his \nstaff indicated that it would be appropriate for me to go ahead and \nmake my\n\n[[Page S2740]]\n\nstatement at this point, so I would like to do so.\n  Mr. President, I want to make a few initial observations about where \nwe are with respect to this bill and where I hope we will end up. \nAlmost every park and public land bill reported from the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee in this Congress is included in the \nMurkowski substitute to be introduced this morning. Most of these bills \nare noncontroversial and were reported by the committee unanimously; \nsome have passed the Senate already but are held up in the House; some \nhave passed the House and could go to the President, but for the fact \nthat they are included in this package; others have had no action in \neither body.\n  While packaging these bills in this manner is not unprecedented, this \nparticular package is unusual in at least two respects. First, for \nalmost 1\\1/2\\ years we have been unable to move any of these bills \nthrough the Senate. This gridlock which has prevented our ability to \nlegislate in this area is unprecedented. This is not the way we should \ndo our business.\n  Whatever happens to this bill, I hope we will not find ourselves in \nthis situation again. For as long as I have been in the Senate we have, \nuntil this Congress, been able to move these noncontroversial but \nimportant bills back and forth between the House and Senate in a spirit \nof bipartisanship and comity. I deeply regret that we appear to have \nlost the will and/or the ability to do that in this instance.\n  Second, the addition of the Utah wilderness bill to this package has \ntransformed an effort to end procedural gridlock and enact a number of \nessential noncontroversial bills into a major battle over a very \ncontentious wilderness proposal. The inclusion of the Utah wilderness \nbill in this package of otherwise relatively noncontroversial bills has \nbrought on a filibuster here in the Senate and a veto threat from the \nadministration.\n  I have indicated to my colleagues from Utah that I plan to support \nthem in their efforts to get a Utah wilderness bill enacted. At the \nsame time, I do not want to see the committee's efforts of the last \nyear and a half wasted by passing a bill that does not pass or cannot \npass the House and will almost certainly be vetoed.\n  Since the Utah wilderness bill was introduced, the delegation from \nUtah has agreed to modify it significantly. Wilderness acreage has been \nadded and a number of significant changes in the management and land \nexchange provisions have been made. While I know that the changes do \nnot go far enough for some of my colleagues, I think it is clear that \nthe Utah delegation is serious about crafting a bill that can pass the \nSenate.\n  For example, with respect to one of the most contentious provisions \nof the bill, the so-called release language, the substitute before the \nSenate today contains language very similar to an amendment which I \noffered in the committee on this subject and which, though it failed on \na 10 to 10 vote, had bipartisan support and, as I recall, the Democrats \nof the committee were united on that subject. So, in effect, Senators \nBennett and Hatch have agreed to the Democratic position in the \ncommittee on that subject.\n  The substitute no longer contains language requiring that release \nlands, that is, lands not designated as wilderness, be managed for \nnonwilderness multiple uses. Likewise, the substitute does not prohibit \nthe BLM from managing these release lands in a manner that protects \ntheir wilderness character. Thus, this new language now satisfies the \nprimary objective that my amendment in the committee addressed.\n  Under the language as introduced, the BLM would have been unable for \nany reason to manage released lands, that is, those lands not \ndesignated as wilderness, for anything but nonwilderness purposes. In \naddition, the BLM would have been precluded from adopting any \nmanagement option that had the effect of protecting the wilderness \ncharacter of these released lands. I was concerned that such \nrestrictive language would preclude management for many legitimate \npurposes, such as disbursed recreation, protection of wildlife habitat \nor watersheds, the protection of scenic, scientific, or historical \nvalues or similar purposes.\n  Like the language offered, which was supported by virtually all the \nSenators on my side, the substitute now clearly permits these \nmanagement options and only prohibits the BLM from managing these lands \nas wilderness study areas for the expressed purpose of protecting their \nsuitability for future inclusion in the National Wilderness \nPreservation System.\n  While I recognize that there is still a serious limitation in the \nview of some of my colleagues, this current formulation is \nsignificantly narrower in scope than the bill introduced and \nillustrates the willingness of the Utah delegation to compromise on \nsome of these very difficult issues. I hope that both sides will make \nthe very serious effort over the next several days to reach an \naccommodation on this bill.\n  I might say, Mr. President, Senator Bennett, a former member of our \ncommittee, has shown time and time again in this Senate his willingness \nto be reasonable, not to be extreme in any way, and try to work to a \nbipartisan solution. I do not know the details of all the land in Utah. \nIn fact, I count myself as being unlucky because I have only been to \nUtah once and that was to the Salt Lake City airport. I am advised that \nit is a magnificent State with very beautiful lands. I cannot tell you \nabout which lands are which in Utah. However, I support the position of \nmy colleagues from Utah, frankly, as an indication of my confidence in \ntheir fairness and their reasonableness in picking these lands and \nbecause I think the two Senators from the State ought to, in all but \nvery extreme circumstances, have the ability to deal with wilderness \nmatters in their State.\n  Now, having said that, I can tell my colleagues from Utah that they \nare up against very strong and persuasive opposition. The most \npersuasive opposition you can get is a veto threat from the President. \nI offer to them and to my colleagues on this side of the aisle whatever \nservices I can give in trying to find a common solution so that we can \nwork out a bill that not only passes the Senate, gets past the \nfilibuster, but can avoid the veto threat of the President.\n  They have shown already, as I just indicated, on the release \nlanguage, their willingness to work to this kind of purpose. I hope we \ncan find a way to do that here on this floor so we can do more than \njust pass a bill in the Senate or get a majority of the votes in the \nSenate for a bill that does not become law; rather, that we pass a law \nthat does become law and settles this very contentious issue in a good \nway for the people of this country, as well as the people of the State \nof Utah.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlaska [Mr. Murkowski] is recognized to offer a substitute amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3564\n\n (Purpose: To offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. \n  1296, a bill to provide for the administration of certain Presidio \n   properties at minimal cost to the Federal taxpayer, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send to the desk a substitute \namendment and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3564.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me acknowledge my friend from Louisiana, the \nranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, for his \nstatement of support on the Utah wilderness. As we both know, serving \non the committee, this particular phase of this package of legislation \nhas been worked long and hard. We will hear from the representatives \nfrom Utah with regard to the specifics, but I think we have a good \npackage here.\n  I want to remind my colleagues, of the 56 or so titles of this bill, \nthere is virtually something in it for almost every Member of this body \nin the sense of it affecting his or her individual State. I encourage \nmy colleagues to recognize the importance of staying together on this \npackage, because once we start to take it apart by motions to strike, \nit will lose its base of support in\n\n[[Page S2741]]\n\nthe House of Representatives. I can assure all of the Members of that \nfact.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Michael \nMenge be permitted privilege of the floor for the duration of the \ndebate of H.R. 1296, the Presidio legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that John Piltzecker be \ngranted privilege of the floor during consideration of H.R. 1296.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the legislation under consideration \ntoday is probably the largest and, in my opinion, one of the most \nbalanced environmental packages we have addressed in the Senate, at \nleast in this Congress. This major legislative effort does, really, a \nnumber of things. It is proenvironment, it is profuture. I think it is \nfair to say that basically everybody wins. The bill represents a \nbalance between protection of our parks and our public lands and the \nwelfare of families and the economic well-being of the Nation and many \nlocal communities.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, it is a very reasonable attempt to \nfulfill a multiple-use concept and add to the wilderness some 2 million \nacres. Now, acreage, in the eyes of many, does not relate to anything, \nand perhaps I can put it in perspective. The State of Delaware is about \n1 million acres. We are proposing to add 2 million acres in Utah. It is \nfair to say 2 million acres is about three times the size of the State \nof Rhode Island; 2 million acres of wilderness is about half the size \nof the State of New Jersey.\n  Let me put this in a further perspective, Mr. President, as we \naddress wilderness and what it means. In the State of New Jersey, there \nare 10,341 acres of wilderness. With this bill, we would be adding to \nUtah's 800,000 acres of wilderness another 2 million, making it 2.8 \nmillion, approximately.\n  Another State that comes to mind in comparison is Arkansas. There are \n127,000 acres of wilderness in the State of Arkansas. By this \nlegislation, we would be adding 2 million in the State of Utah, again \nmaking it 2.8 million.\n  My friend from Louisiana has 17,046 acres of wilderness in his state \nof Louisiana. I am not going to talk too much about my State of Alaska \nbut will just mention in passing, we have 57 million acres of \nwilderness in the State of Alaska. We are proud of that wilderness. I \nthink it is important in this debate that we keep this in a \nproportional comparison, because with New Jersey at 10,341, one wonders \nwhy there is not a little more wilderness in New Jersey. I will leave \nthat to the Senator from New Jersey to explain.\n  Mr. President, this bill contains over 50 measures affecting our \nparks, our national forests, and public lands. It is really a \nbipartisan endeavor. It addresses legislation introduced by Members on \nboth sides of the aisle and represents a broad spectrum of interests \nfrom legislation dealing with everything from the Olympic games in Utah \nto the Sterling Forest in New York, to land exchanges in California, to \nboundary adjustments in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  The legislation contains expanded authorities for the National Park \nService which will contribute to more cost-effective management and add \nadditional parklands for the protection and enjoyment of all Americans \nnow and in the future.\n  There are several land exchange proposals that will add \nenvironmentally sensitive lands to the Nation's public land inventory, \nas well as having the effect of rearranging scattered Federal land \nareas into manageable units that will be protected well into the \nfuture.\n  The amendment starts with the Presidio, San Francisco. The title is a \nresult of long hours of negotiation, long hours of bargaining and \ncompromise. I made a visit to this military post on the San Francisco \npeninsula. The committee has been presented with a major challenge, and \nI am pleased to report to you that we, I think, have a realistic method \nto save this valuable historic asset. Let me recognize Representatives \nfrom the House, as well as those Members from the California delegation \nof the Senate, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. I know how much this \nparticular legislation means, and we have been working with them to try \nand reach an accord.\n  Mr. President, under this legislation, and over a period of time, the \nFederal appropriated dollars that made this park the most expensive \noperation in the National Park System, I am pleased, will be reduced \nover a period of time to basically zero. Federal dollars will be \nreplaced with money and expertise from the private sector, and the \nprivate sector is willing and able to accomplish that.\n  Mr. President, following the provisions affecting the Presidio, we \nhave some 32 additional titles covering 53 separate measures, and now \nthere have been three more for a total of 56. I trust that the staffs \nare responding this morning because I am going to go through the \nvarious titles and identify the States because, again, I want to \nemphasize that there is virtually an interest by each State in this \npackage of titles.\n  Here is the list of titles:\n\n       Yucca House National Monument boundary adjustment \n     (Colorado);\n       Zion National Park boundary adjustment (Utah);\n       Pictured Rocks National lakeshore boundary adjustment \n     (Michigan);\n       Independence National Historic Park boundary adjustment \n     (Pennsylvania);\n       Craters of the Moon National Monument boundary adjustment \n     (Idaho);\n       Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument boundary adjustment \n     (Idaho);\n       Wupatki National Monument boundary adjustment (Arizona);\n       New River Gorge National River (West Virginia);\n       Gauley River National recreation area (West Virginia);\n       Bluestone National Scenic River (West Virginia);\n       Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park (Hawaii);\n       Women's Rights National Historical Park (New York);\n       Boston National Historical Park (Massachusetts);\n       Cumberland Gap National Historic Park (Kentucky, Virginia, \n     Tennessee);\n       William O.

Roosevelt Family Lands (New York);\n       Title XXVI--Great Falls Historic District (New Jersey);\n       Title XXVII--Rio Puerco Watershed (New Mexico);\n       Title XXVIII--Columbia Basin (Washington);\n       Title XXIX--Grand Lake Cemetery (Colorado);\n       Title XXX--Old Spanish Trail (New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, \n     California);\n\n[[Page S2742]]\n\n       Title XXXI--Blackstone River Valley (Massachusetts, Rhode \n     Island);\n       Title XXXII--Cuprum, Idaho Relief (Idaho); and\n       Title XXXIII--Arkansas and Oklahoma Land Transfer \n     (Arkansas, Oklahoma).\n\n  So, you see, Mr. President, this has far-reaching effects, and I urge \nmy colleagues to recognize and assess keeping this package together to \nensure that it will be passed when it reaches the House.\n  Mr. President, within the noncontroversial issues, as I have \nindicated, there are a host of minor boundary adjustments and small \noperational change authorizations requested by the Department of \nInterior. There are authorizations for historic trail studies, building \nand naming national park visitor centers, expansion of historical \nparks, and equal value land exchanges for the Department of \nAgriculture. We have also addressed survey problems, and we authorize \nthe citizens of Grand Lake, CO, to maintain their own town cemetery. It \njust happens to lie inside the boundaries of the Rocky Mountain \nNational Park. There are other noncontroversial measures, each \nbenefiting one or more segments of our society.\n  Mr. President, by far, the most controversial component of the \npackage that we are considering is the title dealing with the Utah \nwilderness. Mr. President, it is suggested that if Winston Churchill \nwere a Member of this body, he would have said, ``Never have so few \ndone so much to confuse so many.'' It is our collective responsibility, \nI think, to look past the smoke screen that has been framed by extreme \nelitist types on the Utah wilderness issue.\n  Under the provisions of this bill, the Nation gains some 2 million \nacres of new wilderness. The lands under consideration meet the \nlegislatively mandated definition of what wilderness should be. These \nare truly land masses that retain their primeval character and their \ninfluence, without permanent improvements or human habitation, with the \nimprint of man's work substantially unnoticeable, just as the act tells \nus the requirements must be. We have the benefit of extensive studies \nand efforts poured into defining exactly what lands should and should \nnot be included in the wilderness system for Utah.\n  This whole issue was initiated by an act of Congress under the terms \nand conditions contained within the Federal Land Planning and \nManagement Act. The effort was carried out by professional subject \nmatter experts working for the Federal Government, not political \nappointees. In other words, Mr. President, this was done by \nprofessionals working for the Federal Government, but independent of \nthe political influences associated with political appointees. That is \nnot the case on the current recommendations that are coming from the \nother side to increase this wilderness in the area of 5 million acres.\n  Mr. President, the Bureau of Land Management study and final report \ncost the taxpayers of this country in excess of $10 million. It took \nmore than 15 years to complete. This process, which was carried out in \nthe full light of the public land planning process, included input from \nsome 16,000 written comments, and there were over 75 formal public \nhearings on this question of Utah wilderness. The study processed was \nopen to every citizen of the United States. It was well-defined \ncriteria, and well documented. Appeals and protests rights were well \npublicized and used by groups of people on both sides of the issue. At \nthe culmination of this process, those independent professionals \nrecommended the inclusion of 1.9 million acres. This legislation \nrecommends 2 million acres on the nose.\n  Those Federal employees in that open process spoke basically for \nevery citizen in this country who participated in the Utah wilderness \nprocess. The process followed the rules that, I remind my colleagues, \nare extensively articulated in both the Wilderness Act of 1964 and the \nFederal Land Planning and Management Act.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, the Secretary of the Interior, \nSecretary Babbitt, seems to want to ignore the advice of his own \nprofessional managers.\n  Here is the record of decision, Mr. President, the Utah Statewide \nWilderness Study Report that substantiates the recommendations that it \nbe 2 million acres. So the Secretary has decided to ignore that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Bureau of Land Management, Oct. 1991]\n\n  Utah Statewide Wilderness Study Report, Volume I--Statewide Overview\n\n\n                                The Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 18, 1991.\n\n\n                           record of decision\n\n       The following are the wilderness recommendations for 95 \n     wilderness study areas (WSAs) in the State of Utah. These \n     recommendations were developed from the findings of a 15-year \n     wilderness study process by the Department of the Interior \n     and Bureau of Land Management. The wilderness studies \n     considered each area's resource values, present and projected \n     future uses of the areas, public input, the manageability of \n     the areas as wilderness, the environmental consequences of \n     designating or not designating the areas as wilderness, and \n     mineral surveys prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey and \n     Bureau of Mines.\n       Based on our review of those studies, I have concluded that \n     1,958,339 acres within 69 study areas should be designated as \n     part of the National Wilderness Preservation System and that \n     1,299,911 acres within 63 study areas should be released from \n     wilderness study for uses other than wilderness. The acreage \n     recommendations for each WSA, with which I concur, are listed \n     in the following table. The Wilderness Study Report \n     accompanying this decision includes a detailed discussion of \n     the recommendations and maps showing the boundaries of each \n     area.\n                                                Manuel Lujan, Jr.,\n                                        Secretary of the Interior.\n\n                                         UTAH WILDERNESS RECOMMENDATION                                         \n                                         [Utah Statewide EIS WSAs/ISAs]                                         \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       Acres    \n                                                                                       Acres        recommended \n           WSA/ISA name                    Study                WSA number          recommended         for     \n                                                                                  for wilderness   nonwilderness\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNorth Stansbury Mountains........

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that throughout the committee \ndeliberations on this issue the Secretary did not offer one \nconstructive comment--not one single comment--nor did he direct his \nlegions to put forth an alternative. He was silent except for his \nexchanges with the media.\n  So here we have a Secretary that objects to this even after some $10 \nmillion and 15 years, and comes up with no suggested alternative.\n  That brings me to the point which I find very, very disturbing. I \npersonally received from the Secretary, not directly but through the \nnews media, a letter. This letter contains the passage that if the Utah \nwilderness provision contained in this bill prevails he would recommend \nthat the President veto the entire bill. This did not come in the mail, \nMr. President. Again, the Secretary offered no other constructive \nalternative to the wilderness proposal. I do not know. Maybe he wanted \nto save stamps and figured that the media would deliver his message. \nWell, they did deliver his message. I put a copy that we finally \nreceived into the Record. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed. I \nadd that this did not come in the mail.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to convey the \n     Administration's position on the Omnibus Parks Bill, due \n     before the full Senate shortly. If the Utah Public Lands \n     Management Act is part of an omnibus bill sent to the \n     President, I would recommend that he veto the entire package.\n       The Administration is prepared to support the omnibus park \n     bill if the Utah wilderness provision is deleted and with the \n     qualifications mentioned below.\n       With regard to the Presidio, we have continued to work with \n     the Committee to arrive at acceptable language. I am prepared \n     to recommend that the President support this provision, \n     assuming the Senate includes language authorizing the Trust \n     to transfer properties surplus to its needs and open space \n     areas to the Secretary (as provided for in the House-passed \n     bill), deletes the Davis-Bacon waiver (again as in the House \n     bill), deletes the exemption from the Anti-Deficiency Act, \n     and clarifies that the National Park Service may continue \n     short-term use and occupancy agreements until the Trust is \n     established.\n       As to the remaining titles, we are, in general, favorably \n     disposed to their enactment. However, the Alaska Peninsula \n     Subsurface Consolidation title is problematic. It would \n     establish a new appraisal methodology that would likely \n     result in the overvaluation of Koniag subsurface rights, at \n     the expense of the taxpayer. In addition, the National Park \n     Service does not believe that Koniag subsurface rights, at \n     the expense of the taxpayer. In addition, the National Park \n     Service does not believe that Koniag has a valid claim on \n     some lands the Secretary would be directed to acquire, and \n     these interests are of very low priority when evaluated on an \n     objective basis.\n       It is my understanding that certain procedural obstacles to \n     the consideration of the individual titles have recently been \n     overcome. We would also be pleased to encourage swift passage \n     and adoption of the vast majority of the bill's titles were \n     they to be considered separately. I have directed my staff to \n     work with the Committee to convey other technical concerns of \n     the Department and assist in improving the legislation where \n     we have expressed concerns, and hope this has been helpful to \n     those seeking to assess prospects for this legislation.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the submission of this report and that \n     enactment of this legislation in its current form would not \n     be in accord with the program of the Administration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bruce Babbitt.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I still have not received the original \nletter from the Secretary. I find these events indicative of some of \nthe attitudes that this administration--or some in this \nadministration--seems to have for the Congress and the people who will \nbenefit by the passage of this legislation. Playing in the media is \nonly self-serving. It does not serve the public. Unfortunately, some of \nthe media seemed to not have the intestinal fortitude to get up and \nfind out just what the facts are. I hope they will search them out with \nregard to this package that is so important to the lands in the United \nStates.\n  It is true that some of these lands in the State of Utah that they \nare going to receive in the exchange authorized under this legislation \nmay be developed, but very little. It will not be developed \nirresponsibly. I think we can trust the people of Utah in that regard. \nThe moneys generated from some of these lands go to Utah schools and \ninstitutions. Some opponents of the legislation suggest that the land \nwill be ruined and developed beyond recognition. I know that my \ncolleagues are aware of all of the safeguards that are still in place \nunder both Federal and State laws, and they are almost too numerous to \nmention, Mr. President. But I think it is important that we recognize \njust what the significance of these checks and balances are because \nthey are numerous.\n  To suggest that somehow Utah will have the flexibility to \nirresponsibly develop this land defies logic, Mr. President. I am going \nto submit for the Record legislative authorities involving the Bureau \nof Land Management, the General Public Lands Management Act, the \ngeneral environmental laws. They consist of the Federal Land Policy \nManagement Act, Classification of Multiple Use Act, Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act, Coastal Zone Management Act, National Environmental \nPolicy Act, Clean Air Act, Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Safe \nDrinking Water Act, Noise Control Act, Solid Waste Disposal Act, \nEnvironmental Quality Improvement Act, Hazardous Materials \nTransportation Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Oil Pollution \nAct, National Environmental Education Act, on and on and on.\n  I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Legislative Authorities Involving BLM\n\n\n                   i. general public lands management\n\n       1.

Mr. President, my point is an obvious one--that there \nare plenty of safeguards to ensure that that land will be developed in \na responsible manner.\n  The citizens of Utah have proven that they are responsible and good \nstewards of their land. Irresponsible development does not support, \nobviously, the school system, and the future of the State of Utah, as \nis any other State, is the children. They obviously need the benefits \nof a good educational system and some development. Some of this land \nwill be utilized for that purpose.\n  But to suggest somehow that it is an irresponsible act, the \ndevelopment of the land will be done irresponsibly, defies logic. This \nbill benefits the local communities in Utah. It provides them with \naccess to resources promised to them when they were first granted the \nschool section concept.\n  I need only to remind my colleagues that those who oppose this \naddition to the wilderness system are, in my opinion, those who have \nabsolutely no consideration for maintaining a vibrant economy. Look at \nsome areas of the United States where we had difficulties--poverty, \nlack of jobs. Appalachia comes to mind. We can look to Afghanistan and \ncertain areas of South America, economically depressed portions of the \nplanet, and there is an easy connection to be drawn. It is a reality \nthat people do not have a future. They do not have the opportunity for \njobs. There is no tax base. As a consequence, a situation like that \nneeds to be recognized and corrected.\n  That is why in this legislation, the State of Utah has the \nflexibility to make the determinations on their own as to what is best \nfor their own people and their own State.\n  So, Mr. President, we simply must not divorce the concept of \nenvironmental protection from the economic\n\n[[Page S2747]]\n\nhealth of our citizens and the communities within which they live. \nEconomic well-being enhances the environment. It certainly does not \ndestroy it. I think you have to have good schools, well-educated young \nAmericans, and good job opportunities. Then we can truly have the means \nand the knowledge to meet our environmental responsibilities. You do \nnot do it in a vacuum.\n  Again, Mr. President, the Nation gains some 2 million acres of \npristine national treasure; the residents of Utah gain schools, \neducation, and a protected environment. In my opinion, there is no \nbetter quid pro quo.\n  We are going to have an extended debate here, Mr. President. But \nthere are a couple of other things that I would like to add to the \nopening statement that I think make reference to the realities that we \nare faced with.\n  There has been a suggestion by some in the media and some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle that there have been delays \nin putting this legislation together and that somehow the \nresponsibility should rest with those of us on this side of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I would like to remind my colleagues that the bills in \nthis package have been held in limbo for several months. The end result \nof this inaction has produced a logjam of legislative proposals that \nhave been collecting sawdust around here. But the reality of this \nlogjam is the fact that Senate passage of one bill will not occur until \nthere is an action on another and then another and so on down the line.\n  The bottom line is everyone gets something or everyone gets nothing. \nThat is where we are with this package today. As I have indicated, \nthere are some 56 areas that are affected here. If we can take this \npackage together and move it, it will pass and be accepted in the House \nof Representatives and move on to the President. But if we start \nunwinding, I can assure you that set of facts is not going to prevail.\n  The bottom line is that you cannot send the Presidio to the House \nminus the provisions concerning Utah. I guess we could sit around here \ntoday and tomorrow rearranging the deck chairs all we want, but if the \nTitanic leaves port without that deck chair the results are \npredictable. Presidio will die and all of the other titles of the bill \nwill die, too.\n  I am going to be specific because I think it is appropriate relative \nto the concerns that are going to be expressed today in the extended \ndebate.\n  I wish to talk specifics about the Utah wilderness bill. I know my \ncolleagues from Utah will go on at great length, but my good friend \nfrom New Jersey has made a point of indicating his dissatisfaction with \nthe proposed resolve of 2 million acres being added to the wilderness \nof Utah, and he has made the point in his press releases that our \npublic lands belong to all Americans. I certainly agree with that. But \nhe goes on to say that they should never be given away to a few special \ninterests.\n  Mr. President, I do not consider the people of Utah ``a few special \ninterests.'' While I am a Senator from Alaska, I happen to have a \nlittle spot in Utah where occasionally I go skiing, so you might say I \nhave my own vested interest in Utah. I am a taxpayer there. I do not \npretend to have the expertise of my colleagues who are going to speak \nlater, but by the same token I think I have equal expertise to that of \nmy friend from Utah.\n  I do not consider the people of Utah a special interest. The \nresidents of Utah are represented by their elected officials. I have a \nletter which shows that 26 of the 29 State senators support the \nprovisions of this bill. The letter from the house chamber of the Utah \nState Legislature shows that 64 out of 75 house members support the \ndesignation of wilderness in this bill.\n  Finally, I have a letter which shows that all of the elected county \nofficials, all of the officials in 26 out of the 29 counties support \nthe legislation as written. It is interesting to note that in the 27th \ncounty, five out of seven commissioners support the bill. The letter \ncontains over 310 signatures of county elected officials.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I \njust referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Utah State Legislature,\n\n                            Salt Lake City, UT, February 14, 1996.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: As legislative leaders, we want to \n     reaffirm the position taken by the Fifty-first Legislature of \n     the State of Utah as it relates to the amount of BLM land \n     designated as wilderness in Utah.\n       HCR 12, RESOLUTION SUPPORTING WILDERNESS DESIGNATION, by \n     Representative Bradley Johnson, states very clearly the \n     process by which wilderness was to be identified and \n     quantified. That process was followed, and the local \n     political entities acted very responsibly when they \n     recommended that a little more than 1 million acres receive \n     wilderness status.\n       The addition of acreage bringing the total amount to be \n     added to the wilderness proposal to 1.8 million was an \n     unsettling surprise. Yet, in a spirit of compromise, this \n     total amount would be acceptable. We believe the addition of \n     any more acreage, however, would be an affront to the \n     citizens of this state and the process put in place that made \n     the original recommendation. Furthermore, we believe the \n     addition of more land would be tantamount to surrendering to \n     rhetoric which is without a rational or factual basis.\n       The Fifty-first Legislature has spoken clearly on BLM \n     wilderness designation. To lock up more land to an uncertain \n     future in a state where 80 percent of the land area is \n     subject to some form of government restriction and control is \n     a policy which lacks sensitivity and foresight. This policy \n     blind spot is simply inappropriate. To shackle future \n     generations in this state with the unbendable restrictions \n     wilderness designation imposes is nothing more than a \n     ``takings'' of the hopes and dreams of Utahns whose heritage \n     and economic roots are tied to these lands. These lands are \n     not threatened and wilderness designation will not provide \n     any additional protection that is already provided for by law \n     governing the management of these lands.\n       For more than 100 years, there has been a harmony between \n     the land and the land user. A dependence on the part of both \n     has grown up with a healthy mutual respect. Questionable \n     science has been injected into the wilderness decision-making \n     process by those who are disjointed and removed from the land \n     they claim to befriend.\n       We reaffirm our position on wilderness designation \n     articulated in the last legislative session and as that you \n     consider it to be the position of the State of Utah. If we \n     can be helpful and answer your questions in addressing your \n     concerns relative to this issue, we would be most amenable to \n     doing what is necessary so that your decision is made with \n     the very best, accurate information.\n           Sincerely,\n     Melvin R. Brown,\n       Speaker.\n     R. Lane Beattie,\n       President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    The Truth About Utah Wilderness\n\n                                                   March 22, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: You recently received a letter dated March \n     15, 1996 from a group of twenty calling themselves ``The \n     Coalition of Utah Elected Officials,'' asking the ``Utah \n     Congressional Delegation to withdraw S. 884 and reconsider \n     the direction they have taken on wilderness.'' The letter \n     states that ``most Utahns oppose S. 884.'' It further states \n     that ``most local people consider this to be stridently anti-\n     environmental legislation, not the carefully balanced package \n     the Utah Congressional Delegation has been claiming it to \n     be.''\n       These statements are not only preposterous, but blatantly \n     untrue. The facts are that most Utahns do not want large \n     amounts of acreage designated as wilderness in Utah. We the \n     undersigned Democrats and Republicans strongly support \n     Senator's Hatch and Bennett in their balanced approach to \n     Utah wilderness.\n       In reality, the Utah State Senate endorsed the provisions \n     contained in the Hatch-Bennett proposal unanimously (27-0), \n     while the Utah State House voted 62-6, or 92% in favor. \n     Across the state, elected commissioners in 27 of 29 counties \n     support this bill. As this letter indicates, over 90% of \n     Utah's elected county leaders support the Utah wilderness \n     proposal now before the Senate.\n       Early in 1995, the Governor of Utah and all members of the \n     Utah Congressional Delegation specifically tasked the elected \n     county officials in each county where wilderness was being \n     proposed, to hold public hearings and from those public \n     hearings, develop a proposal for wilderness designation on \n     Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Lands in the affected \n     counties. Numerous public hearings were held in every county \n     where lands were proposed for wilderness designation. The \n     country officials then developed their proposals for \n     designating lands as wilderness from the public hearings. In \n     every county where lands were proposed for wilderness \n     designation, the county officials made their recommendations \n     based on what they heard at the hearings. Many county \n     officials recommended more acreage than they knew their \n     citizens wanted, but they knew they had to do so in order to \n     make a bill acceptable to Congress. Some of those county \n     officials have paid a dear political price for their \n     recommendations.\n\n[[Page S2748]]\n\n       After the county officials made their recommendations, the \n     Governor and Congressional Delegation, held five regional \n     hearings around the state. The environmental community, both \n     in and outside of Utah was well organized and paid its \n     partisans to testify. They even rented busses and vans to \n     transport these people from location to location. The \n     testimony they gave was based on emotion and not the \n     requirements of the Wilderness Act itself. Their testimony \n     ignored the professional recommendations of the BLM which \n     based its proposals on the criteria of the 1964 Wilderness \n     Act.\n       The Governor and Congressional Delegation then developed \n     what is now Title XX of omnibus package, S. 884. Many in Utah \n     believe it contains too much acreage. It represents more than \n     was recommended by the elected county officials who held the \n     local public hearings. It represents more than the State \n     Legislature has recommended at least twice in the last four \n     years by nearly unanimous votes.\n       The people of Utah live in a state with approximately 67% \n     federal land ownership and another 13% state ownership, but \n     managed under the federally enacted State Enabling Act. Utah \n     already has millions of acres in Five National Parks, two \n     National Recreation Areas, four National Monuments, thirteen \n     Forest Service wilderness areas, and BLM Areas of Critical \n     Environmental Concern (ACEC). The unelected State Director of \n     the BLM manages more of Utah than does its elected Governor.\n       The BLM wilderness debate in Utah has dragged on for more \n     than 15 years at a cost to taxpayers of over $10 million. We \n     believe it is time to end the debate, pass the balanced \n     Hatch-Bennett proposal and bring some peace and stability to \n     the people of Utah who must live daily with results of this \n     debate. We the undersigned are a few of the elected officials \n     in Utah who support Title XX of this omnibus bill. We want it \n     passed and enacted into law.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Hansen, Millard County Auditor; Linda Carter, \n           Millard County Recorder; Ed Phillips, Millard County \n           Sheriff; LeRay Jackson, Millard County Attorney; John \n           Henrie, Millard County Commissioner; Donovan Dafoe, \n           Mayor, Delta Utah; Merrill Nielson, Mayor, Lynndyl, \n           Utah; Phil Lovell, Mayor, Leamington, Utah; B.

and additionally, \n     because designation of wilderness lands is a federal action, \n     that federal funds be appropriated to pay for appraisals of \n     state lands and federal lands to be exchanged;\n       (5) that every effort be made to ensure that there be no \n     net loss of state or private lands and no increase in federal \n     ownship as a result of wilderness designation in Utah;\n       (6) that the designation of wilderness not result in the \n     creation, either formally or informally, of buffer zones and \n     management zones around, contiguous, or on lands affected by \n     wilderness designation;\n       (7) that all valid existing rights and historical uses be \n     allowed to be fully exercised\n\n[[Page S2750]]\n\n     without undue restriction or economic hardship on lands \n     designated as wilderness as provided in the Wilderness Act of \n     1964; and\n       (8) that management of vegetation, reservoirs, and similar \n     facilities on watershed lands designated as wilderness be \n     continued by state or private means.\n       Be it further Resolved that the Legislature and the \n     Governor conclude that elected country officials, after \n     extensive public input, should develop the wilderness \n     proposals and the conditions for acceptable designation of \n     wilderness lands within their respective counties, with the \n     aggregate of those respective county recommendations \n     constituting the basis of the state proposal for BLM \n     wilderness designation in Utah. The county officials should \n     be consulted regarding any changes to their respective county \n     recommendations.\n       Be it further Resolved that copies of this resolution be \n     sent to President Clinton, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives the \n     Secretary of the Interior, the directors of both the state \n     and federal offices of the Bureau of Land Management, and \n     Utah' congressional delegation.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, over 93 percent of the State \nlegislators and county elected officials in Utah did not misread public \nopinion at home. If we were talking about New Jersey, the Senator's \nState, and Federal elected Representatives took the identical stance in \nsupport of their constituency, my good friend from New Jersey would \noccupy the Senate floor for the next month defending their rights, and \nI would admire that, against the intervention of a Senator from another \nState who represents only a few special interests.\n  So let us keep this in perspective, Mr. President. New Jersey has \n10,341 acres of wilderness, Arkansas has 127,000, and Utah, with this \nprovision, will have 2.8 million acres of wilderness.\n  Further, reference has been made by the Senator from New Jersey in a \npress statement dated March 22 saying that ``20 million acres of Utah \nlands can never be designated as wilderness in the future.''\n  He then goes on to say: ``If it becomes law, it would permit the \ntransformation of these lands from wilderness to strip mines, roads and \ncommercial development.''\n  Come on, Mr. President. These statements are scare tactics. They are \nuntrue. They are unrealistic. Congress, as the Senator from New Jersey \nknows, can at any time revisit this issue and designate additional \nwilderness. The field professionals after 15 years of study, review and \ncourt cases, found that 20 million acres do not meet the strict \ndefinition of wilderness. Under the act, these lands are not wilderness \nbut many do qualify under other designations. The BLM is already using \nother management schemes on much of this acreage, including designated \nareas of critical environmental concerns, outstanding natural areas, \nnatural landmarks, research, national areas, wild and scenic rivers, \nnational trails, primitive areas, visual resources, management class 1 \nareas, and each of these designations offer a host of protected \nmeasures.\n  To suggest that the residents of and visitors to Utah will desecrate \nthese lands or to imply that the Federal managers will turn their eyes \nwhen this destruction descends upon us is simply a gross exaggeration \nof facts. One only has to visit Utah, view the lands, look at the \nnational parks and the forests and the State lands that have been set \naside to know that they care about their resources. They were \nprotecting these lands long before the elitists arrived on the scene. \nFor those lands which might be developed, and there will be some, there \nare additional protections.\n  To suggest the enactment of this bill would destroy 20 million acres \ncontributes little fact to this debate and only brings it up to a \nhysteric level. The list of Federal laws and State laws I previously \nsubmitted for the Record still must be complied with. If these lands \nwill not afford protection, why do we have them?\n  Further, much has been made of the holds on this legislation and the \nconsequences associated therewith. I have worked with my good friend \nfrom New Jersey from time to time, and we have reached accords from \ntime to time, not necessarily all the time by any means. But I noticed \na ``Dear Colleague'' the Senator from New Jersey sent around was joined \nby some 17 Members of this body, and it stated:\n\n       Many of us have provisions important to our respective \n     States within the omnibus parks legislation.\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       They need to be uncoupled from the Utah wilderness \n     provision.\n\n  The majority of these bills were placed on the calendar of the Senate \non April 7, 1995, almost a year ago. They have been on the calendar \nalmost a year. The Senator from New Jersey could have let these \nenvironmental bills, land bills, make their way to the House and to the \nPresident months ago. Unfortunately, for reasons of his own, he chose \nnot to do so. The direct result of those actions is this package. The \nSenator from New Jersey, by his own actions, is the ghost writer of \nthis bill that we are considering. So as we look at where to finger the \ndelay and why there is a package, I think we should ask the Senator \nfrom New Jersey to explain why he would put a hold on virtually every \nbill of this nature coming through the process starting back to when it \nwas introduced and placed on the calendar in 1995.\n  I have accommodated many times the Senator from New Jersey on \ninterests of his, certainly on the Sterling Forest, a bill, I might \nadd, that is not totally without some controversy, and, in my opinion, \nthere is reason that he should attempt to accommodate others. When this \nbill passes, Mr. President, Americans will get 2 million acres of new \nwilderness, and there is nothing in this legislation that will prevent \nanother Congress from adding additional lands in Utah to the wilderness \ninventory.\n  I think it is appropriate that we take this discussion a little \nfurther and find out just who and what and why this onslaught of well-\nfinanced propaganda by a small group of elitists in opposition to this \nbill. This has come up in the forms of expensive full-page ads, calls \nfrom telephone banks, multicolored brochures, posters, a raft of letter \nwriting campaigns.\n\n  There was an editorial from the San Francisco Examiner, one example, \nsuggesting that I am the guy who caused the Presidio bill to be held \nhostage and added on the riders.\n  I am not the guy, Mr. President. It suggested that this bill is a \nChristmas tree of special goodies, including, the inference was, \nopening up ANWR, the Alaska Arctic oil reserve. This bill does not have \nanything to do with Alaskan oil. It is not even mentioned in the bill \nand the San Francisco Examiner should know that. But they chose to make \nan issue and draw a parallel, when none existed. I think that is \nirresponsible reporting.\n  I am attempting to get these bills moving in the direction of the \nWhite House. Without this effort, the Presidio will not pass Congress. \nIt needs to be passed, as do other titles, and they are all important \nto our colleagues. That is just the hard, cold fact existing on the \nother side, the House side.\n  There is a small group of elitists, self-anointed saviors of the \nWest, perhaps the Senator from New Jersey is among them, who would \nprefer to see the entire package of noncontroversial, needed measures \nsimply choked together, because they do not want to see 2 million acres \nadded to the Nation's wilderness inventory. They want 5 million acres, \n6 million acres, or nothing.\n  Environmentalism is big business. I am going to show some charts \nhere, to show just how big it is. The campaigns of this big business \nenterprise, the environmental lobby, are well financed, well staffed. \nThey attach themselves rapidly to any issue that expands more \nmembership, will raise more money for their coffers. They almost \nconsume their causes. I am not suggesting the causes are not \nmeritorious in many cases. But, by the same token, I do want to point \nout the significance of just how large these organizations have become \nand why they would dwell on an issue such as Utah wilderness.\n  Here we have environmental organizations, their revenues, their \nexpenses, their assets, and the fund balances. These are the 12 major \nenvironmental organizations in the United States. There are more. I am \nnot suggesting this is the entire list. We have the Nature \nConservancy--these figures are as of fiscal 1993. I suspect they are \nhigher now. These are the last figures we were able to generate. If you \nlook at the revenue generated--$278 million; expenses, $219 million; \nassets, basically what they own, $915 million; and fund balances, $855 \nmillion.\n\n[[Page S2751]]\n\n  Then you go to the National Wildlife Federation. Let us just look at \nthe fund balances: $13 million; World Wildlife Fund, $39 million; \nGreenpeace, $23 million; Sierra Club, $14 million; the Sierra Club \nLegal Defense Fund, $5.9 million; National Audubon Society, $61 \nmillion; Environmental Defense Fund, $5 million; Natural Resources \nDefense Council, $11 million; Wilderness Society, $4 million; National \nParks and Conservation Association, $769,000; Friends of the Earth, \nthey are not doing too well looks like; Izaak Walton League of America, \n$414,000.\n  If we just look these up we will get an idea of the significance of \nthese groups, in their totality. The revenue, $633 million; expenses, \nthey expend about $556 million. Their assets, what they own, $1.2 \nbillion. That would be among the Fortune 500. Fund balances, over $1 \nbillion.\n  Let us look at some of the salaries paid, because I think, here \nagain, this reflects on the significance that these groups are big \nbusiness. The Nature Conservancy, John Sawhill, this is, I believe, as \nof 1994, $185,000. I think the President's salary is somewhere in the \narea of a little over $200,000. So here we have salaries, the National \nWildlife Federation, Jay Hair, $242,000, more than the President of the \nUnited States; World Wildlife Fund, $185,000; Sierra Club Legal Defense \nFund, $106,000; Environmental Defense Fund, $193,000; National \nResources Defense Council, $145,000; National Parks and Conservation \nAssociation, $185,000.\n  I think these show, in detail, the significance of just how big the \nenvironmental communities' efforts and organizations have become.\n  Mr. President, I have another chart here. While staff is getting it, \nI want to amplify, again, the fact that these organizations need \nlegitimate causes. The question of how extreme, how far is there room \nfor compromise, is a legitimate question here. The State of Utah has \nproposed adding 2 million acres. But that is not enough, \nenvironmentalists want 5 or 6 million. They generate extreme reasons, \nin my opinion, inflammatory suggestions, suggesting that the residents \nof the State cannot be trusted, are irresponsible. I just do not buy \nthat. I think we have to recognize their legitimate contribution, and \nwhen they are off line and unrealistic, take them to task.\n  It is interesting to note the investments of these organizations. I \nwish I had a third chart to show, but I am going to have it printed in \nthe Record of investment summaries, the market value of these \norganizations as they invest in stocks, bonds. And I am also going to \nhave printed in the Record the benefits associated with the officers, \ndirectors, the salaries and wages, the pension plans and the other \nemployee benefits which clearly substantiate my claim that this is now \nbig business.\n  I am also going to have printed in the Record the major corporate \ncontributors to these organizations. In some cases that is rather \namusing, because we find a direct contrast between the objectives and \nefforts of some of the organizations and some of the donors who, you \nwould think, would have conflicting points of view. But I will leave \nthat up to them to explain.\n  So, I ask unanimous consent that a list of the major corporate \ncontributors, the officers' income, staff, wages and benefits, \nexecutive compensation, environmental organization incomes, and a list \nof the top 12 organizations, be printed in the Record from the report \nof the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise entitled, ``Getting \nRich, the Environmental Movement's Income, Salary, Contributor, and \nInvestment Patterns, With an Analysis of Land Trust Transfers of \nPrivate Land to Government Ownership.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise]\n\nGetting Rich--The Environmental Movement's Income, Salary, Contributor, \n and Investment Patterns, With an Analysis of Land Trust Transfers of \n                  Private Land to Government Ownership\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       The environmental movement is arguably the richest power \n     and pressure center in America. This report examines the \n     question, ``What is the public paying for with its money for \n     the environment?'' It profiles the twelve richest and best-\n     known environmental organizations in the United States, \n     including two subgroups, one within Greenpeace, one related \n     to the Sierra Club. It focuses on their internal finances, \n     how they spend the money the public gives them--usually a \n     well-guarded secret even though the law requires non-profit \n     organizations to make full public disclosure.\n       Simply put, where does the money go?\n       Certainly environmental group money goes to programs that \n     ``protect the environment from the ravages of humanity.'' \n     None of the twelve major groups and their subgroups examined \n     here fail to expend substantial funds on their publicly \n     announced programs.\n       However, none of the groups examined here announce the fat \n     salaries of their executives, the huge amounts paid for staff \n     wages and pensions, or the donations spent playing Wall \n     Street in professionally managed investment portfolios. And \n     few loudly advertise their gifts from large corporations.\n       In addition, many environmental groups have fallen under \n     control of the nation's richest private foundations. Private \n     foundations have forced their own social-change agendas on \n     many environmental organizations through ``grant driven \n     projects,'' with ominous implications for the unwitting \n     public.\n       This report also focuses on the most troublesome aspects of \n     a citizen movement grown powerful: the ability of wealthy \n     land trusts to funnel private property into the federal \n     government at prices above the approved appraised value, to \n     ``lowball'' prices paid to private owners based on inside \n     information provided by federal agencies, and to persuade \n     congressional allies to put their properties at the top of \n     the list for federal payments.\n\n\n                            acknowledgments\n\n       This report was sponsored by the Center for the Defense of \n     Free Enterprise, which is solely responsible for its content. \n     Ron Arnold, Executive Vice President, managing editor.

Andrus (d. 1934., whose \n     businesses included gold, oil, timber, and real estate. \n     Surdna is Andrus spelled backward. About half of its annual \n     grants go to two programs: Community Revitalization and the \n     Environment.\n       Documents show that Surdna Foundation, as part of an \n     investment portfolio of $338,074,279 in assets, owns and \n     operates approximately 75,000 acres of timberlands in \n     Northern California. Andrus timber partners also own and \n     operate approximately 90,000 acres of timberlands in Northern \n     California. Frederick F. Moon III is a director of both \n     Surdna Foundation and Andrus timber partners. According to \n     federal tax forms, Surdna Foundation realized $2.7 million \n     income from timber in 1992-93.\n       Documents show that Surdna Foundation made contributions of \n     $35,000 to Environment Now, an environmental organization \n     that held training seminars teaching activists group leaders \n     how to file appeals to stop federal timber harvest plans. \n     Surdna Foundation grant recipients known to have filed Timber \n     Harvest Plan appeals include Sierra Club ($90,000), Oregon \n     Natural Resources Council, Wilderness Society ($325,000), \n     Western Ancient Forest Campaign ($175,000), Audubon Society \n     ($100,000), and Natural Resources Defense Council ($557,000), \n     stopping timber harvests and log supplies to mills in the \n     Sierra Nevada market area. Thirty-six sawmills in Northern \n     California have shut down because of log shortages since \n     1990, rendering 8,000 unemployed. As a result, timber prices \n     on Surdna Foundation's private lands have increased \n     dramatically. Some of the Timber Harvest Plans that were \n     appealed lie in the same watershed as the timberlands owned \n     by Surdna Foundation and Andrus timber partners, yet no \n     appeals were filed on the State Timber Harvest Plans \n     submitted by Surdna Foundation under California law.\n       The sequence of events of Surdna Foundation's grantmaking \n     history shows that they made no grants to groups involved in \n     restricting federal timber supplies in Northern California \n     during 1987-88; during 1988-89 they made a grant to The \n     Nature Conservancy; in 1989-90, grants went to Conservation \n     Law Foundation, 1000 Friends of Oregon. Natural Resources \n     Defense Council, Project LightHawk, Sierra Club, Wilderness \n     Society and Western Ancient Forest Campaign; during 1991-92, \n     grants went to Americans for the Ancient Forest, National \n     Audubon Society, Environment Now, Conservation Law \n     Foundation, Natural Resources Defense Council, Oregon Natural \n     Resources Council, Eco Trust, 1000 Friends of Oregon, Western \n     Ancient Forest Campaign, and the Wilderness Society.\n       Two Northern California residents filed numerous Timber \n     Harvest Plan appeals on behalf of several groups, and also \n     occupied leadership positions: Linda Blum, leader positions: \n     Western Ancient Forest Campaign; Tulare Audubon Society; \n     Friends of Plumas; Sierra Nevada Alliance; and Wilderness \n     Society. Erin Noel, leader positions; Western Ancient Forest \n     Campaign; Friends of Plumas; Sierra Nevada Issues Group.\n       During 1992-93 Surdna Foundation realized $2.7 million \n     income from its Northern California timberlands.\n       A substantial effort to control major non-profit \n     environmental organizations through\n\n[[Page S2758]]\n\n     the power of the purse was discussed in the 1992 annual \n     retreat of the:\n       Environmental Grantmakers Association (Founded 1985).\n       Budget: $40,000.\n       Staff: 1, operated by Rockefeller Family fund dba EGA, 1290 \n     Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10104.

The annual retreats are \n     strategy planning sessions during which grantmakers lay their \n     plans for the coming year. The following dialog was \n     transcribed verbatim from tapes of a session titled \n     ``Environmental Legislation.'' Ed Skloot and Hooper Brooks of \n     Surdna Foundation spoke during this panel.\n       Anne Fitzgerald: Do you detect, though, a resistance in the \n     larger organizations to becoming grant driven?\n       Donald Ross [Rockefeller Family Fund]: Yeah. I think a lot \n     of them resist.\n       Chuck Clusen [American Conservation Association]: A number \n     of us have been involved in this, Anne. Yeah. There's \n     definitely a feeling on the part of the not-for-profit \n     organizations that in cases of some of the campaigns like the \n     Ancient Forests Campaign that they resent funders, not just \n     picking the issues, but also being directive in the sense of \n     the kind of campaign, the strategy, the style, and so on. I \n     guess, coming out of the advocacy world, and having spent \n     most of my career doing it, I look at it as, if they're not \n     going to do it on their own, thank God funders are forcing \n     them to start doing it. . . .\n       Donald Ross: I think that there are things that could be \n     done. I think funders have a major role to play. And I know \n     there are resentments in the community towards funders doing \n     that. And, too bad. We're players, they're players.\n       But I think we touched on a lot of problems, the internal \n     problems within these big groups, the warring factions within \n     them who are all trying to get resources, and there's too \n     many groups and too few resources, and all that. I think the \n     fundamental effort that has to be made is a reorganization of \n     the movement, whether you're talking--I don't think it's \n     realistic to think that groups like Sierra Club or NRDC are \n     going to disappear and reform into something new. They'll \n     stay, and they'll still send out those newsletters. I think \n     we have to begin to look much more at a task force approach \n     on major issues that is able to pool. And the funders can \n     drive that. And part of the reason these groups have been \n     resistant to work with each other is precisely because they \n     want the credit, they want the name, so they can get more \n     funding, either from us--from foundations--or from members.\n       And I think there isn't one of them, even the biggest, \n     National Wildlife, or Audubon or Sierra Club, that has the \n     capacity to wage full scale battles on major issues by \n     themselves. They don't have the media, lobbying, grass roots \n     organizing, Washington base, etc., litigation, all wrapped in \n     one organization.\n       And so the trick, I think, is to figure out how we can \n     duplicate some of the early successes like the Alaska lands \n     fight that you were involved in, Chuck, back in--or this \n     transportation one. I think it can be, where funders can play \n     a real role is helping, is using the money to drive, to \n     create ad hoc efforts in many cases that will have a \n     litigation component coming from one group, a lobbying \n     component coming from another group, a grass roots organizing \n     component coming from yet a third group with a structure that \n     enables them to function well.\n       Individual audio tapes of all 1992 EGA retreat sessions can \n     be purchased for $11.00 each from Conference Recording \n     Service, 1308 Gilman Street, Berkeley, California 94706, \n     Phone: (510) 527-3600, Fax: (510) 527-8404.

These land trusts commonly buy property \n     from individual private owners with the understanding that \n     the land will be kept in trust for environmental purposes by \n     the non-profit purchaser. Many non-profit land trusts, in \n     addition to keeping these private purchases in private \n     trusts, also sell purchased private land to government \n     agencies.\n       Many individual private land owners have complained about \n     non-profit land trust practices and cite numerous abuses that \n     should receive congressional scrutiny and wide public \n     attention. The most commonly cited abuses are:\n       Failure to advise the individual private seller that his or \n     her land will in turn be sold to a government agency.\n       Individual land owners are underpaid by non-profit trusts.\n       Individual land owners are not advised that they may sell \n     directly to the government.\n       Non-profit land trusts receive inside information from \n     government agencies about ``approved appraised value'' of \n     individual privately owned parcels in advance of purchase, \n     promoting underpayment.\n       Government agencies secretly request non-profit land trusts \n     to buy desired properties and hold them until congressional \n     appropriations are available to pay for government purchase.\n       Government agencies pay non-profit land trusts prices \n     ``above approved appraised value.''\n       Government agencies pay non-profit land trusts additional \n     ``carrying costs'' including interest, travel, telephone, \n     postage, appraisal and survey costs, title premiums, closing \n     costs, property taxes owed, and overhead.\n       Non-profit land trusts commonly retain all mineral rights \n     and gas and oil rights to properties they sell to the \n     government.\n       Government agency employees who have arranged favorable \n     purchases for non-profit land trusts for years then accept \n     employment by those non-profit land trusts often takes the \n     property off the tax rolls, harming local and country \n     government revenues.\n       Sales of non-profit land trust property to government \n     centralizes power and feeds an insatiable appetite for more \n     private property to be nationalized.\n       Non-profit land trusts keep their government sales quiet \n     and refuse to release details of individual transactions in \n     progress or completed.\n       Government agencies refuse to release details of land \n     transactions in progress or completed with nonprofit land \n     trusts, claiming private sales to government are exempt from \n     the Freedom of Information Act.\n       Non-profit land trusts justify their secret complicity with \n     government agencies by pointing out that it is not illegal, \n     setting a standard of behavior of merely avoiding \n     prosecution.\n       Non-profit land trusts use their reputations to purchase \n     private property for conservation purposes and then convert \n     it to ``trade lands'' which are sold to developers at high \n     profits, using the justification that the funds will \n     eventually be plowed back into purchases of actual \n     conservation lands.\n       Non-profit land trusts advertise only their private land \n     activities, and do not provide the public with remedial \n     advertising openly describing their extensive land sales to \n     the government, thus leaving the public with a false \n     impression of their real operations.\n       Government agencies commonly whitewash their abuses in \n     reports written by government appointees formerly employed by \n     environmental organizations and still loyal to those private \n     non-profit organizations.\n\n\n                            Bait and Switch\n\n       The Bait: This charming Nature Conservancy ad with its \n     appealing tag line, ``Conservation Through Private Action''.\n\n  ``We Get a Good Return on Our Investment. ``The Nature Conservancy \ntakes a business approach to protecting our natural world.

Other sources include \n     financial statements prepared by the environmental \n     organizations and provided to the Secretary of State of New \n     York, the Division of Consumer Affairs of the Commonwealth of \n     Virginia and the Attorney General's Office of the State of \n     California. Lists of investments were obtained from both of \n     these sources, or from California Attorney General's Office \n     filings on Form CT-2. Many organizations do not file their \n     list of investments with any public agency. In such cases, \n     the authors of this report requested such lists by telephone \n     directly from the environmental organization in question. All \n     organizations thus solicited for investment information \n     refused to divulge it.\n       Information on Foundation Control of Environmental Groups \n     came from tape recorded discussions among foundation staff \n     and officers at the Environmental Grantmakers Association \n     1992 Annual Retreat at Rosario Resort in Washington State. \n     Documentation of the Surdna Instance came from U.S. Forest \n     Service timber harvest plans, Form 990 filings, California \n     state filings, and internal documents discovered in public \n     filings.\n       Major documentation of Non-Profit Land Trust abuses was \n     obtained from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service through the \n     Freedom Of Information Act. Additional documentation was \n     obtained from individual land owners in personal interviews \n     or through third-party correspondents.\n       The Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise is the sole \n     author of this report, and is solely responsible for the \n     accuracy of the data here presented.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as I indicated, out of necessity, these \norganizations have to consume their causes, and Utah wilderness \ncurrently is one of their causes. We have seen their efforts in mining \nreform, just last week in grazing reform, and the week before the \nforest issue. Now they have turned their efforts to Utah wilderness.\n  I do not mind constructive input. It is invaluable in the development \nof quality legislation. It is good for everyone, but this type of big \nbusiness, well-financed campaigns that they establish are really not \nconstructive. It is a case of ``We're going to protect you from \nyourselves whether it is good for you or not, but we're going to do it \nat your own expense.''\n  Mr. President, I think it is time to get real.\n  I would like to chat a little bit about Sterling Forest, because \nwhile I support the proposal of my friend from New Jersey, it is not \nwithout some exceptions. The purpose of title XVI is to authorize the \nSecretary of the Interior to provide funding to the Palisades \nInterstate Park Commission in order to facilitate the acquisition of \nthe Sterling Forest in New York. I am not sure what the status is, but \nI am sure my friend from New Jersey will tell us, if this bill goes \nthrough, in what status that land will be held.\n  The 17.5 million dollars authorized by this legislation states that \nfunds may be transferred to the commission only to the extent that they \nare matched with funds contributed by non-Federal sources. So the State \nof New York and the State of New Jersey are going to have to, \nobviously, contribute funds.\n  The funds may only be used for the procurement of conservation \neasements along--this is where it gets interesting, Mr. President--\nalong the Appalachian Trail. That is National Park Service administered \nbut privately owned which runs through the Sterling Forest but not in \nthe same watershed that they are currently trying to protect.\n  So, it is interesting to pick up that difference. In actuality, \nscarce Federal appropriated funds are being used to trigger the flow of \nappropriated funds from New York and New Jersey. While the protection \nof the States' watershed may be meritorious, there are higher \npriorities currently within the National Park Service that need to be \naddressed.\n  Notwithstanding my concerns, the Senator from New Jersey was \naccommodated, and I support his efforts in this regard because I \nrecognize that he is from that State, he is held responsible by his \nconstituents, and he ought to know what is best for his State and, as a \nconsequence, I am going to support the Sterling Forest, as I have \nindicated to him. But it is technically not just a home run or a couple \nof free throws. The Federal funds may only be used for the procurement \nof conservation easements along the Appalachian Trail, which is Park \nService administered but privately owned, which runs through the \nSterling Forest but not in the same watershed that they are trying to \nprotect.\n  So, Mr. President, we have a situation before us where this is really \nnot a debate about the merit of adding 2 million acres of new \nwilderness to the national inventory. This is really a battle between \nsome of the well-financed elitists and the people who live in the State \nof Utah.\n  Would the world be better off with 2 million acres of wilderness? I \nbelieve it would. Would we be better off with an additional 3 million \nacres that did not meet the definition of wilderness? I think not.\n  Unfortunately, the playing field does not happen to be level. We find \nourselves being tied up by a group of elitists. This debate is really a \ndifference of opinion between the well-financed elitist lobby who wants \nall or nothing and the rest of us who are looking for resource \nprotection and balance and trying to represent the people of the \naffected States.\n  As I have indicated and the chart shows, this is a well-financed \nlobby. Environmentalism is big business, as the chart shows, and, as a \nconsequence, it does show that environmental money does go for the \npurpose of protecting the environment, while at the same time it shows \nthat little goes to achieve balance, compromise or resolution.\n\n  As I have indicated, the environmental community does need a cause \nfor additional membership, for added dollars. As I have indicated, this \nweek it is Utah wilderness, last week it was grazing, before that \ntimber.\n\n[[Page S2761]]\n\n  Let me reflect, finally, on how the people of Utah, as they look to \nthe future of their State--a relatively large Western State, 52 million \nacres of land--proposes to increase the wilderness by some 2 million \nacres, increasing that to a special classification of wilderness which \nwould be BLM wilderness of 2 million acres and Forest Service \nwilderness of 800,000 acres.\n  The overwhelming base of support, as evidenced by the statements from \nthose in Utah, and the realization that here we are with a package that \ncan meet its objective in adding wilderness to Utah, that can meet its \nobjective with regard to the concerns of my friend from New Jersey, \nwho, at least to this Senator, has established himself as perhaps the \nself-anointed savior of the West, but, again, I ask, who does he really \nrepresent with regard to this issue? Is it the big environmental groups \nthat have no compassion, no understanding, no willingness to negotiate \na reasonable settlement that has been identified time and time again as \nbeing in the interest of the people? And is this a continued attack on \nresource development on public land, whether it be grazing, timber, or \nmining? Is it going to be concessions next? Is this the attitude \nprevailing from this administration?\n  As we look at resource development in this country, we recognize that \nwe are exporting dollars, we are exporting jobs overseas, and as we \ndepend more and more on imports, our current balance-of-payment deficit \nis half of the cost of imported oil. Fifty-four percent of our oil is \nnow imported. We are increasing our timber and wood fiber imports. We \nare losing high-paying, blue-collar jobs. Can we not, through science \nand technology, continue to develop our resources in a responsible \nmanner? That is what the people of Utah are talking about, relative to \nthe additional acreage that they want to use for their school system, \nfor the education of their children.\n  It seems to me that we should listen to the people of Utah today, Mr. \nPresident. They are not extreme. They are not elitists. They are \nrealists. They know what they need for their State. They have \nrecommended 2 million acres of wilderness. It is a responsible \ncompromise.\n  So, Mr. President, as we go through this debate throughout the day, \nand perhaps a portion tomorrow, I encourage all Members to look at this \npackage, recognize it for what it is, an attempt to accommodate some 17 \nor 18, close to 20 States, with individual recommendations on land \nwithin their States, recognizing the significance of including the \nPresidio in this package and the realization that the trust that has \nbeen formed to manage the Presidio under the scope of this legislation \nis realistic, it will work, it will take the burden off of the Federal \nGovernment. Last, this legislation will meet the needs of the people of \nUtah.\n\n\n                  Modifications to Amendment No. 3564\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send a modification of my amendment \nto the desk. I ask that each of the measures be added at the \nappropriate place, and the titles and section numbers be renumbered \naccordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it would add provisions for the Big \nThicket in Texas, the Big Horn County school district in Wyoming, a \nright-of-way in Wyoming, the Tallgrass provisions in Kansas. I think \nthat takes it up to nearly 60, Mr. President. I do not think further \nreading is required.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The modifications follow:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n                                TITLE --\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I have concluded my remarks. I think \nthe Senator from New Jersey may want to be heard from. If not, there \nare a couple more of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska for his statement, and I thank the distinguished Senators from \nUtah for their strong advocacy of one of the provisions in this bill. I \nknow how much they care about this legislation. I know how long they \nhave worked on it. We have a basic disagreement, which I will try to \nexplore in as much depth as I can for the next--I do not know how long \nit will take, but I want to do it with comprehensive explanations so \nthey can then respond to what I have said.\n  I would only make one point with regard to this bill as a package. As \none Senator, I am prepared to have virtually every one of the 33 \ntitles, maybe with 2 or 3 exceptions, moved through the Senate right \nnow. I do not oppose those sections. What I have a problem with is the \nUtah wilderness bill, which I will get to, to explain. So I want the \nSenate to know that all of the other provisions in this bill I have no \nobjection to passing today on voice vote with the exception of two or \nthree, maybe four maximum, of the titles in the underlying bill.\n  It is clearly the chairman's prerogative to put these together in a \npackage. I am not sure, if I were someone who was interested in a \nparticular provision--I might say that this bill has several provisions \nthat I want for my State--that it would be the wisest course if the \nPresident actually does veto this package. We could get down several \nmonths only to find that the President has vetoed not only Utah land, \nthe wilderness bill, but he has vetoed all of the other smaller \nprovisions that are totally noncontroversial that could move through \nthe Senate today and, in some cases, through the House easily.\n  I think that ought to be established. I think the wiser course here \nwould be to detach from this package the Utah wilderness bill and to \nhave some more time to talk about that, and then move the other \nelements of this bill. I know there are a number of Senators who are \ninterested in their particular provisions. I have no objection to \nmoving them.\n  What I would like to do if I could this morning is take my time to \nreally talk a little bit about the history of public lands. I would \nlike to focus on Federal lands in the United States and in Utah. I \nwould like to focus on the economic development pressures in Utah. I \nwould like to talk about sustainable development. I would like to put \nthis bill in the context of how we got here, and how the bill does in \nrelation to the concept of sustainable development. Then I would like \nto talk about the effect on the rest of the country, and why I think \nthat the Utah wilderness bill is clearly a national bill in a very, \nvery deep sense. I say that with great respect for the knowledge and \nthe commitment of the Senators from Utah, whom I know care as deeply \nabout their State as any Senator in this body cares about his or her \nown State. So I make these comments with respect for them and at the \nsame time with a very profound disagreement.\n\n  Mr. President, the idea that America has public land, public \npatrimony that belongs to all of us, really began in 1778, when the \nsmall State of Maryland led a protest against those States that had \nmade vast claims of territory west of the Appalachian Mountains, our \noriginal frontier.\n  Under their royal charters, Virginia had laid claim to territory \nreaching to the Mississippi and up to what is now Michigan, and \nMassachusetts claimed much of what remained in the then United States. \nThe Senators, Congressmen, the statesmen from Maryland had a different \nidea. They said that the land, which was the defining feature of the \nnew Nation, should be owned and used in common. And Maryland refused to \nsign the Articles of Confederation until this idea of common land won \nrespect.\n  By 1802, the young Nation had taken 233 million acres for the public \ngood between the Thirteen Colonies and the Mississippi River, and with \nthe Louisiana Purchase, and over the next 51 years, the common domain \ngrew to more than 1.4 billion acres of public land. While the Nation \ncame together around Maryland's idea of public land, the question of \nwhat to do with it remained.\n  The fundamental conflict between divisions expressed by Thomas \nJefferson and Alexander Hamilton dominated this debate, as it did so \nmany others. Jefferson believed that land should be put in the hands of \nsmall farmers even if it meant giving it away, while Hamilton believed \nthat land sales could be the steadiest source of income for the Nation.\n  With the oppressive debt from the Revolutionary War, the Hamilton \nview prevailed. And the principle for most of the first half of the \n19th century was that ``lands were to be sold, and the proceeds \nappropriated toward shrinking or discharging the debts.'' That was a \nquote. But the land being what it is,\n\n[[Page S2764]]\n\nJefferson was also correct in his prediction that Americans looking for \nopen space ``would settle the lands in spite of everybody.''\n  Land sales never made up more than 10 percent of the Federal revenue \nbecause people simply laid claim to the lands, moved onto the lands. \nWith the passage of the Preemption Act of 1841, the Jeffersonian view \nprevailed, giving the land away, in hope that it would extend across \nthe continent a nation of small farmers.\n\n  The Homestead Act followed in the 1860's with its promise of 160 \nacres for a family, a blessing in the fertile ground of the Great \nPlains--160 acres. Beyond the 100th meridian, the north-south line \nrunning roughly from Minot, ND, to Laredo, TX, the 160 acres was almost \nuseless. As Senator William Borah said of the Homestead Act, ``The \nGovernment bets 160 acres against the filing fee that the settlers \ncannot live on the land for 5 years without starving to death.'' \nIndeed, only 35 percent of the claims ever lived up to full ownership, \nwith the rest left to be assembled in very large parcels.\n  Just as selling the land did not fulfill Hamilton's vision, giving it \naway did not live up to Jefferson's vision of a country of independent, \nself-sufficient young farmers passing their modest legacy of land from \ngeneration to generation, renewing themselves by tilling the land. \nNeither vision, the sale of the land nor giving it away, really lived \nup to either of the Founders' idea.\n  Instead, mining interests laid the first claim to the land. Every \nsingle major mining strike in the history of the West--gold in \nCalifornia, Colorado, and Montana, silver in Idaho, Nevada--was made on \npublic land. Then ranchers who had quickly exhausted the capacity of \nthe public land of the high plains, moved West, taking vast acreage of \nthin, fragile grassland in the northern range and fencing it in to keep \nhomesteaders out.\n  Mr. President, about this time Americans finally began to really look \nat their land. The reports of the great surveyors, Ferdinand V. Hayden, \nGeorge M. Wheeler, and John Wesley Powell, these reports came East, \nalong with the photographs of William Henry Jackson and the paintings \nof Thomas Moran. Tales of great geysers and Powell's vivid descriptions \nof a canyon opening like a beautiful portal to a region of glory led to \na popular campaign to protect something of this legacy.\n  The creation of Yellowstone National Park, the first national park, \nin 1872, was a moment of great national pride. The truer reflection of \nour view toward our national lands, our public lands, in that same year \nwas the passage of the General Mining Act of 1872, setting fees of \n$2.50 an acre for a permanent mining claim, an error at the time and an \noutdated disgrace today.\n  As the new century approached, the parks movement accelerated and the \ncountry finally escaped the old question, ``Should we sell it or should \nwe give it away?'' In 1891, the National Forest System was created. By \n1907, nearly 10 percent of the Nation's land had been rescued from the \ncycle of transfer and destruction. The great barbecue, as the historian \nC. Vernon Parrington called the abuse of the land in the 19th century, \nhad come to an end, but the struggle had really only begun.\n  Miners, ranchers, farmers, and timber interests began a long fight to \nreclaim the unlimited gold, silver, copper, grasslands, water, and tall \ntrees which had been given away for so long that they had convinced \nthemselves that they had earned them. In Charles Wilkinson's phrase, \nthe ``Lords of Yesterday,'' the interests and ideas that pull us back \ntoward the 19th century, grew and grew in Washington, especially after \nTheodore Roosevelt left the White House and Gifford Pinchot left the \nInterior Department.\n  In 1920, the Mineral Leasing Act gave oil companies access to \npetroleum reserves on public lands, even national forests. But the \nTeapot Dome scandal led President Hoover to ban the oil reserves from \nexploitation. And the dust storms of the 1930's, which blackened the \nskies from New Mexico to the Dakotas as a result of overgrazing and \noverfarming, led to the passage of the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 which \nclosed 142 million acres of public land and was called ``the Magna \nCarta of conservation.'' The New Deal economist Rexford Tugwell \ndeclared ``the day on which the President signed the Taylor Act * * *. \nlaid in its grave a land policy which had long since been dead and \nwhich walked abroad only as a troublesome ghost within a living \nworld.''\n  Tugwell's analysis was seriously premature. The land policy of the \n19th century has not yet been buried. Indeed, it lives on in this bill, \nin the grazing bill, and in several others before this Congress in this \nyear.\n  The advocates of a return to the free-for-all of the past used their \npower in Congress and the appealing image of the brave, solitary \nwesterner--an image at odds with reality then and now--to lead the \nassault on this protective impulse to protect the land.\n  Senator Patrick McCarran of Nevada accused the Grazing Service of \nseeking ``to legislate the trailblazers of the West out of existence,'' \nand launched what one historian called ``the lengthiest, most \nconcerted, and in some respects, the most successful attempt made in \nthe 20th century by one person to force a reinterpretation of land \npolicy more in accordance with the wishes of the using interests.'' I \nrepeat, ``the using interests.''\n  McCarran succeeded in turning the bureaucracy in favor of the using \ninterests. He abolished the Grazing Service and merged it with another \nlarge agency, creating the Bureau of Land Management. The Bureau of \nLand Management was given so many responsibilities--leasing of oil, \ngas, coal, oil, shale, and geothermal sites. Management of hard rock \nmining claims on its own land, plus on the lands of the national \nforests, management of 8 million acres of commercial forests, wetlands \nand fishable streams, thousands of archaeological sites as well as \ngrazing, all of these responsibilities, so much given that McCarran and \nhis backers reasonably assumed that the agency would become \n``Unconvincing Goliath,'' in the words of Prof. Sally Fairfax.\n  By 1973, the BLM had plainly abandoned the task of protecting grazing \nlands from the next Dust Bowl. Only 16 percent of its rangeland was in \ngood condition. The 341 million acres managed by the BLM are often \ncalled the leftover lands or the lands nobody wanted. They are what \nremains of the 2.1 billion acres that had not been sold, given away, or \nset aside as national park or national forest.\n  The BLM does not have the clear sense of mission of the Forest \nService or the Park Service. Indeed, in the 1950's, its nickname was \nthe ``Bureau of Livestock and Mining.'' It gives a sense of what the \nAgency thought its lands were most valuable for in those days. Yet, \nthose lands include some of the most breathtaking and fragile places in \nthe Nation: The Potosi Mountains of Nevada; Glacier Peak in Washington; \nMount Lester in Wyoming; California's Lake Ediza; and in Utah, the \nValley of Dirty Devil, the Kaiparowits Plateau, Grand Staircase, \nEscalante Canyon, the Henry Mountains, and many others in the State of \nUtah. These are lands that if we sacrifice their quiet peace for a \nshort-term economic gain, it will be to the lasting regret--the lasting \nregret--of many Americans.\n  Let me just frame that by focusing on one of these areas. The \nKaiparowits Plateau in southern Utah, an extraordinary place, is one of \nthe most remote places in the United States. I would like to quote from \nwhat one person said about that. His name is Charles Wilkinson, a \nprofessor at the University of Colorado. He says:\n\n       Kaiparowits, the interior of the Colorado Plateau, itself \n     the interior of the nation, is not just for coal. Few people \n     come to this southern Utah plateau because modern \n     conveniences are so distant, traditional beauty so scarce, \n     normal recreational opportunities so limited. Precipitation \n     measures ten to twelve inches a year. There are just two or \n     three perennial streams, and they carry little water. One \n     dirt road, usable by passenger cars, runs up to Escalante. \n     Otherwise, it is all jeep trails. Pinon-juniper stands offer \n     almost no cover from the sun. Cross-country backpacking is \n     for experts only. You have to scour the topographic maps, \n     plan your trip with care (being sure to hit the springs), and \n     stock to your plan. Even a short hike is a challenge. From a \n     distance, Kaiparowits looks flat on top but in fact it is up-\n     and-down, chipped-up, confusing. You can get lost, snakebit, \n     or otherwise injured. There's no one to call.\n       Kaiparowits is, in a word, wild--``wilderness,'' as Raymond \n     Wheeler put it, ``right down to its burning core.'' Eagles, \n     hawks, and peregrines are in here, especially in the wind \n     currents near the cliffs, and so are bighorn sheep, trophy \n     elk, and deer. Archaelologists have recorded some 400 sites\n\n[[Page S2765]]\n\n     but there are many more--there has been lttle surveying, \n     except near some of the mine sites. From Kaiparowits you are \n     given startling Plateau vistas in all directions, vivid views \n     more than 200 miles if the winds have cleared out the haze, \n     views as encompassing as those from the southern tip of Cedar \n     Mesa, the east flank of Boulder Mountain, the high LeSals, \n     DeadHorse Point, long, stretching expanses of sacred country. \n     If you climb the rocky promontories on top of Kaiparowits, \n     you can see off to Boulder Mountain, the Henrys, Black Mesa, \n     Navajo Mountain, the Kaibab Plateau, the Vermilion Cliffs.\n       The languid stillness of Kaiparowits turns your mind gently \n     and slowly to wondering about time, to trying to comprehend \n     the long, deep time all of this took, from Cretaceous, from \n     back before Cretaceous, and to comprehend, since Lake Powell \n     and the seventy-story stacks of Navajo Generating Station \n     also now play part of the vista, how it is that our culture \n     has so much might and how it is that we choose to exert it so \n     frantically, with so little regard of the time that you can \n     see, actually see, from here. Perhaps somehow by taking some \n     moments now, here, here in this stark pinon-juniper rockland \n     place, here in this farthest-away place, a person can nurture \n     some of the fibers of constancy and constraint that our \n     people possess in addition to the might. The silence is \n     stunning, the solitude deep and textured.\n       Kaiparowits makes you decide on the value of wildness and \n     remoteness. Kaiparowits is where the dreams for the West \n     collide. Coal, jobs growth. Long vistas, places to get lost \n     in, places to find yourself in.\n       The BLM wild lands teach us, also, about the people who \n     once lived and worked and loved and worshipped for such a \n     long time in what has been called BLM land for such a short \n     time.\n       Last year, my son Seth, then twenty, and I took a long, \n     home-from-college trip to the canyon country. We hiked most \n     of one day up to our calves in a creek that over the course \n     of some seven million years has cut a thousand feet down \n     through the fiery, aeolian Wingate Sandstone and the layers \n     of rock above it.\n       In a rare wide spot in the canyon, behind a cluster of \n     junipers, we found a panel of pictographs on the Wingate. The \n     artisan painted this row of red and white images--\n     supernatural and life-size--two thousand years ago, perhaps \n     more. The three stolid figures had wide shoulders, narrow \n     waists. We could see straight through the round staring eyes, \n     and the eyes could see through us. We called it ``Dream \n     Panel.''\n       It would be so contemptuous of time to deal away \n     Kaiparowits and Dream Panel. Perhaps the states would protect \n     these and other wild places of national worth as well as they \n     are protected now. But do we want to risk it?\n\n  Mr. President, until the 1960's, none of the public lands were fully \nprotected for mining, automobiles, construction, and other uses. The \nconcept of wilderness did not exist, not only on the BLM lands, but \neven in the national parks and forests.\n  As a way of preserving public land, the idea of wilderness really \nowes its origin to Arthur Carhart, a landscape architect hired by the \nForest Service in 1919 and sent to design a road encircling Trappers \nLake in Colorado's San Isabel National Forest. Instead of laying out \nthe road, he bombarded his bureaucratic supervisors with memos urging \nthat they abandon the project and retain some area ``to which the lover \nof the outdoors can return without being confronted by a settlement, a \ncountry store, telephone pole, or other sights of civilization.'' After \nCarhart built a friendship and alliance with Aldo Leopold, the great \nnaturalist and author of ``A Sand County Almanac,'' the Forest Service \naccepted his idea and made Trappers Lake the first development project \nit had ever denied because of the threat to the natural integrity of \nthe land.\n  The legacy of Carhart and Leopold fell to Robert Marshall, a slightly \neccentric man, who during college decided to walk 30 miles in every \nState of the Union, covering that distance in a single day in each \nState. Once he covered 62 miles in a day. Well, Marshall joined the \nForest Service in 1930 and advocated not just protection of some land \nas wilderness, but the importance of sheer size--vast tracts of \nwilderness rather than small parks in every State. He compared \nwilderness to the ``Mona Lisa'' and he said, ``If you cut up the `Mona \nLisa' into little pieces one inch square and distribute them among the \nart galleries of the world so millions might see it, where hundreds now \nsee it, neither the millions nor the hundreds would get any genuine \nvalue.''\n  The point here is that wilderness has a size factor that is itself \nvaluable. Although Marshall rose to a high position in the Forest \nService, his greatest legacy came when he left to found the Wilderness \nSociety in 1935. The society came into its own with the successful \nfight against a plan to build two major dams on the grounds of Dinosaur \nNational Monument in Utah. Instead of moving from fight to fight \nagainst this development or that, the society developed the idea of \npermanently classifying some portion of the public lands to be \nprotected from development. When Senator Hubert Humphrey introduced \nsuch a bill in 1957, not only the commercial interests and the western \nSenators and Congressmen, but even the Park Service and Forest Service \nwere flatly opposed. Above all, they were offended by the idea that \ncitizens from the areas affected should participate in the decisions \nabout what should be protected.\n\n  Senator Arthur Watkins of Utah argued that a permanent wilderness \ndesignation would ``hamstring economic development,'' but at the same \ntime, like opponents of the Yellowstone in the 1870's, he insisted that \n``Millions of acres are already preserved in the wilderness state and \nprobably always will be.''\n  The bill which finally passed in 1964 contained the following \ndefinition of wilderness:\n\n       A wilderness, in contrast to those areas where man and his \n     own works dominate the landscape, is hereby recognized as an \n     area where the earth and the community of life are \n     untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does \n     not remain.\n\n  That is the definition of wilderness in the 1964 act. It ordered the \nagencies that manage Federal land to review their own holdings and \nrecommend those that qualify for wilderness designation--wilderness, a \n``community of life untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor \nwho does not remain.''\n  But this review omitted the over 300 million acres managed by the \nBLM. Those lands came under the purview of the Wilderness Act only in \n1976. At that time BLM was given 15 years to review its own holdings \nand recommend those to be protected. However, Mr. President, that was \nin 1976. It was not long before James Watt took the reins of the \nDepartment of the Interior and in the long tradition of deliberately \ncrippling the bureaucracy at BLM moved the deadline up from 1991 to \n1984--one would assume not in an effort to protect the land quickly but \nto overwhelm the agency and destroy the review process. In other words, \nwhat was supposed to take 15 years of careful, painstaking, accurate \nanalysis of public land under the control of BLM with designation of \nspecific wilderness was now contrasted into a very short time. And it \nis the legacy of that action that brings us to where we are today in \nconsideration of the Utah lands bill.\n  The Wilderness Act, if it is allowed to work as intended, can be the \nfinal step in our escape from the lords of yesterday--the compulsion to \ntransfer lands and to let their soil and mineral resources, their trees \nand their vistas to be exploited for short-term gain rather than \npreserved for future generations. Bernard DeVoto urged us to ``maintain \nportions of the wilderness untouched, so that a tree will rot where it \nfalls, a waterfall will pour its curves without generating electricity, \na trumpeter swan may float on uncontaminated water--and moderns may at \nleast see what their ancestors knew in their nerves and in their \nblood.''\n  That is what is possible, if the Wilderness Act is allowed to work.\n  Mr. President, what about the Federal lands generally in the United \nStates and in Utah? The Federal Government currently owns approximately \n650 million acres, or nearly 30 percent of the 2.3 billion acre land \narea of the United States. However, this is far less than the \nGovernment has owned in the past. Since 1775 the Federal Government has \nacquired through purchase and war over 1.8 billion acres, and at \nvarious times in U.S. history has held title to nearly 80 percent of \nthe Nation's total area. Nearly two-thirds of the land once owned by \nthe Federal Government has been transferred to the States, or to \nprivate interests.\n  Where did the land come from? Well, the original 13 and the move over \nto the Mississippi is about 236 million acres. If you add the Louisiana \nPurchase, you add 529 million acres. If you take the Oregon compromise, \nyou add 183 million acres. If you take the secession from Mexico at the \nend of the Mexican-United States war, you add 338 million acres. If you \ntake the Alaska purchase, you add 378 million acres.\n\n[[Page S2766]]\n\n Those are the main places that the land came from.\n  How were the Federal lands disposed of? During the 19th century a \nnumber of Federal laws encouraged transfer of Federal lands to \nhomesteaders; as I said, earlier, the Homestead Act of 1862 to miners, \nthe Mining Act of 1872, and to railroads and to others. In general, the \npurpose of the act was to encourage development and settlement of the \nWest. Lands were also sold to raise money and granted to States for \nspecific purposes--funding for education, for example.\n  As a result of the land acts, over 1.1 billion acres have been \ntransferred out of Federal ownership in the following ways. \nHomesteaders got 287 million acres. Railroad companies got 94 million \nacres. As a frame of reference, that is the equivalent of all of the \nland of Washington and Oregon given to railroad companies. Military \nbounties got 61 million acres, and grants to States were around 328 \nmillion acres. Those were the largest chunks of who got the land--the \nhomesteaders, the railroad companies, military, and States.\n  Altogether, private interests have acquired title to 69 million acres \nof Federal lands through patents associated with either extraction of \nminerals or fossil fuels.\n  So that is where the Federal lands went.\n  Who manages these public lands? Four agencies administer 96 percent \nof the Federal land. For conservation, preservation, or development \nthey are the National Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service. The \nmajority of lands managed by these agencies are in the West, which is \nironically the most urbanized part of the country in terms of per \ncapita.\n  In 1891, as I pointed out, Congress granted the President the \nauthority--now repealed--to establish forest reserves from the public \ndomain.\n  In 1906 and 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt more than doubled the \nacreage of the forest reserves which resulted in Congress limiting the \nauthority of the President to add to the forest system.\n  Here is one of the more interesting images that I have ever come \nacross. Teddy Roosevelt came to office, and he kept a big chunk of \nnational forest claiming it for national protection. He did that \nessentially by his Executive power. And then Congress passed an \namendment saying that no further Presidential reservations would be \npermitted unless they were approved by Congress. There was a date by \nwhich that was to go into effect. And the story is that the night, or \ntwo, before the law was supposed to go into effect, Teddy Roosevelt was \nin the White House with Gifford Pinchot, his great national forester. \nThey had the maps of all of the West laid out, and by Executive order \nhe cut out of the maps prior to the law going into effect vast acreages \nthat he had then preserved.\n  At present, the National Forest System includes 155 national forests \ncovering 187 million acres, 20 national grasslands with 4 million \nacres, and 103 other units such as land utilization projects and \nresearch and experimental areas with less than 500,000 acres.\n  So that is the National Forest System.\n  The BLM, Bureau of Land Management, again as I said earlier, was \ncreated in 1946 as a result of the merger of the General Land Office \nand the Grazing Service, and the BLM currently manages about 268 \nmillion acres, about a third of which is in Alaska. Its lands are used \nfor multiple purposes including grazing and wilderness.\n  So in addition to the National Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \nManagement is the National Wildlife Refuge System. Following Pelican \nIsland in 1903, the number of refuges continued to grow, and in 1966 \nthe National Wildlife Refuge System was established under the \nmanagement of the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the \nInterior, and the Fish and Wildlife Service manages 494 refuges \ncovering 91 million acres.\n  The National Park Service. The National Park Service manages 368 \nmillion units including 55 national parks. The basic mission of the \nNational Park Service is to conserve, preserve, protect, and interpret \nthe natural, cultural, and historic resources of the Nation for the \npublic. To a considerable extent, the Service also contributes to \nmeeting the public demand for certain types of outdoor recreation \nopportunities. Scientific research is another activity encouraged by \nthe Service in units in the National Park System.\n  Then the final body is the National Wilderness Preservation System \nwhich was established by the Wilderness Act of 1964 and today contains \nnearly 104 million acres in 44 States.\n  So these are the four principal land management agencies of the \nUnited States. They administer a total of 621 million acres of which \n104 million acres or 17 percent is wilderness.\n  So what about the State of Utah, the public lands of Utah? Of the \nland that makes up Utah, frankly, along with Nevada, California, and \nparts of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and South Dakota, totaling 334 \nmillion acres, approximately 52 million acres came into Federal \nownership when it was ceded to the United States by Mexico in 1848 at a \ncost of $16 million, roughly.\n  In 1896, having agreed forever to abandon polygamy, Utah was granted \nstatehood. At that time, in exchange for giving up plural marriage, and \nbecause Utah did not receive internal improvement and swampland grants, \nthe Federal Government granted 14 percent of Utah territory's land area \nto the State. That was substantially more than the 6 to 7 percent that \nthe omnibus States of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and \nWashington received just 5 years earlier. These land grants were \nallocated to specific activities, and I ask unanimous consent that this \nchart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n        Purpose                                                 Acreage\nSchool........................................................5,844,196\nPublic buildings.................................................64,000\nUniversity......................................................156,080\nAgricultural college............................................200,000\nIrrigation......................................................500,000\nInsane Asylum...................................................100,000\nSchool of Mines.................................................100,000\nDeaf and dumb institution.......................................100,000\nReform school...................................................100,000\nInstitution for the blind.......................................100,000\nMiners' hospital (Act Feb. 20, 1929).............................50,000\nNormal School...................................................100,000\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Remaining Federal lands currently constitute \napproximately 32 million acres in Utah or 62 percent of the State. That \nis what most people in United States do not understand, and that is why \nwhen the Senator from an eastern State, particularly one as densely \npopulated as New Jersey, stands up to speak about this subject, they \nfrequently say, ``Well, you don't understand what it means to have 60 \npercent of your State owned by the Federal Government.''\n  Indeed, New York State has only 1 percent, Michigan has 9 percent, \nNevada has 90 percent, and Utah has 62 percent. Four Federal agencies \ndominate, and very little land in Utah has been designated as \nwilderness. In fact, out of the 32 million acres, about 800,000 of \nthose acres have been currently designated as wilderness. The bulk of \nthe land, 22 million acres, is managed by the BLM. Next highest is the \nForest Service with about 8 million acres, and the National Park \nService about 2 million acres. However, approximately 3.2 million acres \nin Utah which have not received wilderness designation are currently \nmanaged as wilderness. Official wilderness, 800,000 but 3.2 million \nacres now being managed as wilderness.\n  What about economic development, the pressures in Utah on economic \ndevelopment? The issue before us is not just what to do with the public \nlands in Utah, the lands owned by all the taxpayers, but also what is \nthe best path for Utah's future. Utah's economy is being transformed. I \nam sure the Senators from Utah can speak to this with much more \nknowledge and probably much more direct interest, so my comments are in \nthe way of observation.\n  The State is rapidly urbanizing and policies which reflect the old \npatterns of agriculture and extractive industries have little or \nnothing to do with the current economic realities. For example, from \n1979 to 1993, Utah jobs in mining and agriculture declined by 5,000 \nwhile jobs outside these sectors increased by 360,000. In 1993, less \nthan 1 job out of 100 was associated with mineral extraction during a \nperiod of rapid expansion in the State economy. The entire spectrum of \nextractive industries from minerals and agriculture to forestry and \nwood products has been in\n\n[[Page S2767]]\n\nrelative decline since the 1960's and contributes just one-eighth as \nmuch income as do service industries to the State income. Even worse, \nmany extractive industries such as mining are subject to boom and bust \nconditions and resulting economic instability.\n  A study by Prof. Thomas Power, chairman of the department of \neconomics at the University of Montana, found that extractive \nindustries such as agriculture and mining are playing a decreasing role \nin Utah's economy and that ``wilderness protection does not in any \nsignificant way threaten the ongoing development of the Utah economy.''\n  Wilderness protection is not a threat to the Utah economy. In fact, \nPower finds that the most likely economic effect of additional \nwilderness protection will be positive, not negative. While alternative \neconomic uses of wilderness are marginal and primarily the product of \nspeculative mineral activities, additional wilderness designation is \nlinked with more predictable economic activity, the kinds associated \nwith a high quality natural environment which is increasing in demand \nacross America.\n  Utah's population has also undergone rapid expansion in the last 25 \nyears. While the population as a whole in the United States increased \nby 29 percent, Utah enjoyed an 80-percent jump. Much of this was \ndirectly attributable to the attraction of the State's largely \nunspoiled environment. For example, St. George grew by 35 percent just \nin the last 5 years largely due to retirees moving in from California, \nand I can understand why. It is a beautiful, beautiful place--not so \nfar from the Zion National Park.\n\n  Utah's greatest asset is its unique natural beauty, a beauty which \ndraws tourists from around the world. According to Power,\n\n       Lands with wilderness qualities are a relatively scarce \n     resource that has significant alternative uses that satisfy \n     important human needs and desires. . . Wildlands provide a \n     broad range of benefits that make the lives of Utah residents \n     more satisfying and fulfilling in at least the same way that \n     most of their purchases in commercial markets do.\n\n  In the competition to attract new businesses and residents, the \nquality of natural and social environments will be particularly \nimportant. Power views wilderness designations themselves as a sort of \nadvertisement that the natural beauty of the State will remain \navailable for future generations.\n  Preservation of public lands also has direct and measurable economic \nbenefits. Tourism has grown to be Utah's most important industry. \nSpending by travelers in Utah accounts for roughly 69,000 jobs and the \n$3.35 billion they spend generates some $247 million in direct tax \nimpact for State and local governments in Utah. The Governor's Office \nof Planning and Budget expects the State's tourism industry to continue \nto be one of the fastest growing segments of Utah's economy.\n  Utah's special attractions lured about 15 million tourists including \n1 million foreigners to the State in 1994. Visitation to the State's \ndozen national parks has increased more than 20 percent in the past 5 \nyears; there has been a corresponding increase in visitation to the \nsurrounding BLM lands, most of which would not be protected under S. \n884. In some of the counties with lands under consideration for \ninclusion in the wilderness system, tourism provides over 60 percent of \ntotal jobs.\n  Wilderness designation has little of the claimed negative effects \ncited by its most vigorous opponents. When 3.2 million acres were set \naside in the wilderness study areas through the BLM's inventory \nprocess, agriculture accounted for 1.3 percent of the income earned in \nUtah. Ten years later the figure was virtually the same. The protection \nafforded by wilderness management in the study areas had made no change \nin Utah's agricultural economy.\n  The same neutral or beneficial effect is also true for grazing. \nAccording to a University of Arizona study published in the Journal of \nRange Management, in designated wilderness in Arizona, forage \nallocation for grazing has actually increased. And wilderness \ndesignation allows the continuation of existing grazing uses.\n  But even if designation had a significant impact on grazing, the \nFederal grazing lands in Utah currently contribute just eight \nhundredths of 1 percent of the total State income.\n  With mining, too, the impact of wilderness designations is less than \nmight be assumed. Since lands currently being mined are not suitable \nfor wilderness, designation will not result in any losses of existing \nmining jobs.\n  Oil and gas drilling are also declining contributors to the State's \neconomy. Utah has the second highest drilling cost per barrel for any \nState containing significant oil and gas reserves, as a result of \ndifficult access and complex geology. Small decreases in global oil \nprices have phased-out exploration and production in many parts of \nUtah.\n  Utah's demonstrated coal base is significantly smaller than Montana, \nWyoming's, Colorado's, and even North Dakota's. Significant advances in \nlongwall mining technologies has increased productivity in Utah's \nunderground coal mines, thereby decreasing the size of coal mining work \nforces. Thus, while productivity is at its highest in history, coal \nindustry employment has decreased steadily.\n  Then there is uranium. Huge deposits of uranium ore have been opened \nin Australia and Canada and Russian uranium may also be coming on to \nthe United States market. U.S. production is more likely to come from \nthe lowest-cost uranium reserves in Wyoming, New Mexico, and northern \nArizona, not from wilderness deposits in Utah.\n  As these figures show, extractive industries are not going to \nprovide, I think, a stable future for the State, that is, simply \nlooking at the data, looking at the materials, looking at where the \neconomic growth has come, looking at where the employment has come. One \nmight conclude, simply looking at the data, that extractive industries \nare not going to provide a stable future for the State of Utah.\n  Statistics for Washington County, which is Utah's fastest growing, \ntotal and per capita personal income are rising in the region as a \ndirect result of growth in the service sector.\n  The conservation of 3.2 million acres by the BLM as wilderness study \nareas in 1980 did not devastate the affected county economies. Growth \nthat occurred in each of these counties through the 1960's and 1970's \ncontinued through the 1980's and 1990's despite the negative economic \neffects caused by the drop in energy prices.\n  Yet even with the decline in extractive industries and their \ndecreasing impact on job creation, S. 884 was put together to reflect \nthe old economic thinking and old economic patterns with boundaries set \nto accommodate a series of new extractive developments which threaten \ncurrently pristine areas. These include a proposal for a large tar \nsands mining development on the edge of Glen Canyon National Recreation \nArea and in the Book Cliffs; a 3,000 megawatt coal-burning power plant \nin the heart of the Kaiparowits Plateau--as I said earlier, one of the \nthree or four largest undeveloped areas in the lower 48 States--coal \nstrip mining south and west of Bryce Canyon National Park; a petroleum \nand carbon dioxide gas extraction field in the headwaters of the \nEscalante River, involving as many as 97 production wells and 11 four-\nstory compressor plants; chaining of thousands of areas of forests, \nsome of which would be visible from Bryce Canyon National Park; and, \neven construction of a railroad. One tar sands project alone, in the \nDirty Devil area, would entail the drilling of 35,000 injection and \nrecovery wells, the construction of at least 100 miles of associated \nroads, 30,000 acres of soil disturbed, 14,000 acres of vegetation \nstripped away, and 2,000 archaeological sites disturbed or destroyed. \nIn order to support these projects, hundreds of miles of new roads to \ngain access and new facilities to feed and house workers would be \nneeded.\n  The bill itself includes damaging language which allows unprecedented \nincompatible uses even in supposedly protected areas. These include \nallowing jeeps, motorcycles, and other off-road vehicles on remote dirt \ntracks, low-level military overflights which disturb wilderness \nsolitude and even future dams, pipelines, and communications antennas \nin some areas. Accommodating these proposed uses, no matter how \nspeculative or damaging, was the principal reason many important areas \nwere dropped from consideration for wilderness designation under S. \n884. Boundaries seemed to be altered and entire regions omitted in \norder to permit new, large damaging projects which would fuel yet \nanother cycle of economic boom and bust.\n\n[[Page S2768]]\n\n  Unfortunately, these projects proposed for the Colorado Plateau look \nfamiliar. They are the same types that have failed in the past because \nof unfavorable world commodity prices, lack of demand, or simply the \nhigh cost of doing business in a remote and forbidding area. While it \nis unlikely that most of them would ever be completed or be \neconomically viable, even preliminary site work, such as roadbuilding, \nwould destroy their wilderness qualities forever.\n\n  So, that is what I see is the economic circumstance in Utah. The \nextractive industries declining both as a percent of the State economic \nproduct and the numbers in employment, and this bill going in the \ndirection of trying to keep that future available, to the great \ndetriment of the fastest growing areas, the service sector, and in \nparticular tourism, that is growing every year as more people want to \ncome and see and experience these remarkable lands on the Colorado \nplateau and in the Basin Range.\n  The way to look at Utah's future, from my own view, and this is just \nmy view, and the role that this bill will play in that future, is not \nfrom an absolutist perspective, however, not from an absolutist \nperspective that elevates environmental values above economic growth. \nDevelopment is not wrong, and it has a place in both the publicly held \nand private lands of Utah. The principle that it must apply, in my \nview, is that of sustainable development.\n\n  (Mr. DeWINE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Sustainable development is not pure abstraction, but a \nreal plan for action with a specific definition. The definition \nendorsed by the President's Council on Sustainable Development, in a \nreport issued last month, is as follows:\n  Sustainable development means:\n\n       To meet the needs of the present without compromising the \n     ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\n  It is a concept with an imperative behind it that is much like the \nimperative to balance the Federal budget, only much broader. It brings \ntogether the idea of a growing economy in which every adult has the \nopportunity to earn a living and support a family with the promise of a \nhealthy life and a high quality of life for this and future \ngenerations.\n  What does sustainable development mean in the American West? Charles \nWilkinson, a law professor and historian of Western lands, puts it \nwell. He says:\n\n       Good science, good laws, good economics, and good \n     communities come together in the idea of sustainability. At \n     its core are the responsibilities lodged in the idea of \n     intergenerational equity which [has been described] as the \n     principle that ``every generation receives a natural and \n     cultural legacy in trust from its ancestors and holds it in \n     trust for its descendants.'' Development cannot wear the land \n     and waters down but rather must maintain their vigor. A \n     working policy of sustainability encompasses a practical and \n     phased-in, but still rigorous and comprehensive, program of \n     conservation so that consumption can be reduced. But the \n     obligation to provide for the next generations also includes \n     the duty to maintain a vital economy. Sustainability, then, \n     affirmatively recognizes the need for development. . .\n       The first step in approaching sustainability is to identify \n     exactly what must be sustained--the ``natural and cultural \n     legacy'' that we have received and must pass on. Traditional \n     extractive development in the West has focused only on the \n     specific resources being extracted. Water projects, for \n     example, were designed to meet only the demand for water, by \n     which was meant water as a commodity--for mining, farming and \n     ranching, energy development, and industrial, municipal, and \n     domestic use. Any other benefits, such as the blue-ribbon \n     trout stream on the Navajo Dam on the San Juan River, were \n     purely secondary and often accidental. Avoidance of negative \n     effects, such as loss of the salmon runs, was largely a \n     matter of luck, as when the Army Corps of Engineers' fish \n     ladder at Bonneville Dam on the Columbia actually turned out \n     to be workable. The overriding goal was to create commodity \n     benefits, which were viewed as being nearly infinitely \n     sustainable in those simpler times. . .\n       But our thinking has evolved. In many national forests, a \n     broader view of sustainability is not being achieved. Only \n     the specific resources being extracted--commercial timber --\n     is being renewed. Other parts of the forest, which must be \n     taken into account to achieve true sustainability, are in \n     jeopardy. The health of certain fish and wildlife \n     populations. Soil on steep slopes. The recreation \n     economy. Species diversity. The ancient forests. Views. \n     Beauty. Glory. Awe. Sustainability is measured not by \n     board feet but by the whole forest.\n\n  Unless you disagree with the concept of sustainable development, that \nwe owe our descendants the legacy we have received from our ancestors, \nit is imperative to compare the Utah wilderness bill with this idea. \nBefore I go into great detail about the specifics of the bill, I want \nto briefly consider the question, Does the bill live up to the idea of \nsustainable development?\n  First, the bill elevates one set of resources above all others, both \nwithin and without the areas designated wilderness. Grazing, mining, \ntimber sales and commercial development are protected. The wilderness \ndesignation boundaries creep carefully around the sites of planned \ndevelopment. The wilderness value is secondary and incidental to the \nother aims, and appears to be almost accidental. All evidence suggests, \nas I will show later, that the ``using interests'' of Utah, and their \nfriends at the BLM, seem to have asked the question: ``What areas don't \nwe want for mining and development?'' before they asked ``What areas do \nwe want protected for the future?''\n  Second, the uses that are given priority are not those which will \nlead Utah to a sustainable, prosperous future. Minerals, timber, water, \nand grasses are not infinite resources, and cannot be sustained without \nlimits. Mining and agriculture add up to about $800 million of the \ntotal income of the State. That is down from $1.1 billion in 1980 and \nsteadily declining. The rest of the Utah's economy, all that earned \nfrom other sources, has grown from $20 to $30 billion in the same time. \nSo mining and agriculture, from $1.1 billion to $800 million, the rest \nof the economy growing from $20 billion to $30 billion at the same \ntime. In extractive industries, it costs more and more to bring fewer \nand fewer returns as resources are exhausted. The economic values of \ntourism, quality of life, nonextractive industries, such as software \ndevelopment, high technology, grow and grow as more is invested in \nthem.\n  Third, the bill not only fails to protect the natural legacy for \nfuture generations, it affirmatively denies them the right to protect \nit for themselves, and that is the section on managing it for \nsuitability for wilderness.\n  Fourth, there is yet another component which Wilkinson describes as \npart of sustainable development in the West: the idea that a community \ncan best determine for itself how to preserve its legacy for its \nchildren. He writes:\n\n       After identifying all economic, environmental, cultural and \n     abstract (or spiritual) elements that need to be sustained, \n     [I envision] a community coming together; identifying \n     problems; setting goals--a vision--for a time period such as \n     twenty or forty years; adopting a program to fulfill those \n     goals; and modifying the program as conditions change.\n\n  The process that led to this bill was the opposite of this idea. \nInstead, an agency in Washington, crippled by politics and captive of \ninterests, decided on its own which elements needed to be sustained. It \nignored, denounced, and shouted down the county commissioners and \ncitizens who had other thoughts. Finally, the process brought us a plan \nthat cannot be altered if conditions change.\n  So now, Mr. President, I want to put the bill in some context. I have \nalready spent some time this morning talking about the history of \npublic lands in our country and how the Federal Government's \nstewardship of our Nation's environmental heritage has evolved over the \nyears. I think this history provides the context within which to \naddress the situation that faces us today: how do we achieve a \nbalanced, reasonable plan for conserving America's natural heritage \nwhile providing opportunity for economic growth and development across \nour public lands? This is the challenge we face today as we consider \nthe Utah Public Lands Management Act.\n\n  This bill--I have not seen all of the changes in the modification \nthat was sent to the desk, so I would add a couple other hundred \nthousand acres here or there--but this bill would designate between 1.8 \nand 2 million acres of wilderness in Utah. It would release \napproximately 20 million BLM acres of land that are not designated as \nwilderness areas. It would allow the State to exchange land with the \nFederal Government. It would deny Federal reserved water rights on \nlands designated as wilderness. It would provide new management \ndirections for the designated wilderness areas, some of\n\n[[Page S2769]]\n\nwhich are exceptions to the standards established in the Wilderness Act \nof 1964 that would allow military overflights and allow motorized \naccess. It will allow motor boat access in designated areas. The \nlegislation, in my view, fails to strike the balance between using our \nnatural resources, which is the right of all U.S. citizens as \nstakeholders in a common heritage, and abusing natural resources which \nare the shared heritage of the entire people of the country.\n  This legislation designates too little of Utah's spectacular \nlandscape as wilderness. Of the almost 22 million acres of BLM land in \nUtah, only about 1.8 to 2 million, less than 10 percent, would be \ndesignated as wilderness. Vast tracts of America's most magnificent \npublic lands would be left open to development; the wilderness that is \ndesignated by the act would be managed in a manner contrary to the \nprotections afforded by the Wilderness Act, and the unprecedented \ninclusion, now modified somewhat, of hard release language would \nattempt to bar the rest from forever being protected by the shield of \nwilderness designation.\n  Before I begin to talk about the specific shortcomings of the bill--\nand there are several serious flaws that I want to call to the \nattention of the Senate--I would like to take a moment to sketch the \nhistory of public lands management in Utah since the adoption of the \nWilderness Act in 1964, because I think that history paints a clear \npicture of how we arrived at our present dilemma.\n  In 1964, Congress enacted what Charles Wilkinson called one of our \nNation's noblest, most future-looking innovations. The Wilderness Act \nof 1964 established the National Wilderness Preservation System and \nmarked the first time any government had ever legislated in favor of \nwild lands. Today more than 125 other nations protecting more than half \na billion acres have followed the lead of the United States in \nestablishing protection for their wilderness acres.\n  However, the 1964 act did not include, as I said earlier, Bureau of \nLand Management lands; only national forest, parks, wildlife refuges \nwere covered under the protective umbrella of the act. However, in \n1976, in response to concerns raised by citizens in southwestern Utah, \nCongress finally called for a wilderness study of all BLM lands \nnationwide. Each BLM State office was directed to inventory all \nroadless areas with wilderness characteristics. Following on the heels \nof the inventory, each State office was directed to study, hold \nhearings, and recommend--after giving full weight to all issues, \nincluding economic concerns--which areas in the inventory should be \ndefined as wilderness areas. Every State complied with this directive \nwith the exception of Utah.\n\n  BLM officials in Utah failed to produce an initial comprehensive \ninventory of roadless areas with wilderness characteristics in their \nState. Instead, they embarked on a course that I think mirrors the \ndebate we have here today. In 1980, after only a 1-year period of \nstudy, the Utah BLM eliminated nearly 20 million acres from wilderness \nconsideration. In one fell swoop, the BLM removed an area of land that \nwas five times the size of my own State of New Jersey from wilderness \nconsideration. This move left just 2.6 million acres protected, which \nwas later increased to 3.2 million acres after appeals by Utah \nconservationists. Finally, in 1991, the Utah BLM delivered its final \nrecommendation of lands to be designated wilderness areas--and that \nfigure was a mere 1.9 million acres. This low-ball figure was derived \nas a result of the BLM inventory process that was, I think, much too \nsensitive to the developmental interests.\n  The history of the BLM inventory is crucial, and it is a crucial part \nof the story of public lands in Utah. We need to understand that Utah's \nBLM wilderness inventory was not an unbiased, scientific study, but it \nwas the result of a highly politicized process. The inventory work done \nin the 1970's and 1980's was politically driven, and the results were \nseriously flawed. The flawed product, with its recommendations of 1.9 \nmillion acres to be designated as wilderness is replicated in the bill \nS. 884 we are considering today.\n  Criticism of the BLM inventory process has come from all corners, \nwith the most striking group being BLM employees involved in conducting \nthe inventory.\n  In response to these criticisms, in August 1980, just prior to the \nBLM's final inventory decision, Terry Sopher, the national director of \nthe BLM wilderness program, traveled to Utah to investigate charges \nthat the inventory had been misdirected for some reason or another. \nSopher reported that, ``Based on what we had seen, there was an \negregious violation of policies.'' Sopher returned to the District of \nColumbia to recommend that the inventory be redone. However, that \nrecommendation and that effort was halted after the 1980 election.\n  A decade and a half later--go forward a decade and a half; that was \n1980--1995, BLM employees were still voicing strong criticisms of the \nway the inventory process was conducted. On July 7, 1995, Janet Ross, \nwho worked as a BLM employee on the BLM official inventory work in \nUtah, held a press conference with the former BLM national director, \nJim Baca, and coordinator, Keith Corrigan. All three told the press \nthat BLM's wilderness inventory excluded wilderness for reasons that \nwere not exactly clear.\n  Ms. Ross, now director of the Four Corners School of Outdoor \nEducation located in southern Utah, said,\n\n       It is my experience and professional judgment that we did \n     not perform and were not allowed to perform a competent \n     wilderness inventory. The result was that substantial \n     wilderness-quality acreage was arbitrarily excluded from \n     further study and proper consideration.''\n\n  Utah newspapers following the inventory process were also extremely \ncritical of the inventory process. Following the inventory work, in \nAugust 1982, the Salt Lake City Desert News editorialized against the \nBLM's work. It wrote, ``* * * there was much Utah land that should have \nbeen considered for possible designation as wilderness, but the BLM \n`just' did not study it.''\n\n  Additionally, in the 1980's, Utah citizens filed a series of legal \nchallenges with the Interior Board of Land Appeals against the BLM's \ninventory, appeals which covered 925,000 acres in 29 roadless areas. In \n1983, the administrative court responded with a stunning indictment of \nthe BLM's work in the largest appeal of its kind in the history of the \ncourt. The Utah BLM had been in error, the board ruled, on 90 percent \nof the lands in question. Citizens were unable to challenge all of the \nwilderness areas the BLM dropped during the inventory because they \nfaced a 30-day deadline, and a single one of the appeals often required \nfilings that were 2,000 pages, several hundred photographs, and over \n100 affidavits.\n  The belief that the BLM inventory process was seriously flawed was \nshared by congressional committees that held oversight hearings on the \nprocess. In 1984 and 1985, House Public Lands Subcommittee Chairman \nJohn Seiberling held a series of oversight hearings to investigate \ncharges that the Utah BLM's inventory was flawed. After the \ninvestigation, Seiberling told reporters, ``They've left out areas that \nobviously qualify for wilderness * * * their position is absolutely \nabsurd.''\n\n  Spurred on by the realization that the Utah BLM's erroneous work \nwould result in millions of acres of wild lands being subject to the \npossibility of development, Utah citizens conducted their own \ninventory. The citizens' work took years, requiring thousands of hours \nof field work. Unlike the BLM, these citizens walked every one of the \nroadless areas on foot and determined that there were actually 5.7 \nmillion acres of remaining wilderness. Their work was published in a \n400-page book entitled ``Wilderness at the Edge.'' There was a bill \nthat their proposal recommended that was introduced in 1989 by \nCongressman Wayne Owens. When he left the House, Representative Maurice \nHinchey reintroduced H.R. 1500.\n  Now, Mr. President, now that I have had the opportunity to chronicle \nthe controversy that has surrounded the development of this \nlegislation, I want now to discuss the specific flaws in the bill. S. \n884 suffers from several major flaws, each of which merits serious \nconsideration.\n  First, and most alarming, is the hard release language. Not only the \n4 million acres which Utahans seek immediate designation, but also the \nadditional 16 million acres of Utah BLM lands. As I heard the \nmodification, the\n\n[[Page S2770]]\n\nbill has been modified, and it has been improved. The change is \nhelpful, but I will argue later why that change is not sufficient, and \nhow it is in its present structure, a back-door way for doing the exact \nthing that the original bill had intended to do, while at the same time \ndoing it a little more skillfully.\n  Second, the bill leaves nearly 4 million acres of America's Red Rock \nWilderness open for development. These 4 million acres, some of our \nmost magnificent national treasures, landscapes that would no longer be \nprotected for our future generations, include Fish and Owl Creek \nCanyons on the east side of Cedar Mesa, that is the home to 1,500-year-\nold Anasazi cliff dwellings; the wild country of the Kaiparowits \nPlateau that I talked about earlier; the heart of the Dirty Devil \ncanyon system; the slopes of the Beaver Dam Mountains; the White \nCanyon, with its important habitat for desert bighorn sheep and lands \nadjacent to Zion National Park; and countless others in the basin range \nregion. I will save for another day the discussion of the basin range \nregion.\n  Third, the bill transfers a large chunk of the Kaiparowits Plateau \nWilderness out of Federal ownership to the State of Utah for the \ndevelopment of a coal mine, with no regard for its outstanding actual \nquality or value.\n  The Kaiparowits, as I described earlier, is inhabited by a wide \nvariety of wildlife species, including mule deer, mountain lions, \ncoyotes, foxes, and over 210 species of birds. Several areas on the \nKaiparowits contain examples of the marine and terrestrial fossils \nfound nowhere else in the world. If the Kaiparowits were to become \nState land, the national public would have no voice in how the land is \nmanaged.\n  Mr. President, S. 884 would designate no wilderness in the half-\nmillion-acre Kaiparowits region of south central Utah between a slice \nof Fifty Mile Mountain on the east and a sliver of Paria River on the \nwest. Instead, more than 50,000 acres in the heart of this omitted \nregion would be turned over to the State of Utah to facilitate coal \ndevelopment.\n  Fourth, the bill expressly denies a water right to wilderness areas \ndesignated by this act. In the two most recent BLM wilderness bills \nenacted--for California and Arizona, and I think also in Nevada--\nCongress reserved a quantity of water sufficient to fulfill the \npurposes of the act, which is protecting lands designated as wilderness \nareas. This bill would deny the right to water for lands that are \nprotected under this act, thereby preventing protected lands from \nhaving the right to the very water which gives it life. Ironically, one \nof the reasons for granting wilderness protection to desert wild lands \nin Utah is to shelter relatively rare riparian ecosystems. Protecting \nthe lands which contain the habitat of species that live on the banks \nof rivers and lakes without protecting the water which sustains these \nsame systems is shortsighted, to say the least.\n\n  Fifth, the bill includes provisions permitting the State of Utah to \nexchange State land within or adjacent to wilderness areas for Federal \nlands in other locations, so long as the lands exchanged are of \napproximate equal value. Taken at face value this would benefit both \nparties. However, Sylvia Baca, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Land and \nMinerals Management, at the Department of Interior has testified that \n``equal value'':\n\n       * * * is clearly not the case when the specific tracts \n     shown on the map are reviewed. The tracts proposed to be \n     obtained by the State have high economic value for mineral, \n     residential, or industrial development. The fair market value \n     of the lands may be 5 to 10 times more than the value of the \n     lands that would be transferred to the Federal Government.\n\n  Mr. President, S. 884 also permits partial exchanges that would allow \nthe State to acquire desirable Federal land in exchange for whatever \nland the State wants to give up. The State gets to arrange, in other \nwords, both sides of the transaction. It identifies both the lands it \nwants to dispose of and the lands it wants to acquire. The Federal \nGovernment must approve the transaction, once again, provided the lands \nare of approximate equal value.\n  Sixth, this bill makes broad exceptions to the Wilderness Act of \n1964, dangerous precedents, which the act affords protections that \npreserve the unique and spectacular wilderness qualities of public \nlands. These exemptions would allow and in some circumstances even \nencourage new nonwilderness activities in designated wilderness areas.\n  For example, passage of this bill would restrict the Secretary of \nInterior's authority to control motorized vehicles in wilderness, even \non new routes; allow new dams to be constructed under the guise of \nmodifying existing small spring catchments; allow new water users to \ndry up wilderness streams; allow the construction of permanent \nbuildings and roads and wilderness under the guise of interpreting \ncultural resources; allow the military to construct new communication \nsites in wilderness; and include special unnecessary overbroad language \npermitting low-level military flights and the establishment of new \nspecial-use airspace over wilderness; and provide livestock permittees \nan argument for special treatment on allotments in wilderness.\n  Mr. President, those are what I consider to be the major flaws in \nthis bill. I know that some of my colleagues will argue that \npreservation of Utah's unique national heritage is a matter best left \nto the State's own delegation with its considerable wisdom and \nconsiderable talent. In this case, I have to disagree. Wilderness is a \ngift we give to our children and grandchildren, a gift that once \ndestroyed can never be reconstructed. The children of New Jersey \ndeserve it, as much as the children of California or Colorado.\n\n  As a Southwestern poet, Ann Weilern Walka, has written of southern \nUtah, this beautiful, vast, unique area of the world:\n\n       Why not acknowledge that there is something here more \n     important to our beleaguered society than a marginal mine, an \n     overgrazed permit? A great American myth is embodied in wild \n     lands, and it is myth, ultimately, that holds people \n     together.\n       The bits of this continent, too formidable to penetrate by \n     road the last of what drew our ancestors to North America, be \n     it ten or ten thousand years ago, an opportunity to breathe \n     deep and re-imagine their lives. The scraps of Eden still \n     afford us awe in an age of cynicism, steady us when human \n     affairs are dizzyingly complicated, reaffirm our eroding \n     sense of American innocence and courage.\n       Places like these, places to get lost, to become grounded, \n     to meet our Maker, to rediscover our forebears' \n     resourcefulness and grit, to take heart, are promised in our \n     most abiding stories.\n\n  I might close my opening statement with a quote from the Oakland \nTribune that reminds us that ``The battle over public lands in the West \nis a battle between two philosophies: one that says untouched land is \ninherently valuable to all Americans, from those who use it for \nsolitude and recreation to those who simply enjoy knowing that there \nare still pockets of nature left on the continent; and one that says \nall lands, including those owned by the public, should be put to work \nin one way or the other.'' These public lands belong, I believe, to the \nformer group, and so do I.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been intrigued by the comments and \nremarks of my colleague from New Jersey. But I have to say that during \nthe course of this debate, we are going to show a number of those \nremarks to be in error. Let me mention a couple of things right off the \ntop of my head. He mentioned the beauties of the Kaiparowits Plateau, \nwhich I have tramped on and been around.\n  I might add that, in this bill, if you include just Fifty Mile \nMountain in that area and the Paria-Hackberry area, you are talking \nabout 220,628 acres out of that area that are going into wilderness. \nThe implication is that we are not doing anything about wilderness. My \ngosh, almost 221,000 acres. With the Dirty Devil area, which was \nmentioned, we are designating more than 75,000 acres. We are talking \nabout 2 million acres here. Since the BLM began studying this issue \nalmost 18 years ago, more than than $10 million has been spent, \ncountless hearings held, town meetings scheduled--many efforts to bring \npeople together. The affected county people are upset, many not wanting \nany acres at all in wilderness. Then, there is the other extreme \nwanting 5.7 million acres.\n  The BLM, looking at it all, said that the only acres that even came \nclose to qualifying for true wilderness are 3.2 million. That is the \nstudy area. Nobody in their right mind expected that whole\n\n[[Page S2771]]\n\nstudy area to become wilderness. Everybody knows that once it is \ndesignated wilderness, it is used only basically for backpacking. You \ncan walk on it, and that is about it.\n  The people of Utah and everybody else would be basically frozen out \nfrom using any mechanization, including a bicycle, on the property. So \neven if you assume that the whole 3.2 million acres might qualify for \nwilderness and that the entire amount should be taken, that still is \nall there would be. These people who are so extreme want 5.7 million \nacres.\n  Keep in mind, the definition of wilderness is this. Section 2 of the \nWilderness Act of 1964 says: ``A wilderness, in contrast with those \nareas where man and his own works dominate the landscape, is hereby \nrecognized as an area where the Earth and its community of life are \nuntrammeled by man and where man himself is a visitor who does not \nremain.''\n  Further, it is defined as:\n\n       An area of undeveloped Federal land retaining its primeval \n     character and influence without permanent improvements or \n     human habitation, which is protected by man so as to preserve \n     natural conditions and one, which generally appears to have \n     been affected primarily by the forces of nature with the \n     implants of man where it is substantially unnoticeable; two, \n     has outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive and \n     unconfined type of recreation; three, has at least 5,000 \n     acres of land or is of sufficient size as to make practicable \n     its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition; four, \n     may also contain ecological, geological, or other features of \n     scientific, scenic, or historical value.\n\n  Furthermore, it said that you cannot put mechanization on this land. \nWe in Utah understand wilderness. I was one of the pivotal people in \ngetting it passed a number of years ago, along with Senator Garn and \nCongressman Hansen. We passed 800,000 acres of Forest Service. There \nwas a lot of screaming and shouting then. Today, virtually everybody \nadmits that was a wonderful bill. It has worked well. We are proud of \nit. We are proud of our wilderness in Utah. We do not want people from \nother States coming in and accusing us of raping the land or robbing \nthe people of the country as a whole, or taking away their rights, when \nwe understand our land and we know it. We have been there and we have \nwalked over it and we have driven many of these areas.\n  Frankly, it does make sense to me for those who come into our State \ndemanding 5.7 million acres when the total study area was only 3.2 \nmillion. They should listen to a leading BLM figure, Mr. James Parker, \nthe former Associate and Assistant Director of BLM, former BLM State \ndirector for Utah, who stated in testimony before the Senate \nSubcommittee on Forest and Public Land Management on S. 884, the \nfollowing:\n\n       Based on my personal experience with, and review of, the \n     detailed reports and analysis prepared by the professional \n     staff of BLM and other entities of the Department of \n     Interior, I believe that S. 884 is appropriate and that it \n     includes most of the areas that truly deserve to be \n     designated as wilderness in Utah. I believe the acreage \n     figure is both credible and in line with what meets the \n     criteria for wilderness designation. I also believe that it \n     meets both the spirit and intent of the Wilderness Act of \n     1964, and the proposed designations fit well into the overall \n     management scheme provided for by FLPMA for management of the \n     public lands.\n\n  This is the first time I have heard these indications, except from \nthe most extreme people, that the BLM is an organization that is not \ntremendously concerned about the environment. It has always been \nenvironmentally oriented in our State. With regard to the BLM Utah \nState process, Mr. Parker said:\n\n       The process was open to every citizen of the United States, \n     it was well defined, the criteria well-documented, appeals \n     and protest rights were all publicized and used by groups and \n     individuals on both sides of the issue, and extensive \n     documentation was completed for all aspects of the process. \n     Undoubtedly, this is one of the longest running, most \n     expensive, and most intensive public involvement efforts in \n     the history of Utah.\n\n  On the factual aspect of public involvement of this process, Mr. \nParker provided the following information:\n\n       During the 15 years it took to complete this wilderness \n     process in Utah, more than 16,000 written comments were \n     received, analyzed, and incorporated into the decision \n     process. More than 75 formal public meetings and hearings \n     were held by BLM, and hundreds of face-to-face discussions \n     and workshops were conducted. Thousands of pages of \n     documentation were prepared, printed, and distributed for \n     public review and comment, and countless briefings were held \n     and questions responded to. For the draft environmental \n     impact statement alone, 16 separate hearings were conducted, \n     over 700 people testified, and over 6,000 people commented in \n     writing. The resulting EIS fills 10 large books and consists \n     of 7 volumes, plus analysis of public input and agency \n     response.\n\n  Let me make the point that the people arguing against us, have \nproduced a beautiful book that contains their recommendation. It is \ndone in this book here. That is their work. I give them credit for it. \nIt is a beautiful book and there is a lot of good information. But this \nis just part of the study of the Federal Government and the BLM. Here \nare some more parts of the study, from the Geological Survey on \nthrough. That is what we have gone through, not just the study in the \ninterests of a few, but the interests of everybody.\n  I am glad that we have done that. The fact is there has been a lot of \nstudy there. There has been some suggestion here that the BLM \ndevelopment process was flawed. Let us see what Mr. Parker had to say. \nWe are not quoting some liberal, environmentally-oriented professor \nfrom Colorado who does not even live in Utah. We are talking about the \nhead of the Utah State BLM Office.\n\n       I came to the conclusion that, while it was not a perfect \n     process, it was carried out in a very open, professional, and \n     orderly manner. The criteria had been adhered to and \n     procedures had been followed.\n\n  Just look at it right here.\n\n       There was extensive documentation of the decision process.\n\n  Just look at it. It is enough to blow your mind.\n\n       There had also been a great deal of oversight in testing \n     the decisions by higher levels of the organization, the \n     Department of the Interior, and by special interest groups on \n     both sides of the issue through the appeals and judicial \n     challenges. I believe that the professional staff of BLM and \n     the other agencies involved--\n\n  It was not just BLM; there are a number of Federal agencies involved \nin all these studies.\n\n     involved in both Utah and in the headquarters level in \n     Washington. . .\n\n  Let us get with it. People here in Washington are not going to let us \nmake mistakes here. The people out there are not going to let us make \nmistakes. Both areas are environmentally oriented, almost to the \nextreme in some areas. But Mr. Parker says:\n\n       I believe that the professional staff of BLM and the other \n     agencies involved in both Utah and at the headquarters level \n     in Washington and elsewhere did a very credible job in \n     carrying out the mandate of the law.\n\n  In the process pursued by the Utah congressional delegation to \ndevelop S. 884--remember, this is the head of BLM in Utah, former \nAssociate and Assistant Director of BLM and former BLM State Director \nfor Utah on this process pursued by our Utah congressional delegation--\nMr. Parker stated,\n\n       I believe the recent process used by the delegation and the \n     Governor was not only appropriate but was a rather gracious \n     gesture--\n\n  I have to tell you it was. But let me continue.\n\n     given the extent of previous public involvement in the \n     numerous opportunities that have existed over the past 17 \n     years for individuals and groups to become involved in and to \n     impact the process.\n\n  Regarding the future use of lands that are not designated in our \nwilderness bill, S. 884, Mr. Parker continues:\n\n       All of the public lands in Utah are covered by land use \n     plans. Some of the plans are not as current as they might be \n     but they do provide protection for the resources. These \n     plans, along with other laws and regulations, provide many \n     options for land managers to use to protect the land and \n     their resources. While allowing for appropriate authorized \n     use and enjoyment of the public lands, no lands in Utah would \n     be unprotected, nor will they be open to uncontrolled \n     development if they are not designated as wilderness.\n\n  That says it all. These lands are not going to be ripped off. These \nlands are not just automatically developed. There are not going to be \nshopping centers everywhere. The fact is they will be subject to the \nenvironmental rules and laws in existence today. Mr. Parker also has \nwritten the following in a recent newspaper article about H.R. 1500, \nthe bill which apparently our colleague from New Jersey supports as \nwell as people who have never stepped foot in Utah, who have never \nlooked at it, and who do not understand our State. I might add they \ninclude many\n\n[[Page S2772]]\n\nenvironmental organizations that are very sincere in what they are \ndoing, but on this issue they are sincerely wrong:\n\n       This ill-conceived proposal--\n\n  Mr. Parker is talking about H.R. 1500, the environmental bill that \nwould have 5.7 million acres--\n\n       This ill-conceived proposal includes in its boundaries \n     private homes and buildings, cultivated fields, chained \n     areas, thousands of acres of private and school trust lands, \n     and other areas that cannot be designated as wilderness. It \n     also includes hundreds of miles of roads.\n\n  In this study book of theirs we have placed a tab demonstrating where \nthere exist many miles of roads. They try to say these roads are \nabandoned or not used, and so forth--some of them may be. The fact of \nthe matter is that hundreds of miles of roads have been included in \ntheir proposed wilderness areas. We have gone over many of those areas. \nA lot of it is low-lying sagebrush land along highways. That is how \nridiculous this is. Mr. Parker goes on to say:\n\n       Also included are--\n\n  Mr. Parker criticizing H.R. 1500, the environmental bill or I should \nsay the environmentally extreme bill.\n\n       Also included are oil and gas wells, hundreds of mineral \n     leases and mining claims, rights of ways, et cetera, all of \n     which would conflict with wilderness designation. Many of the \n     areas in the proposal lack the 5,000-acre minimum specified \n     by the Wilderness Act and are ``cherry stemmed'' in the \n     extreme leaving narrow necks of land that would make them \n     totally unmanageable as wilderness.\n\n  That is what a lot of this stuff is. I would prefer to go with these \nthings. I do not always agree with what the Federal Government has done \nin all of these wilderness studies, but we have spent millions getting \nto the point where we brought people together from all over the State \nof Utah and, frankly, from all over the country, to achieve what we \nhave been trying to do.\n  So you have a study area of 3.2 million acres that is well studied, \nwell documented. It is misleading to indicate that the BLM did not do \nits job here. In fact, we thought that it did too good of a job. Many \npeople in Utah did.\n  After reviewing the 3.2 million acres, the BLM in its final \nrecommendation, after all of this work, concluded that we should have \n1.9 million acres. That would be the right figure. This bill as \noriginally filed proposed 1.8 million acres, 100,000 acres less than \nthe 1.9 million that the BLM called for. To accommodate our colleagues \nhere in the Senate, because we know that our colleagues are sincere in \nwanting more wilderness acres, we have gone from 1.8 to 2 million.\n  Let us take a look at what 2 million acres equals, just so people \nrealize how vast this amount is, and why we are so upset that certain \ngroups are coming into our State and telling us what we can and cannot \ndo in our own State. And, all this after Senator Bennett, I, and the \nMembers of Congress in the House have worked on this issue for, in my \ncase, 20 years, to get to this point where we can resolve this matter. \nI should point out that both sides on this issue are mad at us most of \nthe time--those who do not want any acreage and those who want \neverything, like our friend from New Jersey. The affected counties \nwanted just over 1 million acres, that is all. They did not want any \nmore, and in some area they did not want that, to be honest with you. \nThey really want zero, especially in the mainly affected counties. But, \nat the most, we finally got them to agree to 1 million acres.\n  To those who never have budged from 5.7 million acres, not one acre, \nwe propose an amount of 2 million acres, which is 100,000 above that \nrecommended by the BLM. Look at what it means. Just so you get the idea \nof how vast this is. Two million acres is equal to 100 percent of the \nwhole State of Delaware--they only have 1.2 million acres in Delaware; \n63 percent of the whole State of Connecticut, which is only 3 million \nacres; 41 percent of Senator Bradley's New Jersey--in other words, our \n2 million acres is almost half of his State--he has 4.8 million acres \nin New Jersey; 41 percent of the whole State of Massachusetts; 35 \npercent of the whole State of New Hampshire; and 34 percent of the \nwhole State of Vermont.\n\n  I think people ought to stop and look at this. We live in Utah. We \nbelieve it is the most beautiful State in the Union. We do not think \nthere is any question about it. We think many people will confirm that. \nWe think all States have much beauty in them. But the fact of the \nmatter is that after all these years of study, all of these years of \nconflict, and all these years of having both sides mad at the \ncongressional delegation, with some wanting none and always the \nenvironmentalists wanting at least 5.7 million, if not more, since \nWayne Owens originally filed the bill in 1988, it is time to settle \nthis matter. Representative Owens' bill totaled 5.2 million, by the \nway, as I recall. The New York Congressman, who at the time he filed \nhis bill had never stepped foot inside of Utah, introduced a measure to \ndesignate 5.7 million acres, and that becomes the battle cry for these \npeople. It is an extreme battle cry.\n  At the outset, my colleagues should understand one very important \nfact. We in Utah love our State. We love and cherish our land, which is \ncomprised of some of the most beautiful and picturesque scenery in the \nworld. I am going to get into it in just a few minutes as to what we \nare doing.\n  When we talk about the Kaiparowits Plateau, we have 220,000 acres in \nthere, and of the other areas cited by my friend from New Jersey, there \nare 75,000 acres of the Dirty Devil, and 16,000 acres of the Fish and \nOwl Creek. Even this proposal is being criticized as well.\n  Mr. President, I really cannot say how disappointed I am that some of \nthe Members of this body have chosen not only to oppose the Utah \nwilderness provisions of this bill but also to engage in such \nquestionable debate about it.\n  My friend from New Jersey, Senator Bradley, issued a press release on \nFriday announcing that he would try to block the Utah wilderness \nlegislation from passing. He has a right to do that if he wants to. \nActually, for those of us involved, this is not big news. The Senator \nfrom New Jersey has done a pretty good job of blocking it so far, as \nwell as most of the rest of the bills in this amendment, since last \nApril. It is because he has that Chairman Murkowski has included our \nwilderness bill in this overall package, knowing that it is the just \nthing to do. It just seems to me that this press release is a public \nway of throwing down the gauntlet and, believe me, I am sincerely sorry \nfor that. The Senator from New Jersey has announced that he intends to \ntake down legislation that is critical to our State. What am I supposed \nto do? What would any Member of this body do if he or she found himself \nor herself in our shoes? If anyone here does not know the answer to \nthat question, he or she does not belong in the Senate.\n\n  I have heard all the rhetoric about Utah land belonging to the Nation \nas a whole. And it may surprise some of my colleagues to hear that to a \ncertain degree I agree with that. I believe certain problems and \nconcerns affecting some States must be shared nationally. But let us \nget one thing straight. The impact of this legislation, and in fact the \nadverse impact of failing to pass this bill, is going to fall on Utahns \nonly--not on New Jerseyites, but on Utahns. It will not matter to a \ncitizen of New Jersey or Florida or Wisconsin that a small town in \nrural Utah like Kanab, UT, dies a slow death because its land has been \nlocked up, unjustly locked up. It will not matter to the average \nIllinoisan that the town of Summit, UT, faces a water crisis because \nexisting water rights have not been respected in the second driest \nState in the Union.\n  Just who do my colleagues think is going to bear the heaviest \nconsequences of our decision with respect to the Utah wilderness issue? \nIn all honesty, this press release sounds like it could have been \nwritten by the lobbyists for the National Resources Defense Council. I \nsimply cannot believe Senator Bradley would have personally approved \nits content. It says that ``The current Senate Utah wilderness \nlegislation would direct that 20 million acres of Utah lands can never \nbe designated as wilderness in the future.''\n  Now, where on Earth did this come from? Neither the original bill \nthat Senator Bennett and I filed nor the substitute says any such \nthing. Moreover, the BLM has never even identified 20 million acres of \nland as wilderness worthy, as I have pointed out earlier. This figure \nrepresents 91 percent of the BLM's total landownership in Utah.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. My friend from New Jersey, Senator Bradley, knows the \ndifference between the BLM inventory and the study areas, which is why \nI really do not believe he really approved of this press release. He \ngoes on to say that ``If the bill becomes law, it would permit the \ntransformation of these lands from pristine wilderness to strip mines, \nroads and commercial development.''\n  Now, Mr. President, these statements are patently untrue. Someone in \nthe Senator's office has been grossly misled, and unfortunately these \nuntruths are being distributed to the press as though they are truths. \nIn essence, these are the facts. First, the upper number of acreage \ninvolved in this debate is over 5 million, not 20 million. Second, \nnowhere in our bill does it say that no more wilderness can ever be \ndesignated in the future.\n  Third, the land not designated as wilderness is still managed and \ncontrolled by the Federal Government in accordance with Federal land \npolicy laws and regulations. I feel very safe in saying that there will \nbe no environmentally irresponsible activity taking place on these \nlands now or in the future.\n  Fourth, there has not been a new strip mine in Utah in many years, \neven decades, and there will not be even after this bill passes. Yet \nthe opponents of this bill know that using the term ``strip mine'' \nconjures up all sorts of horrible images. Its use in this debate is \nsimply not justified.\n  In the same press release from Senator Bradley's office, he states \nthat he will continue fighting for legislation to protect 17,500 acres \nalong the New Jersey-New York border, the so-called Sterling Forest \nbill. The Senator from New Jersey is quite correct that the Sterling \nForest bill passed the Senate without an objection. As public lands \npolicy, I do not think the Sterling Forest bill was perfect, but I did \nnot stand in the way of its passage. The Senators from New Jersey, New \nYork, and surrounding areas wanted it. They represent their States. \nThis legislation, the Sterling Forest legislation primarily affects New \nJersey. If both Senators from New Jersey believe this legislation is in \nthe best interest of their State and the country, I am going to defer \nto their judgment. Ditto the legislation for the Presidio and the Taos \nPueble land exchange and the Arkansas-Oklahoma land exchange, et \ncetera, et cetera.\n\n  So I am a little annoyed, when Senator Bennett and I propose \nlegislation that has the support of our Governor, our legislature, our \nUtah association of counties, our educators throughout the State, and \nthousands of individual Utahns, that we are being second-guessed by \nSenators who do not represent this State.\n  Keep in mind, look at how much acreage we are putting in and how it \nrelates to the States in the northeast where a lot of the complaints \nare coming from. The fact is that we are being sandbagged not so much \nby our colleagues but by a well-orchestrated and well-financed campaign \nstaged by huge, huge national environmental lobbies who are pursuing \ntheir own national agenda.\n  Guess what. Their agenda is too much for the rural areas of my State. \nIt would overwhelm them. We cannot support their agenda. And guess what \nelse. The citizens of rural Utah and their local representatives cannot \neven afford to fight back. The National Resources Defense Council ran a \nhalf-page ad in the Washington Post that cost I believe $54,000. Good \ngrief. For that amount Kane County School District could pay three \nschoolteachers. And that is only one of dozens of full-page ads in \nnewspapers in this area and I guess other areas as well.\n  Actor Robert Redford has been a spokesperson for the \nenvironmentalists. I admire Bob Redford's convictions, but let us face \nit; what TV station would not want an interview with Robert Redford? \nThe deck is surely stacked against rural Utah. It is an area small in \npopulation and small in financial resources and big in tourism, and \nthey have to provide the tax base to provide for all the emergency \nservices--the helicopter services, the hospital services, the law \nenforcement services, et cetera--in some areas where they just do not \nhave the moneys to do it.\n  I urge my colleagues not to let these Utahns become victims of \nelection-year politics, and I hope the President is not trying to show \nhow committed he is to the environment on the backs of rural Utahns. I \nsuggest to my friends in these other States that you are going to have \npeculiar problems in your States that you are going to have to deal \nwith and you are going to have to have good-faith help from other \nSenators here to be able to resolve them. And we will try to help you \nresolve them as we Utah Senators always have.\n  If we allow our rural States to be abused in this manner, if we allow \nthis to happen, then the integrity of this body will have been brought \nto a new low. We will have allowed the Senate to become a blatant \ninstrument for electioneering. While I am not so naive as to think that \npolitical speeches will not be given or that politics does not play a \npart, I cannot remember a time when the interests of a specific State \non a parochial issue were sacrificed in that way. So I really urge my \ncolleagues to support the Utah wilderness provisions in the substitute \namendment offered by Senator Murkowski.\n  Let me, at this point, have printed the press release, so people can \nread it for themselves. I ask unanimous consent that the press release \nfrom Senator Bradley's office be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [For immediate release: Mar. 22, 1996]\n\nBradley Preparing to Block Environmentally Destructive Utah Wilderness \n                                  Bill\n\n       Washington, DC.--Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) said today \n     he's ready to take the floor on Monday and point out all of \n     the problems with the Utah Wilderness Bill, if it is offered \n     as part of an omnibus lands package.\n       ``The battle to preserve America's wilderness legacy has \n     been joined. The Utah Wilderness bill is so bad for the \n     environment that I will pursue any possible way of stopping \n     it. It contains unprecedented anti-environmental language \n     that must be debated at length,'' Bradley said.\n       Bradley pointed out that the current Senate Utah Wilderness \n     legislation would direct that 20 million acres of Utah lands \n     can never be designated as wilderness in the future. If it \n     becomes law, it would permit the transformation of these \n     lands from pristine wilderness to strip mines, roads and \n     commercial development.\n       ``It is unfortunate that this bad Utah wilderness provision \n     is being folded into a package with less controversial and \n     much needed legislation such as the already-passed Sterling \n     Forest measure and a bill for the Presidio in the San \n     Francisco Bay area. If passed with the Utah wilderness \n     legislation, the package would set a horrible precedent by \n     making drastic changes to our precious lands policies.''\n       ``It isn't right to swallow a pill that would be poison to \n     so much of America's great western lands just because it is \n     sugar-coated with some good smaller preservation bills. Our \n     public lands belong to all Americans, whether they live in \n     Utah or New Jersey. They should never be given away to a few \n     special interests,'' Bradley stated.\n       As for Sterling Forest, the Senator was firm in his refusal \n     to give up on the measure that would protect 17,500 acres \n     along the New York-New Jersey border. He pointed out that \n     Sterling Forest has already passed the Senate without a \n     single objection, and is awaiting action in the House of \n     Representatives.\n       ``If Sterling Forest is included in a bill along with this \n     destructive Utah Wilderness measure, I believe President \n     Clinton will veto it. If we are to save Sterling Forest, we \n     must stop the packaging of these bills, which is no more than \n     an attempt to get us to accept a bad public lands bill by \n     wrapping it up in shiny paper.'' Senator Bradley said.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, much has been made about Utahns and how \nthey feel about these issues. But my colleagues might say they do not \nknow what Secretary Babbitt has to say about our proposal. That makes \n100 of us, because, frankly, I do not know. I do not know what specific \nproblems the Secretary has with our bill. I do not know what his \nspecific thinking is on the water language, the military overflight \nsection, the section dealing with cultural and archeological sites \nfound within designated areas on the State's school trust land \nexchange, proposed in the bill. I do not know how he might modify them. \nHonestly, I do not know.\n  I have used the term AWOL, absent without leadership, on this floor \nin recent months to describe the administration's efforts in addressing \nour drug problem. This strategy of criticizing without putting anything \npositive on the table was also evident during consideration of the \nbudget. It seems to be typical of the Clinton administration across the \nboard.\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\n  To date, the Interior Department has not even sent us the letter in \nwhich Secretary Babbitt says he will recommend a veto of the omnibus \npackage if the Utah wilderness bill is included. I suppose the \nSecretary assumed that we would have the privilege of reading his \nletter in the newspaper, which of course we have. I do not know why the \nSecretary has not tried to work with us in order to come to an \nagreement on the many critical issues contained in this measure. We \nhave been working on it, just this measure alone, for the last 20 \nyears; but, in particular, writing it for the last 15 months. The \nSecretary has not attempted to contact me or to have his staff contact \nmy staff to discuss how certain boundaries for designated areas might \npose management problems for his agency, the application of wilderness \ncriteria, the special management directives, or any other concerns he \nhas with this legislation.\n  It is true that last July, during the Energy Committee's hearing on \nour bill, Sylvia Baca, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and \nMinerals Management for the Department of Interior, presented testimony \non behalf of the Department and the Secretary on the bill as it was \nintroduced. She included the following statement in her written \ntestimony: ``If the bill were presented to the President in its current \nform, Secretary Babbitt would recommend that he veto it.'' What is even \nmore amazing to me is that Ms. Baca's explanation for this position is \nbased on the Interior Department's noninvolvement in the wilderness \nissue. The Department admitted that it has been AWOL on this issue, \nwhich is so important to our State.\n  When Senator Craig asked her why the Department did not agree with \nthe 1991 BLM recommendation for wilderness and why there was no attempt \nby the current administration to modify it, here was her response:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, first of all I would like to point out that \n     the Interior Department did not think that wilderness \n     legislation was going to come forward. We did not come here \n     today with a specific wilderness acreage number. I explained \n     earlier that is because we have not been involved in the \n     wilderness issue.\n\n  The Secretary has done nothing but criticize. He has offered nothing \nin the way of constructive suggestions for improving the bill. This can \nonly mean he intended to recommend a veto without regard to what the \nbill was going to say. This strikes me very much as a knee jerk \napproach to protecting the environment, and it is as bad as those who \nsay we should have no environmental protection at all--and there are \nplenty in my State who would like that position.\n  But we have had to be responsible here. We are the people who have \nhad to handle this issue. We have been blasted by both sides, both \nextremes on this issue, for the last 20 years--but certainly the last \nfew years in particular.\n  Fortunately, my colleagues in the Senate have been more helpful and \nmore sincerely interested in resolving this matter. They have offered \nconstructive suggestions for changes, many of which we have \nincorporated in this bill, many of which have changed some of the areas \ncriticized by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. Apparently he \nhas not read the bill yet, at least the substitute, but I hope he will.\n\n  The bill before us today is not the same bill that was discussed last \nJuly. The bill we are debating today is a much changed bill. I am not \nsure it is better, but for those on the other side of this issue, on \nthe environmental side, it is a better bill. It is fair. It is \nreasonable. And, above all, it is balanced. And we are trying to bring \ntogether everybody in Utah, not just one side of the equation.\n  The Secretary now thinks this issue of such import that he is \nthreatening a veto of this entire package of public land legislation. \nThis does not square with Ms. Baca's testimony that the Department has \njust been too busy to focus on wilderness. We in Utah have been \nfocusing on it for 2 decades. We have forged ahead in the 104th \nCongress, to attempt to resolve this issue once and for all. I would \nlike to have the Secretary with us, I really would. I would have been \npleased to work with him every step of the way. I really would.\n  I know Senator Bennett feels the same way. But, even as other \nSenators have offered amendments in the Energy Committee and during \ninformal discussions, Secretary Babbitt is content to be silent except \nfor a veto threat. His position today is the same as it was in July, \nwhen Ms. Baca testified for the Clinton administration. This is a \nlittle like a country threatening the use of nuclear weapons without \nbothering to tell the world why it is attacking.\n  It is time to move ahead with this legislation. The question of \nwilderness in Utah has gone on long enough. It has been studied to \ndeath. We are tired of it. It is time to designate new wilderness in \nUtah and to remove millions of acres from the regulatory limbo that \nthey have been in. Let us give them legal status as wilderness, or \nresponsibly manage them for other uses. I hope the Secretary will \ndetermine this is an important objective, because it is.\n  Let me answer the question many of my colleagues have posed to me \nover the past few years and certainly in recent months and that is: \nWhere are the citizens of Utah on this issue? Over the last several \ndays we have seen advertisements in the Washington Post, Washington \nTimes, Rollcall and the Hill magazine, claiming several things. First, \nthere is the claim that 3 out of 4 Utahns support the so-called \ncitizens proposal, that would designate 5.7 million acres of land as \nwilderness.\n  Second, it is claimed that Americans are opposed to our program by a \nmargin of 9 to 1.\n  This first statement refers to the process the Utah congressional \ndelegation and Governor Leavitt followed last year to obtain input from \nour local citizens. During our statewide regional hearings we requested \nthat any further comments and proposals on the wilderness issue be \nsubmitted in writing or by telephone to Governor Leavitt's office. The \nGovernor's office made a tally of these letters and phone calls. The \ninaccurate claims made in these newspaper advertisements by the \nopponents of this bill stem from the summary report developed by \nGovernor Leavitt's office on these additional calls and letters. Rather \nthan explain this discrepancy to my colleagues, I have asked Governor \nLeavitt to tell us in his own words the truth about the comments and \ncalls in his office. His letter says this:\n\n       Dear Senator Hatch: As you know, there has been substantial \n     confusion about the public sentiment in Utah concerning the \n     BLM wilderness issue. Please accept this letter as an \n     explanation of the public response which my office received \n     with respect to this issue. Personnel in the Governor's \n     Office of Planning and Budget read, recorded, and responded \n     to each of the 3,031 individual letters which were received \n     last year and also categorized the 551 individual public \n     testimonies received at the public hearings held in Utah last \n     spring and summer.\n       In examining this information, 51% of these letters and \n     testimonies were in favor of no wilderness designation \n     whatsoever or something less than the 5.7 million acre \n     proposal.\n       Certain groups throughout the state have publicly stated \n     that support for 5.7 million acres of wilderness has ranged \n     from 70% at a minimum, to upwards of 75%. In Utah and \n     throughout the country, these numbers have been quoted in \n     numerous newspaper stories and in various correspondence, yet \n     no one has ever contacted my office for verification of the \n     numbers. As is evident by the above numbers, this is most \n     definitely a misrepresentation of actual public sentiment.\n       In addition, there have been numerous surveys conducted on \n     the wilderness issue over the last year. These surveys show \n     that those respondents supporting 5.7 million acres have \n     ranged from 19% to 36% depending on how the survey was \n     structured and the way in which questions were asked. In \n     these same surveys, 29% to 60% favored 2 million acres or \n     less, also depending on survey structure and format of \n     questions.\n       It is important that lawmakers in Washington have factual \n     information when making decisions as important as this. The \n     information supporting the numbers I have offered is all on \n     file in the Governor's Office of Planning and Budget and \n     available for anyone with questions or concerns. Thank you \n     for your commitment to this issue and for the work you have \n     done in the pursuit of the resolution of the wilderness \n     debate.\n\n  Mr. President, this letter is clear enough. The figure utilized by \nthe opponents of our measure misconstrues the information tallied by \nthe Governor's office. It is interesting to note, this figure has \nmysteriously risen during this debate. First I saw a report that \nindicated the figure was 68 percent. Then it went to 70 percent. These \nrecent adds have it at 73 percent, and one ad indicated it was 3 out of \n4 Utahns, or 75 percent. Where are they getting these numbers?\n\n[[Page S2775]]\n\n  The second statement that Americans oppose the Utah wilderness bill \nby a ratio of 9 to 1 comes from a straw vote conducted by USA Weekend. \nThis feature in many of the weekend's Sunday papers asked me to present \nmy position on wilderness opposite Robert Redford, the well-known Utahn \nwho owns the Sundance ski resort, which is located by the way, among \nsome of the most beautiful acres in the world.\n\n  At the conclusion of the article, the editors asked readers to write, \nphone or e-mail their votes for which position they supported.\n  Similar to the barrage of advertisements, letters and phone calls and \nmailers my colleagues are receiving, the USA Weekend was bombarded with \nresponses. In fact, the responses were 9 to 1 against the wilderness \nproposal.\n  But USA Weekend was careful to point out that this is not a \nscientific poll. It was self-selected, which is a nice way of saying \nthat people could vote early and often. The results of this call-in \nwere, of course, skewed by those who responded to the urgings of \nnational environmental organizations that they call in. In fact, just \none of these groups, the Wilderness Society, has almost four times as \nmany members as I have constituents. Think about that, four times as \nmany members as Senator Bennett and I have constituents in our whole \nState. To their credit, they can mobilize these members at a moment's \nnotice, which is what they have been doing on this matter for months--\nfor years now--but certainly over the past few weeks and certainly \nduring that particular USA Weekend article.\n  Let us talk about real polls.\n  Dan Jones & Associates, Utah's most prominent and well-respected \npollster, who has a tremendous record for accuracy, has conducted \nseveral surveys on this matter. Last April, he conducted a poll for \nRepresentative Waldholtz, which revealed the following: Survey for \nRepresentative Waldholtz, April 26, 1995--Dan Jones & Associates: 36 \npercent were for 1.2 million acres; 24 percent for 2.0 million acres. \nWe are a little over 2 million acres in the substitute bill that is in \nthe substitute amendment. 23 percent of those polled wanted 5.7 million \nacres. In other words, a lot more people were for 1.2 million acres or \n2.0 million acres than there were for the 5.7 million acres, which \nreceived only 23 percent; 17 percent of those polled were not reported.\n  Later in the year, in May 1995, Dan Jones conducted a poll for the \nWilderness Education Project, and the results were generally the same: \n21 percent preferred 1 million acres; 16 percent for 1.2 million acres; \n20 percent for 1.9 million acres; 15 percent for 2.8 million acres; 19 \npercent for 5.7 million acres. It actually had gone down; 8 percent did \nnot know.\n  In June of last year, Dan conducted a poll for the Deseret News, \nwhich had the following results: 4 percent for zero acres, which means \n4 percent did not want any wilderness at all in Utah; 18 percent were \nfor 1 million acres; 26 percent for 1.8 million acres; 36 percent for \n5.7 million acres; 7 percent for other, and 8 percent did not know. The \nhighest percentage it has ever been for 5.7 million acres has been 36 \npercent, and then only after a massive publicity and advertising \ncampaign done by these environmental organizations who have more money \nthan anybody in Utah, certainly more than anybody on our side, and \ncertainly more than the poor little people in these rural areas. The \nrural people, for the most part, do not want any or at least want very \nlittle acreage, but they have agreed to 1 million acres. And, now \nreluctantly they have gone along with the delegation--some of them have \ngone along with the delegation--for the 2 million acres but are very \nupset about it.\n  In addition to these polls, KUTV Channel 2 and the Coalition for \nUtah's Future conducted a poll in May. Their results were similar to \nthe Dan Jones polls. This survey was conducted from May 5 to 17, 1995, \nby Valley Research: 5 percent for zero acres; 12 percent for 1 million \nacres; 12 percent for 1.9 million acres; 10 percent for 2.9 million \nacres; 23 for 3.2 million acres; and 31 percent for 5.7 million acres; \n8 percent do not agree with any.\n  The summary of these polls is twofold. First, a majority of \nrespondents in almost every poll, except for the respondents in the \nKUTV/Coalition poll, favored a designation of 2 million or fewer acres. \nIn the Waldholtz poll, it was 60 percent; Deseret News, 48 percent; \nwilderness education was 57 percent.\n\n  Second, the 5.7 million acre proposal was not supported by a majority \nof respondents in any poll: Waldholtz, 23 percent; KUTV, 31 percent; \nDeseret News, 36 percent; wilderness education, 19 percent.\n  So, if my colleagues are looking for a definitive answer on how the \nmajority of Utahns feel when it comes to a final acreage figure on BLM \ndesignation, these are the more reliable numbers. They are from \nreputable sources, polling organizations that use scientific methods, \nfrom both the left and the right.\n  I think a far more accurate assessment of where Utahns stand on this \nissue should be a letter that we recently received, Senator Bennett and \nI, dated March 22, last Friday. This letter is on behalf of 300 of \nUtah's top officials--Democrats, Republicans, moderates, liberals, \nconservatives--300 of the elected officials in Utah, the vast majority \nof them:\n\n       Dear Senator: You recently received a letter dated March \n     15, 1996 from a group of twenty calling themselves ``The \n     Coalition of Utah Elected Officials,'' asking the ``Utah \n     Congressional Delegation to withdraw S. 884 and reconsider \n     the direction they have taken on wilderness.'' The letter \n     states, ``most Utahns oppose S. 884.'' It further states that \n     ``most local people consider this to be stridently anti-\n     environmental legislation, not the carefully balanced package \n     the Utah Congressional Delegation has been claiming it to be.\n\n  The letter goes on to say this:\n\n       These statements are not only preposterous--but blatantly \n     untrue. The facts are that most Utahns do not want large \n     amounts of acreage designated as wilderness in Utah. We the \n     undersigned Democrats and Republicans strongly support \n     Senators Hatch and Bennett in their balanced approach to Utah \n     wilderness.\n       In reality, the Utah State Senate endorsed the provisions \n     contained in the Hatch-Bennett proposal unanimously (27 to \n     0)--I might add that the leader of the AFL-CIO in Utah, a \n     member of the Utah State Senate, voted in support of this \n     resolution. . .\n\n  While the Utah State house voted 62 to 6, or 92 percent in favor. \nAcross the State, elected commissioners in 27 of 29 counties support \nthis bill. As this letter indicates, over 90 percent of Utah's elected \ncounty leaders support the Utah wilderness proposal now before the \nSenate.\n\n       Early in 1995, the Governor of Utah and all members of the \n     Utah Congressional Delegation specifically tasked the elected \n     county officials in each county where wilderness is being \n     proposed, to hold public hearings and from those public \n     hearings, develop a proposal for wilderness designation on \n     the Bureau of Land Management lands in the affected counties. \n     Numerous public hearings were held in every county where \n     lands were proposed for wilderness designation. The county \n     officials then designated their proposals for designating \n     lands as wilderness from the public hearings. In every county \n     where lands were proposed for wilderness designation, the \n     county officials made their recommendations based on what \n     they heard at the hearings. Many county officials recommended \n     more acreage than they knew their citizens wanted, but they \n     knew they had to do so in order to make a bill acceptable to \n     Congress. Some of those county officials have paid a dear \n     political price for their recommendations.\n\n  I can certainly affirm that.\n\n       After the county officials made their recommendations, the \n     Governor and Congressional Delegation held five regional \n     hearings around the State. The environmental community, both \n     in and outside Utah, was well organized and paid its \n     partisans to testify. They even rented buses and vans to \n     transport these people from location to location.\n\n  And I can testify to that. We had almost the same people at every \nlocation, demanding to testify, saying the same things each time, and \nmaking it look like they had more numbers than they really did.\n\n       The testimony they gave was based on emotion and not the \n     requirements of the Wilderness Act itself. Their testimony \n     ignored the professional recommendations of the BLM which \n     based its proposals on the criteria of the 1964 Wilderness \n     Act.\n       The Governor and Congressional Delegation then developed \n     what is now title XX of omnibus package S. 884. Many in Utah \n     believe it contains too much acreage. It represents more than \n     was recommended by the elected county officials who held \n     the local public hearings. It represents more than the \n     State legislature has recommended at least twice in the \n     last 4 years by nearly unanimous votes.\n       The people of Utah live in a State with approximately 67 \n     percent Federal land ownership and another 13 percent State \n     ownership, but managed under the Federally enacted\n\n[[Page S2776]]\n\n     State Enabling Act. Utah already has millions of acres in \n     five National Parks, two National Recreation Areas, four \n     National Monuments, 13 Forest Service wilderness areas, and \n     BLM areas of Critical Environmental Concern. The unelected \n     State Director of the BLM manages more of Utah than does its \n     elected Governor.\n       The BLM wilderness debate in Utah has dragged on for more \n     than 15 years at a cost to taxpayers of over $10 million. We \n     believe it is time to end the debate, pass the balanced \n     Hatch-Bennett proposal and bring some peace and stability to \n     people of Utah who must live daily with results of this \n     debate. We the undersigned are a few of the elected officials \n     in Utah who support Title XX of this bill. We want it passed \n     and enacted into law.\n\n  As I said, there are 300-some Democrat and Republican elected \nofficials who have endorsed this letter. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis letter and the attachments thereto be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    The Truth About Utah Wilderness\n\n                                                    March 22, 1996\n       Dear Senator: You recently received a letter dated March \n     15, 1996 from a group of twenty calling themselves ``The \n     Coalition of Utah Elected Officials,'' asking the ``Utah \n     Congressional Delegation to withdraw S. 884 and reconsider \n     the direction they have taken on wilderness.'' The letter \n     states that ``most Utahns oppose S. 884.'' It further states \n     that ``most local people consider this to be stridently anti-\n     environmental legislation, not the carefully balanced package \n     the Utah Congressional Delegation has been claiming it to \n     be.''\n       These statements are not only preposterous, but blatantly \n     untrue. The facts are that most Utahns do not want large \n     amounts of acreage designated as wilderness in Utah. We the \n     undersigned Democrats and Republicans strongly support \n     Senators Hatch and Bennett in their balanced approach to Utah \n     wilderness.\n       In reality, the Utah State Senate endorsed the provisions \n     contained in the Hatch-Bennett proposal unanimously (27-0), \n     while the Utah State House voted 62-6, or 92% in favor. \n     Across the state, elected commissioners in 27 of 29 counties \n     support this bill. As this letter indicates, over 90% of \n     Utah's elected county leaders support the Utah wilderness \n     proposal now before the Senate.\n       Early in 1995, the Governor of Utah and all members of the \n     Utah Congressional Delegation specifically tasked the elected \n     county officials in each county where wilderness was being \n     proposed, to hold public hearings and from those public \n     hearings, develop a proposal for wilderness designation on \n     Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Lands in the affected \n     counties. Numerous public hearings were held in every county \n     where lands were proposed for wilderness designation. The \n     county officials then developed their proposals for \n     designating lands as wilderness from the public hearings. In \n     every county where lands were proposed for wilderness \n     designation, the county officials made their recommendations \n     based on what they heard at the hearings. Many county \n     officials recommended more acreage than they knew their \n     citizens wanted, but they knew they had to do so in order to \n     make a bill acceptable to Congress. Some of those county \n     officials have paid a dear political price for their \n     recommendations.\n       After the county officials made their recommendations, the \n     Governor and Congressional Delegation held five regional \n     hearings around the state. The environmental community, both \n     in and outside of Utah was well organized and paid its \n     partisans to testify. They even rented busses and vans to \n     transport these people from location to location. The \n     testimony they gave was based on emotion and not the \n     requirements of the Wilderness Act itself. Their testimony \n     ignored the professional recommendations of the BLM which \n     based its proposals on the criteria of the 1964 Wilderness \n     Act.\n       The Governor and Congressional Delegation then developed \n     what is now Title XX of omnibus package, S. 884. Many in Utah \n     believe it contains too much acreage. It represents more than \n     was recommended by the elected county officials who held the \n     local public hearings. It represents more than the State \n     Legislature has recommended at least twice in the last four \n     years by nearly unanimous votes.\n       The people of Utah live in a state with approximately 67% \n     federal land ownership and another 13% state ownership, but \n     managed under the federally enacted State Enabling Act. Utah \n     already has millions of acres in five National Parks, two \n     National Recreation Areas, four National Monuments, thirteen \n     Forest Service wilderness areas, and BLM Areas of Critical \n     Environmental Concern (ACEC). The unelected State Director of \n     the BLM manages more of Utah than does its elected Governor.\n       The BLM wilderness debate in Utah has dragged on for more \n     than 15 years at a cost to taxpayers of over $10 million. We \n     believe it is time to end the debate, pass the balanced \n     Hatch-Bennett proposal and bring some peace and stability to \n     the people of Utah who must live daily with results of this \n     debate. We the undersigned are a few of the elected officials \n     in Utah who support Title XX of this omnibus bill. We want it \n     passed and enacted into law.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Hansen, Millard County Auditor; Linda Carter, \n           Millard County Recorder; Ed Philips, Millard County \n           Sheriff; LeRay Jackson, Millard County Attorney; John \n           Henrie, Millard County Commissioner; Donovan Dafoe, \n           Mayor, Delta Utah; Merrill Nielson, Mayor, Lynndyl, \n           Utah; Phil Lovell, Mayor, Leamington, Utah; B.

Just last Sunday we read comments that one large newspaper \nin the State has editorialized against this. That is true. There is no \ndoubt that they are very sincere in what they are doing. We have \nrespect for them. But the other large newspaper, the other large major \nnewspaper in Utah--we have five that are quite large--but the other \nmajor large paper in Utah that has written on this said, ``Let's get \noff dead center on the Utah\n\n[[Page S2778]]\n\nwilderness debate.'' This is the Deseret News editorial. I will just \nread a little bit of it and then put it in the Record as well.\n\n       Politics is supposed to involve the art of compromise.

Mr. President, I am going to ask unanimous consent that \nthe following also be inserted: a letter from the Governor, Mike \nLeavitt; a letter from the speaker of the Utah House of Representatives \nand the president of the Utah State Senate, along with a resolution \nadopted last year by the Utah State Legislature. I also put in the \nRecord a letter signed by over 300 elected officials we received just \nthis morning; a letter from the Utah Parent Teacher Association; a \nletter from the Utah State Board of Education; a letter from the Utah \nFarm Bureau; and a resolution from the board of trustees of the School \nand Institutional Trust Lands Administration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all of those be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    State of Utah,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                               Salt Lake City, UT, March 14, 1996.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Utah is a beautiful and unique state. \n     It comprises 55 million acres of diverse landscapes ranging \n     from high alpine ranges of the Rocky Mountains, red rock \n     wonderlands of the Colorado Plateau, deserts of the Great \n     Basin and rich river valleys. We Utahns feel blessed with \n     what we have been entrusted to care for.\n       These beautiful lands are attracting millions of visitors \n     and tens of thousands of new residents annually. Due partly \n     to this attraction, Utah is also experiencing an era of \n     robust economic growth. During this time of growth and \n     prosperity it is more evident than ever before that it is our \n     responsibility to preserve and carefully manage these diverse \n     landscapes and eco-systems for current\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\n     and future generations of Utahns and all Americans.\n       Of Utah's 55 million acres, some 37 million acres, or over \n     67%, is owned or controlled by the Federal Government. Most \n     of these federal lands are managed by the Forest Service, \n     National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management. Much of \n     this public land is already preserved for future generations. \n     Two million acres have been set aside as National Parks, \n     Monuments and Recreation Areas. Another one million acres \n     have been set aside as National Forest Wilderness or as \n     wildlife refuges. However, we do believe that an additional 2 \n     million acres should be protected for America's future.\n       Wilderness is certainly one important way in which we can \n     and should protect land for the future. However, it is not \n     the only way. Other means of protection include designation \n     as: Areas of Critical Environmental Concern, Wild and Scenic \n     Rivers, Natural Areas, Primitive Areas or withdrawals for \n     specific purposes. Also, the State of Utah has cooperated \n     with organizations such as the Nature Conservancy, the Rocky \n     Mountain Elk Foundation and private land trusts to preserve \n     state and private lands for wildlife habitat and watershed. \n     We believe that land preservation and management must utilize \n     all available tools and be a cooperative process among all \n     federal, local and state agencies as well as involving the \n     general public.\n       I believe we can all agree that Wilderness is one important \n     tool for protecting public land. How much land should be \n     protected as Wilderness is more difficult. The process of \n     determining how much BLM land in Utah should be preserved as \n     Wilderness has taken more than 17 years, at a total cost of \n     more than $10 million in federal dollars. Many more millions, \n     yet unquantified, have been spent by state and local \n     governments, businesses and the general public. Literally \n     hundreds of hearings have been held and thousands upon \n     thousands of comments written, read and heard.\n       During the last year along more than 50 public meetings \n     were held in Utah. Seven public meetings were attended by me \n     and members of Utah's Congressional Delegation. Also, two \n     field hearings were held in Utah by the House Subcommittee on \n     National Parks, Forests and Lands. I have received more than \n     22,000 comments on the issue in my office alone.\n       What is evident from the discussion over the last year and \n     the last 17 years is that all Utahns care deeply about the \n     land. Yet, there is and will always be a great divisiveness \n     in the eyes of the public on how much Wilderness should be \n     designated. Most citizens of rural Utah, where these lands \n     are located, are strongly opposed to any Wilderness. Yet some \n     citizens of Utah's urban areas would like to protect an \n     additional 5.7 million acres.\n       Over the last year, Utah's Congressional Delegation and I \n     have attempted to develop a Wilderness proposed which \n     balances these differing points of view. The result is S 884, \n     ``Utah Public Lands Management Act of 1995,'' which has been \n     introduced by Senators Orrin Hatch and Robert Bennett. \n     Senators Hatch and Bennett have worked long and hard with me \n     and many Utahns of diverse opinions to develop this proposal. \n     They deserve a great deal of credit for their diligence.\n       S 884 is an honest approach to resolving this issue and \n     proposes over 50 Wilderness areas. The bill includes Utah's \n     ``Crown Jewels,'' which are such well known areas as Grand \n     Gulch, Desolation Canyon, San Rafael Swell, Escalante \n     Canyons, Westwater Canyon and Parunuweap Canyon. S 884 \n     includes areas which represent numerous ``eco-systems'' \n     including: high mountain ranges, river canyons, red rock \n     desert and unique areas in Utah's West Desert.\n       The Utah Congressional Delegation and I have committed \n     considerable time and resources to this process. This bill \n     reflects our commitment to the importance of what is fair, \n     balanced and good for the citizens of Utah and the United \n     States. It will not please either extreme but presents the \n     best solution for Utah and the nation and has the support of \n     the mainstream citizens of our state. As the Governor of the \n     great State of Utah, I fully support S 884 which designates \n     two million acres of BLM land in Utah as Wilderness, an area \n     larger than the State of Delaware. With these lands protected \n     as Wilderness, we as a state will move forward to properly \n     managed and protect all of Utah's diverse public lands in \n     cooperation with federal land agencies. I respectfully \n     encourage you to support S 884.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael O. Leavitt,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                       Utah State Legislature,\n\n                          Salt Lake City, Utah, February 14, 1996.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: As legislative leaders, we want to \n     reaffirm the position taken by the Fifty-first Legislature of \n     the State of Utah as it relates to the amount of BLM land \n     designated as wilderness in Utah.\n       HCR 12, Resolution Supporting Wilderness Designation, by \n     Representative Bradley Johnson, states very clearly the \n     process by which wilderness was to be identified and \n     quantified. That process was followed, and the local \n     political entities acted very responsibly when they \n     recommended that a little more than 1 million acres receive \n     wilderness status.\n       The addition of acreage bringing the total amount to be \n     added to the wilderness proposal to 1.8 million was an \n     unsettling surprise. Yet, in a spirit of compromise, this \n     total amount would be acceptable. We believe the addition of \n     any more acreage, however, would be an affront to the \n     citizens of this state and the process put in place that made \n     the original recommendation. Furthermore, we believe the \n     addition of more land would be tantamount to rhetoric which \n     is without a rational or factual basis.\n       The Fifty-first Legislature has spoken clearly on BLM \n     wilderness designation. To lock up more land to an uncertain \n     future in a state where 80 percent of the land area is \n     subject to some form of government restriction and control is \n     a policy which lacks sensitivity and foresight. This policy \n     blind spot is simply inappropriate. To shackle future \n     generations in this state with the unbendable restrictions \n     wilderness designation imposes is nothing more than a \n     ``takings'' of the hopes and dreams of Utahns whose heritage \n     and economic roots are tied to these lands. These lands are \n     not threatened and wilderness designation will not provide \n     any additional protection that is already provided for by law \n     governing the management of these lands.\n       For more than 100 years, there has been a harmony between \n     the land and the land user. A dependence on the part of both \n     has grown up with a healthy mutual respect. Questionable \n     science has been injected into the wilderness decision-making \n     process by those who are disjointed and removed from the land \n     they claim to befriend.\n       We reaffirm our position on wilderness designation \n     articulated in the last legislative session and as that you \n     consider it to be the position of the State of Utah. If we \n     can be helpful and answer your questions in addressing your \n     concerns relative to this issue, we would be most amenable to \n     doing what is necessary so that your decision is made with \n     the very best, accurate information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Melvin R.

and additionally, \n     because designation of wilderness lands is a federal action, \n     that federal funds be appropriated to pay for appraisals of \n     state lands and federal lands to be exchanged;\n       (5) that every effort be made to ensure that there be no \n     net loss of state or private lands and no increase in federal \n     ownership as a result of wilderness designation in Utah;\n       (6) that the designation of wilderness not result in the \n     creation, either formally or informally, of buffer zones and \n     management zones around, contiguous, or on lands affected by \n     wilderness designation;\n       (7) that all valid existing rights and historical uses be \n     allowed to be fully exercised without undue restriction or \n     economic hardship on lands designated as wilderness as \n     provided in the Wilderness Act of 1964; and\n       (8) that management of vegetation, reservoirs, and similar \n     facilities on watershed lands designated as wilderness be \n     continued by state or private means.\n       Be it further RESOLVED that the Legislature and the \n     Governor conclude that elected county officials, after \n     extensive public input, should develop the wilderness \n     proposals and the conditions for acceptable designation of \n     wilderness lands within their respective counties, with the \n     aggregate of these respective county recommendations \n     constituting the basis of the state proposal for BLM \n     wilderness designation in Utah.

This bill \n     impacts the school of our state. Federal land designations \n     capture school trust lands which were set aside at statehood \n     to support Utah schools because 69% of our state is untaxed. \n     Historically, promises to trade the captured land for land \n     outside those designations have not been honored. We support \n     S. 884 because the bill:\n       provides a responsible wilderness designation;\n       provides a process of equitable compensation to the school \n     children;\n       provides for responsible water development under existing \n     state laws.\n       We strongly oppose H.R. 1500, America's Redrock Wilderness \n     Act of 1995 because the bill:\n       captures over a million acres of the school children's land \n     without any provision for exchange;\n       designates wilderness lands that do not meet the \n     Congressional definition of wilderness;\n       is not supported by the Utah Congressional delegation.\n       We rely on your commitment to the future generations of the \n     school children of Utah by supporting S. 884.\n           Sincerely,\n     Linda M. Parkinson,\n       President.\n     Paula M.

Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I strive to be an advocate for \n     children, as I am sure you do also. I am concerned that \n     Utah's school children stand to lose critical resources which \n     would fund their education under H.R. 1500.\n       Therefore, I urge your support of S. 884. This legislation \n     includes provisions to protect the school trust lands within \n     Utah. It is vital that these lands be capable of producing \n     income which in turn supports the public education of Utah's \n     children.\n       Utah receives minimal federal dollars for education when \n     compared to other states. At the same time, we have more \n     children per taxpayer to educate than any other state.\n       Please align your position on the side of the children. \n     Vote in favor of S. 884.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Janet A. Cannon,\n     Member, Utah State Board of Education.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                  Utah Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                             Salt Lake City, UT, October 27, 1995.\n     Re S. 884.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: This letter is to reaffirm the support \n     of the Utah Farm Bureau Federation for Senate Bill 884, the \n     Utah Wilderness bill introduced by you and Senator Bennett, \n     with a companion bill in the House. The Utah Farm Bureau \n     Federation has nearly 22,000 member families, spread across \n     the entire state with members in every single county of the \n     state. It is responsibly estimated that there are about \n     93,000 citizens of Utah in these 22,000 families. A large \n     majority of the farms and ranchers in Utah are members of \n     Farm Bureau. Also, we have members who are not currently \n     farming or ranching, but who may be absentee owners of farms \n     or ranches or who are sons and daughters or grandsons and \n     granddaughters of active farmers.\n       The basic provisions of this bill have been the subject of \n     widespread discussion among our members. Some would have \n     liked an even smaller total acreage than the 1.8 million in \n     the bill. But we recognize this is a good compromise between \n     the radical 5.7 million acre bill proposed by some groups, \n     and the ``zero wilderness'' position of some.\n       We are particularly pleased with the release language, the \n     effort to protect vitally important water rights, the \n     protection against de-facto buffer zones, and the overall \n     attempt in the bill to comply with the original intent of \n     Congress in the 1964 Wilderness Act. Above all, it is \n     critically important that we end this long, divisive and very \n     costly debate over what is and what is not formally \n     designated wilderness in Utah. Public lands are absolutely \n     essential to the economic viability of rural Utah. We need to \n     get this issue settled.\n       We compliment you and other sponsors of this legislation. \n     We assure you of our support and urge every effort to obtain \n     passage of the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          C. Booth Wallentine,\n\n                                      Executive Vice President and\n     Chief Administrative Officer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                          Resolution No. 95-05\n\n       Whereas, legislation currently pending in Congress, H.R. \n     1745 and S. 884, would designate wilderness areas on Bureau \n     of Land Management lands in the State of Utah; and\n       Whereas, the designated wilderness areas would encompass \n     school and institutional trust lands; and\n       Whereas, said legislation provides for the exchange of the \n     included school and institutional trust lands for other lands \n     owned by the federal government outside of the designated \n     wilderness areas; and\n       Whereas, the federally-owned lands are currently subject to \n     leasing under the federal Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 180 et seq.); and\n       Whereas, the federal Mineral Leasing Act provides that the \n     State of Utah shall receive fifty per cent (50%) of the \n     revenues from the leasing or production of minerals on those \n     lands; and\n       Whereas, the valuation which the School and Institutional \n     Trust Lands Administration has placed upon the lands to be \n     exchanged has taken into account the rights of the state of \n     Utah under the Mineral Leasing Act; and\n       Whereas, federal and state laws do not currently allow the \n     School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration to sell \n     the mineral estate; and\n       Whereas, the proposed language in the federal bills would \n     make the obligation to share revenue a valid existing right \n     applicable to all subsequent owners, should the School and \n     Institutional Trust Lands Administration no longer own the \n     mineral estate; and\n       Whereas, the trust is seeking to acquire the targeted \n     federal lands listed in the federal bills because of the \n     potential for development; and\n       Whereas, the Board of Trustees desires to ensure that, \n     based upon the valuation provided by the School and \n     Institutional Trust Lands Administration and accepted by this \n     Board as of the date of this resolution, the State of Utah \n     receives revenues from the production of minerals on the \n     lands which become school trust lands as result of the \n     exchange provided for in H.R. 1745 and S. 884.\n       Therefore, be it Resolved, That, subject to the condition \n     that the lands to be exchanged with the federal government as \n     part of the directed exchange currently included in H.R. 1745 \n     and S. 884 are of approximately equal value, as approved by \n     this Board, such valuation taking into account the right of \n     the State of Utah to receive fifty per cent (50%) of the \n     revenue from the production of minerals that are leased \n     pursuant to the federal Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 180 et seq.), the Board of Trustees of the School \n     and Institutional Trust Lands Administration supports the \n     inclusion of language in H.R. 1745 and S. 884 which provides \n     for the distribution of fifty per cent (50%) of the proceeds \n     resulting from the production of leased minerals on the lands \n     acquired by the state, which minerals would have been covered \n     by the federal Mineral Leasing Act (as amended through the \n     date of enactment of H.R. 1745 and S. 884) if the lands had \n     been retained in federal ownership. The Board also supports \n     language in H.R. 1745 and S. 884 which provides that;\n       1. the proceeds shall be collected by the Administration \n     and distributed, after deduction of a pro rata share of \n     administrative costs, to the state of Utah;\n       2. disputes concerning the collection and distribution of \n     the revenue shall be resolved pursuant to Utah state law;\n       3. that such obligation to collect and distribute proceeds \n     shall end if the trust no longer owns the mineral estate; and\n       4. the collection and sharing of the proceeds from timber \n     production shall also be shared in accordance with current \n     applicable law.\n       The language supported by the Board is attached hereto and \n     incorporated herein by\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\n     this reference, consisting of the Committee Draft of H.R. \n     1745 and amendments proposed by this Board.\n       Adopted this 20th day of November, 1996.\n       Ruland J. Gill, Jr., Chair, Board of Trustees of the School \n     and Institutional Trust Lands Administration.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have taken a long time here, but, \nfrankly, this needed to be said. I realize that many people on the \nother side of the issue are very sincere people. I happen to believe in \nthe environment myself. But I also know if we do not worry about human \nbeings, there will not be an environment in the end, because sooner or \nlater someone is going to rise up and an extremist on the other side is \ngoing to take control if we act like you cannot have balance on these \nmatters.\n  All the sincerity in the world does not make it right. I think we \nhave done a very good job of crafting a bill here that brings the vast \nmajority of all people together, while leaving the extremists still \nscreaming at us; but even they will die down once the bill is passed, \njust like the two ends of the extremist spectrum who moaned and groaned \nabout the Utah Forest Service wilderness proposal.\n  We went through this with that bill, too, when we came up with \n800,000 acres. Once it was passed, the screaming basically went away. \nEverybody understood that it was a good bill. Today, people are \nbragging about it all over Utah. The elected leaders and \nenvironmentalists are because we did a good job. I was here. I worked \non it. I worked on it with Senator Garn and Congressman Hansen, and \nothers. The fact is, we worked hard to get it done. That is what we \nhave done here. I hope our colleagues will give some credibility to \nthat.\n  Perhaps the most misunderstood aspect of this bill has been the so-\ncalled release language. Let me take a moment to explain this in \ngreater detail. The release language in the bill would release those \npublic lands not designated wilderness by this legislation from any \nfurther wilderness study or review by the BLM. In other words, they \nwould fall back into the pool of lands the BLM manages for various \npurposes but without the official status of wilderness. It would still \nbe managed by the BLM. We would still be subject to the environmental \nrules and regulations. It just would not be wilderness, which means \nthat it would not be land that only backpackers could walk on. There \nwould be some reasonable use of the land, but very, very stringently \ncontrolled by the BLM.\n  This is an important point. The land is still managed by the BLM. It \ndoes not go into private hands. Some would have you believe we are \ngoing to build a shopping center on every acre of that land.\n  Under section 603 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of \n1976, the Secretary of the Interior studies those roadless areas of \n5,000 acres or more and roadless islands of public lands for their \nwilderness characteristics and reports to the President on the \nsuitability or nonsuitability for each designation of wilderness. The \nPresident submits a recommendation to the Congress, and a designation \nof wilderness shall become effective only if as approved by an Act of \nCongress.\n  There was supposed to be a beginning of the study process--initiated \nby the BLM--and an end. The Wilderness Act of 1964, together with \nFLPMA, provides the recipe for designating wilderness. This was not a \nprocess designed to go on in perpetuity, causing the BLM or the Forest \nService to manage lands as if they were wilderness forever, which is \nwhat we have been living with in Utah.\n  Our bill follows the plan for designations set out under these \nlaws. It is a plan that allows lands to be protected for their \nwilderness values and character and at the same time brings closure and \nfinality to the process.\n\n  The conception of releasing lands not chosen for wilderness \ndesignation has never been controversial. The Congress has made it \nthrough countless bills to designate wilderness in the time I have been \na Senator. Each time a bill is passed into law, the lands not \ndesignated were released. That is the normal process. Why is release in \nthis bill such a lightning rod issue? I suspect it is because the lands \nin the study areas have been managed as wilderness for almost 20 years. \nIn addition, the lands included in H.R. 1500, the so-called \nenvironmentalist bill--or at least, the environmentalist extreme bill--\nhave been managed as de facto wilderness in recent years.\n  All it takes for all of this land to be de facto wilderness is to let \nthis process go on forever. Face it, it is hard to let something go \nonce you have it. Environmentalists are loath to pass legislation \ndesignating less land in the wilderness than what is already basically \nwilderness now or de facto wilderness. I am not unsympathetic to their \nmotives, but I disagree with the result. It holds millions of acres in \nlegal limbo, some think illegal limbo; our people in Utah feel illegal \nlimbo.\n  Our bill contains release language that would have prevented BLM land \nmanagers, the on-the-ground professionals, from being able to manage \nnondesignated lands for their wilderness value and character.\n  Our concern was the Federal managers would continue to manage land as \nwilderness even though Congress has made a conscious decision that \ncertain land did not have the wilderness characteristics and values \nmeriting formal designation. We included the term ``nonwilderness'' \nmultiple use in our bill which we believed would accomplish this goal.\n  As my colleagues know, that phrase in and of itself caused more \nconcerned to be expressed about our bill than possibly any other \nsection in our bill. In fact, it led to a lively debate last December \nduring the full committee markup on our bill.\n  That was then. This is now.\n  In today's proposal before this body that term has been eliminated. \nOur release provision has been modified substantially. The new release \nlanguage which is contained in the substitute amendment is simple and \nstraightforward. It simply states that the BLM lands located in Utah \nhave been properly studied for their wilderness characteristics, and \nthat those not designated as wilderness by our bill need not be studied \nor pursued any further by the Secretary.\n  In addition, these lands will be managed for the full range of \nmultiple use as defined in section 103(C) of FLPMA in accordance with \nland management plans adopted by the BLM pursuant to section 202 of the \nFederal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.\n  What this says to the Federal managers is that, now that wilderness \nhas been designated, assuming this bill passes, the balance of the land \nshould be managed under existing laws and regulations where \nappropriate. It is not a signal to the mythical lineup of bulldozers to \nstart their engines, as some might say, because it simply does not \nleave these lands unprotected.\n  I repeat, it will not leave nondesignated lands open for unrestrained \nand uncontrolled development. There are other designations available to \nthe BLM other than wilderness to protect our natural resources from \nthis occurring. These designations are proposed, examined and \neventually undertaken through the land use planning process outlined in \nsection 202 of FLPMA.\n  To give comfort to those who remain convinced that our language will \nnot afford these lands the protection they deserve, let me recount the \ncriteria to be reviewed by the Secretary when developing and revising \nland use plans. In subsection (c) of section 202, the Secretary shall:\n\n       (1) use and observe the principles of multiple use and \n     sustained yield;\n       (2) achieve integrated consideration of physical, \n     biological, economic, and other sciences;\n       (3) give priority to the designation and protection of \n     areas of critical and environmental concern;\n       (4) rely on the inventory of the public lands, their \n     resources and other values;\n       (5) consider present and potential use of the public lands;\n       (6) consider the relative scarcity of the values involved \n     and the availability of alternative means and sites for \n     realization of those values;\n       (7) weigh long-term benefit to the public against short-\n     term benefits;\n       (8) provide for compliance with applicable pollution \n     control laws, including State and Federal air, water, noise \n     or other pollution standards or implementation plans; and\n       (9) coordinate the land use inventory, planning, and \n     management activities for such lands with other Federal \n     departments and agencies and of the States and local \n     government within which the lands are located.\n\n  Just look at these Bureau of Land Management special designations to \nwhich we will be subject to. It is not that the lands are going to be \njust\n\n[[Page S2782]]\n\nopened up for any kind of use. Look at the list of these various things \nthey will be subject to.\n  Subsection (f) directs the Secretary to provide an opportunity for \nFederal, State, and local governments and the general public to comment \nupon and participate in the formulation of plans and programs relating \nto the management of public lands.\n  Certainly my colleagues would agree that there is no better way to \nmanage these nondesignated lands than by the book and in accordance \nwith FLPMA. There is not any better way. That is what our release \nlanguage does. It provides they be managed the way FLPMA says they will \nbe managed.\n  In Utah, all of the public lands are covered by land use plans \ndeveloped pursuant to section 202 of FLPMA. I understand some of the \nplans in Utah are not as current as they might be; but, nevertheless, \nthey provide protection for the resources, particularly those not \ndesignated as wilderness. Within each plan, the BLM will consider the \nresources present in an area and what protection they need.\n  Last week, I asked the Utah State BLM director to provide me with a \nsummary of those special designations that can be developed through the \nland use planning process for Federal managers to protect specific \nresources.\n  I have produced these two charts that list those special designations \nand a brief summary of what each designation is for. These designations \ninclude:\n  Areas of critical environmental concern--for those areas that have \nspecial unique or rare values;\n  Outstanding natural areas--to protect unusual natural characteristics \nfor education and recreational purposes;\n  Visual resources management designations--that are utilized to \nmaintain a landscape that appears unaltered, to retain the existing \ncharacter of a landscape, and to manage activities that may lead to \nmodifications in that landscape;\n  Coal management designations--indicating where coal leasing and \ndevelopment can occur and the types of methods that can be used. I \nmight mention in that regard, Utah is the Saudi Arabia of coal. By the \nway, it is environmentally sound, high-moisture content, low-sulfur \ncontent coal that will be necessary to keep the rest of the country \nenvironmentally clean.\n  Continuing with the designations:\n  Designations for locatable energy and nonenergy leaseable minerals--\nindicating in what areas the mining laws are open or closed;\n  Off-highway vehicle designations--I am only listing a few--indicating \nwhere such use is open and closed.\n  These are just a few of the special management designations available \nto the local BLM manager that can be used to protect this country's \nresources and our State's resources.\n\n  If a designation is made and a particular activity is inconsistent \nwith this designation, it will not occur. The only ``golden arches'' \ndotting the protected Utah landscape will be the ones covered by the \nelements over centuries.\n  While I may not always agree with them, I have faith that our local \nBLM managers will use these designations in the proper way after \nestablishing their merit through the proper public process.\n  Again, the substitute bill does not exempt nondesignated wilderness \nlands from being designated in any of these categories. There are also \ndesignations that can be made by Congress or the Secretary of the \nInterior to establish systems of national importance and to include \ncomponents within these national systems. The Utah State BLM office \nprovided a list of these authorities, which I have produced on another \nchart.\n  These designations include: national wild and scenic rivers, national \nconservation areas, national outstanding natural areas, critical \nhabitat areas, national historic landmarks, and national scenic areas, \njust to mention a few. There are others, as well, on the list. There is \na wide latitude available to Congress and the Secretary to utilize \nthese designations in a manner befitting the resources and the \nmanagement scheme they mandate to protect them in their true character.\n  In addition to all of these designations, there is a plethora of \nenvironmental laws and regulations to which the management of our \npublic lands must adhere.\n  Again, I asked the Utah State BLM Director to provide me with a list \nof those Federal laws--and I am only talking about Federal laws, not \nState laws; we have a lot of State laws, too. These are Federal laws \nthat involve BLM activities, to which the BLM managers, as they manage \nthe Federal lands, must adhere. Look at these. We have discussed many \nof these authorities so far. But, my colleagues need to consider all of \nthese legislative authorities that involve BLM.\n  An abbreviated list of these laws is located on the two charts I have \nproduced here. I emphasize that these lists are not full lists. I have \nlisted these legislative authorities which I thought were more \npertinent to this debate than others. I have not prioritized them in \nany particular fashion, other than to place them in groups according to \ntheir particular management emphasis. I will mention a few that are on \nthis list for the benefit of my colleagues. I understand Senator \nMurkowski has submitted this list for the Record in his remarks, but I \nwill mention a few. These include:\n  FLPMA; National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA; Clean Air Act; \nFederal Water Pollution Control Act, or Clean Water Act; Safe Drinking \nWater Act; Solid Waste Disposal Act; Resource Conservation and Recovery \nAct; Superfund; Mining Law; Mineral Leasing Act; Federal Coal Leasing \nAmendments; Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, or SMCRA; \nEnergy Policy Act of 1992;\n  Public Rangelands Improvement Act; Endangered Species Act; Wild and \nFree-Roaming Burro Act; Act for protecting Bald and Golden Eagles; \nToxic Substances Control Act; Migratory Bird Conservation Act; Federal \nInsecticide, Fungicide, an Rodenticide Act; Water Resources Development \nAct; Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act; National Historic \nPreservation Act; Wild and Scenic Rivers Act; Wilderness Act; \nArchaeological Resource Protection Act; and Antiquities Act.\n  This is just to mention a few. It is mind boggling. I am sure my \ncolleagues will agree that this is a ``Who's Who'' list of \nenvironmental laws, and the activities that occur on public lands not \ndesignated wilderness by our proposal will be subject to each and every \none.\n  I will repeat what I said a moment ago in relation to this list of \nenvironmental laws. Our bill does not exempt nondesignated wilderness \nlands--any of those lands released for regulated multiple use under the \nbill--from any provision, contained in any of these laws and their \ncorresponding regulations.\n  Our release language does contain a sentence that has raised \nquestions. This sentence says: ``Such lands shall not be managed for \nthe purpose of protecting their suitability for wilderness \ndesignation.'' What does this mean? This means that Federal managers \nwill not manage a tract of land for the purpose of its possible \ninclusion by Congress within the National Wilderness Preservation \nSystem.\n  As my colleagues will note from the chart listing the special \ndesignations available for BLM managers, ``Future wilderness \ndesignation'' is not listed because it does not exist. There is no \ndesignation or direction from Congress to the agency, outside of \nsection 603(c) of FLPMA, that says you should manage land for the \npurpose of its future designation as wilderness. There is no such rule \nor law.\n  But we have told the agency that we want lands protected for their \nunique geographical and geological traits, for their special and rare \ntopographical values and qualities, historical values, and so forth.\n  The way to do this is through the existing authorities and \ndesignations available to the BLM.\n  This sentence in the substitute does not foreclose a Federal manager \nfrom managing an area of land to protect its wilderness character. This \nsentence does not prohibit a BLM district manager from managing an area \nof land for its wilderness values. Statements to the contrary are \nfalse.\n  And, more importantly, it does not foreclose a future Congress from \nrevisiting this issue and designating additional lands as wilderness. \nWe cannot bind a future Congress, and we do not in our bill.\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\n  During last year's markup on our bill, there was lively discussion \nregarding our release language. On two separate votes, the committee \nvoted to keep our release language in the bill.\n  However, it was clear from the statements made at the markup, and \nshortly thereafter to me and Senator Bennett, that committee members \nhoped we would address the issues that they raised during the markup.\n  We have done that with this language. As I said, the term \n``nonwilderness'' multiple use has been removed, and there is no \nlanguage preventing the agency from managing lands to protect their \nwilderness character.\n  I want to thank all the members of the Senate Energy Committee, \nparticularly Senators Johnston and Bumpers and Murkowski, for their \nconstructive criticism of our original language and for their \nsuggestions for ways to amend it. The amendment offered by Senator \nJohnston at the December markup of the committee provided the impetus \nfor this change.\n  I must say I agree wholeheartedly with the comment Senator Johnston \nmade prior to the vote on his amendment. He said that the effect of his \namendment would be to ``do away with what is a present practice, which \nis also offending, which is managing for the purpose of some future \ndesignation as wilderness.''\n  That also is the effect of our language. We think it is a worthwhile \neffect.\n  Now, I know I have taken enough time. But this is an important \nissue--one of the most important issues in my whole time in the U.S. \nSenate. I am hopeful that our colleagues will help Senator Bennett and \nmyself to get this through. Should it be that they do not, it is going \nto come back and come back and come back again because we have to get \nthis problem solved in our State.\n\n  Frankly, I do not mean to disparage anybody who feels otherwise about \nthis, as there are very sincere people on both extremes of this issue. \nWe have tried to achieve a compromise in the middle, where the vast \nmajority of people can agree. I think people of good will who realize \nwhat we are trying to do will agree. I think we have given reason for \nevery one of our colleagues here to consider the hard work we have done \nand the pain we have been through, and the efforts that we have made to \nget this done.\n  In that regard, I want to pay particular tribute to my colleague and \nmy friend from Utah, Senator Bennett. When he was on this committee, he \ndid yeoman work with other members to apprise them of this matter. \nSince he has not been on the Energy Committee, he has worked very close \nwith his former colleagues on that committee to help get this done. We \nhave worked side by side, and we are going to continue working side by \nside. We both have tried to be reasonable in every way in this Congress \nas we serve here in the Senate. We are going to continue to try and be \nreasonable.\n  I want to pay tribute to him because he has been a voice of reason on \nthis issue--an intelligent voice of reason. I personally believe that, \nwhen this passes, he will deserve a great deal of the credit, as will \nour dear friend and colleague, Congressman Hansen, in the House, who \nhas carried this proposal very strongly over there. Some in the media \nhave said that this cannot pass the House. That is not true. If we pass \nit, it will pass the House whenever the vote comes.\n  I hope our colleagues will give some consideration to the efforts we \nhave made, the good faith that we have shown, and the fact that we \nbelieve we are representing our State and the Nation in the very best \nway on this very critical issue to us. This is a very, very important \nUtah wilderness bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to start by saying how much \nI admire Senators Hatch and Bennett for working on this bill--\nparticularly Senator Hatch, who has worked on some form of this bill \nfor almost two decades. Having worked 10 years on the Colorado \nwilderness bill, I know of the difficulty of doing it, because they are \nall highly charged, emotional debates.\n  I think the American public may not quite know what they want with a \nbalanced budget amendment or with health care, but, believe me, they \nall know what they want when it comes to their land. All of them own \nthe public lands, the areas in or without wilderness, either one. But \nsome want to hunt on it, or run their off-road vehicles on it, and some \nwant to graze on it, and some want to fish or take pictures, or dig for \ngold and use timber. And they would like everybody else off of it.\n  Coming from a western State, the Presiding Officer certainly knows \nthe difficulty we get between the special interest groups, who \nunderstand that it belongs to everybody, but would prefer that their \nparticular interest gets a priority in using that public land. But it \ndoes not happen that way.\n  For 3\\1/2\\ hours, we have been talking about one section of this \nbill, really--the title of the Presidio omnibus bill, not the Utah \nwilderness bill. Utah Wilderness is just 1 title of 33. There are 33 \ntitles in this bill, and all of them are very important. In just title \nII alone, in fact, there are 16 different areas that probably will not \nget too much debate because they are not as controversial as the Utah \nwilderness bill, which is just 1 title. Certainly, when we are \nsomething like 30 years behind on finding the money to purchase land \nthat we have already authorized to go into the Park Service and over 20 \nyears behind on the appropriations for building the buildings in the \nparks, those are all just as important as any other section.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to several bills within \nthe Omnibus package that are of particular interest to me and my home \nState of Colorado. Each of these bills deserves distinction in its own \nright, being crafted with years of collaborative hard work and \ndedication. I would like to make brief comments on each of them, and \nurge my colleagues to support these noncontroversial bills in final \npassage.\n  One little section under section 224, ``Volunteers in Parks \nIncrease.'' I do not think anyone has a doubt that in this day of \nfiscal responsibility that we are supposed to be trying to save some \nmoney. But the importance of volunteers throughout America is going up. \nThat probably will not get into the debate today and tomorrow. But \nthere are many others.\n  Over 50 Senators, it is my understanding, either have sponsored or \ncosponsored some of these titles, and many of them are extremely \nimportant.\n  The Corinth, MS, Battlefield Act, the Walnut Canyon National Monument \nBoundary Modification, Greens Creek Land Exchange, Butte County Land \nExchange, on and on. Title XXIII, Colonial National Historical Park--\nall extremely important. And yet, because the Utah wilderness bill, \nwhich is just one section, is so controversial, it seems to be getting \nall of the debate so far.\n  Let me just talk a little bit about the things that we have worked so \nhard for in Colorado that are also part of this bill.\n  Title IV, Rocky Mountain National Park Visitor Center is one of the \nlargest and most visited in America. This bill provides the authority \nfor the National Park Service to use appropriated and donated funds to \noperate a visitor center outside of the boundary of Rocky Mountain \nNational Park.\n  We worked on this a number of years. And it is a good bill. But it is \nonly one part of the bigger omnibus bill.\n  The Park Service has been in need of a visitor's center at the \neastern entrance to Rocky for many years now, but due to fiscal \nconstraints, they have been unable to get adequate appropriations. \nThanks to a generous private-public partnership proposal, the Park \nService has an opportunity to provide a visitor service outside the \npark boundaries. This legislation would simply make this type of \npartnership possible for the Park Service. This type of private-public \nopportunity is exactly what the Federal Government should be taking \nadvantage of these days, and I am encouraged by the proposal for the \nFall River visitor center that has been put forth. This center would \nhelp the thousands of visitors that flock to the park each year, and \nwould save the Government millions in taxpayer dollars.\n\n\n                        TITLE X: CACHE LA POUDRE\n\n  This bill would designate approximately 35,000 acres between the \ncities\n\n[[Page S2784]]\n\nof Fort Collins and Greeley, CO, as the Cache La Poudre River National \nWater Heritage Area.\n  Senator Brown, my colleague from Colorado, has worked almost 20 years \nsince he has been in the House and on the Senate side to get that bill \npassed. It is just one section of this larger omnibus bill.\n  The headwaters of the streams that flow into this river tell the \nstory of water development and river basin management in the westward \nexpansion of the United States. This historical area holds a special \nmeaning for Coloradans, and we feel that it deserves national \nrecognition as a heritage area. In addition to the designation, this \ntitle will help establish a local commission to develop and implement a \nlong term management plan for the area.\n  This bill holds great distinction for me, for I have been working on \nit for many years with my good friend and colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Colorado. The good Senator has been trying to get this bill \nenacted into law for over 20 years now, and each revision of the bill \nhas been a more worthy product than the last. There are always a couple \nof bills that hold special meaning for us personally, and the Cache La \nPoudre is a good example of one that the senior Senator from Colorado \nhas a particular interest in. I urge my colleagues to support this \nworthy bill, and see to it that it is enacted into law before the \nsenior Senator from Colorado retires from our Chamber.\n\n\n            TITLE XI: GILPIN COUNTY, COLORADO LAND EXCHANGE\n\n  This bill is a simple, straightforward land exchange bill that will \nconvey 300 acres of Bureau of Land Management lands in Gilpin County, \nCO, for the acquisition of 8,733 acres of equal value within the State.\n  I do not think there is any doubt that the Federal Government and the \ntaxpayers of this country get the best of that trade. They are going to \nget 8,733 acres for just 300 acres of BLM land.\n  The bill seeks to address a site-specific land management problem \nthat is a result of the scattered mining claims of the 1800's. The \nFederal selected lands for conveyance are contained within 133 \nscattered parcels near the communities of Black Hawk and Central City, \nmost of which are less than 1 acre in size. These lands would be \nexchanged to the cities of Black Hawk and Central City to help \nalleviate a shortage residential lots.\n  In return for these selected lands, the Federal Government will \nreceive approximately 8,773 acres of offered lands, which are \nanticipated to be of approximately equal dollar value to the selected \nlands. These lands are in three separate locations, described as \nfollows:\n  Circle C Church Camp: This 40-acre parcel is located within Rocky \nMountain National Park along its eastern boundaries, and lies \napproximately 5 miles south of the well known community of Estes Park. \nThis acquisition can provide additional public camping sites and \naddress a current shortage of employee housing in the popular national \npark.\n  Quilan Ranches tract: This 3,993-acre parcel is located in Conejos \nCounty, in southern Colorado. This land has excellent elk winter range \nand other wildlife habitat, and borders State lands, which are managed \nfor wildlife protection.\n  Bonham Ranch--Cucharas Canyon: This 4,700-acre ranch will augment \nexisting BLM land holdings in the beautiful Cucharas Canyon, identified \nas an area of critical environmental concern [ACEC]. This ranch has \nsuperb wildlife habitat, winter range, riparian areas, raptor nesting, \nand fledgling areas, as well as numerous riparian areas, raptor \nnesting, and fledgling areas.\n  Any equalization funds remaining from this exchange will be dedicated \nto the purchase of land and water rights--pursuant to Colorado water \nlaw--for the Blanca Wetlands Management Area, near Alamosa, CO.\n  It is clear that the merits of this bill are numerous. Moreover, the \nbill is noncontroversial, and while it may not have dramatic \nconsequence for people outside of the State of Colorado, it represents \na tremendous opportunity for citizens within my State. Due to the time-\nsensitive and fragile nature of the various components of this bill, I \nwould urge my colleagues to act expeditiously and support this \nlegislation.\n\n\n                         title xviii: ski fees\n\n  For years a number of us in the west have supported legislation that \ntries to find some common sense and reason for the administration of \nForest Service ski area permits. This title will take the most \nconvoluted, subjective, and bizarre formula for calculating ski fees, \ndeveloped by the Forest Service, and replace it with a simple, user \nfriendly formula in which the ski areas will be able to figure out \ntheir fees with very little effort. We think this is important.\n  The current formula utilized by the Forest Service is encompassed in \n40 pages and contains hundreds of definitions, rulings, and policies. \nIt is simply government bureaucracy at its worst. For the ski industry, \nthis formula is a monstrous burden, and with the expansion and \ndiversification of many ski resorts, this burden grows increasingly \nmore complex each year.\n  Mr. President, in the 5 years that I have worked on this issue I have \nheard virtually no opposition to this bill. It enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport, and I hope that my fellow Senators will act swiftly and \nresoundingly in supporting it.\n\n\n                    title xxix: grand lake cemetery\n\n  Mr. President, this title simply directs the Secretary of the \nInterior to authorize a permit for the town of Grand Lake, CO, to \npermanently maintain their 5-acre cemetery, which happens to fall \nwithin the boundaries of Rocky Mountain National Park. This cemetery \nhas been in use by the town since 1892, and continues to carry strong \nemotion and sentimental attachments for the residents. This is a \nlittle, tiny cemetery near Grand Lake that started over 100 years ago--\n104 years ago. For 104 years that little cemetery has been in effect. \nAnd this cemetery has been used by the town. This portion of the \nomnibus bill will give the town a long-term permit to maintain that \nlittle cemetery.\n\n  Currently, the cemetery is operated under a temporary special use \npermit, which is set to expire this year. By granting permanent \nmaintenance authority to the town, this title creates lasting stability \nto this longstanding issue. It is completely noncontroversial, and \nwidely supported by both the community and the Park Service.\n\n\n                     TITLE XXXI: OLD SPANISH TRAIL\n\n  This bill was just introduced a year ago. So it has not been worked \nas some others have been nearly so long. But we think it is important \nin this day and age when everybody is trying to preserve the cultural \nparts of America which is fast declining and going under concrete.\n  Mr. President, the last bill in this package that I would like to \nspeak on today is another bill that holds special meaning for me. I \nhave been working on this legislation for many years now, and I am \npleased to see that this title has seven different cosponsors from both \nsides of the aisle.\n  This title would designate the Old Spanish Trail and the northern \nbranch of the Old Spanish Trail for study for potential addition to the \nNational Trails System as a national historic trail.\n  The Old Spanish Trail has rightly been called ``the longest, \ncrookedest, most arduous pack mule route in the history of America.'' \nIt is that, and more. The Old Spanish Trail tells a dramatic story that \nspans two centuries of recorded history and originated in prehistoric \ntimes. This trail witnessed use by Utes and Navajos, Spaniards, \nMexicans, and American trappers, explorers, and settlers, including the \nMormons. Its heyday spans the development of the West, from the native \non foot to the mounted Spaniard to the coming of the transcontinental \nrailroad. Few routes, if any, pass through as much relatively pristine \ncountry. It is time to recognize and celebrate our common heritage, and \nI would request that my colleagues support this title.\n  These bills are all noncontroversial and somewhat parochial. They may \nnot mean a whole lot to many Members in this Chamber, but they mean a \ngreat deal to me and my constituents. I am not sure what course this \ndebate will take, or even what role I will have in the next few days. \nBut I would like to say for the Record, Mr. President, these bills that \nI have highlighted in my speech today are worthy of passage and are \nworthy to be enacted into law. Let us not forget the elements of this \ndebate that may not be as star-studded, but are equally important.\n\n[[Page S2785]]\n\n  Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to try to add a little bit \nof perspective to what this bill is all about. It is very complicated. \nIt is tremendously difficult. But the vast majority of the 33 titles \nhave been worked out and have no opposition at all. Very few of them \nhave any opposition. To spend all of the time on one on which I think \nthe majority of the disagreements have been worked out already--which \nis the Utah wilderness bill--I think is going to be time consuming and \nnot very productive.\n  So I wanted to add my voice to those who are saying there is more to \nthis bill than just Utah wilderness. Utah wilderness is extremely \nimportant. But through the work that Senator Hatch and Senator Bennett \nhave done I think they have gotten a pretty good compromise. I know \nfrom the years that we worked on the Colorado bill that it does not \nmake any difference how much land you put into a wilderness bill. There \nwill be people who say that it is not nearly enough, and that it should \nbe twice the size, or three times the size, or four times the size.\n  That is what we have gone through in virtually every wilderness bill \nthat we have dealt with here.\n  I want to compliment Senator Bennett and Senator Hatch for the work \nthat they have already done on it, and to tell my other colleagues that \nhopefully we will keep this in perspective and recognize there is an \nawful lot of other extremely important parts of this omnibus bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from \nColorado for giving us that perspective which I think perhaps we \nneeded.\n  If any of our colleagues are watching in their offices, they may \nthink that the Utah wilderness bill is the only issue and that we are \ninvolved in overkill, perhaps. However, there are some things that I \nthink appropriately should be said in this circumstance. And I will do \nmy best not to repeat what has been said by my colleagues, Senator \nMurkowski, and Senator Hatch.\n  I would also like to take the opportunity to thank Senator Johnston, \nmy colleague from Louisiana, for his kind words at the beginning of \nthis debate. He provided a tremendous amount of help on this issue when \nit was before the committee. And, as he said accurately, it was his \nproposal backed unanimously by all of the Democrats on the committee \nthat became the basis for the final wording of the bill in terms of the \nrelease language.\n  I agree with Senator Hatch--that many of those who are now attacking \nthe bill in newspaper advertisements and elsewhere have not read that \nlanguage and need to understand that they are attacking a bill that no \nlonger exists. I know that does not meet their needs because their \npolitical needs require them to attack the very worst possible bill. I \ndo not happen to think our first proposal was the worst possible bill. \nBut they do, and they can keep the emotion up, if they continue to \nattack that which we have long since abandoned.\n  Mr. President, I have a different view perhaps of this issue. And I \napologize if this is unduly personal. But this is the only way I can \nreally describe how I come to this issue.\n  I am a city slicker. That is a term used perhaps in some places. But \nI grew up in a city, went to school in a city, and raised my family in \na city. I knew little or nothing about these issues until I decided to \nrun for the Senate. I came with the perspective of somebody for whom \nwilderness meant a drive in the country on a Sunday afternoon.\n  My opponent for the Senate was the author of H.R. 1500, the bill that \ncalled for at that point 5.4 million acres of wilderness in Utah, and \nhe was lionized by all of the same groups that are now buying the full-\npage ads in national publications to attack the bill that we are \ndebating here today.\n  It was interesting to me to follow him around the State of Utah and \nsee him back away from his original proposal the more exposure he had \nto real voters.\n  It is also interesting that now that the voters of Utah decided to \nretire him from public life that he has become the chairman of the \nSouthern Utah Wilderness Alliance, the group that has been paying for \nthese advertisements around the country. I do not know how much they \nspent. I would guess it would be millions of dollars, knowing what I do \nknow about the cost of advertisement--perhaps even in the tens of \nmillions of dollars. We will never know. The group will never tell us. \nThe group does not tell us where their financial support comes from. \nThe group does not tell us who is behind their efforts. But they have \nmounted this effort and run these ads in attack of this bill.\n  As I say, I am a city slicker. I came to this issue really with no \npreconceptions one way or the other. I was forced into it by virtue of \nthe fact that my campaign was against Wayne Owens who was the primary \nmover of this effort, and who continues, as I say, today as one of the \nprimary forces behind it. I decided I had better learn something about \nthe issue. I know that strikes some people as a little strange in \npolitics. But I decided that I was not going to be able to run on \ndiscussion of this if I did not know anything about it.\n  So this is what I did to try to find out about it. The first thing I \ndid was talk to the people who lived on the land.\n  I went out to the land, and I sat down with the people who live \nthere, and I asked them to tell me about it. I will not bore you with \nall the things they told me, but one conversation sticks in my mind. A \nwoman down in southeastern Utah walked out with me. We had been in an \narea where we had been having dinner with a group of people. We walked \nout into the open air, and she said, ``Bob, look around. What do you \nsee?'' Well, I did not know what I was supposed to see, so I had to \nmake up some kind of comment. I did not know what I was looking for. \nBut she said, ``Look around at this land. What do you see?''\n  I shrugged my shoulders a little, and I said, ``It's pretty.'' She \nsaid, ``It's pristine.'' I said, ``Yes, that's right. It's pristine. \nThat's wonderful.'' She said, ``Bob, my family and I have been making \nour living off this land for five generations. Tell me we don't love it \nand we can't take care of it properly.''\n  So that was the first experience I had as I went out and talked to \npeople who live there and have their feeling of stewardship for the \nland. It is very real. I submit to the Senator from New Jersey that it \nis as real as his sense of stewardship or that of anybody else who \nsends in their subscriptions to the various environmental groups but \nwho has never had the experience of living on the land from generation \nto generation.\n  These people are not despoilers. These people are not exploiters. \nThese people are stewards, and they are good stewards, of the land. The \nreason the land is in the condition it is in that we can be talking \nabout it as needing to be preserved for our children is that these \npeople have preserved it in that condition for five generations and \nmore.\n  All right. That is the first thing I did. I talked to those who live \non the land. Then I decided, well, I better talk to the professional \nmanagers, the people who make their living managing this land for the \nFederal Government. As Governor Leavitt pointed out in his letter that \nSenator Hatch quoted, the professional managers run more of the State \nof Utah than the elected Governor does. The head of the BLM in Utah \ngeographically has wider sway than the Governor and the State \nlegislature put together.\n  So I went and talked to these professional managers, and I asked them \nto tell me about this wilderness thing, help me understand it. They \nlooked at me. They had to take my measure for a little while. They had \nto decide whether I was really serious about trying to get their view. \nWhen they finally decided that I was serious about wanting to know \nwithout any preconception, they said, ``Senator''--by this time I had \nbeen elected so they used that term. They said, ``Senator, we can't \nmanage 5.7 million acres of wilderness. You give us 5.7 million acres \nas wilderness, and we are going to have all kinds of incursion into \nthat land because we don't have enough police force to keep people off \nland that they have been traditionally entering for many, many years. \nWe are finding it\n\n[[Page S2786]]\n\nalready in the study areas; the 3.2 million acres that are being \nstudied cannot in perpetuity be managed as wilderness. We are already \nseeing incursions that we can't control.''\n  They said, ``One of the reasons the BLM came up with 1.8 million \nacres of wilderness is that we decided that was the maximum amount we \ncould effectively protect as wilderness. The rest of it simply could \nnot be managed.''\n  They gave me this example of why some acreage is not appropriate for \nwilderness. They said the 5.7 proposal talks about land that comes \nright up to the highway. They said, ``Senator, we cannot stop people \nout there along the highway from parking their cars on the side of the \nhighway and picnicking on that land.''\n\n  Now, the land has no wilderness characteristics in the terms of the \nbill as Senator Hatch has described; that is, the original Wilderness \nAct. The reason it is included in the 5.7 is that these people want it \nas buffer land for wilderness area that is maybe 5, 6, 10, 20 miles \naway. So they have taken the wilderness area that is 20 miles away from \nthe highway and decided that in order to protect it, in their view, \nthey are going to put the wilderness designation right up to the \nhighway itself.\n  They said, ``Now, Senator, stop and think about it. Are you getting \nthe wilderness experience in an area untrammeled by man when you are \nstanding 50 feet away from an interstate highway?''\n  That is not the kind of solitude that the Senator from New Jersey \nwaxed so lyrical about earlier this morning. That land does not qualify \nin any sense for a wilderness designation, and yet, according to these \nprofessional managers, it is included in some of the proposals that we \nhave.\n  So I thought, well, OK, I have talked to the people who live there. I \nhave talked to the managers. Maybe I ought to go see the land myself. \nSo I went out to see the land, and I discovered something that as a \ncity slicker I would never ever have known, something that I think is \nbeing ignored in this debate, something that has been ignored in this \nChamber, and something that I would like to talk about as being crucial \nto this issue, and that is this. I discovered that human beings do not \nautomatically degrade the quality of the environment. Indeed, I \ndiscovered that in some circumstances human beings improve the quality \nof the environment.\n  Is that not a radical notion? Everything we have been hearing about \npreserving wilderness is that we have to preserve this in its pristine, \nmagnificent quality, or something really worthwhile will be lost and we \nwill get in place of it something terrible that comes from human \nbeings.\n  Let me show you some pictures, Mr. President, some that we have \nbrought together and some that I saw for the first time as I was \npresiding the other night when the Senator from Wyoming was talking \nabout grazing. Let us take first some of the pictures from the Senator \nfrom Wyoming because I think there is a significant point to make. I \nwill not go through all of them as he did.\n  It so happens that in 1870 a photographer got loose in Wyoming, and \nhe went around and took some pictures of areas that he thought were \nparticularly significant. The picture on the top is in Jackson. It was \ntaken on August 12, 1870. In 1976, a little over 100 years later, \nmodern photographers going over these magnificent old photographs \ndecided they wanted to go back to the same place and take a picture of \nexactly the same scene. So they did.\n  What do you see between 1870 on the top and 1976 on the bottom? You \nsee a lusher environment. You see more trees, more vegetation, \nhealthier grass than you saw 100 years ago. What is the difference? The \ndifference is that for the succeeding 100 years wise stewardship by \nhuman beings has been practiced on that land, and environmentally it \nhas gotten better and not worse.\n  We have another one by the same process, same photographers. This is \nalso in Wyoming. I wish I had some pictures like this of Utah. I have \none that I will get to.\n  Again, Jackson, August 20, 1870, on the top. You see the kinds of \nthings that we hear on this floor about overgrazing and the range in \nterrible condition and the grasses having been destroyed, and so on. \nNow you look at it 100 years later with wise management and you see \ntrees in the riparian area; you see lusher grass; you see healthier \nplants because human beings have exercised wise stewardship.\n  Now let us go to the one in Utah. The Senator from Wyoming had a \nwhole series of these and built his whole presentation around them. I \nwas tremendously impressed.\n  This one is not 100 years. This one is only about 50. I picked this \none because the Escalante River is one of the areas of high controversy \nin this wilderness debate. The top photograph was taken in 1949. It \nshows the Escalante River. The bottom photograph was taken in 1992. \nWhat do you see in the bottom photograph? You see lush vegetation \nthrough the riparian area, so lush you cannot even see the river \nbecause there is so much foliage there. And where did that come from? \nThat came from human intervention into the area. That came, primarily, \nfrom cattle.\n  We have heard so much about how terrible cattle are for the \nenvironment. We heard from the Senator from New Jersey the basic \nassumption that when cattle get into an area, there is automatic \novergrazing. As I said, I walked the land myself. This city slicker \nwent out and went over some land and discovered a fascinating thing \nthat I would never have learned, growing up in Salt Lake City, UT. I \nhad a guide who took me through it and he showed me two tracts of land, \nside by side. We walked over both. The one tract of land had cattle \ngrazing on it on a regular basis. The vegetation was healthy. The \nwatershed was good. The grasses were healthy and strong and lush.\n  We then went to another area, which, ironically, was BLM land where \ncattle permits had been denied. The first piece of land was private \nland, right next to it a piece of BLM land where permits had been \ndenied. Here the land was beginning to turn to desert. There were no \ngrasses. Such vegetation as was there was scrawny and drying up, \nshowing, if you will, something very similar to the contrast in those \ntwo photographs.\n  I said to the man who was guiding me through, ``All right, now tell \nme why this is?''\n  He says, ``It is very simple.'' He said, ``Out here in Utah and \nArizona''--actually, this particular tract of land was in Arizona, \nright on the Utah border--``it is so dry that the land cakes, and when \nthe water finally comes in the infrequent rainstorms, it hits this \ncaked-over land, this dried-over land, and it runs off and does not get \nin below the surface to nurture anything, unless something comes along \nto break through the surface of that land.'' He said, ``The something \nthat most often comes along that can do the land most good is a cow.''\n  When a cow comes along, every time it steps, before a rainstorm, \nafterward there is a little puddle of water in every one of those steps \nwhere the cow goes by. And then the seeds are coming through the air as \nthe wind blows along. And where do those seeds get caught? They get \ncaught in those little indentations made by the places where the cattle \nhave stepped. And if there is water there and seeds there, and then \nfertilization--the cow carries that process with it and drops it along \nthe way--you begin to get what you see in this patch of land, strong \nplants and lush grass, rather than the desert effect that you get in \nthis patch of land where the cattle have been kept away.\n  That is exactly what has happened in the Escalante River. Yet, in the \nname of protecting the environment and doing what is best for the \nenvironment, there are people who would say the top photograph is \nbetter than the bottom photograph. The top photograph represents \nsomething we must preserve for our children and our grandchildren, and \nthe bottom photograph represents exploitation and despoilation of our \nnatural resources.\n\n  That is a moral judgment that I cannot make. I do not find any moral \nsuperiority in deserts over vegetation. Some people might be able to \nmake that moral judgment. I cannot.\n  So I came away from that experience, talking to the people who lived \non the land and finding them to be good stewards who loved the land \nevery bit as much as anybody who ever sent off his card to the Sierra \nClub, talking to the\n\n[[Page S2787]]\n\nmanagers who run the process and finding them to be conscientious and \nintelligent people who want to do the right thing for the land, and \nthen finally walking the land myself and going through this process, I \ncame away with the conviction that there is no single magic bullet for \nus to solve our environmental problems, such as slapping a wilderness \ndesignation on a map and then saying nature will take care of this and \nhuman beings, stay away forever and ever.\n  Let me give another example of why it is the people of Utah are so \nconcerned about this question. Why do we care? Why do we care whether \nland is designated as wilderness or left in BLM inventory? What big \ndifference does it make? Let me give one example in Juab County, UT, \nwhere there is a little town called Mona.\n  I have driven through Mona. I would like to say for the sake of this \ndebate I have stayed there and talked with some folks, but I have not. \nI must be honest. I just kept right on driving, and you get through \nMona pretty quick when you are driving. It does not slow you down very \nmuch. Mona's secondary source of culinary water is a spring located on \nForest Service land. Unfortunately for the people of Mona, this spring \nextends into the Mt. Nebo Wilderness Area, which was designated in \n1984. It is a small spring. It has a flow of only 5 to 20 cubic feet a \nsecond, depending on the time of year. The pipeline is operated by the \ntiny little Mona Irrigation Company.\n  For the last 2 years, Mona has been prevented by the Forest Service \nfrom accessing and maintaining the spring, even though the first \nhistoric use of the spring began in 1870.\n  Under the terms of the Wilderness Act, prior activities are \ngrandfathered in and allowed to go on. If you had a grazing permit, \naccording to the act, you can continue to graze. If you had a mining \npermit, according to the act, you can continue to mine. In fact, we \nknow that once something is designated as wilderness, all that goes out \nthe window, it is walled off, no human activity whatsoever regardless \nof what may have been going on there before. The historic use of this \nspring began in the 1870's. There has been over 120 years of use of \nthis water.\n\n  The Forest Service, now, will not give permission for the tiny town \nof Mona to access and maintain its source of drinking water until an \nenvironmental assessment is completed.\n  I will say the Forest Service has not been obstructionist about this, \nin any kind of confrontational way. They have simply said this is what \nthe regulations are and we are going to enforce them. We are sorry \nabout it. They have not been particularly cooperative. They have just \nenforced the rules.\n  So, for 2 years now, Mona cannot deal with maintaining this source of \nwater that they have been using for 120 years.\n  I would be a little more sympathetic with the wilderness advocates if \nthis spring were, say, 3 miles inside the wilderness boundary. Mr. \nPresident, it is 900 feet from the wilderness boundary. But they are \nforbidden from crossing that boundary to go provide maintenance on a \nsource of water that they have been using for 120 years. That is the \nkind of thing that scares the living daylights out of the people in \nUtah, who live next to these wilderness designations and are saying, \n``What is going to happen to us when we start facing the bureaucracy \nthat surrounds the enforcement of a wilderness designation?''\n  Much has been said about the process. I will not revisit that except \nto give my version quickly of what happened, and some of the things \nthat we have gone through here.\n  As Senator Hatch pointed out, the BLM started the study here. I \nshould point out for the sake of partisan clarity that the decision as \nto what would be studied and what would not was not made by Jim Watt. \nIt was made during the Carter administration by those environmentally \nfriendly folks who President Carter appointed to the Department of the \nInterior.\n  They did their study, they came up with their conclusion, and then \nthey opened it up for standard appeals, comments and so on. The Utah \nWilderness Association, a group not to be confused with the Southern \nUtah Wilderness Alliance, protested that the Department of the Interior \nand the BLM had missed some very significant areas. Their protest was \nnot only heard; it was upheld. Some 800,000 acres were added to the \nstudy area in response to the protests of the Utah Wilderness \nAssociation. I happen to believe that that protest was wise and that \nthe decision that was made to add those additional acres to the study \narea was the correct decision.\n  There were other protests that were made that were defeated in court. \nI made that point at the press conference where we all got together to \nannounce our intention to try to resolve this issue, and some folks \ncame up to me after the press conference and said, ``Oh, no, no, \nSenator, we've never lost any of our appeals, we've never lost any of \nour challenges.''\n  I said, ``Well, then, my staff is misleading me and the folks at the \nBLM are misleading me. They said every time you have challenged this \noriginal designation you've lost.''\n  ``Well,'' he said, ``we did have to withdraw some of our appeals, but \nit was withdrawn because we didn't have enough money. We couldn't \nafford to proceed.''\n  I find that a very interesting statement in the light of what we have \nheard on this floor today from the chairman of the committee of roughly \n$1 billion of liquid assets in the hands of those who are fighting this \nbill. If they have enough money to buy a full-page ad in the New York \nTimes, they have enough money to pursue their effort in behalf of some \nof these court challenges.\n  No, I do not think they withdrew the challenges because they did not \nhave enough money; they withdrew the challenges because they knew they \nwere without merit and they were going to lose and they did not want \nthe embarrassment of having that loss on the record.\n  We decided--that is, the members of the delegation--in concert with \nthe Governor that we were going to start this whole thing from scratch \nagain. Senator Hatch has described the hearings that were held at the \ncounty level, the hearings that were held statewide and all of the rest \nof that. We are being told now that 75 percent of the people who \nresponded to those hearings were in favor of 5.7 million acres. I can \nonly agree with Senator Hatch that that is an incorrect figure, \nincorrect statement.\n  What was very clear to me as we went from place to place was that the \ncaravan of protesters went with us. It became kind of a ballet. As the \ndelegation would move into a new area, then all the protesters would \nmove and they would have the same buttons on. They would come in and \ndemand the places and then tell us the same thing they told us in the \nprevious location. Then we would get in our cars and drive to this \nlocation and they would get in their buses and come, and we would go \nthrough the same charade.\n  For them to say 73 percent of the people who testified were all in \nfavor of this other proposal, I would say it is the old story used when \nyou turn down somebody for a job and he said, ``But I've had 10 years \nexperience,'' and the answer is, ``No, you haven't, you've had 1 year \nexperience repeated 10 times.''\n\n  We had this same group of people repeating the same arguments over \nand over and over again. On one occasion, the Governor turned to say \nsomething to a member of his staff and the witness stopped and said, \n``Governor, I'm speaking to you.'' The Governor turned back and \napologized, listened, and then said to me, ``The reason I felt I didn't \nhave to listen to her is because I had heard the same testimony from \nher four times and I thought I knew what it was she was going to say.''\n  It was interesting to me that when we were through with this process, \nwe came up with roughly the same result that the BLM had produced in \ntheir 15 years of activity. We did not try to do that. We did not \ndeliberately set out to validate what they had done, but we found it \nfascinating that when we were through, we had the same result.\n  This is what we were told at those hearings, and we have heard some \nof it on the floor today. I would like to respond to it. We were told: \n``Wilderness will make money.'' We heard that from the Senator from New \nJersey. ``Tourists come to Utah, tourism is Utah's No. 1 industry. If \nwe just add wilderness to the mix, we will make money.''\n  Mr. President, I have a map of the State of Utah, and you will see \nthat it is filled with bright colors. What are\n\n[[Page S2788]]\n\nall these bright colors? The yellow is BLM land. You will see if you \nget close to it that there are a bunch of little tiny squares of purple \nall the way through there. Those purple squares belong to the State of \nUtah. Those are the school trust lands that came in the enabling act \nwhen the State was created. But all of the yellow you see here is BLM \nland. This happens to be a military reservation, the Utah Testing and \nTraining Range. I do not recommend you go out there on your vacation; \nthey are likely to drop bombs on you. That is what they do when they \ntake off from the airfield.\n  The dark blue is water, Utah Lake and Great Salt Lake.\n  The green is Forest Service land. When we talk about the Federal \nGovernment owning 67 percent of the State of Utah, it is the \ncombination of Forest Service land and BLM land.\n  The salmon color lands are Indian reservations. Interestingly, this \narea where it shows a great deal of white land is, in fact, an Indian \nreservation. I will tell you what the white is in just a moment.\n  This land is national recreation area, also not available for any \nkind of private development.\n\n  The white land that you see left over, that is private land. That is \nthe amount of land that the citizens of Utah own. The Senator from New \nJersey says Utah is one of the most urbanized States in the Union. \nMaybe when you see the land pattern you can understand. There is not \nany private land available except in the urban areas. That is a bit of \nan overstatement, but I think it comes closer than some may realize.\n  You may ask, ``What is all this private land on what is supposed to \nbe an Indian reservation?'' That is land the Indian tribes handed out \nto their members, so it is still an Indian reservation but it is held \nby title by the members of the Indian tribe.\n  So if we are going to talk about exploitation of private landowners, \nyou are going to see that the amount of land that the private owners \ncan exploit is very, very minimal, compared to all of the other land \nuses.\n  But I came to the chart for this purpose, because we are talking \nabout the issue of making money off wilderness.\n  You see this dark green place inside the green Forest Service land. \nThis is wilderness, and that is not obscure wilderness. This is \nwilderness so popular that the Forest Service has to issue permits to \npeople to go in. They do not want anybody in there in any higher levels \nof visitation than they are getting right now.\n  This is wilderness that for its tourist potential has reached the \nsaturation point. The Forest Service will not let anybody else in, and \nit happens to be in the two poorest counties in the State of \nUtah. Wilderness has not made them wealthy, the way some of the \nproponents of this proposal would have you believe.\n\n  The other green that you see here in the yellow area is the \nwilderness that is included in our bill. This is the 2 million acres \nthat we have been talking about, and the various places where it will \nbe, including--yes, including--the Kaiparowits Plateau that we heard so \nmuch about earlier in the debate.\n  Mr. President, I put that out because, again, I am a city slicker. I \ndid not know this until I came to the Senate. I had no understanding of \nthe way the land in Utah is allocated and owned until I came to the \nSenate and got into this debate. I love to go out into the wilds. I \nlove to go out and commune with nature and have the kinds of \nexperiences that Senator Bradley quoted the professor from Colorado was \nhaving. ``The silence is stunning,'' he said.\n  I have had that kind of experience in Utah. I have gone off by myself \nand had that kind of tremendously uplifting experience. I did not know \nat the time I had the experience where I was in terms of who owned the \nland. I have gone back and checked. I was on BLM land. I was on land \nexploited. Why? Because some cattle had been through there. I did not \nknow that. I had my experience without knowing that.\n  I guess I am deficient somehow in that I do not require the knowledge \nthat nobody else has ever set foot on the land for me to have that kind \nof experience on the land. The vast majority of the people who come to \nUtah to have that kind of experience have it in the green areas, that \nis, the national forest. We have 8 million acres of national forest in \nthe State of Utah.\n  The only difference, from my perspective, between the national forest \nand the other lands that we are talking about setting aside as \nwilderness is that you can get to the national forest. I can go to the \nnational forest in my automobile. There is no way in the world I am \ngoing to be able to go to these areas we have designated as wilderness \nin an automobile. That is fine. So 2 million acres; it meets the \ncriteria of the Wilderness Act. I agree that that ought to be set \naside, primarily for ecological reasons.\n  But most people who are talking about wanting more wilderness have \nthe mistaken impression that what they are talking about is pretty \ncountry. They are saying we want to keep the country pretty and keep \naway the strip malls and the hamburger stands and so on. There are 8 \nmillion acres where there will never be a strip mall or a hamburger \nstand or any other kind of commercial exploitation in the State of \nUtah. There are 8 million acres right now in national forests. You add \nto that the 2 million acres that we have of national parks,--I am \nsurprised at how many of my constituents think wilderness means \nnational parks--add the 2 million acres that we are proposing in \nwilderness, taken off the BLM land, and you will have 12 million acres \nof Utah set aside that can never ever be used for any kind of \ncommercial exploitation, plus 20 million acres left to be managed in \nthe way that we saw in the first photograph I showed of Escalante \nCanyon.\n  There are 20 million acres left to be exploited, the way that picture \non the bottom indicates it is exploited, plus 12 million acres where \nthere will never be any commercial activity of any kind. That comes to \n32 million acres. I think that is enough. That all meets the standard \nof what the law has said that gives us all the legacy that we need to \npass on to our children.\n  Mr. President, I have two other things I want to say that I found as \nI went around on my odyssey to talk with the people who lived there, \ntalk with the managers, and to look at the land myself.\n  The first one has to do with the issue that Senator Bradley raised \nwith respect to Kaiparowits. As Senator Hatch very appropriately \npointed out, our bill protects hundreds of thousands of acres in \nKaiparowits. The real issue in Kaiparowits, however--we must be honest \nabout it, Mr. President--is not the number of acres; the real issue of \nKaiparowits is called, ``Will we allow any exploitation of the coal \nreserves that are under the surface in the Kaiparowits Plateau?''\n  You see the full page ads that talk about ripping out all of this \nmagnificent scenery so that coal can be ripped from the Earth, flung \naround the world, and as the final statement in the advertisement says, \n``A foreign corporation gets all of the profits, and Utah is left with \na hole in the ground.''\n  In the first place, the particular foreign corporation that they are \ntalking about happens to be a very good corporate citizen of the State \nof Utah and has been mining coal in the State of Utah for close to 100 \nyears.\n  But, quite aside from that, let us talk about it from the \nenvironmental impact standpoint. The Senator from New Jersey talked \nabout long-wall technology in coal mining. I have been down in a coal \nmine in Utah. I have seen long-wall technology. I say to anybody who \nhas not had that experience, it is one of the most fascinating \nexperiences you are going to have in your life because you cannot \nconceive, or at least I could not conceive, how any engineer would ever \nbe bright enough to sit down and figure out how that whole thing works. \nIt is just absolutely stunning.\n  With the long-wall technology that now occurs in coal, it will be \npossible for the mining company to go into the coal seam at Kaiparowits \nand take out virtually all of the available coal through a single mine \nopening. We are not talking about strip mining here. We are not talking \nabout tearing the top off of the Kaiparowits Plateau. We are talking \nabout a hole on the side of a mountain roughly the size from that door \nto that door in this Chamber and maybe 16 to 20 feet high. That is \nabout all the bigger the hole has to be.\n  How much coal are we talking about? You figure you have a good seam \nof\n\n[[Page S2789]]\n\ncoal if it runs anywhere from 6 to 8 feet in height. The seam under \nKaiparowits is about 16 to 18 feet in height, more than twice the size \nof the coal seam that you would consider very good. There is enough \ncoal under Kaiparowits to provide the power needs of several Western \nStates for the next 100 years.\n\n  As Senator Hatch pointed out, it is environmentally friendly coal. It \nhas the right kind of chemical makeup and is the kind of coal you want \nto burn instead of the kind of coal from other parts of the country, \nparts that are very well represented in this body, I might add.\n  How do we get to this opening where this coal can be taken out? In \norder to get to the opening where the coal can be taken out, you have \nto go down into a circular canyon. That is good from an environmental \nstandpoint because it means if you are not standing closer than about \n100 feet from the edge of the canyon, you cannot see it. How many acres \nare we talking about? How big a platform? How big a footprint is going \nto be placed on the land when this thing is fully operative? Forty \nacres, Mr. President.\n  At the bottom of this circular canyon, virtually hidden by the nature \nof the way the canyon was formed, 40 acres at the bottom of this canyon \nwill be admittedly despoiled and exploited, 40 acres will be filled \nwith buildings that are not particularly pretty to look at, 40 acres \nwill be filled with sheds and equipment. And for that 40 acres which \ncannot be seen anywhere on the Kaiparowits Plateau--I stood on the \nKaiparowits Plateau and looked at it directly myself--for that 40 acres \nthat cannot be seen anywhere on the Kaiparowits Plateau, we could \nproduce enough coal to furnish the energy for several Western States \nfor over 100 years.\n  Now, in this book, ``Wilderness at the Edge,'' where we see the whole \n5.7 million acres laid out in all their glory--and it is glory--they \ntell us all of the places we ought to designate as wilderness that we \ndo not have as wilderness. There is an interesting little suggestion. \nOne of the places they designate as wilderness happens to have a \nrailroad tunnel running underneath it. The railroad tunnel is already \nin. The trains are already going back and forth. They say it should \nstill be designated wilderness because the activity beneath the surface \ndoes not detract from the glorious wilderness experience on top of it.\n  I say to those who wrote this book, what is the difference between \ncoal mining that is going on underneath the surface, hundreds if not \nthousands of feet below the magnificent scenery up above, and railroad \ncars going back and forth? If you can live with railroad cars, saying \nthat does not detract from the experience on the surface, I tell you, \nyou should be able to live with coal mining, particularly with the long \nwall technology to which the Senator from New Jersey referred.\n  Now, Mr. President, in conclusion, I know those are very welcome \nwords, and for most of the people who are listening, I go back to the \ncomment made by the Senator from New Jersey in his conclusion. He \nquoted an editorial from a newspaper, the editors of which, I would \nguess, have little or no personal experience with any of these issues \nwe have been talking about. The editorial says there are two \nphilosophies, and we have a clash between the two philosophies: Whether \nwe want to support solitude and recreation, one philosophy; or whether \nall things on the Earth should be exploited for human development, the \nother philosophy. Of course, they came down on the side of the first, \nas does the Senator from New Jersey, which is his right. I respect him \nfor it. I respect the thoughtful, intelligent way in which he proposed \nhis arguments.\n  I suggest, however, based on what I now know about this, that these \nare not the two philosophies at stake here at all. I suggest, Mr. \nPresident, that, yes, this is an argument between two philosophies, but \nthese two philosophies have nothing to do with the question of, are you \nin favor of solitude and recreation, or are you in favor of human \ndevelopment?\n  The two philosophies are these, Mr. President: Do you believe that \nnature is perfect and benign and must be left alone to achieve the \nhighest moral goal; or do you believe that nature is constantly \nchanging, moving from one moral circumstance to the other with such \nrapidity that there is no moral judgment that can be found, and \ntherefore nature can be managed without any moral implications. Based \non what we have seen here, based on what I have seen as I have gone \nthroughout the western lands, I believe that there is moral \njustification for managing nature, for planting trees where they did \nnot exist before, for running cattle on areas that will produce greater \nvegetation than was there before. That is my philosophy. I do not run \nfrom it nor apologize for it.\n  I close with this real-life example that illustrates what I am \ntalking about. There is in Utah--there was in Utah; I must put it in \nthe past tense, unfortunately--there was in Utah in Garfield County, \none of the counties that would be most affected by this legislation, a \nmagnificent field--beyond field; a magnificent area--filled with \nbuttercups. I did not ever see it myself, but I am told, and I am \nquoting from those who did see it. It was one of the most awe-inspiring \nsights anyone could experience, going out and seeing this huge field, \nlush and gorgeous, at the proper time with buttercups blooming. Cattle \ngrazed in that field, and people who belonged to the organizations \nlisted by the Senator from Alaska decided that field of buttercups was \nso magnificent that it must be preserved; it must be protected from the \ndegradation of human beings.\n\n  Since there was no legislative way to do it, they raised the money--\nthe money presumably they could not find to bring the lawsuits to \nprotect their position elsewhere--they raised the money, purchased this \npiece of land, and then fenced it off so that the beauties of nature as \nmanifested in these buttercups would be protected forever and ever.\n  That was just a few years ago, Mr. President. If you were to go to \nGarfield County today and ask the residents of Garfield County, ``Where \nare your buttercups,'' they would tell you there are no buttercups. \nThey would take you out to the piece of land that had been fenced off \nand preserved from any human management. You can see that. What it is \nfilled with is dead grass. Why? Because no longer were human beings \nallowed to run their cattle through that area, so that the grasses that \nchoked out the buttercups were able to grow up, unmolested and uneaten. \nThe manure that the cattle normally brought with them into the area \ndisappeared, and now the heavy grasses have grown up, choked out all \nthe buttercups, and then, unfertilized themselves, have died, and you \nhave one of the most sterile, uninspiring pieces of real estate on the \nplanet to which somebody paid a fairly pretty penny in order to \npreserve the buttercups.\n  Mr. President, human involvement in the environment is not \nautomatically bad for the environment. Human involvement in the \nenvironment, if properly managed, can produce good results for the \nenvironment. Saying that we are not going to allow someone that does \nnot have any personal stake in this issue to lock up huge chunks of the \nenvironment in the name of the environment does not mean we are opposed \nto the environment.\n  In my view, Mr. President, sound stewardship by intelligent human \nbeings who love the environment can be good for the environment. \nLocking humans out arbitrarily by legislative fiat is not automatically \nthe proper environmental thing to do.\n  I close as I began, Mr. President, by taking you back with me to that \nmoment when I first began my odyssey in understanding this issue, as I \nstood with this woman in southeastern Utah, looking out over absolutely \npristine territory, and having her say to me, ``Look at the land. What \ndo you see? It is pristine. My family and I have been making our \nlivings off of this land for five generations. Tell me we do not love \nthe land and that we cannot be trusted to manage the land.'' I could \nnot tell her that. I cannot tell this Senate that. I cannot tell the \nPresident of the United States that.\n  The bill we have crafted is not only the right bill for the people of \nUtah, it is, Mr. President, the right bill for the environment and the \nenvironmentalists. If they will simply come out of their carports and \ncome away from their mailing lists and come with us, to go through the \nland and talk with the people who live there and spend time\n\n[[Page S2790]]\n\nwith the land managers, the true lovers of the environment will come to \nagree with us that our bill for wilderness in the State of Utah is the \nproper environmental response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to compliment my colleague for his \nvery good remarks and his ability to put into prosaic and also simple \nterms just what is involved here.\n  In fact, both of us have been fighting for this for a long time. It \nis a moderate, reasonable approach. We really appreciate our colleagues \nwho cooperated to help us on this, because it is not going to go away \nfor us or for anybody else here until we get it resolved. It is a \nreasoned, moderate, decent approach.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2737-4", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2790-S2792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JUDICIAL SELECTION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to address an issue that I have \ndiscussed recently before the Senate: judicial selection. As I have \nsaid before, differences in judicial philosophy can have real and \nprofound consequences for the safety of Americans in their \nneighborhoods homes and workplaces. Judges are every bit as much a part \nof the Federal anticrime effort as are U.S. attorneys and FBI and DEA \nagents.\n  In my last speech, I drew attention to two Federal district judges \nappointed by President Clinton--Judges Harold Baer, Jr. and James \nBeaty. These two judges rendered decisions favorable to criminal \ndefendants based on legal technicalities that had nothing to do with \ntheir guilt.\n  Judge Baer sparked outrage throughout the Nation when he suppressed \nevidence seized during the stop of an automobile by police who had \nwitnessed four men drop off two bags in the trunk at 5 a.m., without \nspeaking to the driver, and who then rapidly left the scene when they \nsaw a police officer looking at them. The bags turned out to contain \nabout 80 pounds of drugs. Judge Beaty has received similar criticism \nfor releasing a man who murdered his parents in their own bed because a \njuror had gone to look at a tree where the murder weapon was found.\n  I was pleased to learn that President Clinton is upset about Judge \nBaer's outrageous decision. He even momentarily suggested, through his \npress secretary, that the judge should resign if he does not reverse \nhimself. But President Clinton concern is too little, too late. He \nshould have been more concerned when he nominated this individual to \nlifetime tenure as a Federal judge. A mistake here lasts a lifetime, \nnot just 4 years. Judge Baer is one of President Clinton's lasting \nlegacies.\n  And the President's concern comes only after I and many others have \ncriticized the decision literally for weeks.\n  The President talks about putting cops on the beat, yet he appoints \njudges who are putting criminals back on the street.\n  Now that the American people are suffering from the consequences of \nthis administration's judicial nominations, President Clinton's initial \nsolution was to call upon Judge Baer to resign. This was a meaningless \ngesture that has no practical effect because the only way to remove a \njudge is to impeach him. President Clinton is now left to hoping Judge \nBaer will reverse himself. The true check on these solf-on-crime \njudicial activists is to never appoint them in the first place.\n  Let me be clear, I did not call for Judge Baer's resignation. I \nsimply pointed out that there is no substitute for the sound exercise \nof the President's power to appoint judges to lifetime positions.\n  Let me assure my colleagues, Judge Baer is not the only judge \nappointed since January, 1993 that, in my view, President Clinton \nshould feel misgivings about.\n  Will the President chastise Judge Beaty, or does he agree with his \ndecision to release a convicted double murderer on a technicality? I am \nnot alone in my criticism of Judge Beaty--the Wall Street Journal has \nsaid that Judge Beaty and his Carter-appointed colleague took ``a view \nof defendants' rights that is so expansive that they are willing to put \na murderer back out on the streets because a juror took a look at a \ntree.'' The entire fourth circuit has voted to grant en banc review of \nthe case, and I fully expect the court to do the right thing and \nreverse Judge Beaty's misguided opinion.\n  But President Clinton has not called upon Judge Beaty to resign. \nInstead, he is rewarding Judge Beaty by promoting him. He has nominated \nJudge Beaty to the fourth circuit. While the President cannot force \nactivist, soft-on-crime judges to resign, he can choose to keep them \nwhere they are instead of promoting them to the appellate courts, where \nthey can do even more damage to the law and to our communities. Will \nPresident Clinton regret Judge Beaty's soft-on-crime decisions if they \nstart to issue from the fourth circuit? Will he then suggest that Judge \nBeaty resign? Perhaps he ought to withdraw that nomination--it is in is \npower to do so, removing Judge Baer is not.\n  To be sure, Republican appointed judges can make erroneous rulings. \nAnd, I understand the Clinton administration is on a desperate damage \ncontrol mission to mention such rulings. That is fine by me, because \nthe more information about the track records of Republican and \nDemocratic appointed judges, the better.\n  I hardly agree with every decision of a Republican appointed judge. \nNor do I disagree with every decision of a Democratic appointed judge.\n  Nevertheless, there can be little doubt that judges appointed by \nRepublican Presidents will be generally tougher on crime than \nDemocratic appointees. As I will explain in this and subsequent \nspeeches, on the whole judges appointed by Democrat Presidents are \ninvariably more activist and more sympathetic to criminal rights than \nthe great majority of judges appointed by Republican Presidents.\n  I does little good to ask these judges to resign or to chastise them \nafter they have inflicted harm upon the law and upon the rights of our \ncommunities to protect themselves from crime, violence, and drugs. \nPresident Clinton's momentary resignation gesture is only the latest \nexample of this administration's eagerness to flip-flop wherever it \nmeets a stiff breeze of public disapproval of its actions.\n  And what excuse, Mr. President, does President Clinton have for the \nnomination of Judge J. Lee Sarokin of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nThird Circuit, and Judge Rosemary Barkett of the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Eleventh Circuit? These are two of the most activist friends of \ncriminal rights on our Federal courts of appeals. Their judicial track \nrecords were crystal clear at the time President Clinton appointed \nthem. The President nominated Judges Sarokin and Barkett with full \nknowledge of their records.\n  I will have more to say about these two judges in the future, but let \nme remind the Senate and the American people that I led the opposition \nto these two nominees because of their activist, soft-on-crime \napproach. The Clinton administration fought hard to get these nominees \nthrough the Judiciary Committee and through the Senate, which confirmed \nboth Judge Sarokin and Judge Barkett in 1994.\n  I regret to say that my predictions about these two judges have been \nproven correct. Judge Sarokin has repeatedly come down on the side of \ncriminals and prisoners in a series of cases, and he recently voted to \noverturn the death sentences of two Delaware men who, in separate \ncases, killed several elderly people. Not to be outdone by her New \nJersey colleague, Judge Barkett has continued her tolerant attitude \ntoward drugs in our society and her suspicion of the police. Just last \nmonth she argued in an opinion that police could not conduct random \nroadblocks to prevent traffic violations and to search for drugs--in \nher words the searches were ``intolerable and unreasonable.''\n  Luckily, in both of the cases that I have just mentioned, Reagan and \nBush appointees formed a majority of the court and ensured that Judges \nSarokin and Barkett's views were made known as dissents. But if Judges \nSarokin and Barkett and other Clinton nominees had formed a majority on \nthose courts, they would have put the criminals back on the street. If \nPresident Clinton should win a second term, he will appoint a majority \nof the judges on the Federal courts of appeals. Judges Barkett and \nSarokin provide a clear\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\nexample of what we can expect from the Federal courts should President \nClinton appoint judges for 4 more years.\n  Can the administration name any Reagan or Bush appellate judges who \nhave argued so often and so vigorously in favor of elevating criminal \nrights above the right of the community to protect itself? I don't \nthink they can. In fact, the record indicates that the current \nadministration has nominated several judges who have ruled in favor of \ncriminals or prisoners clearly and consistently. When they are right, \nthat is fine. In most of these cases they are wrong.\n  For example, let me tell the American people about the case of United \nStates v. Hamrick, [43 F.3d 877 (CA4 1995) (en banc)]. While serving \ntime in Federal prison for threatening to kill President Reagan, \ndefendant Rodney Hamrick built several improvised bombs, threatened to \ndestroy a Federal building, shot other inmates with improvised guns, \nand threatened to kill Federal judges. While serving his various \nsentences, Hamrick built a letter bomb of materials available in prison \nthat, in the words of Judge Michael Luttig's opinion for the fourth \ncircuit, if fully effective could have produced a 1,000-degree fireball \nup to 3 feet in diameter. This fireball would have burned the skin and \neyes of anyone exposed to it. If those exposed were inhaling when the \nbomb detonated, the fireball could have seared their lungs, possibly \nresulting in death.\n  Hamrick sent the bomb to William Kolibash, the U.S. attorney for the \nNorthern District of West Virginia, whose office was responsible for \nHamrick's prosecution. Kolibash opened the package, but the bomb was \nfaulty and only scorched the package instead of detonating. Hamrick put \nhis own return address on the envelope, making his arrest an easy \nmatter since he was in prison. Hamrick confessed and stated that he \nintended the bomb to go off in retaliation for his prosecution.\n  Hamrick was convicted by a jury of assault of a U.S. attorney with a \ndeadly or dangerous weapon under 18 U.S. Sec. 111(b). Relying upon \napplicable Supreme Court precedent, Judge Luttig affirmed the \nconviction for the en banc fourth circuit. He was joined by Judges \nRussell, Widener, Wilkinson, Wilkins, Niemeyer, and Williams. Judge \nHamilton wrote a concurring opinion. All of these judges were appointed \nby Republican Presidents.\n  Judge Ervin, then chief judge and an appointee of President Carter, \nwrote the dissent. He was joined by every Democratic appointed judge on \nthe circuit in arguing that because the bomb was made badly, it could \nnot constitute a deadly or dangerous weapon under the statute. Judge \nBlane Michael, President Clinton's appointment to the fourth circuit, \njoined this illogical, unreasonable decision. He joined Chief Judge \nErvin's conclusion that because the bomb lacked an igniter, it could \nnot be called a dysfunctional bomb, as the majority concluded, but \ninstead was, in the dissent's phrase, an ``incomplete bomb,'' and hence \ncould not be a dangerous weapon under the statute. Goodness gracious. \nWhat if it had been a real bomb?\n  Mr. President, I imagine that Judge Ervin and Judge Michael also \nwould think that if a defendant pointed a gun at you or me and pulled \nthe trigger, but the gun is defective and doesn't fire, the defendant \nwould not be guilty of attempted murder because he used an incomplete \ngun. Such sophistic word games demonstrate the eagerness of Judge \nMichael and his dissenting colleagues to protect criminals at the \nexpense of law enforcement.\n  Even once the criminals are convicted and sent to prison, the judges \nnominated by President Clinton continue to adopt a tolerant attitude. \nThese judges are determined to defend prisoners against the rights of \nsociety to defend itself from violent crime. These judges should be \nmore concerned about the rights of society to incarcerate convicted \ncriminals and to run orderly prisons before they start wringing their \nhands about how unfair a punishment it is to be in jail.\n  On this score, let me just identify one decision out of many that \nexemplifies the willingness of some activist Clinton judges to protect \nthose who have harmed and attacked our society. Let me tell the \nAmerican people about Giano versus Senkowski, a case in which an inmate \nbrought a Federal civil right suit against a prison that refused to \nallow inmates to possess sexually explicit photographs of spouses or \ngirlfriends. The plaintiff somehow felt that his first amendment rights \nwere violated. It is a demonstration of how far activist judges have \nalready expanded the laws that a prisoner can even bring a lawsuit on \nsuch a frivolous claim.\n  The majority, Judges Joseph McLauglin and Dennis Jacobs, both Bush \nappointees, properly rejected the prisoner's amazing claim that this \npolicy violated his first amendment rights. Under Supreme Court \nprecedent, courts are to uphold prison regulations if they are \nreasonably related to a legitimate penological interest. This was the \ncase here, especially in light of the duty of the Federal courts to \ngrant prison administrators discretion to run their prisons in a safe, \nefficient, and orderly way. Convicted criminals are in prison for a \nreason: punishment. Sometimes, activist judges forget this simple fact.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Guido Calabresi, a former dean of the Yale Law \nSchool who President Clinton appointed to the second circuit, \ndisagreed. He dissented from the majority and asserted that the first \namendment provides prisoners with the right to possess such sexually \nexplicit photographs. Judge Calabresi even went so far as to compare \nhis position with the position of the Supreme Court in the Pentagon \nPapers case, as examples of instances in which the courts courageously \nresisted scare tactics in the absence of proof.\n  What the first amendment's plain words--``Congress shall make no law \nabridging the freedom of speech, or of the press''--has to do with \nconvicted prisoners prossessing sexually explicit pictures is beyond \nme.\n  Judge Calabresi argued that the case should be sent back for \nfactfinding--what this factfinding would be I do not want to know--\nbecause he thought it possible that these pictures might diminish \nviolence by mollifying prisoners. Gee. What reasoning. Judge Calabresi \nalso saw fit to suggest several alternative policies, such as allowing \ninmates to be sent photographs but providing that the pictures may be \nseen only at appointed places, or allowing photographs to be received \nand seen for a brief time before they must be returned.\n  It is exactly this intrusiveness that demonstrates the activist \nstance of the Clinton judiciary. Here we have a Federal judge of the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals deciding what policies a prison ought \nto have regarding sexually explicit photographs. The judge wants \nfactfinding conducted to produce evidence about the link between such \nphotographs and violence. He has ideas about how the pictures are to be \nprovided and used. I am sorry, but this seems like a job for prison \nadministrators, who are expert at these issues and who are accountable \nto the people. It is the people, after all, who must pay for the costs \nof incarceration and who ultimately must fund the fanciful policies \nJudge Calabresi would impose.\n  Why is this so important? As a practical matter, we in the Senate \ngive the President deference in confirming judicial candidates \nnominated by the President.\n  No one can say that I have not been at the forefront to giving \ndeference to this President. I like him personally. I want to help him. \nI certainly believe he was elected and I believe he has a right to \nnominate these judges. I might say though that a Republican President \nwould not nominate the same judges that a Democrat would and vice \nversa.\n  Indicia of judicial activism or a soft-on-crime outlook are not \nalways present in a nominee's record. But in the cases of Judge Sarokin \nand Barkett, they were, and we Republicans in the Senate attempted to \ndefeat them on those grounds.\n  We also now can view the products of the President's choices. We do \nnot just have two trial judges, Judges Baer and Beaty, who have trouble \nunderstanding the role of the Federal courts in law enforcement and in \nthe war on crime. President Clinton has sent judicial activists to \nFederal appellate courts as well, and the effects of his approach to \njudicial selection are felt even at a court as high as the Supreme \nCourt. This is not good for the Nation, which\n\n[[Page S2792]]\n\nmust live under the permissive rules set by these liberal judges when \nthey attempt to rid our streets of crime and drugs.\n  The judicial philosophy of nominees to the Federal bench generally \nreflects the judicial philosophy of the person occupying the Oval \nOffice. We in Congress have sought to restore and strengthen our \nNation's war on crime and on drugs and to guarantee the safety of \nAmericans in their streets, homes, and workplaces. For all of the \nPresident's tough-on-crime rhetoric, his judicial nominations too often \nundermine the fight against crime and drugs.\n  This is an important issue. It may be the single most important issue \nin the next Presidential campaign. Frankly, I hope everybody in America \nwill give some thought to it because I for one am tired of having these \nsoft-on-crime judges on the bench. I for one am tired of having people \nwho, as activists, do not understand the nature and role of judging, \nwhich is that judges are to interpret the laws that are made by those \nwho are elected to make them. Judges are not elected to anything. They \nare nominated and confirmed for life. Hopefully, they will be removed \nfrom the pressures of politics and will be able to do what is right. I \nhave to say that many of these judges are very sincere. They are kind-\nhearted, decent, honorable people who are so softhearted that they just \ndo not see why we have to punish people because of the crimes they \ncommit, or why we have to be as tough as we have to be. But those of us \nwho really study these areas know that if a person is put in jail--a \nviolent criminal--until they are 50 years of age there is a very high \npropensity that they will never commit violence after 50. But if we \nhave them going in and out of the doors in those early years when they \nare violent criminals, they just go from one violent crime to the next, \nand society is the loser. We understand that here in the District of \nColumbia, which is sometimes known as ``Murder Capital U.S.A.'' and \n``Drug Capital U.S.A.'' That needs to be cleaned up.\n  That is why I put $20 million in a recent bill to give directly to \nthe chief of police here so that they can acquire the necessary cars \nand weapons and ammunition and other facilities that they need to be \nable to run a better police force. Consider that it was the best police \nforce in the Nation 20 years ago; today it is the worst in the Nation. \nSo we put our money where our mouth is, at least as far as the Senate \nis concerned. I hope that money stays in in the House.\n  We have to pay attention where judges are concerned, too. We have to \nget people who really are going to make a difference against the \ncriminal conduct in our society. I am fed up with our streets not being \nsafe. I am fed up with our homes not even being safe. We are becoming a \npeople who have to lock the doors every time we turn around, and I for \none think it is time to stop it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been noted. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2790-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2792-S2795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PRESIDIO PROPERTIES ADMINISTRATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this morning my friend from New Jersey \nreflected a little history of public lands. I listened intently, and \nwhile I appreciate his point of view, I suggest there are two points of \nview relative to the history of public lands and the transition that \nhas occurred in this country.\n  Under the Northwest Ordinance, which, as a matter of fact, predated \nthe Constitution, the prevailing philosophy was simply to dispose of \nlands either to the States or the territories or to private \nindividuals. And as the several States obtained their inheritance, they \nfor obvious reasons began to lose interest in further Federal \ntransfers. In other words, they had achieved what they wanted.\n  Mr. President, this goes back to the period of about 1788 when this \nNorthwest Ordinance prevailed. So they lost the incentive once they \nreceived their land and further Federal transfers simply were not \nnecessary. The State of Arkansas obtained over 11 million acres from \nthe Federal Government, over one-third of its total acreage. Only about \n3 percent of New Jersey currently is in Federal ownership.\n  So the history of public lands is a history of those States, mainly \nthe Eastern States, that have already obtained the lands needed for \ntheir schools, their roads, their economy, and other purposes. Then we \nhave the Western States and territories that basically remain captive \nto the Federal Government and the interests of those Eastern States. \nThe definition of ``West,'' as we all know, steadily moved west. It \nmoved from what was West, in 1790, Ohio, to Utah and my State of Alaska \nin 1990.\n  According to the 1984 BLM public lands statistics, Florida obtained \nover 24 million acres from 1803 to 1984 out of a total of 34 million \nacres in that entire State. Arkansas, as I mentioned, obtained over \none-third of its entire acreage. Now, there was a time when the State \nof New Jersey looked at the western lands as a source of raising money \nfor needs in New Jersey--roads and docks, the harbors, other public \nworks in New Jersey--and there was a time when New Jersey wanted the \nwestern lands basically to feed its industry.\n  It was a concept that is not unknown to us, Mr. President. The \nEastern States had the capital base, and where did they look? They \nlooked to the West to put that capital to work in investments that \ncould generate a handsome return because the money centers at that time \nwere in the East, as they are today for the most part. So the eastern \nat that time, I think it is fair to say, elitists chose to invest in \nthe West and generate a return, and they could continue to live in the \nmore luxurious lifestyle that existed in the East because the West was \nconsidered pretty much a frontier. So States like New Jersey and New \nYork invested in western lands to feed, if you will, the fruits \nassociated with the productivity of the West.\n  Now we have seen a change in that, a rather remarkable change. Let us \nbe realistic and recognize New Jersey and other States now want western \nlands not necessarily as a return on the investment that was initially \ngenerated there, although some of it is fourth and fifth generation \nwealth, but they look at the West as a playground, a recreation area \nfor themselves and others of that elitist group.\n  If the State of Utah is unable to use its school lands to fund \neducation, that is even better, because then Utah will become even more \ndependent on the Federal Government and the preferred social agenda of \nWashington, DC. Make no mistake about it. This is not unique to the \nState of Utah.\n  Those of us who are westerners question when is enough enough. There \nhas been no change in the policy of some of these eastern seaboard \nStates and many of the other original States from 1790 until now. What \nhas changed is what they want western lands for. There would be a \nconsiderable difference if New Jersey as a State were 63 percent owned \nby the Federal Government, like Utah, but it is not. The State of New \nJersey is only 3 percent owned by the Federal Government, so it has the \nluxury to assume that two-thirds of Utah is, one might interpret, for \nthe private pleasure of the residents of New Jersey.\n\n  We can get into a long discussion over the various conservation \nmeasures mentioned by the Senator from New Jersey, but I think the \nSenate should remember that the primary purpose of the national \nforests--a lot of us seem to have forgotten this--the primary purpose \nof the national forests, when they were withdrawn from public domain, \nwas simply to ensure a steady supply, a renewable supply, of timber. \nThat is almost seen as a joke today, but that was the concept; the \nforests were to be conserved, used, and managed to provide a steady \nsupply of timber.\n  The Wilderness Act, speaking of history, was originally intended to \nset\n\n[[Page S2793]]\n\naside pristine areas, untrammeled areas where mankind was not evident. \nNow, in our zealous efforts, we seem to be ready to put almost anything \ninto wilderness--roads, structures. Whatever the objective, a \nwilderness designation is not to preserve pristine areas but to prevent \nother uses that some organization or group wants to prevent.\n  So, I hope, as we reflect on history, we do reflect on this dichotomy \nassociated with the traditions of the influence of the Eastern States, \nwhich have virtually no public land in those States, which have \nvirtually no wilderness in those States, setting the precedent for the \nrest of the Nation.\n  I am going to try to leave us with a little understanding of what \nthis business of public land and wilderness land is all about, \nreflecting on how some States, like mine, enjoy a significant amount of \nwilderness. My State of Alaska has 365 million total acres. We are 2\\1/\n2\\ times the size of the State of Texas. I am glad my friends from \nTexas are not here to be reminded of that. Out of that 365 million \nacres, we have 57.4 million acres of wilderness. That is quite a bit of \nwilderness. We are proud of that wilderness. We take good care of that \nwilderness. But we think enough is enough.\n  If you took the State of Arkansas with 33 million acres of \nwilderness, you add the State of New Jersey with 4.8 million acres, \nWest Virginia with 15 million acres, Vermont with 5 million acres, you \ncome up with about 57 million acres--equal to what is in my State of \nAlaska. So there are four States. The difference here is we are not \ntalking about wilderness in Arkansas, New Jersey, West Virginia, or \nVermont. We are talking about their total acreage. So I do not want to \nmislead the Presiding Officer when I say Alaska has 57 million acres of \nwilderness out of 365 million acres. If you take the entire landmass of \nthe State of Arkansas at 33 million, New Jersey 4.8, West Virginia 15, \nand Vermont 5, you come up with a combined area of 57.8 million acres \nfor those four States. That equates to what is in my State alone as \nwilderness.\n  Let us go one step further. Let us look at some of these States and \nrecognize that Arkansas has 33 million acres in its entire State, \n120,378 acres in wilderness--not very much. New Jersey has 4.8 million \nacres in the entire State, 10,341 acres of wilderness.\n  Let us compare that with Utah. Utah has 52 million acres in the \nState, 890,858 acres of wilderness, and we are proposing to add 2 \nmillion to that, that would be 2.9 million acres of wilderness in the \nState, 891,000 managed by the Forest Service and 2 million under BLM \nwilderness.\n  I think it is important that we reflect on those comparisons. The \nStates in question with large wilderness acreage, outside of the State \nof Alaska, include Arizona at 4.5 million acres, California at 5.9 \nmillion acres, Colorado at 2.6 million acres, Florida at 1.4 million \nacres, Idaho at 4 million acres, Minnesota at 805,000, Montana at 3.4 \nmillion acres, New Mexico at 1.6 million acres, Oregon at a little over \n2 million acres, Washington at 4.2 million acres, and Wyoming at 3 \nmillion acres. So, by this action we would be creating in Utah \nwilderness equal to that existing in Wyoming today.\n  What about some of the other States? Interestingly enough--and I hope \nmy colleagues from Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, and \nRhode Island are listening, because these six States that have no \nwilderness. There is no wilderness in Connecticut, no wilderness in \nDelaware, no wilderness in Iowa, no wilderness in Kansas, no wilderness \nin Maryland, and no wilderness in Rhode Island.\n  How do you suppose that came about? It came about, as I indicated in \nmy opening remarks, when those States that have been around a long \ntime--when the Northwest Ordinance philosophy prevailed, back in 1788--\nacquired their land. That is where it ended. Now these States are \nsaying we do not want any wilderness in our State. We want the \nwilderness out West.\n  I think everybody ought to have a little wilderness. I think, before \nI get out of this body, I am going to propose some legislation that \nevery State have a little wilderness. They can designate where it is. \nMaybe Sterling Forest should be a wilderness. Perhaps the States of New \nYork and New Jersey could designate this transfer of land into a \nwilderness. It is going to be used as a watershed. Why not make it a \nwilderness?\n  Another curious consideration is, who owns the States? Alabama is 3 \npercent owned by the Federal Government, Alaska 68 percent owned by the \nFederal Government; Arizona, 47 percent; Arkansas, 8 percent; \nCalifornia, 44 percent; Colorado, 36; Connecticut, 1 percent; Delaware, \n2 percent; District of Columbia, 26 percent. I am surprised it is not \nhigher. Florida, 9 percent; Georgia, 4 percent owned by the Federal \nGovernment; Hawaii, 16 percent. You get to Idaho, 62 percent of Idaho's \nlandmass is owned by the Federal Government; Illinois, 3 percent; \nIndiana, 2; Iowa, 1; Kansas, 1; Kentucky, 4; Louisiana, 3 percent; \nMaine, 1 percent; Maryland, 3; Massachusetts, 1; Michigan, 13; \nMinnesota, 10; Mississippi, 4.\n  These are extraordinary comparisons with the prevalence of Federal \nownership being out West. Missouri is 5 percent owned by the Federal \nGovernment; Montana, 28; Nebraska, 1; Nevada, 83 percent owned by the \nFederal Government; New Hampshire, 13; New Jersey, 2 percent; New \nMexico, 33; New York, 1--New York 1--North Carolina, 6; North Dakota, \n4; Ohio, 1 percent; Oklahoma, 2 percent; Oregon, 52 percent owned by \nthe Federal Government; Pennsylvania, 2 percent; Rhode Island, 1 \npercent; South Carolina, 5 percent; South Dakota, 6 percent, Tennessee, \n4 percent; Texas, the second largest State in the Union, Mr. President, \nhas only 1 percent of its landmass owned by the Federal Government.\n  Clearly, when they came into the Union, they made certain conditions \nprevail relative to ownership, and the Federal Government today owns 1 \npercent of the land mass of Texas, compared with Utah, which is 64 \npercent; Vermont, 6 percent; Virginia, 6 percent; Washington, 29 \npercent owned; West Virginia, 7; Wisconsin, 10; Wyoming, 49.\n  So there you have it, Mr. President, a comparison of the States. Now \nwe look at the merits of adding 2 million acres to Utah wilderness, as \nrecommended by the delegation from Utah and a vast majority of the Utah \nLegislature, both the house and senate and the Governor.\n  I think it is also interesting to note that the process that occurred \nin Utah did not happen by accident. It happened as a result of a number \nof meetings that were held and the consensus that was developed there \nover an extended period of time. As the record indicates, some $10 \nmillion was spent reaching the point we are at today, evaluating just \nwhat would be appropriate for the State of Utah; 15 years went into \nthat study; 16,000 written comments were processed; 75 formal public \nhearings were held. This was a process that was open to the public \nthroughout the United States, professionals were hired to make the \nrecommendation of 1.9 million, and today we have a proposal of 2 \nmillion acres in the Utah wilderness.\n  As I indicated to my friend from New Jersey this morning, the matter \nof Sterling Forest is also somewhat contentious, as evidenced by the \nconsideration of some of the specifics, which I will share with my \ncolleagues. But nevertheless, I support the Senator from New Jersey in \nhis efforts, because I believe he has to answer to his constituents, \nand I believe it is fair to say that both the Senators from New Jersey \nsupport the Sterling Forest. I respect that process. But I think the \nRecord should note who owns the Sterling Forest.\n  Sterling Forest is currently owned by the Swiss Insurance Group of \nZurich. They signed a purchase agreement with the Swiss company for the \nproperty in June 1995. What is it valued at? I am told it is valued \nsomewhere between $55 and $65 million. How much would it cost if we \nwere to buy it? The request in the legislation of the Senator from New \nJersey is for Federal participation of about $17.5 million. This will \nbe the Federal figure regardless of the total purchase price. The \nbalance of the purchase price is going to be paid by the States of New \nYork and New Jersey and the private sector. I understand about 2,400 \nacres of Sterling Forest rests in New Jersey. The balance is in New \nYork.\n  There are those who might think Sterling Forest is just that, an \nancient\n\n[[Page S2794]]\n\ngrowth forest, but Sterling Forest has been logged. What you have there \ntoday is second growth. Hardwood logging has taken place. I thought I \nwould ask the question, When was it last logged? The answer was, it is \ncurrently being logged, Mr. President, by the Sterling Forest Corp., a \nsubsidiary of the Swiss Insurance Group of Zurich.\n  If the Sterling Forest is acquired, of course, logging is not \ncontinued, and that is really the business of the delegation from New \nJersey. The primary reason for purchasing Sterling Forest, as I \nunderstand, appreciate and support, is to protect the watershed. \nHunting would be allowed.\n  So if anybody wants further information with regard to the situation \nin Sterling Forest, why, I am sure the Senator from New Jersey will be \nhappy to provide it. If not, we have the address and phone number of \nthe Zurich Reinsurance Center in New York, the principals to contact.\n  I do not put this out as a criticism; I simply put it out as a \nreality that here we have an acquisition taking place in the best \ninterest of clearly the State of New York and the State of New Jersey. \nThere are about 30 square miles, 19,200 acres are in New York and about \n2,400, as I have mentioned, in New Jersey.\n  It is also my understanding that what we are purchasing here are \ncertain easements owned and managed by the U.S. Park Service that are \nin the Appalachian trail area but that triggers, if you will, a process \nwhereby New York and New Jersey will come up with the additional \nfunding, and that would be somewhere in the area of $40 or $45 million \nto acquire the land.\n  It is also interesting to note Sterling Forest has roads through it \nand other access, so it is pretty hard to suggest, perhaps, that it be \nmade a wilderness. Nevertheless, I think it is important that as this \nwatershed is addressed, relative to its use as a watershed, that as \nmuch of the wilderness characteristics as possible be retained for the \nbenefit of the citizens of New York, as well as the citizens of New \nJersey.\n  A lot of people do not really appreciate what 1 million acres equates \nto in size. We are talking about adding 2 million acres of wilderness \nin Utah. One million acres is equal to the size of the State of \nDelaware. If we are talking about 2 million acres, we are looking at \nthree times the size of the State of Rhode Island. Two million acres is \nabout half the size of the State of New Jersey, so it is a big chunk of \nreal estate. Unless you have some idea of acreage or the vastness of \nwilderness, you have no idea as to the significance of what that large \na piece of real estate is.\n  As I indicated in my remarks, for those who come from States that \nhave little or virtually no wilderness or States with little, if any, \nFederal ownership of their land, it is difficult for those Members to \nhave an appreciation of what it means to designate an additional area \nthe size of 2 million acres. While many of us support adding 2 million \nacres to wilderness, that is not enough for the advocates here who want \n5 to 6 million acres of wilderness.\n  They do not seem to care about the ability of the State of Utah to \nsupport its schools, support its economy. All they see is a vision out \nthere that tells them somehow this is not enough. As I have indicated, \nMr. President, as you look at the comparisons, what is enough? What is \nreasonable? What is balanced? The people of Utah, in their own good \njudgment, after $10 million and 15 years, have indicated, 1.9 million \nacres. The legislation proposes 2 million acres.\n  Mr. President, as we look at the history of Western public lands, \nlittle is said about the economy of the region. What happens to the \njobs? We cannot all be employed by the Federal Government. Who pays the \ntaxes? We have resources in the West that have fueled the economy of \nthis Nation for a long time.\n  Where we are lax, Mr. President, is in not recognizing that science \nand technology has given us the opportunity to develop our resources \nbetter, more efficiently, with more compatibility with the environment, \nthe ecology. As we address new and better ways to develop those \nresources, we seem reluctant to go back and review those of our laws \nthat protect these areas. We did not update our environmental laws. We \ndid not seem eager to look at cost-benefit risk analysis to determine, \nindeed, if it is practical to develop one resource or another.\n  So what we have here, Mr. President, is a fast-developing technology. \nThe minute you attempt to look at more efficient ways of cutting \ntimber, of mining, grazing, oil and gas development, it is suggested \nthat you are irresponsibly unwinding the advancements that have been \nmade in the environment.\n  Mr. President, the water is cleaner, the air is cleaner, we can do a \nbetter job. But we still need to maintain a balance. That balance \ndictates a healthy economy. Only with a healthy economy can we meet our \nenvironmental obligations.\n  So, when I see my good friend, who I know is very dedicated and \nbelieves diligently in his point of view, become a self-anointed savior \nof the West, I have to ask, who is he saving the West from? From other \nwesterners? Or is it really the elitist group, the big business?\n  Let me refer to the charts back here just very briefly with the \nrealization that these well-meaning groups somehow get a little overly \nambitious, in the opinion of the Senator from Alaska--let us recognize \nthem for what they are. They are big businesses, just like a lot of \nother big businesses. As I indicated earlier, the environmental \norganization incomes, the 12 major organizations in this country have \nassets of $1.2 billion. They have fund balances--that means immediate \naccess to cash--of $1.03 billion. There you have it. The revenues, $633 \nmillion; their expenses, $556 million; their assets $1.2 billion --the \nfund balances at $1 billion.\n  There is nothing wrong with that, but let us keep it in perspective. \nThey have to have a cause. They resolve one issue and they move on to \nthe next so they can generate membership, generate dollars. Let us be \nhonest. They accomplish a lot. But there has to be a balance. That is \nwhat is lacking, because if they had their way, the extreme would \nprevail.\n  They pay, as big business does, compensation. Several of the \nindividuals who represent these organizations--the National Wildlife \nFederation, the World Wildlife Fund, the Environmental Defense Fund, \nthe National Parks and Conservation Association--they pay their chief \nexecutive officers more than the President of the United States makes. \nThat is neither here nor there, but it points out my contention that it \nis simply big business. It is just a different type of business. It is \nworthwhile business, just as are job-developing business is in mining, \noil and gas, timber, and grazing.\n\n  Some of these people are extremists, though, Mr. President. They have \nto have a cause. The cause here is not wilderness, because 2 million \nacres of wilderness has been offered. It is more wilderness. It is 5 or \n6 million acres of wilderness.\n  Where is the balance? They are generating dollars and membership, \nusing scare tactics that suggest that the people of Utah are \nirresponsible, that they will go out and haphazardly develop their land \nor overdevelop it, overgraze it, overmine it. That will not happen, Mr. \nPresident. It will not happen in any State of the Union. But those are \nthe scare tactics that they use. They say, ``We must save the West from \nitself.''\n  There have been abuses in the West, just like there have in the East, \nbut I defy the membership of these organizations to take a look at the \neast coast. Go up in the train. Look at the aging of America. Take the \ntrain from Washington and look through New Jersey, look through \nDelaware, look out the window, look at New York, go on to Boston. Just \nlook at the mess that you see in the backyards of America.\n  Where is the energy of these organizations to correct that? It is not \nthere. They want to move out to an area where most people cannot visit, \ncannot see for themselves, see what the people in these Western States \nare responsible for. They are doing a good job. They are sensitive. No, \nthey do not want to start near home. They seem to have no concern about \nthe economy, the jobs, the taxes. I find that perplexing, Mr. \nPresident. They want to get on their white charger and save the world, \nbut they will not start right in their own backyard.\n  What we are looking at, Mr. President, is trying to balance this \nprocess. As I said, there is nothing wrong with Sterling Forest. I \nsupport it. I support\n\n[[Page S2795]]\n\nthe process that is underway here as far as reaching a compromise.\n  But we have to recognize reality, Mr. President. We have a trade \ndeficit in this country. Over half of it is the price of imported oil. \nWe have the reserves in this country. We have substantial reserves in \nmy State. We have the technology to do it safely. But the environmental \nelitists need a cause. They say, ``No, you can't do it. You don't have \nthe science. You don't have the technology.'' So what we are doing is \nimporting it. Fifty-four percent of our oil is imported now. We are \nbringing it in in foreign tankers.\n  If you ever have an accident, good luck in trying to find a deep \npocket like occurred with the Exxon Valdez where you had responsible \nparties. While the ship was operated irresponsibly, at least the deep \npocket was there.\n  Where are the payrolls going to come from? Are we going to ship our \ndollars overseas? The interesting thing, Mr. President, is that other \ncountries are not quite so sensitive as ours. Their logging practices, \ntheir mining practices do not have the same sensitivity.\n  So are we not hastening, if you will, by being hellbent to reduce our \nown resource development the onset of the very problems that we are \ntrying to avoid. Recognizing that we have the science and technology \nand experience to offset the imports from countries who allow \nexploitation without responsible resource development technology, \nwithout a response to renewable resources? So, are we really \naccomplishing a meaningful compromise? In many cases, I think not. We \nhave many issues relative to development, private land issues, \nendangered species, wetland, Superfund.\n\n  We talk about cost-benefit risk analysis, the need to review our \nenvironmental laws as we look at new technological advances, to better \nprotect our renewable resources. How do we get to a balance, Mr. \nPresident? I think we have that balance today in the proposal of 2 \nmillion acres of wilderness in the State of Utah.\n  As we wind up this debate, as least probably for today, I urge my \ncolleagues from the following States to recognize the reality of where \nwe are in this legislation. If this package does not stay together, \nColorado, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Utah, Idaho, Arizona, West Virginia, \nHawaii, New York, Massachusetts, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, and \nCalifornia will be affected because there are titles for public lands \nand changes in those States, as well as Georgia, Louisiana, \nMississippi, Idaho, Wyoming, Ohio, my State of Alaska, New Mexico--some \n56 titles or changes, Mr. President, a pretty significant number.\n  Now, the Senator from New Jersey said in a dear colleague letter that \nhe had joined with 17 of his colleagues. There are many provisions \nimportant to our respective States within this omnibus park \nlegislation. Well, we have plenty of them, Mr. President. As I said \nearlier today, the majority of these bills were placed on the calendar \nof the Senate April 7, 1995--almost a year ago. The Senator from New \nJersey could have let these environmental bills make their way to the \nHouse and go on to the President months ago. Unfortunately, he chose \nnot to do so. Mr. President, the direct result of these actions is this \npackage. The Senator from New Jersey, by his own actions, is in reality \nthe ghost writer of this bill that we are considering today.\n  As I said earlier, I accommodated the Senator from New Jersey on \nSterling Forest because I think it is in the best interest of his State \nand his constituents. Unfortunately, the Senator from New Jersey and \nothers do not seem to extend the same degree of confidence and respect \nto the citizens of Utah. I guess that is where we part.\n  Now, if this bill stays together, Americans are going to get 2 \nmillion acres of new wilderness. There is nothing in this legislation \nthat will prevent another Congress, another day, from adding additional \nwilderness lands in Utah or my State of Alaska. The will of Congress \nprevails.\n  The reality is this cannot go piecemeal. One bill cannot go without \nthe other. I guess, to quote the three musketeers, one for all and all \nfor one, or none. I urge my colleagues to support this package as it \nhas been presented, because an awful lot of hard work and an awful lot \nof benefits to an awful lot of States is at jeopardy here. To suggest \nit is irresponsible and to threaten the State of Utah because this \nlegislation does not propose enough wilderness, in the opinion of the \nSenator from Alaska is not only unrealistic and impractical, it is \nsimply absurd.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to recognize while we have \nhad an extended debate here about a lot of titles that are covered \nunder the bill, the success or failure of this bill is related \ntremendously to the Utah wilderness. I implore my colleagues who have \ntitles and interest in this bill to recognize that this does represent \na compromise, a 2-million acre compromise. As we have seen, the \nintensive lobbying by a relatively small segment of motivated \nextremists who say 2 million acres is not enough, does not represent \nthe prevailing attitude in Utah by a long shot, nor the prevailing \nattitude in the West by a long shot. It represents, perhaps some of the \nelitist Eastern States who simply have their land and do not have a dog \nin this fight.\n  This is far too important, Mr. President, to let slide for another \nCongress--15 years, $10 million expended. We have a solid \nrecommendation and a solid base of support.\n  Mr. President, as we look forward to another day on this matter, we \nhave attempted to accommodate each State that had an interest in public \nlands legislation. Now we are down to the point of determining whether \nor not those Members who have an interest will stick together to keep \nthis legislation in its package form. I have been assured that it will \npass in the House if it is kept that way. If it is broken up, if Utah \nwilderness is stricken from the body, the legislation and the packages \nas we know it today will fail.\n  I urge my colleagues, in conclusion, to reflect on the significance \nof that reality.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think it is appropriate now, I send a \ncloture motion to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, President Clinton has once again failed \nto demonstrate leadership to the American people in the budget crisis.\n\n[[Page S2796]]\n\n  The newspaper stories last week, reporting on the President's budget \nsubmission, missed the point. Like a straight man, the media dutifully \nreported on the budget using the standard White House spin--and with a \nstraight face.\n  They reported that the budget would balance by 2002, just as the \nWhite House claims. Instead, they should have challenged its integrity. \nThe balance part is all smoke and mirrors. Underneath, it is a brandnew \nbox of steroids for big Government.\n  The media should have cried, ``Stop the presses. Extra, extra, the \nera of big Government has returned. You see, the President pronounced \nin his State of the Union Address that the era of big Government is \nover.\n  That was 2 months ago. In other words, 2 short months after big \nGovernment was pronounced dead, it has miraculously resurrected.\n  Just look at this budget, Mr. President. Not a single government \nprogram terminated. They are all worthwhile--every last one of them, \naccording to the President. Meanwhile, the Federal debt rises from $4.9 \nto $6.5 trillion in 6 years. Spending rises from $1.6 to $1.9 trillion.\n  How is it that the era of big Government can be pronounced over with \nthis kind of a budget?\n  We have all heard the saying, ``Put your money where your mouth is.'' \nWe have also all heard the quote of former Attorney General John \nMitchell: ``You will be better advised to watch what we do instead of \nwhat we say.'' The budget is the fundamental statement of policy of any \nadministration. In it, an administration puts its money where its mouth \nis. Except this administration. Its mouth is in shrinking Government; \nbut, its money is in big Government.\n  With a discrepancy like this, which do we believe? The money or the \nmouth? Most insiders in this town, like John Mitchell did, know the \nanswer. They know you will be better advised to watch what we do \ninstead of what we say. I would submit, Mr. President, that that is why \nthe presses did not stop when the President submitted his budget. The \nreturn of big Government was not big news.\n  The media must have been pretty skeptical 2 months ago of the \nPresident's pronouncement of the end of big government. They did not \nfall for the old soft shoe routine. They know well enough that, in this \ntown, you watch what we do, not what we say. I have to hand it to \nfourth estate. They really know politicians.\n  Of course, they did have some clues about what to expect from the \nPresident. On June 4, 1992, Candidate Clinton told the country he would \nend deficit spending as we know it. He said ``I would present a 5-year \nplan to balance the budget.'' Since then, he submitted three no-year \nbalanced budgets. Each one had rising deficits as far as the eye could \nsee, usually around the figure of $200 billion.\n  Even this budget--balanced in name only--will never balance in the \nreal world. It lacks the integrity of true deficit reduction \ndecisionmaking. It is the manana budget. It puts everything off until \nmanana. A chimpanzee, banging away at a typewriter, would type out the \nentire Encyclopedia Britannica before the Clinton budget balances.\n  There are other clues of the old soft shoe routine. In September \n1992, the President wrote, in ``Putting People First,'' the following:\n\n       Middle class taxpayers will have a choice between a \n     children's tax credit or a significant reduction in their \n     income tax rate.\n\n  Yet, he just vetoed a children's tax credit. He did not even propose \none until Republicans took control of the Congress.\n  Instead, he increased taxes more than any other President in the \nhistory of the Nation. He raised taxes too much. But do not take my \nword for it. Here is what the President himself said. At a fundraiser \nin Houston on October 17, 1995, Mr. Clinton said,\n\n       Probably there are people in this room still mad at me at \n     that budget because you think I raised your taxes too much. \n     It might surprise you that I think I raised them too much, \n     too.\n\n  Mr. President, saying one thing and doing the opposite undermines \none's moral authority to lead. That is the case with this President. \nThere is a void in moral leadership in this White House. A good example \nfor the Nation cannot be set when the President--any President--says \none thing and does the opposite so consistently.\n  It is significant that such leadership has fallen to Congress which, \nas a body, is generally unsuited for moral leadership. Usually, it is \nthe individual of the President who can hear the discordant voices of \nthe Congress and the country, and unite them into harmony, into a \nsingle melody.\n  But in the absence of moral leadership in this White House, it was \nCongress--this Congress--that passed a balanced budget. The first \nbalanced budget to be passed by any Congress in 27 years.\n  It was Congress that passed a children's tax credit. It was Congress \nthat passed welfare reform. It was Congress that passed Medicare and \nMedicaid reform. It was Congress that passed a budget to end the era of \nbig Government. These are all the items that the President pledged to \ndo, but he did not do them. We did them.\n  Yet, what did he do in reality? He vetoed them. Balanced budget? \nVetoed. Welfare reform? Vetoed. Medicare reform? Vetoed. Medicaid \nreform? Vetoed. Children's tax credits? Vetoed. This is the ``Veto \nPresident.'' His policy is ``Just Say No.'' This is the ``Do-Nothing \nPresidency.'' The reason is simple--there is no moral leadership coming \nfrom the White House.\n  Some of us have tried to work with the President. I have found that, \nwhen he does what he says, we can work together. An example of that is \nthe President's national service program, AmeriCorps. I have been \nwarning the administration for 2 years that AmeriCorps needed to be \nreinvented. Arrogance appeared to be in the way. For 2 years, the \nadministration resisted the obvious need for reform.\n  But any program that pays close to $30,000 for a volunteer is in bad \nneed of reinvention. AmeriCorps was giving boondoggles at the Pentagon \na run for their money.\n  Under the new leadership of Harris Wofford--a former colleague of \nours in the Senate--AmeriCorps is finally being reinvented. Two weeks \nago, we held a joint press conference to announce the reinvention, and \nI pledged my support for their budget this year. We have heard lots \nabout reinventing Government from this administration. They have done \nsome good things. But they are just tinkering around the edges.\n  The Balanced Budget Act, passed last fall by this Congress, was a \nblueprint to reinvent the whole Federal Government. It did not have to \nbe done our way. We would have worked with the White House on an \nalternative. But the White House refused to work for a real, credible \nbalanced budget. There was a battle royale in the White House over the \nmind and soul of the President. The budget wonks lost out to the \npolitical operators.\n  The politicos argued that doing nothing would allow them to fund \ntheir special interests and maintain their voting base. Forget what is \ngood for the country. They simply put reelection over reform. So the \nPresident followed the advice of the political operatives. The bloated \nship of state steams along, on a rising tide of debt. Special interests \nare at the helm.\n  One of our colleagues in this body, Mr. President, understood this \nleadership problem in the White House last year. On October 21 of last \nyear, he is quoted in the New York Times saying of President Clinton,\n\n       What troubles me is that after three years as president, he \n     doesn't appear to know where he wants to lead America.\n\n  That quote is from a member of our President's own party, Mr. \nPresident. It is a quote from Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. I agree \nwith him.\n  Even more to the point is the inability of the President to lead. And \nevery time says one thing and does the opposite, he further erodes it.\n  It should have come as no surprise that politics would win out over \nfiscal sanity with this administration. Many of us had hoped a balanced \nbudget was possible. We could have saved ourselves the trouble if we \nwere not quite so optimistic. We should have done what the fourth \nestate did. We should have watched the President's actions, not his \nwords.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n[[Page S2797]]\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, as farmers in Minnesota and across the \nNation enter this year's planting season, I rise today in support of \nthe farm bill conference report Congress will consider later this week.\n\n  In the coming days, the Senate and the House, and ultimately the \nPresident, will have to make a choice: we will either revolutionize \nFederal agriculture policies as outlined in this conference report, or \nwe will continue the failed, Washington-knows-best policies of the past \n60 years. But that choice should be very clear, Mr. President.\n  After considerable delay, this much-needed legislation will give our \nagriculture communities a reasonable and responsible policy roadmap for \nthe future.\n  In the short term, decisions about planting, equipment purchases, \nfertilizer and seed sales, and credit will no longer hang in the \nbalance. In the long term, farmers will have less Government \ninterference from Washington, giving them the flexibility to plant for \nwhat the marketplace demands--not what traditional Government crop \npayments have dictated.\n  I am also proud to note that this legislation is comprehensive and \nbalanced when it comes to protecting our environmentally sensitive \nlands.\n  Foremost among these environmental provisions is the Conservation \nReserve Program, more commonly known as the CRP. I have heard from many \nof my Minnesota constituents, including farmers and sportsmen and \nwomen, who are pleased to see that the CRP and Wetlands Reserve Program \nwere recognized, maintained, and strengthened because of their high \nsuccess rates. In Minnesota, these programs will further protect our \nhighly erodible lands while expanding hunting and fishing \nopportunities.\n  Mr. President, overall this bill offers tremendous benefits to \nMinnesota's agriculture community, which already ranks among the \nNation's most productive in many of the traditional raw and processed \ncommodities.\n  For individual Minnesota farmers, this legislation will help meet the \nneeds of the growing number of value-added cooperatives and their \ncustomers who benefit from products such as ethanol. This in turn will \nhelp Minnesota's rural communities, which depend on high-output \nagriculture and value-added products for a large portion of income and \njobs.\n  Farmers and others dedicated to protecting the environment will not \nbe the only individuals helped by this legislation. The American \ntaxpayers will also benefit from the $2 billion in total budget savings \nthat will go toward balancing the Federal budget.\n  No longer will this portion of the agricultural budget serve as a \npotential runaway entitlement, as we saw happen after the 1985 farm \nbill. Instead, taxpayers and farmers will now know well in advance the \nspecific amount of Federal dollars involved in food production.\n  But while I enthusiastically support much of this bill because it \nworks on behalf of both Minnesota's farm community and the American \ntaxpayers, I must raise my strong concerns about its potential harm to \nMinnesota's dairy industry.\n  For years, dairy producers and processors in the Upper Midwest have \nstruggled against the harmful impact of the archaic Federal milk \nmarketing order scheme. This complex set of regulations has played a \nkey role in the loss of over 10,000 dairy farms in Minnesota over the \nlast decade--an average of nearly three farms every day.\n  I am pleased to see that this legislation pays some attention to \nreform of those archaic Federal dairy policies, specifically with the \nproposed consolidation of milk marketing orders and the elimination of \ncostly budget assessments on producers. However, I must state for the \nrecord that continuation of milk marketing orders makes little sense, \nparticularly when most other commodities in the bill are subject to \ndeclining Federal payments over a 7-year period.\n  Continuing the milk marketing orders is disappointing, but the bill's \ninclusion of the Northeast Dairy Compact provokes even greater concern \namong the members of Minnesota's dairy industry.\n  It should trouble my colleagues and their respective dairy industries \nwhen Congress authorizes more regulatory burdens and interstate trade \nbarriers.\n  Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened during conference \nnegotiations on the farm bill with the mysterious resurrection of the \nNortheast Dairy Compact.\n  Mr. President, many of my colleagues rightly thought the compact idea \nto be effectively defeated after we voted 50 to 46 to strike it out of \nthe Senate's farm bill.\n  However, despite the clear message sent by the Senate, the compact \nhas reappeared in the conference report.\n  Many of the compact's supporters will say that this is a compromise. \nAfter all, the Secretary of Agriculture will now have to decide whether \nto allow the New England States to create a compact.\n  If authorized by the Secretary, the compact would only exist until \nthe implementation of milk marketing orders takes place, which is 3 \nyears from now.\n  Perhaps they are right. But we are still creating a bad precedent by \nmaking it easier for any region to set up its own monopoly. The Senate \npreviously voted against the compact because it would ultimately result \nin a proliferation of antitrade barriers between the States and \nregions. At a time when we are trying to open up global markets for our \nNation's farmers, it makes no sense to encourage protectionism within \nour own borders. Yet, that is exactly what the dairy compact would do.\n  In response to the compact, other regions will work to get similar \nregional monopolies enacted. For far too long, regional politics have \nmade many farm programs the way they are today--archaic, unfair, \nunwise, and unworkable.\n  The purpose of this farm bill is to remove Government interference in \nthe agricultural decisionmaking process and reduce the regional \nconflicts that have plagued our farm policy for years.\n  Creation of the Northeast Dairy Compact would accomplish just the \nopposite--it would expand the role of government across America at the \nexpense of free-trade opportunities.\n  I will not stand for that and neither should any other Senator who \nvoted against the compact last month. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin standing up for small dairy farmers across the country by \ncosponsoring a bill which I am introducing today to repeal the \nNortheast Dairy Compact.\n  Instead of compromising on free-market principles and retreating into \nthe past, my bill will move America's dairy industry forward.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that the farm bill before us \nis obviously not a perfect piece of legislation. It does indeed have \nweaknesses, but I believe those weaknesses are outweighed by those \nprovisions which move us in a more market-oriented direction.\n  For this reason, I urge my colleagues to support the conference \nreport on behalf of rural America, and on behalf of the taxpayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2797-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2797-S2799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, they are going to be handing out the Oscars \ntonight in Hollywood, honoring the film industry's best efforts at \ncreating fantasy and make-believe. Well, we create a lot of that in \nWashington, too, and if it were a movie, the latest Clinton budget \nwould be taking home the award for ``Best Special Effects.''\n  After all, it is a document that makes the impossible appear \npossible. It disguises reality with the smoke and mirrors that are \nstaples of any good special effects team.\n\n[[Page S2798]]\n\n  It is such a creative effort, in fact, that you have to wonder \nwhether Steven Spielberg and George Lucas somehow had a hand in it.\n  Yes, the President's budget would be right at home amongst the glitzy \nphoniness of Tinseltown. And at a cost to the taxpayers of more than \n$1.6 billion this year, it is a big-budget production that makes the \n$175 million lavished on ``Waterworld'' look like a drop in a water \nbucket.\n  But like any movie, the more often you see it, the more you start \nnoticing the special effects and the more time you spend trying to \nfigure out how they did. And suddenly it is not all so magical anymore.\n  Unfortunately for President Clinton, the American taxpayers have had \nalmost a week to study his proposed budget for fiscal year 1997, and I \nthink they have begun to figure it out.\n  After eight earlier tries by the President over the last 13 months, \nthe taxpayers were hoping this budget would reflect the changes they \ncalled for in 1994: They want a workable balanced budget, real tax \nrelief for middle-class Americans, an end to welfare as we know it, and \nthe reforms needed to save entitlement programs from bankruptcy.\n  But after carefully reviewing the President's recommendations, I have \nto report that this budget does not deliver. In fact, as hard as it is \nto believe, President Clinton's budget takes the status quo and makes \nit even worse.\n  He requests over $61 billion more in nonentitlement spending than he \nproposed in his own minibudget last month. He pays for that increased \nspending by raising taxes and fees by more than $60 billion. \nFurthermore, he delays nearly 60 percent of his promised spending \nreductions until the last 2 years of his plan, making this a paper \nbudget only, with no hope of ever being implemented.\n  By perpetuating bigger government, more spending, and higher taxes, \nthis document is an affront to the American taxpayers.\n  One area of this budget I find particularly frustrating is the \nfunding for the Cabinet-level Department of Energy. If we have indeed \nentered a time in which ``the era of Big Government is over,'' as \nPresident Clinton proclaimed in his State of the Union Address, there \nshould be no place in the budget for this $16 billion relic.\n  At a time when taxpayers are demanding that Congress be accountable \nfor each and every dollar we spend, Secretary O'Leary and the President \nhave submitted a budget plan that ensures the continuation of DOE's \nbloated bureaucracy at the expense of responsible, accountable \nGovernment.\n  Perhaps they believe that spending enormous amounts of tax dollars on \nDOE will mask the fact that the Energy Department no longer has an \nenergy mission of its own. Since the oil crisis that led to its \ncreation in the 1970's evaporated, DOE has expended its resources in a \nperpetual attempt to expand its reach and justify its existence. Today, \nin fact, 85 percent of DOE's annual budget is spent on activities \nentirely unrelated to national energy policy.\n  That trend would continue under the President's budget, beginning \nwith the administration's proposal to increase DOE's overhead costs by \nmore than 38 percent next year. At the same time, DOE is boasting of \npersonnel decreases of nearly 20 percent. But if you examine the budget \ncarefully, looking beyond the summary pages delivered to Congress which \nlist nearly 19,000 full-time personnel, the actual decrease is only \nabout 6 percent from this year.\n  Of course, those 19,000 individuals represent just full-time workers. \nDOE employs another 150,000 contract employees at its labs and cleanup \nsites across the country.\n  If you are looking for a more in-depth breakdown of Energy Department \npersonnel, you will not find it within the pages of the President's \nbudget. The agency does not even rate an individual listing in the \nhistorical tables for the executive branch--instead, it's lumped into \nthe ``other'' category. One can only assume that the White House \ndoesn't want the taxpayers to realize just how large the DOE \nbureaucracy really is.\n  There are numerous other examples of how this latest budget \nsymbolizes the wasteful spending that has plagued DOE throughout its \nsearch to re-invent itself.\n  DOE's research, which includes the development of alternative sources \nof energy such as solar power, has cost the taxpayers more than $70 \nbillion since the agency's creation in 1977.\n  But during testimony before Congress last year, Jerry Taylor of the \nCato Institute said:\n\n       Virtually all economists who have looked at those programs \n     agree that federal energy R investments have proven to be a \n     spectacular failure.\n\n  The taxpayers have financed a great deal of pork with their $70 \nbillion investment, but few meaningful scientific breakthroughs. That \nreckless spending on renewable energy sources is slated to continue. \nFor example, by DOE's own accounts, the fiscal year 1997 request \nincludes an increase of 157 percent in subsidies to the solar building \ntechnology industry. Contrary to what this administration would have us \nbelieve, however, the solar industry is already competitive, and as a \nformer solar-home builder myself, I can tell you that such an \noverwhelming increase in a single year is not necessary.\n  The Department of Energy has proven to be more of a hindrance than a \nhelp in making technologies self-sustaining and independent of taxpayer \nassistance. It is time for the Federal Government to get out of the \nbusiness of directing market forces in the renewable area.\n  Rather than spending billions of taxpayer dollars to promote \nparticular industries within the private sector, DOE should be funding \nbasic research which actually breaks our growing dependence upon \nforeign oil. Minnesotans recognize that conservation and renewables \nalone will not heat a home in the winter--it is time this \nadministration owns up to that fact as well.\n  The President is also requesting $651 million--a 9-percent increase \nover 1996--to fund DOE's nondefense environmental management programs. \nIt is all part of the agency's environmental and nuclear waste cleanup \nefforts. Yet the budget increase comes on the heels of a report issued \njust last month by the National Research Council which criticized DOE's \nwaste disposal program as being too bureaucratic with too many layers.\n  Beyond the bloated bureaucracy and questionable spending, the \nPresident's budget plan reflects policies which are inconsistent with \ncurrent law, pending legislation, or at times, even common sense.\n  For example, the President proposes to delay until 2002 the sale of \nthe Naval Petroleum Reserve oil located at Elk Hills. This is in direct \ncontradiction to legislation enacted last year as part of the \nPresident's fiscal year 1996 budget which called for the sale to take \nplace this year. In an effort to continue to milk the NPR for money to \npay for additional DOE spending, this administration is rejecting \ncurrent law, ignoring the fact that there is gross mismanagement at the \nfacility.\n  And what about the back-loaded savings from the sale of the United \nStates Enrichment Corporation? Under the President's budget, a portion \nof the proceeds were shifted to 2002. Obviously, he was not watching \nfloor consideration of the most recent omnibus spending bill when this \nbody used those same proceeds to pay for the additional education \nfunding President Clinton demanded. Again, they are trying to spend the \nsame dollars once, twice, three, four, five times.\n  Then there are the policies which defy common sense. We have all \nheard about the environmental hazards resulting from leaking oil at the \nWeeks Island facility. The Energy Department is currently removing over \n70 million barrels from there and transferring them to other strategic \npetroleum reserve facilities --only to be sold in 2002. But again, a \nportion of the proceeds from the sale have already been spent, targeted \nto offset the additional spending requested by the President in the \nomnibus appropriations bill. Again, trying to spend the same dolalrs \nmore than once, it is smoke and mirrors, trying to balance the budget \nat the taxpayer's expense.\n  Furthermore, why does DOE not prioritize the Weeks Island reserve for \nimmediate sale, rather than moving it to another facility, storing it, \nand then selling it? If the Secretary of Energy believes we will not \nneed this oil in 2002, I am certain we don't need it now.\n  Mr. President, under this budget, the potential for even further \nabuses would\n\n[[Page S2799]]\n\ncontinue, because it does nothing to rein in DOE's ever-present search \nfor something to do, someplace to spend the taxpayers' hard-earned \ndollars. There would be nothing to stop the extravagant, taxpayer-\nfunded foreign excursions, or the use of tax dollars to investigate \nreporters and their stories, or the other wasteful spending that has \nbecome all too common at the Energy Department.\n  The Department would be left to operate mostly as it has in the \npast--free to pursue its own supposed manifest destiny through \nexpansion, reinvention, and constantly redefining its missions. That \nkind of freedom has allowed DOE's budget to grow 235 percent since \n1977, even in the absence of another energy crisis like the one that \nled to its creation.\n  At a time when the people are demanding a balanced budget and \njustification for every dollar spent by the Federal Government, can any \nof us in good conscience claim that business as usual at the Department \nof Energy is how the taxpayers ought to be served?\n  Mr. President, in presenting its budget to Congress, DOE's chief \nfinancial officer testified last week that the document demonstrates a \nnew commitment to streamlining its operations. ``More than ever,'' he \nsaid, ``American citizens are holding us accountable for superior \nresults with increasingly limited resources. The Department of Energy \nis meeting these expectations. We are improving our process efficiency \nand effectiveness.''\n  Mr. President, whether or not DOE is meeting these expectations is a \nquestion clearly open to debate. I believe they are falling short, way \nshort. And I am afraid that improving process efficiency and \neffectiveness will not ensure accountability or solve the fundamental \nproblems that rack the Department of Energy.\n  President Clinton's budget feeds DOE's problems through more \nspending. But when will the big spenders here realize that the time-\nhonored Washington tradition of throwing money at a problem does not \nmake the problem go away--that it only perpetuates the status quo and \naggravates the damage?\n  Mr. President, I believe the solution lies in less spending and \nultimately, elimination of the Department of Energy. Without a specific \nand defined mission to guide it, the agency will remain a taxpayers \nboondoggle for years to come, a burden the taxpayers are no longer \nwilling to bear.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2797-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE SITUATION IN BURUNDI\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of my colleagues \nBurundi, a small Central African country. There are 6 million people \nwho live in Burundi. Each week, a civil insurgency tightens its grip on \nthis poor African nation, causing the deaths of hundreds of people. The \nkilling frenzy in Burundi has barely touched international headlines, \nas it has been dwarfed by the calamities striking Israel and Bosnia. \nBut consider the situation if it were to occur in the United States. \nThe United States has a population of about 260 million. Sliding the \nscale to the figures of the United States, we would see 30,000 \nAmericans dying a week; 1,560,000 a year. Burundi, my colleagues, is on \nthe brink of national suicide.\n  The hostilities in Burundi are between the Tutsi-controlled army and \nHutu rebels. The current turmoil is the fallout of the explosion of \ntensions between Tutsi's and Hutu's in 1993. That year, the country's \nfirst popularly elected President, a Hutu, was assassinated. In the \nchaotic aftermath of his death, tens of thousands of Burundians were \nkilled, hundreds of thousands were displaced. Today, Burundi is ruled \nby a coalition of moderate Hutus and Tutsis who agreed to share power \nthrough the mediation of U.N. Secretary General's former special \nrepresentative, Ambassador Ahmedou Abdallah. The moderates who lead \nthis Government have tried to contain the violence. Their efforts, \nhowever, continue to be threatened by extremists on both sides.\n  A breakdown in Burundi could have catastrophic effects in the \ncountry, the region, and in the international community. The world \nwitnessed at great length the tragedy that wrecked Rwanda 2 years ago. \nRwanda shares the ethnic makeup of Burundi and is just barely coming to \ngrips with the horror it endured. A collapse in Burundi could crack the \nfragile peace now established in Rwanda and even worse, could trigger a \nregional genocide. The international community cannot afford to sit \nback and watch another egregious slaughter.\n  The international community, with leadership from the United States, \ncan help. First, we should support last Saturday's meeting of African \nleaders in Tunis. This meeting was brokered by former President Jimmy \nCarter. Second, there must be diplomatic efforts to persuade the \nextremists on both sides that violence is not a credible option. If \nviolence resumes, the United States, in conjunction with its European \nallies, should be prepared to impose an arms embargo, block \ninternational financial transactions by Burundi's extremists and stop \nall trade with Burundi with the exception of humanitarian relief. And \nthird, we, the Congress, should stand behind the State Department, the \nU.S. Agency for International Development, and private American \nvoluntary and relief projects whose programs promote peace and national \nreconciliation.\n  Burundi represents a great opportunity for the world community to \nexercise preventative diplomacy. The United States should do its share \nof constructive engagement and assist in heading off a regional \ngenocide before it is too late.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2799-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2799-S2800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DIANE KASEMAN\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am proud to pay tribute today to a dear \nfriend to me and my wife, Elizabeth Ann, Diane Kaseman. Diane is a \nlong-time employee of the Senate Service Department, where her \nfriendliness, dedication, and charming personality have become familiar \nto many Members of this body and our staffs. Unfortunately for us, she \nwill be retiring from her position in the Service Department after an \nincredible 43 years of service to the U.S. Congress.\n  Diane Kaseman is one of those individuals who takes extreme pride in \nher work and who truly loves the Senate as an institution. She and her \nloyal canine pets have become welcome sights to the many hundreds of \nstaff members who routinely seek assistance from the Service \nDepartment. She never fails to express genuine concern when one of us, \nour spouses, or our staff members is under the weather. Her kind words \nand thoughtful notes never fail to improve our spirits.\n  Diane is a Rochester, NY native, and began her Capitol Hill career as \na receptionist for the late Congressman and Senator Kenneth Keating of \nNew York. She began work on March 27, 1953. Eventually, she moved over \nto the Senate, where she served on the staff of former Kentucky Senator \nJohn Sherman Cooper. Since then, she has served under 11 Senate \nSergeants-at-Arms, working with the service and computer facilities.\n  Not surprisingly, Diane has devoted much of her time over the years \nto volunteer and community service activities. Early on in her career, \nshe helped establish the Senate Staff Club. Since its founding in 1954, \nit has sponsored a wide variety of social, civic, and philanthropic \nprojects. She served as the organization's first treasurer. Today, it \nhas over 3,000 members.\n  One of the Staff Club's major activities has been its blood donor \ndrives, begun in 1978. Diane has been a driving force behind this \ncampaign and has dedicated many hours of hard work and energy to see \nthat the Senate meets its goals. My wife has worked with Diane on many \nof these blood drives.\n  In 1981, she received the Sid Yudain Award, which recognized ``her \ndedication to the well-being of her coworkers and for the generous \nexpenditure of her time, talent, and personal resources in the service \nof the congressional community.'' These few words are perhaps the best \nthat can be offered to summarize her outstanding career and selfless \nservice.\n  Diane Kaseman is truly a Senate institution who will be sorely missed\n\n[[Page S2800]]\n\nafter she leaves the Senate at the end of this month. I join my \ncolleagues in thanking her, commending her, and wishing her all the \nbest as she embarks upon a well-earned retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2799-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today as the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs to briefly address two \nevents which transpired in Asia over the weekend, one which bodes well \nfor the continued growth and vitality of democracy in Asia and one \nwhich, unfortunately, does not.\n  First, as I'm sure my colleagues are by now aware, despite \nunprecedented military threats and vituperative media pressure from the \nPeople's Republic of China, the people of Taiwan have elected Lee Teng-\nhui as their President. The election, aside from its practical result, \nwas important for several reasons. First, for the first time in its \nalmost 5,000 year history, China --or, more precisely, a portion \nthereof--has elected its paramount leader in a free, fair, and open \ndemocratic election. With the election, the ideals of human rights and \nrepresentative democracy--which some in Asia, especially authoritarian \nregimes, have argued are peculiarly Western inventions with little or \nno applicability in their region--have taken a dramatic step toward \nuniversality.\n  Second, Taiwan's electorate clearly demonstrated to Beijing that its \nbellicose campaign of threats and intimidation was ill-conceived and \nineffectual. Rather than diminishing support for President Lee, as \nBeijing and the PLA had hoped, the People's Republic of China's recent \nround of missile tests and live-fire military exercises seems only to \nhave served to solidify his support; President Lee won with some 54 \npercent of the vote. In other words, the People's Republic of China's \nplans backfired, much as I and others of my colleagues predicted. I \nwould hope that they come away from the past month having learned that \nthe best course is not one of brazen threats, but open bilateral dialog \nacross the Taiwan Strait.\n  I wish to convey my personal congratulations to the Government and \npeople of Taiwan, and hope to do so in person to President Lee when I \ntravel to the People's Republic of China and then on to Taipei next \nweek.\n  Mr. President, in contrast the second issue I'd like to discuss today \nis not so encouraging. On Sunday at its second plenary session, China's \nHong Kong Preparatory Committee--the body charged by Beijing with \noverseeing the transition of the British Colony to a Special \nAdministrative Region of the People's Republic of China in 1997--voted \nby a margin of 148 to 1 to scrap the elected Legislative Council and \ninstall in its place an appointed body.\n  Members of Hong Kong's Legislative Council, or Legco, have \ntraditionally been elected not by universal suffrage but by a narrow \ngroup of functional constituencies. In other words, the trade unions \nhad a certain number of votes, the civil service had a certain number \nof votes, lawyers had a certain number of votes, et cetera. Last year, \nin a move to increase the representation of the average citizen on the \nCouncil, a number of changes were made by the colonial government in \nthe way elections are conducted.\n  Beijing objected to the changes in the election process, ostensibly \nbecause they were made unilaterally by the British; of course, Beijing \noverlooked the fact that they themselves had refused to seriously \nnegotiate on the issue. However, most observers--correctly I believe--\nfelt that the real reason for Beijing's opposition was that the changes \nmade the Legco even more democratic, a status that they would then be \nforced to acquiesce to after 1997.\n  The reason that increased democracy is a problem for the People's \nRepublic of China is fairly obvious; the government presently installed \nin Beijing is antithetical to democracy. Despite lip service to its \npromises that it would ensure the continuation of Hong Kong's rights \nand civil liberties after 1997, the People's Republic of China has \ntaken a number of steps over the last 2 years to call that commitment \nto democratic norms into serious question. It's opposition to the \nreconstituted Legco is one of the more visible.\n  Another is the fate of the lone dissenting vote, by Mr. Frederick \nFung, in the 148 to 1 vote tally on the Legco question. As a result of \nhis dissenting vote, the head of the Preparatory Committee--Lu Ping--\nannounced that because of his vote Mr. Fung should be disqualified from \nthe transitional bodies planning Hong Kong's post-1997 government and \nfrom any governing role after the British withdraw. What does this \npetty and vindictive statement say about the People's Republic of \nChina's commitment to democracy; that instead of tolerating dissent the \nChinese will seek to punish those who express their opinions and fail \nto follow the party line.\n  Actions and statements such as this are not, sadly, surprising. The \nPeople's Republic of China has made several moves in the past year to \nexclude pro-democracy figures from the transition process; it even \nprevented one pro-democracy legislator from entering China to attend a \nconference, solely on the basis of his being a critic of the Government \nin Beijing. I believe that moves like these call into question the \nPeople's Republic of China's commitment to the Basic Law, and its \ncommitment to safeguard the rights of Hong Kong's citizens after \nretrocession. It would behoove them to remember that each move they \nmake is under very close scrutiny by Hong Kong's--and the world's--\ncommercial community. How Beijing acts will be directly reflected in \nthat community's confidence, or lack thereof, and its willingness to \nmaintain its investments there.\n  This is the People's Republic of China's reaction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2800-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2800-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2800-4", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2800-S2801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO ANGOLA--MESSAGE FROM \n                         THE PRESIDENT--PM 134\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby report to the Congress on the developments since September \n26, 1995, concerning the national emergency with respect to Angola that \nwas declared in Executive Order No. 12865 of September 26, 1993. This \nreport is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) of the National \nEmergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n  On September 26, 1993, I declared a national emergency with respect \nto Angola, invoking the authority, inter alia, of the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and the United \nNations Participation Act of 1945 (22 U.S.C. 287c). Consistent with \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 864, dated September 15, \n1993, the order prohibited the sale or supply by United States persons \nor from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or \naircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons \nand ammunition, military vehicles, equipment and spare parts, and \npetroleum and petroleum products to the territory of Angola\n\n[[Page S2801]]\n\nother than through designated points of entry. The order also \nprohibited such sale or supply to the National Union for the Total \nIndependence of Angola (``UNITA''). United States persons are \nprohibited from activities that promote or are calculated to promote \nsuch sales or supplies, or from attempted violations, or from evasion \nor avoidance or transactions that have the purpose of evasion or \navoidance, of the stated prohibitions. The order authorized the \nSecretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, \nto take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and \nregulations, as might be necessary to carry out the purposes of the \norder.\n  1. On December 10, 1993, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign \nAssets Control (``FAC'') issued the UNITA (Angola) Sanctions \nRegulations (the ``Regulations'') (58 Fed. Reg. 64904) to implement the \nPresident's declaration of a national emergency and imposition of \nsanctions against Angola (UNITA). There have been no amendments to the \nRegulations since my report of September 18, 1995.\n\n  The Regulations prohibit the sale or supply by United States persons \nor from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or \naircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons \nand ammunition, military vehicles, equipment and spare parts, and \npetroleum and petroleum products to UNITA or to the territory of Angola \nother than through designated points. United States persons are also \nprohibited from activities that promote or are calculated to promote \nsuch sales or supplies to UNITA or Angola, or from any transaction by \nany United States persons that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of \nevading or avoiding, or attempts to violate, any of the prohibitions \nset forth in the Executive order. Also prohibited are transactions by \nUnited States persons, or involving the use of U.S.-registered vessels \nor aircraft, relating to transportation to Angola or UNITA of goods the \nexportation of which is prohibited.\n  The Government of Angola has designated the following points of entry \nas points in Angola to which the articles otherwise prohibited by the \nRegulations may be shipped: Airports: Luanda and Katumbela, Benguela \nProvince; Ports: Luanda and Lobito, Benguela Province; and Namibe, \nNamibe Province; and Entry Points: Malongo, Cabinda Province. Although \nno specific license is required by the Department of the Treasury for \nshipments to these designated points of entry (unless the item is \ndestined for UNITA), any such exports remain subject to the licensing \nrequirements of the Departments of State and/or Commerce.\n  2. The FAC has worked closely with the U.S. financial community to \nassure a heightened awareness of the sanctions against UNITA--through \nthe dissemination of publications, seminars, and notices to electronic \nbulletin boards. This educational effort has resulted in frequent calls \nfrom banks to assure that they are not routing funds in violation of \nthese prohibitions.

A bill to prohibit the possession and transfer of \nnonsporting handguns, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n            The Domestic Saturday Night Special Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure \ndesigned to ban the sale and possession of domestic Saturday night \nspecials, which are inexpensive, short-barreled--4\" or shorter, easily \nconcealed handguns that are made from inferior materials and lack any \nsporting purpose. These handguns have flooded the black market and are \ndisproportionately used in violent criminal activity. These weapons are \npoorly made, unreliable and, in some cases, unsafe. They are cheap to \nbuild, cheap to purchase, and are roughly 3.4 times more likely to be \ninvolved in violent crimes than are handguns from other major \nmanufacturers. Their destructive impact on the lives of American \ncitizens must be stopped.\n  Mr. President, in the aftermath of the assassinations of Robert F. \nKennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., Congress passed the Gun Control \nAct of 1968, which targeted small caliber, easily concealable, and \npoorly made imported handguns named Saturday night specials. It was \nCongress' intent to eliminate imported guns which were believed to be \ndisproportionately involved in crime. Specifically, the legislation \nbanned the importation of handguns not particularly suitable for or \nreadily adaptable to sporting purposes. Congress, however, exempted \ndomestic manufacturers from the legislation, resulting in the creation \nof a protected domestic industry that produces and markets small, \npoorly made, easily concealable handguns.\n  Today, Mr. President, six handgun manufacturers in southern \nCalifornia dominate the production of Saturday night specials. In 1992, \nthey made over 80 percent of the .25 ACP, .32 ACP, and .380 ACP pistols \nmanufactured in this country. Indeed, in 1992 these companies \nmanufactured 685,934 handguns, or 34 percent of all handguns made in \nthe United States. According to 1993 figures, one of the Saturday night \nspecial manufacturers, Lorcin Engineering Inc., is the leading pistol \nmanufacturer in America.\n  In 1968, ``the American Rifleman''--a publication of the National \nRifle Association, in arguing in favor of a ban on Saturday night \nspecial imports, noted that such weapons were ``miserably made, \npotentially defective arms that contribute so much to rising \nviolence.'' This statement is equally applicable today to domestically \nmanufactured Saturday night specials.\n  The carnage and killing that occur in our Nation's towns and cities \nare directly related to the proliferation of these weapons of \ndestruction on the streets of America. According to a Wall Street \nJournal investigation, these pistols are purchased in bulk at retail by \nillegal dealers and smuggled by bus or train to urban centers for \nresale on the street.\n  Once they reach the streets, domestic Saturday night specials, which \nsell for as low as $35, are the starter guns of choice for criminals \nand the very young. For example, in 1990, a 5-year-old from the Bronx, \nNY, carried in his pocket a loaded domestic Saturday night special to \nkindergarten. In 1992, a 15-year-old aimed a domestic Saturday night \nspecial from the roof of a New York apartment building and shot a \npoliceman in the ankle.\n  Mr. President, these guns are disproportionately used in robberies \nand murders. From 1990 to 1992, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms [ATF] traced approximately 24,000 handguns sold after 1986 and \nused in murders and other crimes. Saturday night specials produced by \nthree southern California companies accounted for 27 percent of the \ntraces, as compared to 11 percent for the much larger Smith and Wesson \nCompany. According to the Wall Street Journal, police in Houston \nconfiscated nearly 1,000 guns used in crimes in 1991. Three Saturday \nnight specials produced by southern California companies--the Raven .25 \nACP, the Davis .380 ACP, and the Davis .32 ACP--ranked as the top three \nguns confiscated. The same year in Cleveland, police confiscated more \nthan 2,000 handguns; the Raven .25 ACP ranked second.\n  The Washington Post reported in June 1994 that of all 21,744 guns \nseized at crime scenes and traced by ATF during 1991 through 1993, an \nastounding 62 percent--or 13,559 handguns--were produced by a southern \nCalifornia manufacturer of Saturday night specials. ABC television's \n``Day One'' reported that in 1994, the Lorcin .380 ACP was the single \nfirearm most frequently submitted to ATF for tracing. Thus, there is no \nquestion that these weapons are the weapons of choice of criminals.\n  Of significant concern is also the threat that these guns pose to law \nenforcement. The single gun with the greatest number of police \nhomicides per number of guns in circulation is the .32 caliber pistol. \nAs of 1992, nearly 90 percent of these guns were manufactured by the \nsouthern California gun makers. Mr. President, for the sake of the \nAmerican public and the law enforcement community, it is time that \nCongress take action to get these killing machines off the streets of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, under the 1968 Gun Control Act, ATF has developed an \nelaborate scheme to determine whether foreign firearms should be \nclassified as Saturday night specials. To gain entry into the U.S. \nmarket, imported guns must meet minimum size and safety specifications \nand pass a battery of individual design, performance, and materials \nstandards. The ATF classification scheme considers the quality of the \nmetal used to construct the weapon, as well as the combined height and \nlength, weight, caliber, safety features, and accessory features of the \nweapon. By the mid-1970's, ATF estimated that over half of all of the \nhandguns produced domestically could not legally have been imported.\n  Domestic Saturday night specials are cheaply made and unreliable. \nLarge domestic handgun manufacturers--such as Smith and Wesson--produce \nsmall quantities of guns because their production process is labor \nintensive. On average, these guns retail for $600. By contrast, the \nSaturday night specials are assembled in mere minutes using cheap \nmaterials, yielding high volumes that sell for as little as $35 per \ngun. The results are predictable. For example, the zinc alloy used in \nmany of the Saturday night specials is so soft that it can be shaved \nwith a knife. Moreover, the alloy begins to distort at 700 \ndegrees Fahrenheit, compared to 2,400 degrees for the stainless steel \nin quality guns.\n\n  In addition, while the Saturday night specials typically have minimal \nsafety devices that block the trigger from being pulled, they lack \nsafety equipment found on higher quality guns, such as firing pin \nblocks that help prevent accidental discharge. Indeed, officials at ATF \nhave indicated that the Raven .25 ACP pistol produced by one of the \nsouthern California companies can discharge if it is loaded and dropped \nto the floor, thereby failing ATF's drop test. The quality and \nreliability of domestic Saturday night specials is so atrocious that \nEdward Owen, Jr., Chief of the Firearms Technology Branch at ATF, has \nstated: ``If someone gave me one as a gift, I would throw it away.''\n  The unreliability of these guns, Mr. President, highlights the fact \nthat they have no sporting purpose and cannot be depended on for self-\ndefense. This fact was illustrated in a May 1994 segment of ABC \ntelevision's ``Day One''. A Colorado Springs gun shop owner is firing \none of the domestic Saturday night specials when it jams. As she \nattempts to clear the weapon, the correspondent asks her what would \nhappen at that moment if she was relying on the gun for protection. She \nanswers, ``Well, I just got killed.''\n\n[[Page S2803]]\n\n  In independent tests of domestic Saturday night specials by ``Gun \nTests'', Lorcin's .22 caliber pistol, the L-22, was found unacceptable. \nIn test firing, evaluators ``experienced 20 misfires due to light \nfiring-pin strikes and 36 failures to completely lock into battery, \nand--the gun--failed to feed truncated-nose ammunition about 25 percent \nof the time.'' Indeed, according to the Wall Street Journal, many gun-\nstore owners have decided not to sell domestic Saturday night specials \nbecause ``the quality is too poor, replacement parts are too hard to \nobtain, and the dollar profit per gun is too small.''\n  Mr. President, since these weapons are useless for self-defense and \nhave no sporting purpose, the present legislation would apply the Gun \nControl Act of 1968 to domestic Saturday night specials, thereby \nbanning the possession and sale of these weapons shipped or transported \nin interstate or foreign commerce. Specifically, the present ATF import \nclassification scheme--which considers the quality of the metal used to \nconstruct the weapon, as well as the combined height and length, \nweight, caliber, safety features and accessory features of the weapon--\nwould be applicable to domestic Saturday night Specials.\n  Mr. President, the focus of this bill is to ban inexpensive, short-\nbarreled, easily concealed handguns that are made from inferior \nmaterials and lack any sporting purpose. Thus, this legislation would \nnot ban high quality, domestic snub-nosed revolvers and derringers \ncontaining adequate safety features that would otherwise be banned \nbecause of their size. Moreover, this legislation would exempt from \ncoverage those high quality, domestic handguns that meet the overall \nATF size requirement, but would otherwise fail the ATF test because of \ntheir light weight and low caliber.\n  Mr. President, the Justice Department recently released a report \nconcluding that 86 percent of all firearm-related crimes occurring in \n1993 were carried out with a handgun. This represents an 18 percent \nincrease from 1992. Also, of the more than 24,500 murders in 1993, \n16,189--(70 percent)--were committed with firearms, and four out of \nevery five firearm murders involved the use of a handgun. The evidence \nis clear that domestic Saturday night specials--inexpensive, poorly \nmade handguns that lack any sporting purpose--are disproportionately \ninvolved in criminal activity and pose a significant threat to the \nsafety of American citizens. Mr. President, it is time to stop the \ncarnage in our Nation's streets caused by these killing machines.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1640\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares that--\n\n[[Page S2813]]\n\n       (1) certain scattered parcels of Federal land located \n     within Gilpin County, Colorado, are currently administered by \n     the Secretary of the Interior as part of the Royal Gorge \n     Resource Area, Canon City District, United States Bureau of \n     Land Management;\n       (2) these land parcels, which comprises approximately 133 \n     separate tracts of land, and range in size from approximately \n     38 acres to much less than an acre have been identified as \n     suitable for disposal by the Bureau of Land Management \n     through its resource management planning process and are \n     appropriate for disposal; and\n       (3) even though the Federal land parcels in Gilpin County, \n     Colorado, are scattered and small in size, they nevertheless \n     by virtue of their proximity to existing communities appear \n     to have a fair market value which may be used by the Federal \n     Government to exchange for lands which will better lend \n     themselves to Federal management and have higher value for \n     future public access, use and enjoyment, recreation, the \n     protection and enhancement of fish and wildlife and fish and \n     wildlife habitat, and the protection of riparian lands, \n     wetlands, scenic beauty and other public values.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Title to authorize, \n     direct, facilitate and expedite the land exchange set forth \n     herein in order to further the public interest by disposing \n     of Federal lands with limited public utility and acquire in \n     exchange therefor lands with important values for permanent \n     public management and protection.\n\n     SEC. 1102. LAND EXCHANGE.\n\n       (A) In General.--The exchange directed by this Title shall \n     be consummated if within 90 days after enactment of this Act, \n     Lake Gulch, Inc., a Colorado Corporation (as defined in \n     section 1104 of this Title) offers to transfer to the United \n     States pursuant to the provisions of this Title the offered \n     lands or interests in land described herein.\n       (b) Conveyance by Lake Gulch.--Subject to the provisions of \n     section 1103 of this Title, Lake Gulch shall convey to the \n     Secretary of the Interior all right, title, and interest in \n     and to the following offered lands--\n       (1) certain lands comprising approximately 40 acres with \n     improvements thereon located in Larimer County, Colorado, and \n     lying within the boundaries of Rocky Mountain National Park \n     as generally depicted on a map entitled ``Circle C Church \n     Camp'', dated August 1994, which shall upon their acquisition \n     by the United States and without further action by the \n     Secretary of the Interior be incorporated into Rocky Mountain \n     National Park and thereafter be administered in accordance \n     with the laws, rules and regulations generally applicable to \n     the National Park System and Rocky Mountain National Park;\n       (2) certain lands located within and adjacent to the United \n     States Bureau of Land Management San Luis Resource Area in \n     Conejos County, Colorado, which comprise approximately 3,993 \n     acres and are generally depicted on a map entitled ``Quinlan \n     Ranches Tract'', dated August 1994; and\n       (3) certain lands located within the United States Bureau \n     of Land Management Royal Gorge Resource Area in Huerfano \n     County, Colorado, which comprise approximately 4,700 acres \n     and are generally depicted on a map entitled ``Bonham Ranch--\n     Cucharas Canyon'', dated June 1995: Provided, however, That \n     it is the intention of Congress that such lands may remain \n     available for the grazing of livestock as determined \n     appropriate by the Secretary in accordance with applicable \n     laws, rules, and regulations: Provided further, That if the \n     Secretary determines that certain of the lands acquired \n     adjacent to Cucharas Canyon hereunder are not needed for \n     public purposes they may be sold in accordance with the \n     provisions of section 302 of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 and other applicable law.\n       (c) Substitution of Lands.--If one or more of the precise \n     offered land parcels identified above is unable to be \n     conveyed to the United States due to appraisal or other \n     problems, Lake Gulch and the Secretary may mutually agree to \n     substitute therefore alternative offered lands acceptable to \n     the Secretary.\n       (d) Conveyance by the United States.--(1) Upon receipt of \n     title to the lands identified in subsection (a) the Secretary \n     shall simultaneously convey to Lake Gulch all right, title, \n     and interest of the United States, subject to valid existing \n     rights, in and to the following selected lands--\n       (A) certain surveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n     Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal \n     Meridian, Section 18, Lots 118-220, which comprise \n     approximately 195 acres and are intended to include all \n     federally owned lands in section 18, as generally depicted on \n     a map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July \n     1994;\n       (B) certain surveyed lands located in Gilpin County, \n     Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal \n     Meridian, Section 17, Lots 37, 38, 39, 40, 52, 53, and 54, \n     which comprise approximately 96 acres, as generally depicted \n     on a map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated July \n     1994; and\n       (C) certain unsurveyed lands located in Gilpin County \n     Colorado, Township 3 South, Range 73 West, Sixth Principal \n     Meridian, Section 13, which comprise approximately 11 acres, \n     and are generally depicted as parcels 302-304, 306 and 308-\n     326 on a map entitled ``Lake Gulch Selected Lands'', dated \n     July 1994; Provided, however, That a parcel or parcels of \n     land in section 13 shall not be transferred to Lake Gulch if \n     at the time of the proposed transfer the parcel or parcels \n     are under formal application for transfer to a qualified unit \n     of local government. Due to a small and unsurveyed nature of \n     such parcels proposed for transfer to Lake Gulch in section \n     13, and the high cost of surveying such small parcels, the \n     Secretary is authorized to transfer such section 13 lands to \n     Lake Gulch without survey based on such legal or other \n     description as the Secretary determines appropriate to carry \n     out the basic intent of the map cited in this subparagraph.\n       (2) If the Secretary and Lake Gulch mutually agree, and the \n     Secretary determines it is in the public interest, the \n     Secretary may utilize the authority and direction of this \n     Title to transfer to Lake Gulch lands in sections 17 and 13 \n     that are in addition to those precise selected lands shown on \n     the map cited herein, and which are not under formal \n     application for transfer to a qualified unit of local \n     government, upon transfer to the Secretary of additional \n     offered lands acceptable to the Secretary or upon payment to \n     the Secretary by Lake Gulch of cash equalization money \n     amounting to the full appraised fair market value of any such \n     additional lands. If any such additional lands are located in \n     section 13 they may be transferred to Lake Gulch without \n     survey based on such legal or other description as the \n     Secretary determines appropriate as long as the Secretary \n     determines that the boundaries of any adjacent lands not \n     owned by Lake Gulch can be property identified so as to avoid \n     possible future boundary conflicts or disputes. If the \n     Secretary determines surveys are necessary to convey any such \n     additional lands to Lake Gulch, the costs of such surveys \n     shall be paid by Lake Gulch but shall not be eligible for any \n     adjustment in the value of such additional lands pursuant to \n     section 206(f)(2) of the Federal Land Policy and Management \n     Act of 1976 (as amended by the Federal Land Exchange \n     Facilitation Act of 1988) (43 U.S.C. 1716(f)(2)).\n       (3) Prior to transferring out of public ownership pursuant \n     to this Title or other authority of law any lands which are \n     contiguous to North Clear Creek southeast of the City of \n     Black Hawk, Colorado in the County of Gilpin, Colorado, the \n     Secretary shall notify and consult with the County and City \n     and afford such units of local government an opportunity to \n     acquire or reserve pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 or other applicable law, such \n     easements or rights-of-way parallel to North Clear Creek as \n     may be necessary to serve public utility line or recreation \n     path needs: Provided, however, that any survey or other costs \n     associated with the acquisition or reservation of such \n     easements or rights-of-way shall be paid for by the unit \n     or units of local government concerned.\n\n     SEC. 1103.

The use of any \n     water rights acquired pursuant to this section shall be \n     limited to water that can be used or exchanged for water that \n     can be used on the Blanca Wetlands. Any requirement or \n     proposal to utilize facilities of the San Luis Valley \n     Project, Closed Basin Diversion, in order to effectuate the \n     use of any such water rights shall be subject to prior \n     approval of the Rio Grande Water Conservation District.\n       (b) Restrictions on Selected Lands.--(1) Conveyance of the \n     selected lands to Lake Gulch pursuant to this Title shall be \n     contingent upon Lake Gulch executing an agreement with the \n     United States prior to such conveyance, the terms of which \n     are acceptable to the Secretary of the Interior, and which--\n       (A) grant the United States a covenant that none of the \n     selected lands (which currently lie outside the legally \n     approved gaming area) shall ever be used for purposes of \n     gaming should the current legal gaming area ever be expanded \n     by the State of Colorado; and\n       (B) permanently hold the United States harmless for \n     liability and indemnify the United States against all costs \n     arising from any activities, operations (including the \n     storing, handling, and dumping of hazardous\n\n[[Page S2814]]\n\n     materials or substances) or other acts conducted by Lake \n     Gulch or its employees, agents, successors or assigns on the \n     selected lands after their transfer to Lake Gulch: Provided, \n     however, That nothing in this Title shall be construed as \n     either diminishing or increasing any responsibility or \n     liability of the United States based on the condition of the \n     selected lands prior to or on the date of their transfer to \n     Lake Gulch.\n       (2) Conveyance of the selected lands to Lake Gulch pursuant \n     to this Title shall be subject to the existing easement for \n     Gilpin County Road 6.\n       (3) The above terms and restrictions of this subsection \n     shall not be considered in determining, or result in any \n     diminution in, the fair market value of the selected land \n     for purposes of the appraisals of the selected land \n     required pursuant to section 1102 of this Title.\n       (c) Revocation of Withdrawal.--The Public Water Reserve \n     established by Executive order dated April 17, 1926 (Public \n     Water Reserve 107), Serial Number Colorado 17321, is hereby \n     revoked insofar as it affects the NW \\1/4\\ SW \\1/4\\ of \n     Section 17, Township 3 South, Range 72 West, Sixth Principal \n     Meridian, which covers a portion of the selected lands \n     identified in this Title.\n\n     SEC. 1104.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (94 \n     Stat. 2371), enacted on December 2, 1980, established Gates \n     of the Arctic National Park and Preserve and Gates of the \n     Arctic Wilderness. The village of Anaktuvuk Pass, located in \n     the highlands of the central Brooks Range, is virtually \n     surrounded by these national park and wilderness lands and is \n     the only Native village located within the boundary of a \n     National Park System unit in Alaska.\n       (2) Unlike most other Alaskan Native communities, the \n     village of Anaktuvuk Pass is not located on a major river, \n     lake, or coastline that can be used as a means of access. The \n     residents of Anaktuvuk Pass have relied increasingly on snow \n     machines in winter and all-terrain vehicles in summer as \n     their primary means of access to pursue caribou and other \n     subsistence resources.\n       (3) In a 1983 land exchange agreement, linear easements \n     were reserved by the Inupiat Eskimo people for use of all-\n     terrain vehicles across certain national park lands, mostly \n     along stream and river banks. These linear easements proved \n     unsatisfactory, because they provided inadequate access to \n     subsistence resources while causing excessive environmental \n     impact from concentrated use.\n       (4) The National Park Service and the Nunamiut Corporation \n     initiated discussions in 1985 to address concerns over the \n     use of all-terrain vehicles on park and wilderness land. \n     These discussions resulted in an agreement, originally \n     executed in 1992 and thereafter amended in 1993 and 1994, \n     among the National Park Service, Nunamiut Corporation, the \n     City of Anaktuvuk Pass, and Arctic Slope Regional \n     Corporation. Full effectuation of this agreement, as amended, \n     by its terms requires ratification by the Congress.\n\n     SEC. 1402. RATIFICATION OF AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) Ratification.--\n       (1) In general.--The terms, conditions, procedures, \n     covenants, reservations and other provisions set forth in the \n     document entitled ``Donation, Exchange of Lands and Interests \n     in Lands and Wilderness Redesignation Agreement Among Arctic \n     Slope Regional Corporation, Nunamiut Corporation, City of \n     Anaktuvuk Pass and the United States of America'' \n     (hereinafter referred to in this Title as ``the Agreement''), \n     executed by the parties on December 17, 1992, as amended, are \n     hereby incorporated in this Title, are ratified and \n     confirmed, and set forth the obligations and commitments of \n     the United States, Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, \n     Nunamiut Corporation and the City of Anaktuvuk Pass, as a \n     matter of Federal law.\n       (2) Land Acquisition.--Lands acquired by the United States \n     pursuant to the Agreement shall be administered by the \n     Secretary\n\n[[Page S2815]]\n\n     of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as the \n     ``Secretary'') as part of Gates of the Arctic National Park \n     and Preserve, subject to the laws and regulations applicable \n     thereto.\n       (b) Maps.--The maps set forth as Exhibits C1, C2, and D \n     through I to the Agreement depict the lands subject to the \n     conveyances, retention of surface access rights, access \n     easements and all-terrain vehicle easements. These lands are \n     depicted in greater detail on a map entitled ``Land Exchange \n     Actions, Proposed Anaktuvuk Pass Land Exchange and Wilderness \n     Redesignation, Gates of the Arctic National Park and \n     Preserve'', Map No. 185/80,039, dated April 1994, and on file \n     at the Alaska Regional Office of the National Park Service \n     and the offices of Gates of the Arctic National Park and \n     Preserve in Fairbanks, Alaska. Written legal descriptions of \n     these lands shall be prepared and made available in the above \n     offices.

Should the value of the \n     property so identified by Koniag be in excess of the value \n     of the remaining selection rights, then Koniag shall have \n     the option of (i) declining to proceed with the exchange \n     and identifying other property or (ii) paying the \n     difference in value between the property rights.\n       (c) Revenues.--Any property received by Koniag in an \n     exchange entered into pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of \n     this section shall be deemed to be an interest in the \n     subsurface for purposes of section 7(i) of the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) provided, \n     however, should Koniag make a payment to equalize the value \n     in any such exchange, then Koniag will be deemed to hold an \n     undivided interest in the property equal in value to such \n     payment which interest shall not be subject to the provisions \n     of section 9(j).\n\n     SEC. 1504. CERTAIN CONVEYANCES.\n\n       (a) Interests in Land.--For the purposes of section 21 (c) \n     of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1620 \n     (e)), the receipt of consideration, including, but not \n     limited to, lands, cash or other property, by a Native \n     Corporation for the relinquishment to the United States of \n     land selection rights granted to any Native Corporation under \n     such Act shall be deemed to be an interest in land.\n       (b) Authority To Appoint and Remove Trustee.--In \n     establishing a Settlement Trust under such section 39 of such \n     Act (43 U.S.C. 1629c), Koniag may delegate, in whole or in \n     part, the authority granted by Koniag under subsection (b)(2) \n     of such section to any entity that Koniag may select without \n     affecting the status of the trust as a Settlement Trust under \n     such section.\n\n                       TITLE XVI--STERLING FOREST\n\n     SEC. 1601. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Palisades Interstate Park Commission was \n     established pursuant to a joint resolution of the 75th \n     Congress approved in 1937 (Public Resolution No. 65; ch. 706; \n     50 Stat. 710), and chapter 170 of the Laws of 1937 of the \n     State of New York and chapter 148 of the Laws of 1937 of the \n     State of New Jersey;\n       (2) the Palisades Interstate Park Commission is responsible \n     for the management of 23 parks and historic sites in New York \n     and New Jersey, comprising over 82,000 acres.\n       (3) over 8,000,000 visitors annually seek outdoor \n     recreational opportunities within the Palisades Park System;\n       (4) Sterling Forest is a biologically diverse open space on \n     the New Jersey border comprising approximately 17,500 acres, \n     and is a highly significant watershed area for the State of \n     New Jersey, providing the source for clean drinking water for \n     25 percent of the State;\n       (5) Sterling Forest is an important outdoor recreational \n     asset in the northeastern United States, within the most \n     densely populated metropolitan region in the Nation;\n       (6) Sterling Forest supports a mixture of hardwood forests, \n     wetlands, lakes, glaciated valleys, is strategically located \n     on a wildlife migratory route, and provides important habitat \n     for 27 rare or endangered species;\n       (7) the protection of Sterling Forest would greatly enhance \n     the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, a portion of which \n     passes through Sterling Forest, and would provide for \n     enhanced recreational opportunities through the protection \n     of lands which are an integral element of the trail and \n     which would protect important trail viewsheds;\n       (8) stewardship and management costs for units of the \n     Palisades Park System are paid for by the States of New York \n     and New Jersey; thus, the protection of Sterling Forest \n     through the Palisades Interstate Park Commission will involve \n     a minimum of Federal funds;\n       (9) given the nationally significant watershed, outdoor \n     recreational, and wildlife qualities of Sterling forest, the \n     demand for open space in the northeastern United States, and \n     the lack of open space in the densely populated tri-state \n     region, there is a clear Federal interest in acquiring the \n     Sterling Forest for permanent protection of the watershed, \n     outdoor recreational resources, flora and fauna, and open \n     space; and\n       (10) such an acquisition would represent a cost effective \n     investment, as compared with the costs that would be incurred \n     to protect drinking water for the region should the Sterling \n     Forest be developed.\n\n     SEC. 1602.

Such parcel shall be a part of the Pueblo \n     de Taos Reservation and shall be managed in accordance with \n     section 4 of the Act of May 31, 1933 (48 Stat. 108) (as \n     amended, including as amended by Public Law 91-550 (84 Stat. \n     1437)).\n       (b) Land Description.--The parcel of land referred to in \n     subsection (a) is the land that is generally depicted on the \n     map entitled ``Lands transferred to the Pueblo of Taos--\n     proposed'' and dated September 1994, comprises 764.33 acres, \n     and is situated within sections 25, 26, 35, and 36, Township \n     27 North, Range 14 East, New Mexico Principal Meridian, \n     within the Wheeler Peak Wilderness, Carson National Forest, \n     Taos County, New Mexico.\n       (c) Conforming Boundary Adjustments.--The boundaries of the \n     Carson National Forest and the Wheeler Peak Wilderness are \n     hereby adjusted to reflect the transfer made by subsection \n     (a).\n       (d) Resolution of Outstanding Claims.--The Congress finds \n     and declares that, as a result of the enactment of this Act, \n     the Taos Pueblo has no unresolved equitable or legal claims \n     against the United States on the lands to be held in trust \n     and to become part of the Pueblo de Taos Reservation under \n     this Title.\n\n                         TITLE XVIII--SKI FEES\n\n     SEC. 1801.--SKI AREA PERMIT RENTAL CHARGE.\n\n       (a) The Secretary of Agriculture shall charge a rental \n     charge for all ski area permits issued pursuant to section 3 \n     of the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. \n     497b), the Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1101, chapter 144; \n     16 U.S.C. 497), or the 9th through 20th paragraphs under the \n     heading ``surveying the public lands'' under the heading \n     ``under the department of the interior'' in the Act of June \n     4, 1897 (30 Stat. 34, chapter 2), on National Forest System \n     lands. Permit rental charges for permits issued pursuant to \n     the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 shall be \n     calculated as set forth in subsection (b). Permit rental \n     charges for existing ski area permits issued pursuant to the \n     Act of March 4, 1915, and the Act of June 4, 1897, shall be \n     calculated in accordance with those existing permits: \n     Provided, That a permittee may, at the permittee's option, \n     use the calculation method set forth in subsection (b).\n       (b)(1) The ski area permit rental charge (SAPRC) shall be \n     calculated by adding the permittee's gross revenues from lift \n     ticket/year-round ski area use pass sales plus revenue from \n     ski school operations (LT+SS) and multiplying such total by \n     the slope transport feet percentage (STFP) on National Forest \n     System land. That amount shall be increased by the gross \n     year-round revenue from ancillary facilities (GRAF) \n     physically located on national forest land, including all \n     permittee or subpermittee lodging, food service, rental \n     shops, parking and other ancillary operations, to determine \n     the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) subject to the permit rental \n     charge. The final rental charge shall be calculated by \n     multiplying the AGR by the following percentages for each \n     revenue bracket and adding the total for each revenue \n     bracket:\n       (A) 1.5 percent of all adjusted gross revenue below \n     $3,000,000;\n       (B) 2.5 percent for adjusted gross revenue between \n     $3,000,000 and $15,000,000;\n       (C) 2.75 percent for adjusted gross revenue between \n     $15,000,000 and $50,000,000; and\n       (D) 4.0 percent for the amount of adjusted gross revenue \n     that exceeds $50,000,000.\n       Utilizing the abbreviations indicated in this subsection \n     the ski area permit fee (SAPR) formula can be simply \n     illustrated as:\n       SAPF=((LT+SS)STFP)+GRAF=AGR; AGR% BRACKETS\n       (2) In cases where ski areas are only partially located on \n     national forest lands, the slope transport feet percentage on \n     national forest land referred to in subsection (b) shall be \n     calculated as generally described in the Forest Service \n     Manual in effect as of January 1, 1992. Revenues from Nordic \n     ski operations shall be included or excluded from the rental \n     charge calculation according to the percentage of trails \n     physically located on national forest land.\n       (3) In order to ensure that the rental charge remains fair \n     and equitable to both the United States and ski area \n     permittees, the adjusted gross revenue figure for each \n     revenue bracket in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted annually \n     by the percent increase or decrease in the national Consumer \n     Price Index for the preceding calendar year. No later than 5 \n     years after the date of enactment of this Act and every 10 \n     years thereafter the Secretary shall submit to the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate \n     and the Committee on Resources of the United States House of \n     Representatives a report analyzing whether the ski area \n     permit rental charge legislated by this Act is returning a \n     fair market value rental to the United States together with \n     any recommendations the Secretary may have for modifications \n     of the system.\n       (c) The rental charge set forth in subsection (b) shall be \n     due on June 1 of each year and shall be paid or pre-paid by \n     the permittee on a monthly, quarterly, annual or other \n     schedule as determined appropriate by the Secretary in \n     consultation with the permittee. Unless mutually agreed \n     otherwise by the Secretary and the permittee, the payment or \n     prepayment schedule shall conform to the permittee's schedule \n     in effect prior to enactment of this Act. To reduce costs to \n     the permittee and the Forest Service, the Secretary shall \n     each year provide the permittee with a standardized form and \n     worksheets (including annual rental charge calculation \n     brackets and rates) to be used for rental charge calculation \n     and submitted with the rental charge payment. Information \n     provided on such forms shall be compiled by the Secretary \n     annually and kept in the Office of the Chief, U.S. Forest \n     Service.\n       (b) The ski area permit rental charge set forth in this \n     section shall become effective on June 1, 1996 and cover \n     receipts retroactive to June 1, 1995: Provided, however, That \n     if a permittee has paid rental charges for the period June 1, \n     1995, to June 1, 1996, under the graduated rate rental charge \n     system formula in effect prior to the date of enactment of \n     this Act, such rental charges shall be credited toward the \n     new rental charge due on June 1, 1996. In order to ensure \n     increasing rental charge receipt levels to the United States \n     during transition from the graduated rate rental charge \n     system formula to the formula of this Act, the rental charge \n     paid by any individual permittee shall be--\n       (1) for the 1995-1996 permit year, either the rental charge \n     paid for the preceding 1994-1995 base year or the rental \n     charge calculated pursuant to this Act, whichever is higher;\n       (2) for the 1996-1997 permit year, either the rental charge \n     paid for the 1994-1995 base year or the rental charge \n     calculated pursuant to this Act, whichever is higher;\n       (3) for the 1997-1998 permit year, either the rental charge \n     for the 1994-1995 base year or the rental charge calculated \n     pursuant to this Act, whichever is higher.\n\n     If an individual permittee's adjusted gross revenue for the \n     1995-1996, 1996-1997, or 1997-1998 permit years falls more \n     than 10 percent below the 1994-1995 base year, the rental \n     charge paid shall be the rental charge calculated pursuant \n     to this Act.\n       (e) Under no circumstances shall revenue, or subpermittee \n     revenue (other than lift ticket, area use pass, or ski school \n     sales) obtained from operations physically located on non-\n     national forest land be included in the ski area permit \n     rental charge calculation.\n       (f) To reduce administrative costs of ski area permittees \n     and the Forest Service the terms ``revenue'' and ``sales'', \n     as used in this section, shall mean actual income from sales \n     and shall not include sales of operating equipment, refunds, \n     rent paid to the permittee by sublessees, sponsor \n     contributions to special events or any amounts attributable \n     to employee gratuities or employee lift tickets, discounts, \n     or other goods or services (except for bartered goods and \n     complimentary lift tickets) for which the permittee does not \n     receive money.\n       (g) In cases where an area of national forest land is under \n     a ski area permit but the permittee does not have revenue or \n     sales qualifying for rental charge payment pursuant to \n     subsection (a), the permittee shall pay an annual minimum \n     rental charge of $2 for each national forest acre under \n     permit or a percentage of appraised land value, as determined \n     appropriate by the Secretary.\n       (h) Where the new rental charge provided for in subsection \n     (b)(1) results in an increase in permit rental charge greater \n     than one half of one percent of the permittee's adjusted \n     gross revenue as determined under subsection (b)(1), the new \n     rental charge shall be phased in over a five year period in a \n     manner providing for increases of approximately equal \n     increments.\n       (i) To reduce federal costs in administering the provisions \n     of this Act, the reissuance of a ski area permit to provide \n     activities similar in nature and amount to the activities \n     provided under the previous permit shall not constitute a \n     major Federal action for the purposes of the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4331 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 1802. WITHDRAWALS.\n\n       Subject to valid existing rights, all lands located within \n     the boundaries of ski area permits issued prior to, on or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act pursuant to authority \n     of the Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1101, chapter 144; 16 \n     U.S.C. 497), and the Act of June 4, 1897, or the National \n     Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 497b) are \n     hereby and henceforth automatically withdrawn from all forms \n     of appropriation under the mining laws and from disposition \n     under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing \n     and all amendments thereto. Such withdrawal shall continue \n     for the full term of the permit and any modification, \n     reissuance, or renewal thereof. Unless the Secretary requests \n     otherwise of the Secretary of the Interior, such withdrawal \n     shall be canceled automatically upon expiration or other \n     termination of the permit and the land automatically restored \n     to all appropriation not otherwise restricted under the \n     public land laws.\n\n       TITLE XIX--THE SELMA TO MONTGOMERY NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL\n\n       Sec. 1901. That section 5(b) of the National Trails System \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 1244(a)) is amended by adding at the end \n     thereof the following new paragraph.\n       ``(20) The Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail, \n     consisting of 54 miles of city streets and United States \n     Highway 80 from Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church in Selma to the \n     State Capitol Building in Montgomery, Alabama, traveled by \n     voting rights advocates during March 1965 to dramatize the \n     need for voting rights legislation, as generally described in \n     the report of the Secretary of the Interior prepared pursuant \n     to subsection (b) of this section entitled ``Selma to \n     Montgomery'' and dated April 1993.

The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the \n     National Park Service, which shall be the lead Federal \n     agency, shall cooperate with other Federal, State and \n     local authorities to preserve historic sites along the \n     route, including (but not limited to) the Edmund Pettus \n     Bridge and the Brown Chapel A.M.E.

Copies of both the notice of intention to \n     relinquish and the determination concerning the contaminated \n     state of the lands shall be published in the Federal Register \n     by the Secretary of the interior.\n       (d) Effect of Contamination.--(1) If any land which is the \n     subject of a notice of intention to relinquish under \n     subsection (b)(3) is contaminated, and the Secretary of the \n     Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of the Army, \n     determines that decontamination is practicable and \n     economically feasible, taking into consideration the \n     potential future use and value of the land, and that upon \n     decontamination, the land could be opened to the operation of \n     some or all of the public land laws, including the mining \n     laws, the Secretary of the Army shall decontaminate the land \n     to the extent that funds are appropriated for such purpose.\n       (2) If the Secretaries of the Army and the Interior \n     conclude either that the contamination of any or all of the \n     lands proposed for\n\n[[Page S2823]]\n\n     relinquishment is not practicable or economically feasible, \n     or that the lands cannot be decontaminated sufficiently to \n     allow them to be opened to the operation of the public land \n     laws, or if Congress declined to appropriate funds for \n     decontamination of the lands, the Secretary of the \n     Interior shall not be required to accept the lands \n     proposed for relinquishment.\n       (3) If, because of their contaminated state, the Secretary \n     of the Interior declines under paragraph (2) to accept \n     jurisdiction of the lands proposed for relinquishment, or if \n     at the expiration of the withdrawal made by the Title the \n     Secretary of the Interior determines that some of the lands \n     withdrawn by this Title are contaminated to an extent which \n     prevents opening such contaminated lands to operation of the \n     public land laws--\n       (A) the Secretary of the Army shall take appropriate steps \n     to warn the public of the contaminated state of such lands \n     and any risks associated with entry onto such lands;\n       (B) after the expiration of the withdrawal, the Secretary \n     of the Army shall undertake no activities on such lands \n     except in connection with decontamination of such lands; and\n       (C) the Secretary of the Army shall report to the Secretary \n     of the Interior and to the Congress concerning the status of \n     such lands and all actions taken in furtherance of the \n     subsection.\n       (4) If the lands are subsequently decontaminated, upon \n     certification by the Secretary of the Army that the lands are \n     safe for all nonmilitary uses, the Secretary of the Interior \n     shall reconsider accepting jurisdiction over the lands.\n       (5) Nothing in this Title shall affect, or be construed to \n     affect, the Secretary's obligations, if any, to decontaminate \n     such lands pursuant to applicable law, including but not \n     limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response \n     Compensation and Liability Act (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.), and \n     the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource \n     Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.).\n       (e) Program of Decontamination.--Throughout the duration of \n     the withdrawal and reservation made by this Title, the \n     Secretary of the Army, to the extent funds are made \n     available, shall maintain a program of decontamination of the \n     lands withdrawn by this Title at least at the level of effort \n     carried out during fiscal year 1992.\n       (f) Acceptance of Lands Proposed for Relinquishment.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of \n     the Interior, upon deciding that it is in the public interest \n     to accept jurisdiction over that lands proposed for \n     relinquishment, is authorized to revoke the withdrawal and \n     reservation established by this Title as it applies to the \n     lands proposed for relinquishment. Should the decision be \n     made to revoke the withdrawal and reservation, the Secretary \n     of the Interior shall publish in the Federal Register an \n     appropriate order which shall--\n       (1) terminate the withdrawal and reservation;\n       (2) constitute official acceptance of full jurisdiction \n     over the lands by the Secretary of the Interior; and\n       (3) state the date upon which the lands will be opened to \n     the operation of the public land laws, including the mining \n     laws if appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 2108.

FINDINGS AND DETERMINATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that --\n       (1) in June 1995, Salt Lake City Utah, was selected to host \n     the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, and the Snowbasin Ski Resort, \n     which is owned by the Sun Valley Company, was identified as \n     the site of six Olympic events: the men's and women's \n     downhills, men's and women's Super-Gs, and men's and women's \n     combined downhills;\n       (2) in order to adequately accommodate these events, which \n     are traditionally among the most popular and heavily attended \n     at the Winter Olympic Games, major new skiing, visitor, and \n     support facilities will have to be constructed at the \n     Snowbasin Ski Resort on land currently administered by the \n     United States Forest Service;\n       (3) while certain of these new facilities can be \n     accommodated on National Forest land under traditional Forest \n     Service permitting authorities, the base area facilities \n     necessary to host visitors to the ski area and the Winter \n     Olympics are of such a nature that they should logically be \n     located on private land;\n       (4) land exchanges have been routinely utilized by the \n     Forest Service to transfer base area lands to many other ski \n     areas, and the Forest Service and the Sun Valley Company have \n     concluded that a land exchange to transfer base area lands at \n     the Snowbasin Ski Resort to the Sun Valley Company is both \n     logical and advisable;\n       (5) an environmental impact statement and numerous resource \n     studies have been completed by the Forest Service and the Sun \n     Valley Company for the lands proposed to be transferred to \n     the Sun Valley Company by this Title;\n       (6) the Sun Valley Company has assembled lands with \n     outstanding environmental, recreational, and other values to \n     convey to the Forest Service in return for the lands it will \n     receive in the exchange, and the Forest Service has \n     identified such lands as desirable for acquisition by the \n     United States; and\n       (7) completion of a land exchange and approval of a \n     development plan for Olympic related facilities at the \n     Snowbasin Ski Resort is essential to ensure that all \n     necessary facilities can be constructed, tested for safety \n     and other purposes, and become fully operational in advance \n     of the 2002 Winter Olympics and earlier pre-Olympic events.\n       (b) Determination.--The Congress has reviewed the previous \n     analyses and studies of the lands to be exchanged and \n     developed pursuant to this Title, and has made its own review \n     of these lands and issues involved, and on the basis of those \n     reviews hereby finds and determines that a legislated land \n     exchange and development plan approval with respect to \n     certain National Forest System Lands is necessary to meet \n     Olympic goals and timetables.\n\n     SEC. 2202. PURPOSE AND INTENT.\n\n       The purpose of this Title is to authorize and direct the \n     Secretary to exchange 1,320 acres of federally-owned land \n     within the Cache National Forest in the State of Utah for \n     lands of approximately equal value owned by the Sun Valley \n     Company. It is the intent of Congress that this exchange be \n     completed without delay within the period specified by \n     section 2104.\n\n     SEC. 2203. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Title--\n       (1) the term ``Sun Valley Company'' means the Sun Valley \n     Company, a division of Sinclair Oil Corporation, a Wyoming \n     Corporation, or its successors or assigns; and\n       (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n     Agriculture.\n\n     SEC. 2204. EXCHANGE.\n\n       (a) Federal Selected Lands.--(1) Not later than 45 days \n     after the final determination of value of the Federal \n     selected lands, the Secretary shall, subject to this Title, \n     transfer all right, title, and interest of the United States \n     in and to the lands referred to in paragraph (2) to the Sun \n     Valley Company.\n       (2) The lands referred to in paragraph (1) are certain \n     lands within the Cache National Forest in the State of Utah \n     comprising 1,320 acres, more or less, as generally depicted \n     on the map entitled ``Snowbasin Land Exchange--Proposed'' and \n     dated October 1995.\n       (b) Non-Federal Offered Lands.--Upon transfer of the \n     Federal selected lands under subsection (a), and in exchange \n     for those lands, the Sun Valley Company shall simultaneously \n     convey to the Secretary all right, title and interest of the \n     Sun Valley Company in and to so much of the following offered \n     lands which have been previously identified by the United \n     States Forest Service as desirable by the United States, or \n     which are identified pursuant to paragraph (5) prior to the \n     transfer of lands under subsection (a), as are of approximate \n     equal value to the Federal selected lands:\n       (1) Certain lands located within the exterior boundaries of \n     the Cache National Forest in Weber County, Utah, which \n     comprise approximately 640 acres and are generally depicted \n     on a map entitled ``Lightning Ridge Offered Lands'', dated \n     October 1995.\n\n[[Page S2824]]\n\n       (2) Certain lands located within the Cache National Forest \n     in Weber County, Utah, which comprise approximately 635 acres \n     and are generally depicted on a map entitled ``Wheeler Creek \n     Watershed Offered Lands--Section 2'' dated October 1995.\n       (3) Certain lands located within the exterior boundaries of \n     the Cache National Forest in Weber County, Utah, and lying \n     immediately adjacent to the outskirts of the City of Ogden, \n     Utah, which comprise approximately 800 acres and are \n     generally depicted on a map entitled ``Taylor Canyon Offered \n     Lands'', dated October 1995.\n       (4) certain lands located within the exterior boundaries of \n     the Cache National Forest in Weber County, Utah, which \n     comprise approximately 2,040 acres and are generally depicted \n     on a map entitled ``North Fork Ogden River-Devil's Gate \n     Valley'', dated October 1995.\n       (5) Such additional offered lands in the State of Utah as \n     may be necessary to make the values of the lands exchanged \n     pursuant to this Title approximately equal, and which are \n     acceptable to the Secretary.\n       (c) Substitution of Offered Lands.--If one or more of the \n     precise offered land parcels identified in paragraphs (1) \n     through (4) of subsection (b) is unable to be conveyed to the \n     United States due to appraisal of other reasons, or if the \n     Secretary and the Sun Valley Company mutually agree and the \n     Secretary determines that an alternative offered land package \n     would better serve long term public needs and objectives, the \n     Sun Valley Company may simultaneously convey to the United \n     States alternative offered lands in the State of Utah \n     acceptable to the Secretary in lieu of any or all of the \n     lands identified in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection \n     (b).\n       (d) Valuation and Appraisals.--(1) Values of the lands to \n     be exchanged pursuant to this Title shall be equal as \n     determined by the Secretary utilizing nationally recognized \n     appraisal standards and in accordance with section 206 of the \n     Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The appraisal \n     reports shall be written to Federal standards as defined in \n     the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land \n     Acquisitions. If, due to size, location, or use of lands \n     exchanged under this Title, the values are not exactly equal, \n     they shall be equalized by the payment of cash equalization \n     money to the Secretary of the Sun Valley Company as \n     appropriate in accordance with section 206(b) of the Federal \n     Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716(b)). \n     In order to expedite the consummation of the exchange \n     directed by this Title, the Sun Valley Company shall arrange \n     and pay for appraisals of the offered and selected lands by a \n     qualified appraiser with experience in appraising similar \n     properties and who is mutually acceptable to the Sun Valley \n     Company and the Secretary. The appraisal of the Federal \n     selected lands shall be completed and submitted to the \n     Secretary for technical review and approval no later than 120 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, and the \n     Secretary shall make a determination of value not later than \n     30 days after receipt of the appraisal. In the event the \n     Secretary and the Sun Valley Company are unable to agree to \n     the appraised value of a certain tract or tracts of land, the \n     appraisal, appraisals, or appraisal issues in dispute and a \n     final determination of value shall be resolved through a \n     process of bargaining or submission to arbitration in \n     accordance with section 206(d) of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716(d)).\n       (2) In order to expedite the appraisal of the Federal \n     selected lands, such appraisal shall--\n       (A) value the land in its unimproved state, as a single \n     entity for its highest and best use as if in private \n     ownership and as of the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (B) consider the Federal lands as an independent property \n     as through in the private marketplace and suitable for \n     development to its highest and best use;\n       (C) consider in the appraisal any encumbrance on the title \n     anticipated to be in the conveyance to Sun Valley Company and \n     reflect its effect on the fair market value of the \n     property; and\n       (D) not reflect any enhancement in value to the Federal \n     selected lands based on the existence of private lands owned \n     by the Sun Valley Company in the vicinity of the Snowbasin \n     Ski Resort, and shall assume that private lands owned by the \n     Sun Valley Company are not available for use in conjunction \n     with the Federal selected lands.\n\n     SEC. 2205. GENERAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE EXCHANGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The exchange authorized by this Title \n     shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:\n       (1) Reserved rights-of-way.--In any deed issued pursuant to \n     section 5(a), the Secretary shall reserve in the United \n     States a right of reasonable access across the conveyed \n     property for public access and for administrative purposes of \n     the United States necessary to manage adjacent federally-\n     owned lands. The terms of such reservation shall be \n     prescribed by the Secretary within 30 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Right of rescission.--This Title shall not be binding \n     on either the United States or the Sun Valley Company if, \n     within 30 days after the final determination of value of the \n     Federal selected lands, the Sun Valley Company submits to the \n     Secretary a duly authorized and executed resolution of the \n     Company stating its intention not to enter into the exchange \n     authorized by this Title.\n       (b) Withdrawal.--Subject to valid existing rights, \n     effective on the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal \n     selected lands described in section 5(a)(2) and all National \n     Forest System lands currently under special use permit to the \n     Sun Valley Company at the Snowbasin Ski Resort are hereby \n     withdrawn from all forms of appropriation under the public \n     land laws (including the mining laws) and from disposition \n     under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing.\n       (c) Deed.--The conveyance of the offered lands to the \n     United States under this Title shall be by general warranty \n     or other deed acceptable to the Secretary and in conformity \n     with applicable title standards of the Attorney General of \n     the United States.\n       (d) Status of Lands.--Upon acceptance of title by the \n     Secretary, the land conveyed to the United States pursuant to \n     this Title shall become part of the Wasatch or Cache National \n     Forests as appropriate, and the boundaries of such National \n     Forests shall be adjusted to encompass such lands. Once \n     conveyed, such lands shall be managed in accordance with the \n     Act of March 1, 1911, as amended (commonly known as the \n     ``Weeks Act''), and in accordance with the other laws, rules \n     and regulations applicable to National Forest System lands. \n     This subsection does not limit the Secretary's authority to \n     adjust the boundaries pursuant to section 11 of the Act of \n     March 1, 1911 (``Weeks Act''). For the purposes of section 7 \n     of the land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 \n     U.S.C. 4601-9), the boundaries of the Wasatch and Cache \n     National Forests, as adjusted by this Title, shall be \n     considered to be boundaries of the forests as of January 1, \n     1965.\n\n     SEC. 2206. PHASE I FACILITY CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION.\n\n       (a) Phase I Facility Finding and Review.--(1) The Congress \n     has reviewed the Snowbasin Ski Area Master Development Plan \n     dated October 1995 (hereinafter in this section referred to \n     as the ``Master Plan''). On the basis of such review, and \n     review of previously completed environmental and other \n     resource studies for the Snowbasin Ski Area, Congress hereby \n     finds that the ``Phase I'' facilities referred to in the \n     Master Plan to be located on National Forest System land \n     after consummation of the land exchange directed by this \n     Title are limited in size and scope, are reasonable and \n     necessary to accommodate the 2002 Olympics, and in some cases \n     are required to provide for the safety of skiing \n     competitors and spectators.\n       (2) Within 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary and the Sun Valley Company shall review the \n     Master Plan insofar as such plan pertains to Phase I \n     facilities which are to be constructed and operated wholly or \n     partially on National Forest System lands retained by the \n     Secretary after consummation of the land exchange directed by \n     this Title. The Secretary may modify such Phase I facilities \n     upon mutual agreement with the Sun Valley Company or by \n     imposing conditions pursuant to subsection (b) of this \n     section.\n       (3) Within 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary shall submit the reviewed Master Plan on the \n     Phase I facilities, including any modifications made thereto \n     pursuant to paragraph (2), to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the \n     Committee on Resources of the United States House of \n     Representatives for a 30-day review period. At the end of the \n     30-day period, unless otherwise directed by Act of Congress, \n     the Secretary may issue all necessary authorizations for \n     construction and operation of such facilities or \n     modifications thereof in accordance with the procedures and \n     provisions of subsection (b) of this section.\n       (b) Phase I Facility Approval, Conditions, and Timetable.--\n     Within 120 days of receipt of an application by the Sun \n     Valley Company to authorize construction and operation of any \n     particular Phase I facility, facilities, or group of \n     facilities, the Secretary, in consultation with the Sun \n     Valley Company, shall authorize construction and operation of \n     such facility, facilities, or group of facilities, subject to \n     the general policies of the Forest Service pertaining to the \n     construction and operation of ski area facilities on National \n     Forest System lands and subject to reasonable conditions to \n     protect National Forest System resources. In providing \n     authorization to construct and operate a facility, \n     facilities, or group of facilities, the Secretary may not \n     impose any condition that would significantly change the \n     location, size, or scope of the applied for Phase I facility \n     unless--\n       (1) the modification is mutually agreed to by the Secretary \n     and the Sun Valley Company; or\n       (2) the modification is necessary to protect health and \n     safety.\n\n     Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the \n     Secretary's responsibility to monitor and assure compliance \n     with the conditions set forth in the construction and \n     operation authorization.\n       (c) Congressional Directions.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, Congress finds that consummation of the \n     land exchange directed by this Title and all determinations, \n     authorizations, and actions taken by the Secretary pursuant \n     to this Title pertaining to Phase I facilities on National \n     Forest System lands, or any modifications thereof, to be \n     nondiscretionary actions authorized and directed by Congress \n     and hence to comply with all procedural and other \n     requirements of the laws of the United States.\n\n[[Page S2825]]\n\n     Such determinations, authorizations and actions shall not be \n     subject to administrative or judicial review.\n\n     SEC. 2207. NO PRECEDENT.\n\n       Nothing in section 2104(d)(2) of this Title relating to \n     conditions or limitations on the appraisal of the Federal \n     lands, or any provision of section 2106 relating to the \n     approval by the Congress or the Forest Service of facilities \n     on National Forest System lands, shall be construed as a \n     precedent for subsequent legislation.\n\n            TITLE XXIII--COLONIAL NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK.\n\n     SECTION 2301. COLONIAL NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK.\n\n       (a) Transfer and Rights-of-Way.--The Secretary of the \n     Interior (hereinafter in this Title referred to as the \n     ``Secretary'') is authorized to transfer, without \n     reimbursement, to York County, Virginia, that portion of the \n     existing sewage disposal system, including related \n     improvements and structures, owned by the United States and \n     located within the Colonial National Historical Park, \n     together with such rights-of-way as are determined by the \n     Secretary to be necessary to maintain and operate such \n     system.\n       (b) Repair and Rehabilitation of System.--The Secretary is \n     authorized to enter into a cooperative agreement with York \n     County, Virginia, under which the Secretary will pay a \n     portion, not to exceed $110,000, of the costs of repair and \n     rehabilitation of the sewage disposal system referred to in \n     subsection (a).\n       (c) Fees and Charges.--In consideration for the rights-of-\n     way granted under subsection (a), and in recognition of the \n     National Park Service's contribution authorized under \n     subsection (b), the cooperative agreement under subsection \n     (b) shall provide for a reduction in, or the elimination of, \n     the amounts charged to the National Park Service for its \n     sewage disposal.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares that:\n       (1) In 1899, the citizens of Cuprum, Idaho, commissioned \n     E.S. Hesse to conduct a survey describing these lands \n     occupied by their community. The purpose of this survey was \n     to provide a basis for the application for a townsite patent.\n       (2) In 1909, the Cuprum Townsite patent (Number 52817) was \n     granted, based on an aliquot parts description which was \n     intended to circumscribe the Hesse survey.\n       (3) Since the day of the patent, the Hesse survey has been \n     used continuously by the community of Cuprum and by Adams \n     County, Idaho, as the official townsite plant and basis for \n     conveyance of title within the townsite.\n       (4) Recent boundary surveys conducted by the United States \n     Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, and the United \n     States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, \n     discovered inconsistencies between the official aliquot parts \n     description of the patented Cuprum Townsite and the Hesse \n     survey. Many lots along the south and east boundaries of the \n     townsite are now known to extend onto National Forest System \n     lands outside the townsite.\n       (5) It is the determination of Congress that the original \n     intent of the Cuprum Townsite application was to include all \n     the lands described by the Hesse survey.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Title to amend the \n     1909 Cuprum Townsite patent to include those additional lands \n     described by the Hesse survey in addition to other lands \n     necessary to provide an administratively acceptable boundary \n     to the National Forest System.\n\n     SEC. 3202. AMENDMENT OF PATENT.\n\n       (a) The 1909 Cuprum Townsite patent is hereby amended to \n     include parcels 1 and 2, identified on the plat, marked as \n     ``Township 20 North, Range 3 West, Boise Meridian, Idaho, \n     Section 10: Proposed Patent Adjustment Cuprum Townsite, \n     Idaho'' prepared by Payette N.F.--Land Survey Unit, drawn and \n     approved by Tom Betzold, Forest Land Surveyor, on April 25, \n     1995. Such additional lands are hereby conveyed to the \n     original patentee, Pitts Ellis, trustee, and Probate Judge of \n     Washington County, Idaho, or any successors or assigns in \n     interest in accordance with State law. The Secretary of \n     Agriculture may correct clerical and typographical errors in \n     such plat.\n       (b) The Federal Government shall survey the Federal \n     property lines and mark and post the boundaries necessary to \n     implement this section.\n\n     SEC. 3203.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join the efforts \nof my colleagues on the Senate Small Business Committee to advance \nregulatory reform. As the CEO of a small business during the eighties, \nI witnessed first hand how a business, when left unencumbered by \nintrusive government regulations, can push the envelope of innovation, \nmaximize on ingenuity, and create jobs. When I left Franklin Quest \nbefore running for the Senate, our firm, which did not even exist 10 \nyears ago, provided over 700 people with jobs.\n  Unfortunately, as the decade progressed and the Congress accelerated \nits approval of unfunded mandates to State and local governments and \nbusinesses, the regulatory machine burgeoned while the job creation \nengine slowed. Americans now are suffering the unintended consequences \nof the Federal Government's good intentions. Over-regulating causes \nprices to go up and wages to go down. It is responsible for increased \nunemployment and a drain on our international competitiveness. And \nbecause regulation increases uncertainty, it impairs innovation.\n  For these reasons, I am excited to help enact laws which will help \nour country's businesses, particularly our small businesses, function \nwith less government intrusion. Although I would like to go much \nfurther in limiting excess regulation of business, this bill is a step \nin the right direction, and I look forward to seeing President Clinton \nsupport it.\n  In a report to Congress issued in October 1995, the Small Business \nAdministration noted that small businesses bear a disproportionate \nshare of the regulatory burden. It was estimated that small businesses \npay 63 percent of the total private-sector bill for complying with \nFederal regulations, while employing 53 percent of the work force. Dr. \nThomas Hopkins, a leading researcher in the field of regulatory costs, \nestimated that small businesses pay 80-percent more per employee in \nregulatory paperwork costs than do larger companies. Meanwhile, small \nbusiness is acknowledged to be the creator of most new jobs in this \ncountry. For these reasons, it is imperative that we listen and respond \nto the concerns of small business.\n  This bill, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of \n1996, S. 942, was developed using recommendations from the small \nbusiness community. During the 1995 White House Conference on Small \nBusiness, representatives from small business came together and \nprioritized the top ways the Federal Government could help them be more \nsuccessful. Several of the top priorities named during that conference \nare included in this bill.\n  The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 \npermits small businesses to take Federal agencies to court if the \nagencies do not comply with a reg flex analysis, a requirement under \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 that requires agencies to review \nthe impact of new regulations on small businesses. S. 942 also requires \nFederal agencies to simplify forms and publish a plain English guide to \nhelp small businesses comply with regulations. Additionally, agencies \nare directed to waive certain fines for first-time, nonserious \nviolations by small businesses if the violations were corrected within \na certain time period. The bill also allows small firms to recoup \nattorneys' fees if they win a challenge against excessive enforcement \nof existing regulations. Finally, the bill provides a 45-day \ncongressional review mechanism for Congress to reject new rules with \nexpedited procedures, subject to constitutional presentment to the \nPresident.\n  I appreciate the efforts of Senators Bond, Bumpers, Domenici, and \nNickles to pass this legislation which offers at least some degree of \nrelief to the American worker. As one leader in the small business \ncommunity put it, ``if Government continues to load regulations on our \nbacks, all it will get in return are broken backs.'' I am happy to be a \ncosponsor and supporter of this effort to get Government off small \nbusinesses' backs, and help them get back to work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2830-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2831-S2832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HEROES IN A FLORIDA TRAGEDY\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a South \nCarolina family and the heroes who struggled to rescue them. On one \nside, we have a tragedy that boggles the mind. On the other, there are \ndozens of quiet heroes whose courage is a blessing and reminder of what \nmakes our people strong.\n  On March 17, a small plane crashed off Key West, FL. Five people--the \npilot and four members of the Blackburn family--died. A son, 10-year-\nold Matthew Blackburn, miraculously survived. Our prayers are with both \nfamilies. We mourn their deaths and pray for a speedy recovery for \nyoung Matthew.\n  At the same time, we should all feel a deep sense of gratitude for \nAmericans who risk their lives everyday for others. In this tragedy, \ntrained rescue workers, lifeguards, police officers, and paramedics put \ntheir lives in danger to save the pilot and family. Even more \nnoteworthy are other volunteers, such as a boat captain and diver, who \nwent out of their way to help as much as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record the March 24 \narticle from the Miami Herald to pay tribute to these heroes and to \nleave a lasting memorial to those who perished.\n  The article follows:\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Mar. 24, 1996]\n\n                          Heroes in the Moment\n\n                 (By Susana Bellido and Ozzie Osborne)\n\n       Key West.--In one sickening moment, a seaplane bound for \n     the Dry Tortugas crashed into five feet of water off key \n     West's busiest road last Sunday, trapping a family of five \n     and the pilot under water.\n       In the seconds and minutes that followed:\n       One by one, tourists and Key West resident, police officers \n     and paramedics, students and workers jumped into the water.\n       Despite the horrid scene, the sting of fuel in the eyes, \n     the despair of seeing children die in their hands, they did \n     what they could.\n       In an unsynchronized maneuver, they cleared the way for \n     each other, they yielded to the most experienced, they \n     fetched equipment, they formed a human chain to get the \n     victims to shore, they did what had to be done.\n       The did all the could.\n       When it was all over, five people were dead: Lynn and \n     Pamela Blackburn, a couple from Charleston, S.C, who had \n     arrived in Key West the night before on vacation; their 6-\n     year-old son Jonathan and 3-year-old daughter Martha; and the \n     pilot, Keith Bellow of Gretna, La., father of three.\n       The only survivor was Matthew Blackburn, a 10-year-old who \n     defied the odds and is recovering from broken bones and other \n     injuries.\n       With him are the hopes of the everyday people who reacted \n     to an extraordinary situation with selfless courage.\n       With him is their sympathy, for he was the only one they \n     could save.\n       They are the heroes. Here are some of their stories.\n\n\n    Andy Matroci--boat captain was one of the first in murky water.\n\n       Andy Matroci heard it hit. Something big, in the water.\n       A boat captain and diver who searches for Spanish galleons, \n     Matroci had been riding his bike along North Roosevelt \n     Boulevard. He looked back. The wreckage was just 60 feet \n     away.\n       Instantly, it seemed, people were wading toward the \n     wreckage. He took off his shoes and joined them.\n       The water was still murky from the crash. He put his hand \n     into the plane and felt Pamela Blackburn's leg. He couldn't \n     reach her seat belt. He yelled to a guy on the other side to \n     try to get her out.\n       ``I got one here,'' another man yelled. He asked for a \n     knife to cut loose a child.\n       Somebody brought a mask out. Somebody asked for a pair of \n     shears. Someone was walking from shore with a pair. Matroci \n     fetched them.\n       He carried one of the children to shore. He thought of \n     administering CPR, but water poured the child's mouth. He \n     handed the wilted body up the sea wall.\n       We're not working fast enough, he thought.

He took her to the hospital, \n     where everyone was busy, so he stayed and helped out.\n       Kavanaugh radioed the hospital: three children and a woman \n     on the way, more to come.\n       He asked firefighters and police officers to drive \n     ambulances so paramedics could tend to patients.\n       Within 15 minutes of transporting the victims to the \n     hospital, the paramedics had four other emergency calls.

Mr. President, I would like to address the \namendment that was offered by my colleague, Senator Bumpers, to S. \n1549. Senator Bumpers' amendment would have substituted a two-tiered \ngrazing fee for the new grazing fee formula in the bill. After serious \nconsideration, I supported the motion to table the Bumpers amendment,\n\n[[Page S2833]]\n\nand thereby preserve the new increased grazing fee formula in S. 1459.\n  The Bumpers amendment would create two grazing fee formulas. The \nfirst would apply to permittee who ``control livestock less than 2,000 \nanimal unit months [AUM]'' on public lands during a grazing year. This \nfee is intended to apply to small ranching operations, and would \nincrease each year for the next 3 years. The second fee created by this \namendment is targeted to larger ranching operations, which are \ncomprised of more than 2,000 AUM's. This fee would be set according to \nhigher amount of either the average grazing fee charged by the \nrespective State, or, by increasing the aforementioned small ranch fee \nby 25 percent.\n  The Bumpers amendment would increase the grazing fee each year for \nthe next 3 years for smaller ranchers, and implement a substantial \nincrease for larger ranchers. While the Bumpers amendment attempts to \nrequire larger--and therefore presumably better off ranching operations \nto pay more, I ultimately decided that the Bumpers proposal would have \ntoo injurious an impact on modest, family-run ranching operations in \nArizona.\n  I strongly believe in the longstanding principle of managing Federal \nlands for the multiple use of the public. This means that the many \nlegitimate uses of public lands--recreation, wildlife preservation, \ngrazing, hunting, and economic purposes--must be carefully balanced \nwith each other. Our precious Federal lands must be properly managed so \nthat they can be enjoyed by Americans both today, and in the future.\n  When public lands are used for economic purposes, such as timber, \nmining, and cattle grazing, there clearly should be a fair return to \ntaxpayers for the economic benefits gained from the land, and for the \ncost of administering these uses. In light of the massive Federal debt \nour Nation has piled up, the Congress must be especially vigilant in \nensuring that fees imposed on individuals who are using public lands \nfor commercial purposes, must be equitably set. With an astounding $5 \ntrillion debt growing larger every day, I think it is appropriate for \ngrazing fees and mining fees to be adjusted.\n  I strongly oppose, however, drastic hikes in such fees that would \nbankrupt hard-working ranching families. Nationwide, ranchers who graze \ncattle on public lands have an annual income of only $30,000 a year. \nThese families do not have a huge profit margin that is being gained at \nthe expense of the public. Indeed, the taxes they pay and the economic \nbenefits they generate are extremely important to small towns in \nArizona and throughout the West.\n  The grazing reform bill I am supporting, S. 1459--Public Rangelands \nManagement Act--would increase the existing grazing fee by 37 percent. \nIn my view, that is a pretty reasonable attempt to address legitimate \nconcerns of the public about what return the Treasury is getting from \nthe lease of Federal rangelands. If we could reform Federal fees or \nreduce Federal spending pertaining to corporate entities which are \nsimilarly subsidized by taxpayers, our budget problems would be in a \nlot better shape. Ranchers will pay their fair share under S. 1459.\n  The new, higher grazing fee in S. 1459 will afford greater stability \nto ranchers in my State who need to plan ahead for their family \nbusiness. The fee in S. 1459 is based upon a 3-year rolling average of \nthe gross value of beef production in the United States, along with \ninterest rates from Treasury bills. This new formula will fluctuate \naccording to market conditions, which I think is appropriate.\n  While the sponsors of the Bumpers amendment state that it is targeted \nat large, corporate-owned ranching operations, I am deeply concerned \nthat its higher, corporate fee hike could come down squarely on many \nfamily ranchers in the Southwest. It would have potentially crippling \neffects on family ranchers in States such as Arizona and New Mexico, \nespecially.\n  The reason the Bumpers amendment would hurt many Southwestern \nranchers is that its formula would significantly impact ranchers whose \ngrazing permits are comprised primarily of Federal lands, and on \nranchers who graze cattle year round. Both of these factors apply to \nsouthwestern ranchers, due to large amount of land that is owned by the \nFederal Government. The Bumpers amendment's formula would apply its \nhigher fee to ranching operations with more than 176 head of cattle, \nwhich is not a large, corporate operation by the standards of my State.\n  Furthermore, the Bumpers amendment's higher fee was partly based on \nhigher State land standards, which are not always readily comparable to \nFederal lands. Federal rangelands do not offer the same exclusivity of \nuse to permittees as do State lands, and ranchers on Federal lands also \nbear higher costs for range improvements than do holders of private \ngrazing permits.\n  I find no evidence that that new fee will not cover the Federal cost \nof the program.\n  Due to these factors, I opposed the Bumpers amendment, and voted to \npreserve the reasonable fee increase which is in the underlying bill. I \ncommend Senator Bumpers for his objectives, however, and share his \nconcerns that taxpayers must be fairly compensated for the economic use \nof public lands. I will continue my efforts to vigorously weed out \nunfair and unsustainable corporate subsidies. If S. 1459 becomes law, \nthe Congress should continue to evaluate the grazing revenues it \nproduces. I will be open at that time to considering whether further \nadjustments for corporate ranching operations are warranted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2832-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COL. FRED E. KISHLER, JR.\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Col. Fred \nE. Kishler, Jr., who died this past January. From August 1994 until his \ndeath, Colonel Kishler served as the Director of the General Defense \nIntelligence Program [GDIP] Staff where he served with great \ndistinction.\n  Colonel Kishler was a fellow Buckeye--born in Tiffin, OH, and \nreceiving his undergraduate degree at Heidelberg College in Tiffin. In \nhis lengthy and distinguished Air Force career, Colonel Kishler flew \ndangerous, sensitive missions in the U-2 spy plane and other aircraft, \nand was responsible for fielding numerous tactical and strategic \nintelligence systems. His greatest love as a pilot was flying the U-2, \nspending approximately 15 years in the U-2 program. Colonel Kishler \naccumulated over 4,800 flying hours--over 2,000 of those hours were \nspent in the cockpit of a U-2, and he flew 106 combat missions in \nSoutheast Asia. During the Vietnam War, he demonstrated his courage as \na flight leader for search and rescue missions, and he supported the \nSon Tay POW raid.\n  In 1991, Colonel Kishler came to work for the Defense Intelligence \nAgency, first serving as the Chief of the Reconnaissance Division for \nFunctional Management. His hard work and effectiveness led to other \npositions as the Associate Deputy Director of the Programs and \nEvaluation Division of the National Military Intelligence Collection \nCenter, and ultimately as the Director of the General Defense \nIntelligence Program Staff--particularly challenging assignments in a \nperiod of declining resources where we have had to do more with less. \nColonel Kishler's honesty, integrity, and professionalism gained the \nrespect of Congress as well as the Department of Defense.\n  Among Fred's many decorations and awards were the Distinguished \nFlying Cross, a Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Medal with thirteen \noak leaf clusters, and the Air Force Commendation medal.\n  Mr. President, I join all of my colleagues on the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence in paying tribute to the memory of Col. Fred \nE. Kishler, Jr., and pass along our deepest sympathies to Colonel \nKishler's mother and father--Fred and Marjorie Kishler; his wife, \nSusan; and their sons, Mark and Fred. Fred Kishler was a credit to the \nAir Force and the United States of America, and he will be sorely \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2833-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2833-S2834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to join the \ndistinguished majority leader, and my colleagues, in cosponsoring the \nNational Missile Defense Act of 1996. This legislation builds on the \nMissile Defense Act of 1995. The 1995 act made significant\n\n[[Page S2834]]\n\nprogress toward securing the funding necessary for the eventual \ndeployment of a missile defense system capable of protecting the United \nStates. Unfortunately, that act fell short by not explicitly directing \nthat we deploy the missile defense system as soon as possible.\n  The majority leader, in close cooperation with Congress' National \ndefense leadership, has crafted a proposal that achieves our nation's \nmissile defense through prudent, incremental development of policies \nand force structures. To begin with, we would produce the system \nnecessary to protect the United States from limited, unauthorized or \naccidental ballistic missile attacks. We then would augment that \ncapability to defend our Nation against larger and more sophisticated \nballistic missile threats. I am especially heartened that this bill \nallows for the development of the most promising anti-ballistic missile \ntechnologies, including sea-based systems such as Navy Upper Tier.\n  This bill assigns the Secretary of Defense the considerable task of \nreporting a missile defense development and deployment plan by March \n15, 1997. However, I feel confident that Congress will be more than \nwilling to assist him in the formulation of that plan. This can, and \nshould, be a joint endeavor, Congress will fulfil its constitutional \nresponsibility to raise and support our armed forces, while the \nExecutive determines how best to deploy these forces.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I would like to expand upon section 5 of \nthe act--that section regarding the ABM Treaty. Congress, through the \nMissile Defense Acts of 1991, 1994, and 1995 has repeatedly stated that \nthe ABM Treaty does not, in any way, hinder the development of theater \nballistic missile defenses. It has also called for a renegotiation of \nthe ABM Treaty so as to allow the development of more robust national \nmissile defense systems.\n  Unfortunately, this country has abandoned the initiatives of the \nprevious administration to cooperatively develop with the Russians a \nprotective global missile defense systems. An insistence on keeping \nAmerica vulnerable to attack, and a dogmatic faith in the deterrence of \nnuclear war through mutual assured destruction will no longer prevent \nmissile attacks upon the United States.\n  Mr. President, the times have changed since the ratification of the \nABM Treaty. Our primary threats no longer come from a general nuclear \nattack by thousands of Soviet weapons--an attack that would probably \noverwhelm a ballistic missile defense system. Today our immediate \nthreats come from rogue, unintentional, or unauthorized attacks of \nlimited size and duration. The limitations of the ABM Treaty fail to \naddress these new threats, and I believe, are incapable of being \nmodified so as to address them. The administration has steadfastly \nstood by the antiquated strategies of the ABM Treaty, and I am afraid \nit is unwilling to address the threats posed to America by continued \nreliance on that treaty.\n  Nonetheless, Mr. President, this Congress continues to be willing to \nwork with the administration to address our missile defense needs. I \nbelieve the urging contained in section 5 represent our last, best hope \nof adequately modifying the ABM Treaty, and protecting America from \nballistic missile attack. The Treaty may be fundamentally unable to \naddress the threats we face today. It may be best to renounce it in its \ntotality. Such a clear break with previous policy may not be feasible \nin this Congress. But it must be clear that this Congress worries that \nits urging and calls have fallen on deaf ears in the Executive, and \nthat we believe the United States cannot afford to wait much longer. \nTherefore, I particularly support the provision in this bill that calls \nfor withdrawal from the ABM Treaty if amendments allowing adequate \nnational missile defenses are not agreed to within 1 year. I hope this \nis sufficient warning as to the extent of congressional frustration.\n  The majority leader has displayed the foresight and perceptiveness \ncritical for developing effective national security strategies. There \ncan be no doubt that a fully operational and technologically capable \nballistic missile defense system is crucial to that strategy. Nor can \nthere be any doubt that antiquated treaties which fail to adapt to \nvastly different national security threats must be either changed or \ndiscarded.\n  The majority leader's bill constitutes a reasonable and moderate \nattempt to bridge the broad philosophical gap that exists between \nCongress and the administration. We should not let this opportunity be \nlost. If concerns with the ABM Treaty prevent this bill from becoming \nlaw, then I believe it may be time to nullify that treaty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2833-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CARL SIMPSON WHILLOCK\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ntrue statesman. Carl Simpson Whillock was born on May 7, 1926, in the \nsmall town of Scotland, AR. In the nearly 70 years since, he has \nexcelled in the realms of politics, academia, and private business.\n  Carl's desire to serve the people of Arkansas surfaced at an early \nage. Just 2 years after receiving both his undergraduate and master's \ndegrees from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Carl began a \ndistinguished career of public service as a member of the Arkansas \nHouse of Representatives. He came to Washington in 1955 to serve as the \nexecutive assistant to the Honorable J.W. Trimble, U.S. Congressman \nfrom the third district of Arkansas.\n  While working in Representative Trimble's office, Carl Whillock \nearned a law degree from George Washington University in 1960. After a \n3-year stint in private law practice, he served as prosecuting attorney \nfor the 14th Judicial District of Arkansas before beginning his career \nin academia at the University of Arkansas.\n  Carl Whillock was the director for university relations and an \nassistant to the president during his 7\\1/2\\ years at Arkansas. He also \ntaught part-time in the political science department.\n  In 1964, Carl Whillock left academics to run my campaign for Governor \nof Arkansas, and I am happy to say he worked with me in the Governor's \noffice for a short time after my election. But Carl soon returned to \nhis beloved University of Arkansas as the vice president for \ngovernmental relations and public affairs.\n  Carl's many years of work in the academic community were rewarded in \n1978 when he was asked to become the president of Arkansas State \nUniversity in Jonesboro.\n  For the past 16 years, Carl has been the president of Arkansas \nElectric Cooperative and Arkansas Electric Cooperatives Inc. As he \nprepares to retire on the 1st of April, his colleagues remember him as \na trusted friend, a revered mentor, and a gentle, gracious boss.\n  Carl Whillock's management style has been praised throughout his many \nyears in various positions of authority. He believes in hiring good \npeople, and then giving them the space to do their jobs. His employees \noperate effectively and efficiently because Carl makes them feel \ncomfortable and encourages them to bring their own style to the \nworkplace.\n  By all accounts, Carl Simpson Whillock is a success. The very mention \nof his name brings a smile to the faces of those who know him, and the \nwords gentleman and good guy flow from their lips.\n  After retirement, I am sure Carl will remain active as a member of \nthe University of Arkansas' Board of Trustees. He has never been one to \nsit still for very long. He is always there to lend a hand. As Dennis \nRobertson, a long-time friend and employee says, ``Carl approaches life \nin a simple way. He does not get mad. He is warm, caring and above all \nsincere. We can all learn a lot from him.''\n  Carl Simpson Whillock--a true asset to the State of Arkansas. On \nbehalf of all the people you have touched over these many years, \ncongratulations on your retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2834-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2834-S2835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to join with my colleagues, \nand with so many Americans--both of Greek and non-Greek descent--in \ncelebrating March 25, Greek Independence Day. I am pleased to have been \nan original cosponsor of Senate Resolution 219, a bipartisan resolution \nthat designated today ``Greek Independence\n\n[[Page S2835]]\n\nDay: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.'' \nThat resolution was submitted by our distinguished colleague from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, and it was agreed to by the Senate \nunanimously on March 6.\n  Today commemorates the 175th anniversary of the beginning of Greece's \nstruggle for independence from the Ottoman Turkish Empire. After 400 \nyears of foreign domination, and after 11 years of struggle against the \ndespotic rule of the Ottoman Turks, Greece's independence was a \ncataclysmic event in European Affairs. At that time, outside of Britain \nand France, Europe was composed mainly of autocratic empires and states \nwhose borders had little relation to their composite nationalities.\n  The astounding accomplishment of the Greek people in achieving their \nindependence from the vast Ottoman Empire acted as a catalyst in \ntransforming the aspirations of Europeans across the continent. \nGreece's independence from the Turks was, in many ways, even a greater \nfeat than the other great struggle for national independence 45 years \nearlier: the American Revolutionary War. Although the Greek people \nreceived support from many other countries, particularly from the \nUnited States, they enjoyed no advantage similar to a protective ocean \nor the active assistance of an ally such as France.\n  During the last 175 years, the ideals of national independence and \ndemocracy, which were first expounded by the ancient Greeks, have \nspread widely throughout Europe and so much of the rest of the world. \nGreece's achievement of independence helped to spread not only the \nbelief in the inherent right of national independence, but the belief \nthat it is possible for a nation to assert its rights, despite \nseemingly impossible odds.\n  Mr. President, it is appropriate to remember the meaning of March 25, \nwhich remains a powerful symbol of the ideals that America holds dear \nand upon which our own Nation was founded. But this is a symbol not \nonly for the Greek and American people to celebrate. It should also be \na day of commemoration for the many young, struggling democracies \naround the globe, as well as for the numerous nations and peoples still \nyearning to be free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2834-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2835-S2836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PRODUCT LIABILITY FAIRNESS ACT\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I support the conference report of the \nProduct Liability Fairness Act.\n  This is a historic day in the effort to enact meaningful civil \njustice reform. For the first time in more than two decades, the Senate \nand the House of Representatives have debated and passed product \nliability reform.\n  Product liability reform was part of the Contract With America. \nAccording to the Luntz Research Co. survey released in March 1995, ``83 \npercent of Americans believe that our liability lawsuit system has \nmajor problems and needs serious improvements.''\n  Now, all that remains is for the President to do his part to make \nproduct liability reform a reality.\n  I commend the efforts of my colleagues from Washington and West \nVirginia, Senators Gorton and Rockefeller, for their 15-year effort to \nbring needed reform to the Nation's product liability laws.\n  Historically, America's economic strength has been in manufacturing, \nwhere much of our wealth has been created. It is essential that the \nCongress move to protect our Nation's manufacturing base from \nunreasonable litigation. Although product liability law is a small area \nof tort law, it is also a critical area in which America is losing its \ncompetitive edge.\n  Mr. President, the conference report contains many important \nprovisions which were contained in the original Gorton-Rockefeller \nbill. The alcohol and drug defense would create a complete defense \ncreated if the claimant was more than 50-percent responsible for his or \nher injury. The bill also provides for a reduction in damages by the \npercentage of the harm resulting from claimant's misuse or alteration \nof a product.\n  The bill provides for a punitive damages cap that limits recovery to \n$250,000 or 2 times compensatory damages, whichever is greater. \nExceptions are established for small business--under 25 employees--and \nindividuals with a net worth of less than $500,000. With these two \nexceptions, the limit is $250,000 or 2 times compensatory, which ever \nis lesser.\n  The bill's statute of limitations requires that suits be filed within \n2 years after the harm and the cause of the harm was discovered, or \nshould have been discovered.\n  The bill provides for joint and several liability for all economic \ndamages, but several liability only for noneconomic damages.\n  The bill provides that biomaterial suppliers who furnish raw \nmaterials, but are not manufacturers or sellers, are protected from \nliability when the supplier is not negligent. Further, a product seller \ncan be held strictly liable as a manufacturer only in two \ncircumstances: where the claimant can't get service of process on the \nmanufacturer, or where the judgment is unenforceable against the \nmanufacturer, as is the case when the manufacturer is judgment-proof.\n  During the product liability floor debate, I offered three \namendments. Amendment 1, which passed by a vote of 60 to 39, struck out \nprovisions in the original Senate bill that penalized, with attorney \nfees and court costs, only defendants, but not plaintiffs who refused \nto enter into ADR. Under State law, ADR provisions are equally \napplicable to plaintiffs and defendants, and we should keep it that \nway.\n  Amendment 2, which was tabled by a vote of 56 to 44, would have \nlimited non-economic damages to $500,000 in medical malpractice cases. \nAmendment 3--which was tabled by a vote of 65 to 35--would have limited \nattorneys' contingency fees to 25 percent of the first $250,000. The \namendment also provided that 25 percent of a punitive damage award is \nrebuttably presumed to be ethical and reasonable.\n  Although the House bill had both a non-economic damages cap of \n$250,000 in medical malpractice cases and an attorney-fees limitation \nprovision, neither of these two provisions were included in the \nconference report. I will continue to work to see that these provisions \nare enacted into law. However, one important provision from the House \nversion that was included by the conferees shortens the statute of \nrepose from 20 to 15 years, thus reducing the time period during which \na claimant may bring a product-liability action after taking delivery \nof a durable good.\n  The conferees also limited the ``additur'' provision contained in the \noriginal Senate bill. Thus, in a case of egregious conduct, a judge may \nraise the claimant's punitive damage recovery no higher than the amount \nproposed by the jury, unless State law provides otherwise.\n  I want to note some other important provisions contained in the House \nbill that unfortunately were dropped by the Senate-House conferees. The \n``loser pays'' provision, which would discourage frivolous lawsuits, \nwas dropped. The ``FDA defense,'' which would prohibit the imposition \nof punitive damages upon a manufacturer of a product that has received \nFDA approval, was also eliminated. And, as I mentioned earlier, the \nconferees also dropped the $250,000 cap on non-economic damages in \nmedical malpractice actions. Moreover, the conferees dropped provisions \nthat would have extended the punitive damage cap and joint and several \nliability reform to all civil cases. I regret that these provisions are \nnot in our bill.\n  In spite of the narrow scope of the conference report, President \nClinton has indicated that he will veto this bill. And this is despite \nthe fact that back in August 1991, Governor Clinton was leader of the \nNational Governor's Association when it approved--unanimously--Federal \nproduct-liability reform. Also as Governor, Mr. Clinton twice supported \nNGA resolutions calling for product-liability reform.\n  The President's track record on this issue caused the Washington \nPost, in a March 14 editorial, to predict that the bill should be \n``accepted by both houses and signed by the President.'' The veto \ndecision prompted another Post editorial 5 days later, this one \nentitled, ``Trial Lawyers Triumph.''\n  Mr. President, I could not agree more, and it is a real shame.\n  The limited reform in this bill will be an important first step, but \nonly a first\n\n[[Page S2836]]\n\nstep. Ultimately, the Congress and a more responsive President must go \nbeyond product-liability reform and must comprehensively overhaul the \nentire civil justice system. We must repeal the regressive ``tort tax'' \nthat depletes our economy, raises prices, destroys jobs, stifles \ninnovation, and reduces exports. The ``tort tax'' created a capricious \nlegal lottery that divides neighbor from neighbor, and causes doctors \nto add billions to our national health-care costs each year by \npracticing defensive medicine.\n  In Arizona, for instance, medical malpractice premiums have increased \nby nearly 200 percent since 1982. Attorneys' fees and transaction costs \nare an increasingly large part of this increase in litigation expenses.\n  The U.S. Department of Commerce has estimated that only 40 cents of \neach dollar expended in product-liability suits ultimately reaches the \nvictims. A Rand Corp. study showed that 50 cents of each liability \ndollar does not go to victims, but to attorneys fees and other \ntransaction costs. It is clear that the Product Liability Fairness Act \nis a small but critical step toward the goal of national legal reform.\n  It is my understanding that this body will consider more \ncomprehensive legal reform legislation later this year, including \nSenator Hatch's Civil Justice Reform Act of 1995, and Senator \nMcConnell's, Lawsuit Reform Act of 1995. I am also hopeful that the \nSenate Judiciary Committee will hold hearings on S. 11, the Medical \nCare Injury Compensation Act of 1995, a bill I introduced on the first \nday of the 104th Congress. This legislation caps non-economic damages \nsuch as pain and suffering at $250,000; imposes a limit on attorneys' \nfees of 25 percent of the first $150,000 recovered and 15 percent of \nany amount in excess of $150,000; provides for periodic payments where \ndamages for future economic loss exceed $100,000; provides for \nmandatory offsets for damages paid by a ``collateral source''; and \nreforms ``joint and several'' liability.\n  Mr. President, I would like to close by addressing one of the \narguments used by the President in his veto message. this argument \nasserts the unconsitutionality of the preemption of State liability \nlaws under the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n  It is clear that no individual State can solve the problems created \nby abusive litigation. This is particularly true in the case of \nproduct-liability litigation: a product is frequently manufactured in \none State, sold in a different State, and causes injury in a third \nState. In fact, Government figures establish that, on average, over 70 \npercent of the goods manufactured in one State are shipped out of State \nfor sale and use.\n  It is clearer that a national solution is justified by the \nfundamentally interstate character of product commerce. The threat of \ndisproportionate, unpredictable, punitive damage awards exerts an \neconomic impact far beyond the borders of any individual State. This \nthreat reduces investments, dampens job creation, and prevents new \nproducts from reaching the marketplace. In an increasingly integrated \nnational and international economy, the confusing, inconsistent \npatchwork of State liability awards has cut deeply into America's \neconomic strength.\n  Unfortunately, since the signing of the Constitution, the commerce \nclause has been stretched and contorted to authorize virtually every \nactivity Congress chooses to regulate--except interstate commerce. \nOpponents of legal reform profess concern about the preemption of State \nlaw and interference with States' rights. And yet it was many of the \nsame interests that favored intrusive Federal regulations imposed on \nthe States by OSHA, FDA, EPA, and other Federal regulators.\n  In truth, States' rights is not what is being defended here, but \nrather, the status quo. Otherwise, why is the litigation industry the \nonly segment of the economy that opponents of legal reform believe \nshould remain beyond the reach of Federal law?\n  Mr. President, legal reform will not cause the creation of a single \nnew Federal program or the expenditure of a single new appropriation; \nLegal reform will not impose new taxes or regulations on our citizens. \nLegal reform will simply create clear, consistent legal standards \ncovering civil actions brought in State and Federal courts.\n  Mr. President, legal reform will enhance the essential principle of \ndue process. As the U.S. Supreme Court has said many times, due \nprocess, criminal and civil, is fundamental to our concept or ordered \nliberty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2835-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SALUTE TO MEDINA LIONS CLUB\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in support and \nappreciation of the Medina Lions Club, which will celebrate its 50th \nanniversary this Thursday. These club members from Gibson County, TN \nhave devoted countless hours of their time and energy over the years to \nhelping their community of Medina, and I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize some of their many achievements.\n  Since its inception, more than 210 different members have joined the \nMedina Lions Club. Today, there are 33 active members, including 2 who \nhelped found the club in 1946. Over the years, the club has raised \nenough money to provide college scholarships to 38 deserving local \nstudents and furnish local schools with cafeteria equipment, library \nbooks and furniture, and athletic and playground equipment. Many of the \nclub's successful fund raising drives have become yearly favorites \namong the residents of Gibson County, including a horse show, a \nminstrel show, and a ``haunted'' farm.\n  In addition to education projects, the club has used the money it \nraises to provide glasses and surgery for local residents, remodel and \nredecorate a civic center, erect a park pavilion, purchase equipment \nfor the local fire department, erect a community war memorial, purchase \nhospital equipment, and sponsor Little League baseball in Medina. As \nLittle League sponsors, the club members helped furnish lighting, \nfencing, and concessions equipment for the Little League ballpark. It \nis also saving money to help build a new city park, which will include \na walking track, football field, baseball field, fence lighting, and \npaved parking.\n  Mr. President, the members of the Medina Lions Club have a long \nhistory of giving back to their community. Their commitment has won the \nMedina club the Top Club in the State award twice, and the members have \nreceived numerous other individual awards. Mr. President, I would like \nto commend and thank every member--past and present--of the Medina \nLions Club for their commitment and their dedication. They have \nestablished a long record of service for others to follow, and I wish \nthem all the best as they celebrate the club's 50th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2836-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2836-S2837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CLETIS WAGAHOFF\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding public servant and my friend, Cletis Wagahoff. On March 31, \n1996, Cletis will retire from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after \nserving selflessly for nearly 27 years and after a total of 35 years of \nGovernment service.\n  Cletis Wagahoff has served as the deputy district engineer for \nProject Management in the corps' New Orleans District Office since \n1988. If the daily challenges of managing several of our Nation's \nlargest civil works projects were not enough to ask of someone Mr. \nPresident, the job of deputy district engineer also requires that \nCletis be the liaison for all congressional inquiries from the \nLouisiana Congressional Delegation. For this alone, he deserves our \ndeepest gratitude, not to mention a medal. In fact, Cletis was recently \nawarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award for his performance as a \nhighly skilled engineer and proven leader in his field.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with Cletis on many of Louisiana's \nnavigation, hurricane, and flood protection projects and have often \nsought his counsel and advice on critical problems like coastal erosion \nand protecting our valuable wetlands. His reputation as a consensus \nbuilder and a man of unwavering integrity is well known by Louisiana's \nelected officials and our community and business leaders.\n  Mr. President, Cletis Wagahoff and his wife, Betty, have given much \nto Louisiana and our great Nation during their many years of service, \nand for this we are eternally grateful. On behalf of the Louisiana \ncongressional Delegation and all Louisianians, we wish them every \nsuccess, good health, and much happiness as they turn the pages of life \nto begin a new chapter.\n\n[[Page S2837]]\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF JOHN E. CHRISTENSEN\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise at this time to recognize an \noutstanding citizen for the achievements and contributions he has made \nto the people of the State of Colorado. After a 30-year career in \neducation, John Christensen is retiring as principal of Greeley Central \nHigh School.\n  John Christensen, or ``JC'' as he is known, began his teaching career \nin 1964 at Carbondale Junior High School in Carbondale, CO. Over the \nnext three decades, he became one of the driving forces in Weld County \neducation. He taught mathematics, physical education, and biology. He \ncoached basketball, football, track, and baseball, and served as an \nathletic director and assistant principal before becoming principal of \nGreeley Central.\n  As a resident of Greeley, CO, I am aware of the contributions JC has \nmade to students and to the community. In addition to his classroom and \nadministrative responsibilities, his enthusiasm and dedication to \nstudents' extra-curricular programs led him to speech contests, musical \nconcerts, theater performances, athletic events and countless other \nstudent activities in the evenings and on weekends. During some of \nthose athletic events he was a fan; other times he was the coach. In \n1975, he coached Greeley West's AAA State Baseball Championship Team, a \ndemonstration of his commitment to hard work and excellence.\n  John Christensen's selfless dedication brought him richly deserved \nrecognition. In 1989, he was presented the International Thespian Award \nby International Thespian Society Troupe 657 for his support of theater \narts at Greeley Central. In 1990, he received the Administrator Award \nfrom the Colorado Music Educators' Association. He served as president \nof the Colorado High School Football Coaches Association and was \ninducted into the District 6 Coaches' Hall of Fame for his years of \nservice to youth as a football and baseball coach. He is past president \nof the Northern League Principals Association and continues to consult \nand speak at various leadership conferences across the country.\n  Greeley Central's Class of 1994 so greatly admired and respected John \nChristensen, their own principal, they chose him as their commencement \nspeaker. His leadership and integrity has affected students, parents, \nteachers, and fellow administrators. In 1995, he received the \nprestigious Governor's Award for Excellence in Education. Most \nimpressive of all is the new scholarship created in JC's name by \nGreeley Central's faculty. The John Christensen ``Pride, Class and \nDignity Award'' is to be given to a Greeley Central High School senior \nwho is active in student life, displays a distinguished academic \nrecord, and exemplifies outstanding leadership.\n  I have worked with numerous public officials and business leaders \nfrom across the country. There are few of the same high caliber as John \nChristensen. His integrity, enthusiasm, and dedication are unequaled. \nFor this, I thank him for his service and wish him and his family, \nJonna, JJ and Jill, the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2836-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A NEW INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIP\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, this week an historic agreement will \nbe signed here in Washington that I believe embodies the enduring \nspirit of international commerce and what could be the promoting future \nof the Baltic States.\n  On March 28, 1996, government officials from the Baltic country of \nEstonia will sit down with representatives from one of my constituents, \nNRG Energy, Inc., and pen a memorandum of understanding [MOU] that \ncould lead to NRG jointly owning, as well as managing and operating, \nthe major electric generation assets in Estonia.\n  The agreement is a further step forward for Estonia, which is rapidly \nprogressing into the global village. At the beginning of this decade, \nEstonia was one of the first nations to break from the old Soviet \nsphere of influence. Movement toward the West has been constant ever \nsince. In 1991, Estonia became a member of the United Nations and it \nwas welcomed into the World Bank in 1992. Today, the nation envisions \nitself as a member of the European Union and has submitted a formal \napplication for inclusion.\n  Estonia's coalition government, led by Prime Minister Tiit Vahi and \nForeign Minister Siim Kallas, has forged swiftly ahead in developing \nthe open markets necessary to bring the nation into the global economy. \nThese leaders should be commended for their foresight and resolve in \nmaking free trade a cornerstone of the country's impressive economic \nmaturity.\n  Mr. President, the Estonians should be praised for their steady \nprogress away from a command and control economy and toward free market \nprinciples. They share with a majority of Americans a strong belief \nthat most often the private sector can better conduct business than the \ngovernment.\n  Already the Estonian Government has privatized more than 377 of its \nenterprises. This includes the remarkable undertaking of privatizing \nand modernizing its entire telecommunications sector which was jointly \naccomplished with contributions from Swedish and Finnish interests.\n  Under the guidance of Arvo Niitenberg, former energy minister and \ncurrent Estonian Ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, \nthe most ambitious investment initiative to date is occurring in the \nelectricity sector. For this endeavor, the Estonians looked to American \nexpertise and know-how, and found these qualities in abundance with \nNRG. As a subsidiary of Northern States Power Company [NSP], a \nMinneapolis-based, multistate, investor-owned electric and gas utility, \nNRG has successfully brought the Minnesota penchant for hard work and a \nno-nonsense approach to international power projects in Australia and \nthe former East Germany.\n  No doubt, NRG's success around the globe will once again evidence \nitself in Estonia. The project entails an investment of up to $250 \nmillion by NRG for environmental upgrades and plant life extension in \nthe Estonian electric company and NRG's management and operation of \nthree powerplants totaling more than 3,000 megawatts through a stock \ncompany jointly owned with the Estonians. This represents almost the \nentirety of Estonia's power production in what is sure to be a win-win \npartnership in which NRG will apply its extensive and renowned \nexpertise in emission reductions and operation of world class \npowerplants for the growing Estonian economy.\n  Mr. President, the MOU to be signed this week is the consummation of \nan important partnership not only between NRG and the Estonians, but \nalso between Estonia and the United States. I welcome the partnership \nbeing established March 28 at the State Department as not only the \nteaming of a nation with a company, but also the commencement of a \nlasting relationship between two nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/25/senate-section/article/S2837-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2837-S2838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n   Mr. DOMENICI.
