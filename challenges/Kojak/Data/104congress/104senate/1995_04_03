Mr. President, for those who have followed NCAA \nbasketball this year, not only through the sports pages and TV and \nradio coverage, but through the statements of various Members of this \nChamber, I did not want to disappoint my colleagues by not rushing to \nthe floor this morning to express my pride at the extraordinary victory \nof the University of Connecticut women's basketball team in defeating \nTennessee yesterday and claiming the national championship.\n  Mr. President, there is a part of me that wants to do a Dick Vitale \nimpersonation here on the floor--raise the voice, shake the hands--but \nI am going to abide by the rules of appropriate discourse, at least in \nthis Chamber, and simply say with quiet pride what a great season this \nhas been for this University of Connecticut women's basketball team.\n  How much they have taught us, not just in the fact that they had an \nundefeated season, which makes them only the second women's team in \nNCAA history to finish a championship season undefeated; not just that \nthey won the championship yesterday against a very formidable Tennessee \nteam, but for all they have done for our State of Connecticut to make \nus proud, to make us feel a little bigger than we normally feel in a \nrelatively small State, not only helping us through the winter and \nraising our sights as we come out of the recession, but reminding us \nwhat sports is all about.\n  Women's basketball at the collegiate level has reached the big time. \nIt has not, obviously, at the professional level, and in some ways \nbecause of that inequity, this sport remains as pure as sport was meant \nto be. And in the midst of strikes and contract disputes in other \nsports, in the midst of extraordinary competition for enormous salaries \nand promotional contracts, it is great to see a sport, and in this \ncase, to focus in on this team of UConn Huskies, that plays the game \nfor the \n[[Page S5026]] love of the sport and for the devotion that they have to \none another and to their coach.\n  These are true scholar-athletes. The All American Player of the Year, \nRebecca Lobo, has an extraordinary average, was considered for a Rhodes \nscholarship, and can make a contribution in whatever she has done.\n  This team taught us something else about teamwork. Some of the other \nsports which we watch are focused on not only the extraordinary \naccomplishment of the performers, but the enormous egos of the \nathletes. Rebecca Lobo was criticized a while ago gently by her coach \nfor being too selfless, for not shooting the ball enough, for being too \nfocused on team play. And she still managed, in spite of all that, to \nbe there yesterday at the critical moments to help turn the game \naround, and in the last 2 minutes, to take this team ahead.\n  So, UConn Huskies women, your coach Geno Auriemma, we thank you from \nthe bottom of our hearts for bringing the championship back to \nConnecticut. And we thank you, too, for reminding us what American \nsports was meant to be, has traditionally been, and what you have made \nit again in our time.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to explain \nat least my understanding of where we are in terms of Senate procedure.\n  I think the majority leader and the minority leader will come to the \nfloor shortly and propound a consent request which I will certainly \nsupport. I urge my colleagues to also support it so that we will have a \nfinal resolution and disposition of the conference report. We will do \nthat sometime this afternoon in a way that accommodates the greatest \nnumber of Members. And I have every intention of supporting the \nconference report. I had that intention last week, and I have that \nintention today. I hope the Members do as well. It is a very important \nmeasure which means a great deal to the self-employed and small \nbusinesses across the country, as it does provide protection for those \nwho are purchasing health insurance. It makes sense to give the self-\nemployed some help and assistance in recognition of the pressures they \nare under in terms of health care.\n  As I had mentioned over the course of last week, it was never my \nintention not to proceed to that particular program. Rather, I wanted \nto draw the attention of the Senate to changes which took place in the \nlegislation from the time that it passed the Senate, when it included a \nprovision to close what has grown into a sizable tax loophole. That \nloophole would permit some of the wealthiest individuals in this \ncountry, by renouncing their citizenship, to escape the financial \nresponsibilities for accumulation of significant amounts of wealth in \nthis country.\n  The fact remains there were provisions already in existence in the \nTax Code to try and capture that accumulation of wealth, but it had not \nbeen effective. Through the work of the Senator from New Jersey, \nSenator Bradley, an amendment was offered to address that very sizable \nloophole in which individuals could become Benedict Arnolds by \nrenouncing their American citizenship and walking off with hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in accumulated wealth, and then taking up residency \nin Belize or the Cayman Islands or other places around the world, and \navoid their participation in ensuring that this country is going to \nremain free.\n  This is an extremely offensive loophole. I think all of us commended \nthe Senate Finance Committee in eliminating the loophole. It was only \nin the few hours prior to the time that we were requested to take \naction on the conference report that it was brought to our attention \nthat the loophole which was closed by the Senate had effectively been \nreopened by our House colleagues, and that the $3.6 billion that would \nhave been recaptured over 10 years was effectively lost. Not only \nmyself but my other colleagues were so troubled by that action that we \nwanted to at least have an opportunity to present to the Senate, at the \ntime when we were going to accept the conference report, a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution that would indicate not just other Members' \ndesire to close that loophole, but also reflect the totality of our \nsupport for that action.\n  As I said last week, I do not doubt the sincerity of the members of \nthe Finance Committee when they said that they would address that issue \ndown the road. But we have seen at other times that what really speaks \nthe strongest is when you have a unanimous vote. I believe that this \nwould win a unanimous vote and certainly should win a unanimous vote of \nthe Members--Republicans and Democrats alike. It is absolutely \noutrageous and unacceptable to permit the plundering of the Treasury by \nselfish individuals who refuse to be part of our American system.\n  Mr. President, I was reminded last week that, under the Senate rules, \nthe sense-of-the-Senate resolution would not be appropriate on a \nconference report because of Senate rules. I think if there ever was a \nlegitimate reason for an exception to overturn a ruling of the Chair \nthis would be one so that the Senate could go on record as to what the \nreal sentiment of the Members would be on this particular issue.\n  Nevertheless, I had tried to see if we could not work out at least an \nopportunity to vote on the sense-of-the-Senate resolution as a separate \nmatter, hopefully prior to the time that we pass the conference report \nor at a time related to the conference report, because it makes a great \ndeal of common sense.\n  The conference report is the instrument by which this matter was \nconsidered. It would be appropriate to consider a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution at the time of its acceptance or shortly thereafter.\n  The majority leader has laid down the cloture motion, which, as I \nmentioned, I expect will be vitiated with the understanding that we \nwill vote later in the afternoon. I certainly will support that. We \nwill have an opportunity prior to the time of the vote to review where \nwe are in terms of the conference report and also where we are in the \nSenate debate on priorities. Because that is really the issue--the \npriorities being reflected in the rescission proposal of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  During the course of the presentation by the chairman and the ranking \nminority member of the Appropriations Committee, they have outlined the \nareas where there are going to be rescissions.\n  In response to that outline, the minority leader, Senator Daschle, in \nconsultation with a number of Members on our side, had proposed an \namendment to cancel rescissions totaling $1.3 billion in the areas \nwhich are reflected in the chart here and which we have spoken of last \nweek--the restoration of the AmeriCorps, drug free schools, title I \neducation programs, Goals 2000, Head Start, the WIC program, school-to-\nwork, child care, and also some housing and health training programs.\n  Mr. President, just to go back a step, many of us were under the \nimpression that this matter was to be debated on the floor of the \nSenate on Wednesday or Thursday of last week. It reflected a principal \nopportunity for the Senate to reflect on how important these programs \nare for children and parents, and how we believe that the cuts in the \nrescission package were too deep. We wanted an opportunity to debate \nthose cuts versus other cuts.\n   [[Page S5027]] I respect the rights and the priorities that are \nbeing reflected in the second-degree amendment to the minority leader's \namendment. We ought to have an opportunity for an exchange on that.\n  But, generally speaking in this institution, when the majority leader \nor the minority leader offers a proposal, we have an opportunity for a \nfull and complete presentation of the amendment and the reasons for and \nagainst it.\n  We were in a situation where many of us thought the proposal would be \nconsidered last Thursday. Then, the Senator from New York, as is his \nright, sought and received recognition and offered his amendment on the \nMexican loan issue. The Senate had a good debate on that particular \nmeasure. We did not conclude until late Thursday evening to at least \nreach a procedure by which that matter would be considered at a later \ntime.\n  Then I was in the well on Thursday evening when the majority leader \nasked the minority leader, ``Will we be able to consider your amendment \nand perhaps dispose of it as early as 1 o'clock on Friday so that \npeople can meet their schedules?''\n  Although there was not a firm time agreement, I think those of us who \nwere the sponsors thought we could take that matter up at 10 o'clock \nthe next morning, then have a good chance to debate and vote on the \namendment of the Senator from South Dakota, which would certainly have \nbeen appropriate.\n  So the amendment was offered, and there were short speeches on it. \nThen, within just a matter of minutes, an amendment in the second \ndegree was offered. Many of us who had thought we would have time to \nhave a debate on children and education were at least temporarily \nforeclosed from being able to make that presentation.\n  Then, at the noon hour, when some of us were still here, we were \nasked, at a moment's notice, for a consent agreement to not only \nproceed to the self-employed conference report, but also for immediate \nadoption of that.\n  That conference report, as I just referred to, was different from the \nmeasure that actually passed the Senate. The Senate measure would have \nprovided $3.6 billion in additional revenues, and that particular \nloophole in the bill would have benefited a dozen or so American \ncitizens who renounce their citizenship for tax purposes. The cost \nwould be $3.6 billion over a period of 10 years, and we were asked to \ngo ahead and agree to it.\n  There were questions, Mr. President, that should have been responded \nto. I appreciated the responses given by the Senator from Oregon on \nthose issues raised in the conference.\n  Nevertheless, it seemed to me, if we were going to consider that \nmeasure in the conference report, we ought to have had at least been \ngiven an opportunity to resolve it with a very brief discussion before \ncoming back to the Daschle amendment.\n  We were not permitted to do so, and so here we are this afternoon \nwith the prospect of voting on the conference report and then the \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Mr. President, this issue becomes all the more significant when you \nlook at the Daschle amendment, which invests $1.34 billion on programs \nprimarily focused on children and their education.\n  This measure regarding the expatriation tax break, however, is $3.6 \nbillion. It is interesting that our total return for reinvestment in \nchildren is only $1.3 billion. It is a pretty interesting \njuxtaposition. Many of us are saying, look, if we can be so sensitive \nto the handful of multi-multimillionaires to give them a tax break of \n$3.6 billion, then we ought to be able to at least say that the $1.3 \nbillion devoted to children for the Head Start Program and the WIC \nNutrition Program is a higher priority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The time \nexpires at 12 noon.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will just take 2 minutes. I ask unanimous consent for \n2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in terms of where we stand, I think this \nchart clearly juxtaposes what the issues are.\n  I believe that the overwhelming majority of all Americans believe \nthat if we are going to give a tax benefit of $3.6 billion, we ought to \nbe able to at least try to do something about children, Head Start, the \nWomen, Infants, and Children Nutrition Program, the School-to-Work \nProgram, the Child Care Program, on the basis of importance and need. \nWe will have an opportunity to address that later in the afternoon. I \nlook forward to participating in that debate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. What is the order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The morning business lasts until the hour of \n12 noon.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. And at 12 noon, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture vote is to occur under the order.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Cloture vote is under the order at 12 noon. Mr. \nPresident, so we have how much more time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have approximately 4 minutes before 12 \nnoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5026-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, 4 minutes is not a lot of time, but let \nme just rise to support the powerful words of my colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  We are talking about capital gains over $600,000, that is the only \nreal tax we are talking about. And we are talking about expatriates \nwith incomes over $5 million. We are just simply saying that if you are \ngoing to be making these gains over $600,000 a year and you are going \nto renounce your citizenship as a tax dodge, then, in fact, you are \ngoing to have to pay above and beyond that $600,000.\n  It just seems to me that that does meet some standard of fairness, \nand my colleague has pointed out the juxtaposition of these proposed \ncuts in drug-free schools, the Women, Infants, and Children Program, \nthe Head Start Program, Child Care Program.\n  Mr. President, I have been on the floor over and over and over again \nwith an amendment that speaks to the concerns and circumstances of \nchildren's lives. If we are going to be talking about cuts that \ndramatically affect the quality of life for children in America, quite \noften the most vulnerable citizens, and at the same time we are going \nto be talking about trying to let this kind of tax dodge go through, I \njust think that people in the country ought to understand what, in \nfact, really is going on.\n  I do not think anybody intended to filibuster. None of us did. So it \nwill be an overwhelming cloture vote. I do not think there is any \nquestion about that. But I do think that a little bit of sunshine is \nimportant, and I do think people in the country do need to understand \nthe significance of what the Senator from Massachusetts has had to say.\n  I think the significance of it--and we will have time this week as we \nget into what I think is a real important debate for the country--has \nto do with priorities. What in the world are we doing enabling people \nto have this huge tax dodge that really runs up into the billions of \ndollars for people who make over $5 million and, at the same time that \nwe have this tax dodge going on, we are willing to be so generous with \nall too often the suffering of children in this country.\n  That seems a little bit like just a speech on the floor. I probably \nhave less than 20 seconds now, but we are going to have a debate on all \nof these programs. When the language, I say to my colleague from \nMassachusetts, is programs, it seems abstract. But we are going to talk \nabout what all this means in personal terms, in human terms to our \ncommunities, working families, and children. That will be the debate \nthat we will get to. I look forward to that debate.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5027-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n     ROBERTA DOERING--NEW PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL SCHOOL BOARDS \n                              ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to Roberta Doering of Agawam, MA, who today \nbecomes president of the National School Boards Association [NSBA]. \nRoberta has served as a member of the Agawam School Committee for 25 \nyears and has been active in both the State and national school board \nassociations for many of those years. She was elected to the executive \ncommittee of the national organization in 1991 and now assumes the role \nof president.\n  Her unwavering commitment to the welfare of the Nation's youth is \ndemonstrated in her work with the schools and in other areas of service \nas well. She served for over 20 years on the board of directors of the \nMetropolitan Springfield YMCA and was the first woman president of that \norganization. She has also served on the board of trustees of the \nSpringfield Library and Museum Association, and on the board of \ntrustees of the Baystate Medical Center.\n  Roberta Doering deserves great credit for her service to education. \nLike so many dedicated citizens who serve on thousands of local school \ncommittees and boards across the country, she entered the arena because \nof her interest in children. She recognized the participation by \ncitizens at the local level is vital if we are to assure quality \neducational programs for children and youth.\n  As she became knowledgeable about the Agawam system, she saw the need \nto do more. She explored what other communities were doing in the \nState, and what lessons from their experience could be applied to \nimprove the schools in her own community. As a natural extension of her \nability and interests, she became active in national education issues. \nHer path to the presidency reflects what so many of us in Congress \nunderstand. An active partnership among local, State, and national \ngoals is vital to achieve educational excellence.\n  Roberta is clearly making a difference, and I commend her for her \ncommitment as she begins her service as president of the National \nSchool Boards Association. I share the pride of the people of Agawam \nand Massachusetts that she will be serving all the Nation's children, \nand I wish her success in this important new undertaking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5028-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, a popular trend among the liberal elements \nof the news media today is their assertions that efforts to rid the \ncurrent welfare system of waste and inefficiency are heartless and \ncruel. Aside from being untrue, such statements ignore the \nextraordinary things that are going on in America today. For example, \nthe story of Mrs. Carol Porter, cofounder of Kid-Care, Inc., a \nnonprofit organization that feeds needy children in Houston, TX. I was \nreminded of Mrs. Porter and her family's efforts on behalf of Houston's \nhungry children when I read a March 20 People magazine article, headed \n``Mother of Them All.''\n  Mr. President, I have met with the remarkable Carol Porter on several \noccasions, the first of which was in October 1993 when she visited \nWashington to receive an award for the very work detailed in the People \nmagazine article. Senators and staff members would be impressed, as I \nam, if they could spend just a few brief minutes with this wonderful \nlady and her husband.\n  Why? Two reasons come to mind:\n  The first is her totally unselfish attitude which puts the needs of \nothers before her own. It began when Carol Porter was driving through \nHouston during the Christmas season of 1989. By chance she happened \nupon a group of youngsters eating out of a fast-food dumpster. It was \nthen that she and her husband decided to operate a feeding program from \ntheir three-bedroom home.\n  Today, Porter and the volunteers at Kid-Care deliver 500 free meals \nto Houston's poor neighborhoods. Plans are underway to move into a \nfacility enabling them to produce 4,000 meals a day, without 1 cent of \nsupport or subsidy from the U.S. Government.\n  My second thought: As the U.S. Senate prepares to debate various \nfacets of the House-passed welfare-reform proposal, Senators should \nkeep in mind Mrs. Porter's admonition when she was asked about \nGovernment assistance. Mrs. Porter said, ``I'm against people saying, \n`Let the Government do it.' I say it's time for Americans to feed \nAmericans.''\n  Mrs. Porter's message to all of us is both needed and refreshingly \nclear: The Government cannot do it all, nor can it afford to. But the \nneeds of others can be met if each of us does our part.\n  Mr. President, I do hope my colleagues will have time to read the \narticle describing an extraordinary lady doing an extraordinary work. I \nask unanimous consent that the March 20, 1995, People magazine article, \n``Mother of Them All,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                 [From People magazine, Mar. 20, 1995]\n\nMother of Them All: Carol Porter Feeds Poor Kids in Houston--Without a \n                        Cent From the Government\n\n       The white van squeals to a stop in the loose gravel of a \n     dilapidated mobile-home park in Houston. The driver blasts \n     the horn five times, and children come running from every \n     direction. One little boy in a blue sweatsuit races back from \n     the van to his mother, excitedly waving a lunch bag over his \n     head. He knows the sack contains a plain turkey sandwich, an \n     apple, a granola bar and some juice. But he couldn't be \n     happier with a bag of Halloween candy.\n       ``How excited would you be if you hadn't eaten since we \n     were here yesterday?'' asks Carol Porter, 50, co-founder of \n     Kid-Care, Inc., a nonprofit group that helps feed some of \n     Houston's neediest children. ``It's better than ice cream to \n     these kids. It's hope.''\n       Porter and Kid-Care's corps of up to 25 volunteers deliver \n     500 free meals each day to children in one of Houston's \n     poorest neighborhoods. Every morsel is prepared by volunteers \n     in Porter's cramped North Houston home, where extra stoves \n     and refrigerators are shoe-horned into what used to be the \n     family's living room and den. Remarkably, Kid-Care accepts no \n     public funding. ``I'm against people saying, `Let the \n     government do it,''' says Porter. ``I say it's time for \n     Americans to feed Americans.''\n       Carol Porter, a registered nurse, and her husband, Hurt, \n     52, a former radio announcer--they have a son, Hurt III, 20, \n     and a daughter, Jamilhah, 10--might serve as a poster couple \n     for the Contract with America. They are black Republicans who \n     are dead set against welfare in its current form. ``I get a \n     lot of flak from black folks,'' says Carol Porter. ``But I'm \n     basing my belief structure on what I know. And I know we need \n     welfare reform with compassion.''\n       ``I think we should do more to encourage self-reliance, and \n     that's what the Porters are doing,'' says Texas Senator Kay \n     Bailey Hutchinson.\n       Compassion is something the Porters learned from their \n     parents. Carol, in fact, credits her late mother, Lula Doe, \n     with planting the idea for Kid-Care. It was Lula who, in \n     1984, persuaded a local supermarket not to discard its \n     blemished produce but to let her distribute it to the poor.\n\n[[Page S5029]]\n\n       The Kid-Care idea began to take shape at Christmas 1989, \n     when Carol came on a group of children eating out of a \n     McDonalds' dumpster. ``I saw Third World conditions a stone's \n     throw from where I live,'' she says. Two years later, Kid-\n     Care was created as a non-profit organization.\n       These days, the Porter's three-bedroom bungalow is hemmed \n     in by Kid-Care vehicles. Industrial-size cans of beans, \n     tomatoes, corn and spaghetti sauce line shelves tacked up in \n     the family room. Bags of disposable diapers, bulk rice and \n     dozens of loaves of bread are stacked alongside. in the \n     center of the room is a banquet table, where the sandwiches \n     are prepared in a huge assembly line. In the next room, a \n     magnet stuck to one of four refrigerators reads, ``Carol's \n     Kitchen.'' ``Hah!'' snorts Carol. ``This hasn't been my \n     kitchen in years.''\n       Until late last year, Kid-Care provided not only brown-bag \n     lunches but also hot meals. That was when the Houston health \n     department forced the Porters to suspend cooking operations \n     until certain code violations were remedied. That problem \n     should be solved by May, When the Porters hope to move kid-\n     Care into its newly acquired 11,500-square-foot building \n     equipped to produce 4,000 hot meals a day. That is, of \n     course, if they can increase their funding. Carol Porter's \n     tireless fund-raising has given Kid-Care high visibility \n     among corporations--Quaker Oats and long-distance company \n     Heartline Communications are sponsors--but most of the \n     current annual budget of $500,000 comes from individual \n     donations. The couple supplements Hurt's $2,000-a-month \n     stipend from Kid-Care with a contract to oversee Houston-area \n     daycare providers for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \n     Hurt III earns $1,000 a month managing Kid-Care's \n     transportation.\n       Carol, whose dream is to seed Kid-Care groups across the \n     country, draws no salary. ``People ask me what's in it for \n     me,'' she says. ``And I tell them to go the route with me and \n     see my kids' faces. That's what's in it for me.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5028-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, I am holding up in my hands the front page \nof today's Hartford Courant, which reads ``Perfect.'' It shows a \nphotograph of the University of Connecticut women's basketball team and \nthe score of the game, 70 to 64, over Tennessee.\n  Mr. President, you will certainly appreciate the fact that there is a \ncertain \n[[Page S5030]] amount of local pride in the Nutmeg State this morning. \nThe women's basketball team completed their tremendous season, 35 and \n0. It is the best record ever compiled by a men's or women's basketball \nteam, culminating in the NCAA title against Tennessee. The other team \nthat went undefeated, 34 and 0, was the University of Texas in 1986.\n  What makes this team unique is the intellectual as well as the \nathletic ability of its players. The star player--I am hesitant to use \nthe word--Rebecca Lobo, was chosen first team All American and first \nteam Academic All American the last 2 years. She is a candidate for a \nRhodes scholarship and winner of every Player of the Year Award this \nseason. She has compiled a 4.0 grade point average during her last 2 \nyears at the University of Connecticut and is the No. 1 women's \nbasketball player in the United States.\n  She is joined on that remarkable team that won the championship game \nyesterday by Jennifer Rizzotti, Kara Wolters, Jamelle Elliott, Pam \nWebber, Nakisha Sales and many other talented players. Rebecca Lobo, \nJennifer Rizzotti, Kara Wolters, and Jamelle Elliott were named to the \nall-tournament team. It is the first time that four players from one \nteam were named to that honor.\n  Mr. President, today is a day of great pride in the State of \nConnecticut because of the accomplishment of this great team.\n  I wish to pay a special tribute to Geno Auriemma, the head coach of \nthe team, who did a remarkable job this season, and to the fans. You \ncould not get a seat in Gampel Pavilion this year; they sold out every \nsingle game.\n  Mr. President, I am going to include in the Record as well, a couple \nof side-bar stories that go to the heart of a few other issues. The \nstories are about young women in the State of Connecticut, 9-, 10-, 12-\nyear-olds, who were watching this team during the last year and who \nhave become tremendous fans. It goes to the issue of title IX and the \nsuccess of a program, a women's program, a basketball program. Just a \nfew years ago you probably would have found only a handful of people \nwatching a women's basketball game, not only at the University of \nConnecticut but all around the country. And today, as I mentioned a \nmoment ago, there are sell-out audiences, sell-out crowds. This is a \ngreat tribute to title IX and those who fought so very hard for that \nprogram.\n  We are very proud in Connecticut today. We have always had to export \nour team allegiances to either the Boston Red Sox, the New York Knicks, \nthe Mets, or others. Lately, we have had a hockey team which has not \ndone terribly well, but now there is deep pride over this remarkable \nteam that did a fantastic job in their quest for a national \nchampionship.\n  I join my colleague, Senator Lieberman, who I know spoke already, in \ncongratulating all the people involved in this great season.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I would like to offer my congratulations \nas well to the women's team at the University of Connecticut, and I \nwould like to call attention to a quote by its star player, Rebecca \nLobo, in this morning's Washington Post. When she was asked what the \nvictory meant to her, she said:\n\n       This is just a picture-perfect way for someone to end their \n     career. We are undefeated, we won a national championship and \n     I did it with people I love.\n\n  Mr. President, that openness is remarkable and should be applauded, \nand it correctly captures the feeling among members of a 35 and 0 team \nthat wins a championship, and that is true both of a men's team that \nwould win a championship and a women's team that wins a championship. \nMy hope is that someday when a men's team wins a championship, the star \nplayer can say those exact words and feel as comfortable saying them as \nRebecca Lobo did yesterday.\n  I congratulate Connecticut for this tremendous accomplishment and \nRebecca Lobo for her courage and leadership in difficult times in her \nown family situation, because of her mother having breast cancer, and \nalso because of her determination that was shown every day that she \nwent out onto the court with her teammates.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for \nthose comments. She is a remarkable young woman on a remarkable team, \nand the joy of watching them win was only exceeded by their joy in \nwinning. There are no NBA careers in front of them. There are no six-\nfigure, seven-figure salaries awaiting these young women--just the joy \nof playing the game, the joy of victory and the joy of doing it \ntogether. It needs to be heralded. It needs to be highlighted. We need \nto get back to that very spirit of amateur sports.\n  I congratulate as well the team from Tennessee. Tennessee has won \nseveral national championships in the women's basketball division. They \nlost to Connecticut yesterday, but they are a great team and a great \nchampion as well. I just know we are going to see more and more of \nthem. I think it is a wonderful thing in America to be able to watch \nyoung women get the kind of attention they did.\n  By the way, the President called the coach yesterday. It is the first \ntime a President has ever called an NCAA women's champion after the \ntitle game. I congratulate and thank President Clinton for making that \ncall to the Connecticut women's basketball team.\n  They went down to the White House last year and could not get in. \nThere was a long line. They were here in the office and met with \nSenator Lieberman and me, but they had to go back to their schedule and \npractice, so they could not get in to the White House. Yesterday, the \ncoach asked the President if this time they might be able to come \nthrough the front door of the White House. The President extended an \ninvitation to them to visit, and it is going to be a pleasure to go \nthere with them and have them walk in the front door of the White House \nas the national champions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I wish to say to the Senator from Connecticut that I \nshare his pride in those young women. And certainly, as a woman who \ndoes not quite make 5 feet tall, I am particularly awed by these women \nand their skill. We still have UCLA, as you know, Mr. President, going \ntoward a championship, we hope. But I really have to say to the \nSenator, it made me feel so good to watch these young women.\n  I do hope someday they have more of a future. If they can sink the \nball in the basket with the best of them, they ought to have a chance. \nThat is a subject for another day and another time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5029-5", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5030-S5047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SELF-EMPLOYED HEALTH INSURANCE ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to now take the floor to thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts for what he has done by bringing forward \nsuch an important issue really, not only to the Senate but to the \npeople of the United States of America.\n  We are going to see on Friday, I say to my friend, a big celebration \non the steps of the Capitol. Those Republicans who signed the Contract \nWith America are going to be celebrating and saying how great it is \nthat they passed a number of those provisions.\n  Well, I think what the Senator from Massachusetts is pointing out is \nthat there are more people than just those Republicans who are going to \nbe celebrating; some of those people are going to be the millionaires \nand the billionaires who got away with it again, who again got away \nwith what I call tax murder. I actually call them tax traitors, because \nwhat they do is they make a lot of money in this country, millions and \nhundreds of millions, sometimes billions, and then they renounce their \ncitizenship to escape any kind of State taxes. I think that is \nunpatriotic. I think it is in many ways acting like a traitor to this \nNation.\n  This Senate, on a very clear vote, said let us end that kind of tax \nloophole. The Senator from Massachusetts was completely struck, as was \nI and others in this Chamber, when the tax \n[[Page S5031]] bill came back from the other Chamber, from the \nRepublicans in the House who are so proud of their contract. And guess \nwhat? That tax loophole was not closed.\n  So on Friday, when the Republicans are celebrating their contract, \nthere will be a celebration in a lot of places across this great land, \nwhere people will be saying, ``Oh, thank goodness, I still have that \nkind of a loophole.''\n  All the Senator from Massachusetts was asking us to do on Friday was \nto go on record, because it is too late to change that conference \nreport. We do not want to hold it up. It does some other very important \nthings, and we care about the small businesses and the farmers who are \nconcerned about their tax deductibility for their health care, which is \nin that bill.\n  All the Senator from Massachusetts was asking was for a simple sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution so the Senate could go on record and say we \nare not turning our back on fixing this problem. We stand for average \npeople in this Senate Chamber. And we are going to fix this problem and \nwe are going to stop this tax loophole for the millionaires and \nbillionaires who would renounce their citizenship in America to get \naway with having to pay their fair share of the taxes.\n  And guess what happened? The Republican leadership said, ``No way. We \nare not going to have that vote.''\n  Well, I hope some agreement can be reached--and I tell my friend that \nI stand with him--so that at some point in the near future we will have \nthat vote so that people in this country will understand that the U.S. \nSenate is not changing its mind on fixing this loophole.\n  I also want to thank the Senator from Massachusetts and the \nDemocratic leader, Tom Daschle, for bringing forward an amendment that \nI think is a very important amendment to the supplemental \nappropriations bill that is before this Senate.\n  The chart that the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, has \nput together shows what would be restored by our Democratic leader's \namendment.\n  If ever you wanted to know the difference between Democrats and \nRepublicans, here is your chance. Mean-spirited, unnecessary cuts put \nforward in an appropriations bill, a rescissions bill; unnecessary.\n  For AmeriCorps, the Daschle amendment will restore $210 million. I \nask my friend from Massachusetts, is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  (Mr. JEFFORDS assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wish to engage my friend in a colloquy.\n  I had a wonderful experience visiting an AmeriCorps Program in Los \nAngeles. I want to tell my friend that the Americorps volunteer--and by \nthe way, our Republican friends say: They are not volunteers. They get \na stipend. They get money for their education. They are not volunteers.\n  Well, I say to my friend, could these people do this work without a \nstipend? Could they live? Could they give of themselves and back to \ncommunity if they did not have the stipend? Did not the people in the \nPeace Corps, I say to my friend, have a way to live while they gave \ntheir service?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could answer my friend, the Senator from \nCalifornia. She is putting her finger on a very important point, which \nis that voluntarism should not be just a luxury for the wealthiest \nindividuals. There are many young people with limited resources that \nwant to have an opportunity to give something back to their \ncommunities. We see that time after time.\n  What we are basically saying to those young Americans is: if you are \nprepared to give something back to your community, you will also have a \nstipend, which is effectively a minimum wage, to be able to live. You \nwill also be able to get the equivalent of a year's down payment on \nyour tuition at a State university to continue your education.\n  I like to think that part of our Nation's value system is to try and \nencourage young people to be involved in a selfless way, to give \nsomething back to their community and, second, to encourage people to \nmove ahead in terms of their education.\n  Finally, let me say to my friend, the Senator from California, that \nwe effectively had an agreement here in the United States Senate when \nwe passed the national service program. We are going to have $300 \nmillion in the first year, $500 million in the second, and $700 million \nin the third. We had very strong bipartisan support for that \ncommitment. I think there was only a handful of Senators that voted \nagainst it. Now we have established a service program where young \npeople have been recruited on the basis of an agreement and \nunderstanding that was reflected in the bipartisan effort.\n  The AmeriCorps Program, however, was targeted for a 75-percent \nreduction, more than any other single program. And I do not think that \nit is a coincidence that it happened to be a top priority of President \nClinton's--one that he spoke about during the course of his campaign. \nHe stated that it was one of his greatest initiatives and he spent a \ngreat deal of his own personal time and involvement to see that it \nbecame a reality. I can just say, from a personal point of view, each \ntime he comes to Boston, he meets with these young Americorps \nvolunteers and continues to inspire them, as he does others who are \ninvolved in voluntary programs.\n  These cuts are effectively taking the rug right out from underneath \nthese volunteers. All we are saying to our colleagues is not to go back \non your word to these young people. And that is what this amendment is \nall about.\n  Maybe next year, we are going to have to fight to try and get what \nresources are available for that program.\n  But are we now saying to the young people in the AmeriCorps Program \nwho are committed to making a contribution to their communities that \nthe rug is pulled out from underneath them?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend, because I have to say \nthat I did notice broad support for this when it came up. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts certainly worked on it, as chairman of the committee \nat that time. Very few spoke out against it.\n  It is hard for me to believe, as the Senator has pointed out, that \nthis is not some kind of political attack. Because President Clinton \nsaid during his campaign, just as the Peace Corps, which sent our young \npeople abroad, was so effective in helping people abroad, let us have \nthat in America where we have problems in our schools, where we have \nproblems in our nursing homes, where these young people can give \nsomething back and have a sense of community and of giving back.\n  And so the Daschle amendment, as my friend points out, will restore \nthis funding.\n  I will tell you one story about my visit to a school in Los Angeles, \nwhere I meet with an AmeriCorps volunteer and some of the students in a \npretty tough school. This school is made up of kids who were basically \nfirst-generation Americans. Their parents work in the garment district \nin Los Angeles in very, very tough conditions, minimum wage conditions.\n  And, of course, that is another issue, I say to Senator Kennedy, that \nhe has lead the fight on. We have opposition from the Republicans, \nunanimously. God forbid we should raise the minimum wage, which is at a \n40-year low in terms of purchasing power.\n  And they say, ``Oh, it helps get teenagers into the job market.'' \nMost of the people on minimum wage, as the Senator knows, are adults. \nThey use that money to live on and try to provide for their families. \nThat is another issue. But it all fits into the same pattern, I say to \nmy friend.\n  Very quickly, they did away with closing a tax loophole that helps \nthe billionaires; just dropped it right out of the conference. But with \na lot of forethought and talk about the deficit, and a lot of time to \nconcentrate, they cut money for young people, for their hopes, for \ntheir dreams, for their future.\n  And they say they care about the deficit. Not one of them voted for \nthe $500 billion deficit reduction that every Democrat took a risk and \nwent down to that well and voted for. And we have had the biggest \ndeficit reduction in our history. We have had 3 years of declining \ndeficits, and the smallest work force since John Kennedy with a \nDemocratic Congress.\n  We did not take a meat ax to these programs, I say to my friend. We \ntook a scalpel.\n   [[Page S5032]] We closed loopholes. We said to the wealthiest in \nthis country--those over $200,000--you may have to pay a little more. \nOver on the House side with their contract, they want to give a \ncontract to those who earn $200,000 a year.\n  When I went to the school, I say to my friend, I met a little child \nwho was shot in a drive-by shooting, and an AmeriCorps volunteer went \nto see him in the hospital every single day and turned that child's \nlife around. This is a living, breathing human being, first-generation \nAmerican who now believes in this country.\n  I say to my friend, they say that sometimes children ask the best \nquestions. Do you know what some of those kids talked to me about, the \nones who were afraid of losing their school lunch program? Here is what \nthey said:\n  ``Who gets the money if you cut us out of the program?''\n  I could not believe they asked that question.\n  ``Who gets the money, Senator, if I do not get my lunch?''\n  And I have to tell them, ``The Republicans want to give a tax break \nto the wealthiest people in this land, and I won't let them do that and \ntake food out of your mouth.''\n  I do not care if I am saying something popular or unpopular, but I am \ngoing to stand on this floor with my friend until hell freezes over \nbefore that happens in this U.S. Senate.\n  I see that my friend has put another chart up here. I ask him to \nexplain it, if he would do that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to. I had not anticipated we would be \ndebating this issue at this time, but I think perhaps it is \nappropriate.\n  This is a chart showing that the top 12 percent of taxpayers get more \nthan half of the tax benefits in the Republican plan. More than 50 \npercent of the tax benefits would go to those individuals who earn over \n$100,000.\n  I think this makes the point that the Senator has been talking about. \nWhat we are faced with in these rescissions is the cutbacks in the \nvarious programs which have been identified by the Senator from \nCalifornia--in AmeriCorps and drug-free schools. We had a very \nimportant and eloquent debate on the problems of violence in our \nschools and how we are going to deal with it.\n  Other programs targeted for cutbacks include:\n  The chapter 1 program, which was completely revamped in the last \nCongress, again, with strong bipartisan support. If the Senate \nrescissions stand, 70,000 children across the country will not be \nparticipating in these programs which try to assist young people that \ncome from economically disadvantaged communities.\n  Goals 2000--this cut will result in 1,300 school districts not \nparticipating in education reform programs.\n  The Head Start programs, which have been tried, tested, and \nreevaluated.\n  The WIC nutrition program, school-to-work, child care, and the list \ngoes on and on.\n  These cuts, as the Senator has talked about, are going to be used for \nthe House Republican tax cut, which will go to the top 51 percent of \nthe taxpayers.\n  That is fundamentally wrong, as the Senator from California \nunderstands. I do not believe that that is what the Americans are \nreally for.\n  You would hardly understand that this is what is being cut here. You \nwill hear general comments about how we have to cut back on programs \nand discretionary spending in order to deal with the deficit. The fact \nis, the programs which are being cut back are to be used for the tax \ncut to the wealthiest individuals. I just do not think that is right. \nThis is the argument that the Senator from California is making, and I \nwelcome the chance to join with her.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Senator in closing my comments that I did \nnot come here to take from the kids and give to the rich. And I did not \ncome here to throw the women and children over first. And that is \nexactly what the Republicans are doing in this Congress.\n  Cut the WIC Program, the Women, Infants, and Children Program that \ngives nourishment to pregnant women who may not be able to afford it? \nEvery dollar we put in that program saves from $3 to $10. Why? Because \nwe give them nourishment--cheese, milk, and things they need.\n  I have a pregnant daughter right now--the light of my life. I am \ngoing to have my first grandchild. Every day I call her: ``Did you take \nyour vitamin pill? Are you eating right?''\n  I say to my friends, we ought to care about the pregnant women in \nthis country who may not have a mom or a dad to call them up in the \nmorning, who may not even have the education to know that it is \nimportant. And, listen, it pays off. It pays off because we have \nhealthier children and less costs, less costs to put these babies in \nincubators, not to mention the humanity involved here.\n  Where is our decency here? I do not know. But what I know is that I \nam proud to be associated with the Senator from Massachusetts. I think \nwhat he is pointing out is a tie-in between these tax breaks for the \nwealthiest people among us and the taking from the children. I think it \nis reprehensible, and I will join that fight. The fight has just begun, \nI say to my friends.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Cloture has been \ninvoked; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So now each Member is entitled to speak up to an hour; \nam I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I do not intend to use all the time, and \nI have every expectation we will have a final vote on this sometime in \nthe early or midafternoon, a time to be set by the majority and \nminority leaders. I thought that process would be worked out. I did \nwant to be able to address the Senate for just a few moments at this \ntime on the issue of the tax loophole.\n  The current tax laws contained an unjustified tax loophole that \nexists for billionaires who renounce their American citizenship in \norder to avoid taxes on the wealth that they have accumulated as \nAmericans. I commend the Finance Committee for closing the loophole in \nits action on the 25-percent health care deduction for small business. \nThe Finance committee took the action despite the fact that the revenue \ngained was not needed to pay for the health care deductions for small \nbusiness owners in the bill.\n  In fact, the committee requested that the revenues be used for \ndeficit reduction, exactly the type of action necessary if we are \nserious about achieving a balanced budget.\n  Closing this loophole would raise $1.4 billion over the next 5 years, \n$3.6 billion over the next 10 years, according to the Senate Finance \nCommittee report.\n  In too many cases, we close tax loopholes only when we need to raise \nrevenues for specific spending measures, whether they involve direct \nexpenditures or tax expenditures. In this case, the committee closed \nthis flagrant loophole as soon as it was brought to the committees's \nattention, and rightly so. All of us thought the issue was settled. Now \nit comes back to us from the Senate-House conference and the loophole \nhas been reopened.\n And the outrageous tax break for two dozen or so of the most wealthy \nindividuals in the country will remain wide open. This is all \nhappening, of course, at the same time that we are cutting Federal \nfunds for basic investment and for the future of children and working \nfamilies. Funds for education, housing, and vital social services are \nall being drastically cut at the very time our Republican colleagues \nare deciding that this tax break is not flagrant enough to be \nterminated immediately.\n\n  All citizens of the United States have a basic right to leave the \ncountry and live elsewhere and to relinquish their citizenship. That is \nnot what this provision is about. Every citizen has the right to \nrepatriate. We would not want the Tax Code to be used to outlaw that \naction.\n  At the same time, though, we do not want the Tax Code to be an \nenticement to citizens to renounce their citizenship. The law would not \nprevent individuals from shifting their assets and citizenship to a \nforeign country; rather it would make sure that those who have amassed \ngreat wealth through the U.S. economic system pay their fair share of \ntaxes.\n  Last year, approximately 850 individuals renounced their citizenship, \nbut \n[[Page S5033]] only a handful of those would have been affected by this \nlegislation. The tax loophole we are trying to close is not one that \napplies to all those who renounce their citizenship. As a result, it is \nwrong to call this an exit tax. It only applies to those with a minimum \nof $600,000 in unrealized capital gains, which would necessitate a \nminimum of $5 million of net worth. All those below that level of \nliability could renounce their citizenship without the IRS ever \nquestioning their motives. But the fact of the matter is that many of \nthese wealthy individuals are leaving the country for only one reason--\nto avoid taxes that they rightfully owe the Government.\n  In some cases, the individuals involved have the best of both worlds. \nThey renounce their citizenship, avoid millions of dollars of tax \nliability, but still spend up to 6 months a year in the United States. \nIn many cases, their families stay in the United States, taking full \nadvantage of the U.S. standard of living and quality of life.\n  In other cases, wealthy individuals are gaining from the system to an \neven greater degree. They are renouncing their citizenship to avoid \nEuropean taxes, also. Then they take up European citizenship but live \npart time in a Caribbean tax haven so they cannot be taxed by their new \nEuropean home country.\n  Some have suggested that this provision would unlawfully restrict the \nfundamental right of voluntary expatriation and emigration. This is not \nthe case. The State Department has stated that this provision does not \nconflict with the international human rights law concerning an \nindividual's right to freely emigrate from his or her country of \ncitizenship. It also recognizes that a state, in order to protect its \ninterest, may impose economic controls on a departure as long as such \ncontrols do not result in a de facto denial of an individual's right to \nemigrate.\n  Requiring individuals to pay taxes on gains that accrue prior to \nexpatriation does not constitute a de facto denial of an individual's \nright to leave a country.\n  These are comparable taxes to those which U.S. citizens or permanent \nresidents would have to pay were they in the United States at the time \nthey disposed of the assets or their debt. Under the current law, if \nthe IRS suspects that an individual has renounced his or her \ncitizenship in order to avoid taxes, it will attempt to tax the \nholdings for an additional 10 years. The IRS must establish that it is \nreasonable to believe that the individual gave up citizenship to avoid \ntaxes. The burden of proof that the move was not for tax reasons falls \non the former citizen.\n  Current law needs to be tightened because individuals are easily \nevading it. The law provides for that with the taxing of their income \nfor an additional 10 years after expatriation. But they avoid the tax \ncompletely by postponing the realization of gains for the first decade \nafter leaving the United States.\n  So the concept has been at least included in the tax law. As I \nunderstand from the experience, that law provides that 10 years after \nexpatriation, that income has basically been hidden or shielded. And \nthe Finance Committee addressed that issue and was to be able to \nrecover what was necessary.\n  The Finance Committee report itself states:\n\n       The committee is concerned that present law--\n\n  So this is not a new law; it is a new way of dealing with the \nloopholes that exist.\n\n       The committee is concerned that under present law, which \n     bases the application of the alternative method of taxation \n     under section 877, proof of a tax avoidance purpose has \n     proven difficult to administer. In addition, the committee is \n     concerned that the alternative method can be avoided by \n     postponing the realization of U.S. source income for 10 \n     years. The committee believes that section 877 is largely \n     ineffective to tax U.S. citizens who expatriate for the \n     principal purpose to avoid the tax.\n       The proposed provision is similar to those in other \n     countries, including Canada and Australia. The concept is \n     also similar to laws in many States, where individuals who \n     move to other States are taxed on compensation earned before \n     the move though it may not be received until after the move.\n\n  The law would be limited in its scope. It would not apply to real \nestate or pensions, regardless of their value. We already tax gains on \nreal estate of foreign citizens as a result of the sale of property. \nUnder the Finance Committee reform, the State Department would notify \nthe IRS when anybody relinquishes their U.S. citizenship. The State \nDepartment would provide appropriate information to assist the IRS in \nenforcing the provision.\n  As the report of the Senate Finance Committee stated on this \nprovision, it is fair and equitable to tax expatriates on the \nappreciation of their assets when they relinquish their U.S. \ncitizenship.\n  I regret that Congress is unable to act now to close this \nbillionaires' tax loophole in the current tax bill. We know that our \nRepublican colleagues are quick to call for deep cuts in programs that \nhelp working families, children, college students, senior citizens, and \nother deserving Americans. So it is ironic that our Republican \ncolleagues show so much solicitude for the least-deserving Americans--\nthose who want to renounce their citizenship in order to evade their \nfair share of taxes on the massive fortunes they have accumulated from \nthe blessings of America. This tax loophole should be closed as soon as \npossible.\n  So, Mr. President, it was my purpose--and I am joined by a number of \nmy colleagues. Although we were not technically able to do so in terms \nof the parliamentary situation in which we finds ourselves, at least we \nshould be accorded an opportunity to vote on a resolution that would do \njust that--that is, remedy this situation.\n  I would expect that it would have overwhelming support. I would \nexpect that it would have unanimous support. I see on the floor my \nfriend and colleague, the chairman of the Finance Committee. As I noted \nearlier today, he had given assurance, as did the Senator from New \nYork, that this issue would be resolved in the conference, along with \nother members of the Finance Committee. Senator Bradley authored the \nprovision in the Finance Committee, and he indicated that as well.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that Members ought to be able to \nexpress the sense of outrage that is felt by their constituents and be \nable to speak to this issue in support of a resolution that would urge \nthat at the earliest possible time, there be action on this particular \nloophole. We do not doubt for a moment the sincere, dedicated, \ncommitted desire of the Members I mentioned and other members on the \ncommittee to do so.\n  To many of us who have been around long enough to know that when we \nare in those conferences and the House has a different view about this, \nthat getting a unanimous, recorded vote by the membership, Republican \nand Democrat alike, with the strong assurances of the members of the \nFinance Committee, majority as well as minority, and all Members of the \nSenate on this, that this would be an issue that would be resolved and \nresolved in a timely fashion, and that this real injustice to all of \nthe other American taxpayers--because when we have this kind of \nloophole, make no mistake about it, it is the hard-working men and \nwomen that are paying the taxes, playing by the rules, that make up the \ndifference.\n  Every time you have this kind of a windfall and you create that \ndeficit, what are we asked to do? We are asked to address the problems \nof the deficit. Here are where the cuts come. That is what we are being \nasked to do here--to cut the child care programs, the WIC Program, cut \nthe Head Start Program. Why? For deficit reduction. And one of the good \nreasons we have it is because we have a loophole like the one I have \njust mentioned. It seems that the least we can do is to have a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution that reflects the combined body here of the \nSenate on the earliest possible time. I wish we could have worked out a \nprocess prior to the vote.\n  I understand that we will move to a vote. Of course we will have an \nopportunity to offer it on the underlying measure, in terms of the \nrescissions later on.\n  It would seem to me that it would be wise for the leadership to give \na very clear indication about their support and make it easy to resolve \nthis. Announce to the world that tomorrow at 10 o'clock, this afternoon \nat 5, we will vote on this. We will close this down.\n   [[Page S5034]] But we cannot do that. We hear, ``We are for it,'' \nbut we will not be given an opportunity to vote on it. We are not going \nto say when we can get a vote on it. We have to conclude that if this \nis the case, why do we not just say at a time certain that we will get \na resolution on this matter such that the majority leader and the \nminority leader and the members of the Finance Committee will all say, \n``This is an expression of the unanimous vote of the Senate.'' That is \nwhat we are desiring to do.\n  We are saying to the House of Representatives that the Senate of the \nUnited States--Democrats and Republicans--are all aligned together. We \nbelieve that action has to be taken, that this loophole has to be \nclosed. We are prepared to go on record. We are prepared to set the \ntime to do so.\n  I want just to finally indicate that I am very hopeful that we can do \nit. I will be eager to try and work with the leadership to try and \nestablish that time. I will also be forced to remind our body, if we \nare not able to do it, as to what, really, is at issue.\n  It is the issue of fundamental fairness. An issue of which side are \nwe on. Are we on the side of working families who are in the lifeline \nprograms that reach the children of this country? In the child care \nprograms, where we have long lines of parents trying to get quality \nchild care? Or the school-to-work program for the 70 percent of the \nindividuals who do not go on to 4-year college and want to be able to \nfind employment? This program, which has strong bipartisan support, \nreflects a combination of business and educators and parents trying to \nget people into work.\n  Other programs include the WIC nutrition program, which was spoken to \nso eloquently by our friend and colleague, the Senator from California. \nThe Head Start Program, which was reviewed by a bipartisan commission, \nvirtually had a unanimous vote when it passed out of the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee, and had strong support in the House.\n  Goals 2000 education reform, which incorporates many of the ideas and \nsuggestions of the previous Secretaries of Education.\n  The Chapter I Program that focuses on the educationally \ndisadvantaged.\n  The Safe and Drug Free Schools Program--we obviously know that as \nmuch as we do to reform our education system, if we do not have a safe \nschool, none of this will matter.\n  Finally, regarding the AmeriCorps Program, we must not pull the rug \nout from underneath the young men and women who are beginning to reap \nits benefits and serve their communities.\n  This is really something that I think all Americans can understand.\n  I see other colleagues that want to speak here this afternoon. I \nwould hope that we will all understand the impact of these cuts when we \nvote on this measure. I can give the assurance to the membership we \nwill get a vote on it, hopefully sooner than later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority manager is recognized.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I thank the Chair.\n  It was almost 25 years ago that I traveled around the country with my \ngood friend, the senior Senator from Massachusetts. I was then on the \nLabor and Public Welfare Committee. He was, I believe, chairman of the \nHealth Subcommittee. We were doing health hearings around the country \ngoing to hospitals, holding hearings.\n  There is no question that his compassion for the poor is unrivaled in \nthis body. Sometimes, however, that compassion is confused by the \nvolume of his oratory and the velocity of his statistics.\n  Volume and velocity are not necessarily accuracy. He uses the word \n``cut, cut, cut.'' Only in this Government--not in any State government \nthat I know--only in this Government do we use the word ``cut'' as \nfollows: cut means we are going to spend less than we thought we were \ngoing to spend in the future, even though it is more than we are \nspending now. That is a cut.\n  This would be a cut, to an average layperson. I am making $1,000 a \nmonth. I think I am worth $1,200 a month. I go to the boss and say, I \nam worth $1,200. And the boss says I don't have $1,200. I will give you \n$1,100. You do not tell your wife you got cut $200; you got $100 raise. \nIt is not as much as you hoped but more than you are getting.\n  I defy you to ask any average normal citizen in this country to \ndefine ``cut'' the way we define it.\n  Having said that, we will take a look at the quantity of money we now \nspend. The Federal Government--and we hate to be cavalier about this \nbut I will round it off--the Federal Government this year will spend \nabout $1.5 trillion--``t,'' trillion, $1.5 trillion.\n  If we were to spend $1.5 trillion a year for the next 7 years--and \nthe reason I pick that is the year 2002 we are hoping to get to a \nbalanced budget--we would spend about $11 trillion. We are planning to \nspend under current law, if we do not change the current law at all, we \ndo not add anything like long-term care to Medicare, we do not add \nanything more to AmeriCorps or Head Start, over the next 7 years \ninstead of spending $11 trillion, as we would spend if we spent the \nsame amount every year, we would spend $15 trillion. That is if we do \nnot change the laws. And we would still have the perpetual deficits.\n  In order to balance the budget by the year 2002, instead of $15 \ntrillion spent over the next 7 years, we need to spend about $14 \ntrillion. I want to emphasize, again, we are spending roughly $1.5 \ntrillion now.\n  If we continue to spend it over 7 years, we would spend about $11 \ntrillion. To balance the budget, we can do it and spend $14 trillion. \nThat is not a cut from what we are now spending--Social Security is not \ngoing to go down, Medicare is not going to go down, Medicaid will not \ngo down, education will not go down, food for the poor will not go \ndown. They are all going to go up, not down.\n  The reason that people use the word ``cut'' is because they have a \nvested interest in the program. Often, they are bureaucrats who \nadminister it and aggrandizement and biggering is good for bureaucracy. \nThe more you can bigger, the better.\n  So we have come with this concept only, really, in the last 20 years, \nof what a cut is: Spending less than we were otherwise going to spend \nbut more than we are spending now.\n  Unfortunately, the press has picked it up. They say Republicans plan \nto cut--whatever it is. So let me give an example. Let us take some of \nthe programs that my good friend from Massachusetts has. Let us take \nHead Start and let us say we were going to spend $500--$100 a year on \nit over the next, let us say, 5 years: $500; and let us say we were \ngoing to spend $100 a year on school lunches for the next 5 years: \nanother $500; and $100 on child care per year. So over 5 years, you \nhave $500 we would spend on Head Start, $500 on school lunches, and \n$500 on child care. That is $1,500 we would spend over the next 5 \nyears.\n  Let us say, however, that the current law--no change in the current \nlaw, we do not have to vote for anything--would say that on these \nprograms we will spend $200 a year. So over 5 years, instead of \nspending $500, we would spend $1,000 on each program. So on the three \nprograms, instead of spending $1,500, we spend $3,000.\n  Now let us say the Republicans come forth and say, ``We think, over \nthe next 5 years on those three programs, instead of $1,500 that we are \nnow spending if you were to flatten it out, we think we should spend \n$2,500; not $3,000, $2,500.'' The argument would be made we have cut \nthe programs $500.\n  We have not cut the programs. We have increased the spending $1,000. \nIt just is not as much as advocates of each of those programs would \nlike. And we, everyone in this body, knows we are faced with this.\n  In comes a group whose principal purpose is education. It can often \nbe conservative Republicans, let us say it is the National Association \nof School Boards. Except in very big towns, my experience has been that \nschool board members are often Republicans, somewhat conservative, and \nthey want to balance the budget. But they are on the school board, so \nin they come and say, ``Yes, I am for the balanced budget amendment, I \nam for balancing the budget, but education is a special problem and you \nmust increase spending for education. If we have to balance the budget, \nyou should take it from someplace else.'' They leave.\n  In the next week comes the National Association of Hospital Boards of \nDirectors. These are almost invariably Republicans, also. They are the \ntown's \n[[Page S5035]] elite, the town's 400. They are generous in their \ncharity. They give money to the hospital. In they come, and they \nunderstand the fastest growing program we have is health and they want \nto balance the budget. But they say, ``You have to understand that \nhealth is in a special category. If the budget must be balanced, take \nit out of education.'' They leave.\n  In comes the National Association of the Chiefs of Police, and to \nthem the most critical problem facing this country is crime and the \nbudgets for their police department. These people are normally \nreasonably conservative, also. Probably if they had to vote on a \nbalanced budget amendment, they would vote four or five to one for a \nbalanced budget. But fighting crime is unique and different and, ``If \nthere is not enough money for everything, we should take it out of \neducation and health so that we have it for crime.''\n  None of these people are malevolent. Each of these people sees the \nworld through their eyes. Each of them sees it through the programs \nthat they administer or are committed to--and are committed to out of \nperfect decency. Yet, if you do not see the world as they see it, if \nyou say, ``Listen, somehow instead of spending $3,000''--we are now \nspending on the average only $1,500 --``we have to cut it to $2,500,'' \nwhich is really a $1,000 increase, but in order to pare down the \nincrease by $500, we have to take a little bit off of the increase in \neducation and a little bit off the increase in health and a little bit \noff the increase in crime prevention--each one of them is mad at you \nbecause you did not see the world as they saw it.\n  I want to emphasize, again, when we finally get the welfare reform \nbill on the floor, when we finally get the entire budget bill on the \nfloor--if we ever get it on the floor--and if we have a budget that \ngets us to a balance in 7 years, spending will be up for health, up for \neducation. It may be down in defense. It will be up for child care. It \nwill be up for almost every social program we know.\n  Aha, but the opponents are going to say, we cannot guarantee that \nbecause you are going to block grant it. By block granting, we simply \nmean we are going to give to the States some of these programs, with \nsome money, and tell them to administer it.\n  Let me take the example I have used, these three: Head Start, school \nlunch, and child care. As I say, we are now spending $100 each year, \n$300 a year on the three of them; over 5 years, that is $1,500. But if \nwe did not make any change in the law over those 5 years, we would \nspend $3,000. So let us say we say to the States we will make you a \ndeal. We think you are closer to the people than we are. We think you \nknow your problems better than we do. The problems of Oregon may not be \nthe problems of New York. Certainly, the problems of Newport, OR, are \nnot the problems of New York City. We are going to give to the States \nfor these three programs $2,500 over 5 years, and say to the States, \n``You spend it as you want on these three programs: Head Start, school \nlunch, and child care.''\n  But we do not say in each case how much they have to spend on each of \nthose programs. They just have to spend the aggregate $2,500 on those \nthree programs. The States that are stable, with relatively lower \ndivorce rates, with only one person in the household working, may not \nhave the same child care problems that an urban area with illegitimate \nbirth rates of 50 or 60 or 70 percent and no man around in the \nhousehold, they may have a different problem about child care. It may \nnot be as critical as it is when you are trying to get a woman off \nwelfare, get her a job, and she has a child and the child is 1 or 2 \nyears of age, and she is 19 and not quite out of high school--dropped \nout. She needs child care.\n  Maybe that State says, ``We are going to have to spend more on child \ncare than even what the Federal Government might have planned to have \nspent on that particular program. But we will spend a little bit less \non Head Start or a little bit less--not less than we are spending, less \nthan was planned to be spent.''\n  So the argument will be made, if you give these programs to the \nStates, there is no guarantee that they will have the compassion and \nthe knowledge and the interest to take care of Head Start and school \nlunch and child care the way a compassionate Federal Government would. \nNot only that we understand the problems better, the argument goes, so \nwe have to have programs that have a myriad of Federal regulations that \ngo with them--not only do we understand them better, we are more \ncompassionate. State legislators do not care about children, they do \nnot care about nutrition, they do not care about Head Start. Governors \nare callous, backward people who have no concern that their children \nare well educated and well fed.\n  That is just baloney. We know it. For us to say at the Federal level \nthat the Governors and the State legislatures do not care about these \nproblems is outrageous. They care as much as we do, and they are closer \nto the problem than we are.\n  So let us get over this argument about cut, cut, cut. Are there going \nto be reductions in spending from what we would otherwise spend if we \nare going to balance the budget? Yes.\n  Will those be reductions from what we are now spending? No. Will they \nbe somewhat less than the most wild-eyed, zealous partisan of these \nparticular programs that they would like spent on their programs? \nPerhaps. We are going to have to ask everybody in this country to share \nin the reduction of the increase--not a cut --a reduction of the \nincrease. This battle we are going to have at another time.\n  I mention this only because my good friend from Massachusetts has \ntalked about this expatriate tax provision in the bill that is \ncurrently before us which would allow the self-employed in this country \nto take a 25-percent deduction for health insurance which they \npurchase, and 30 percent starting in this year, and has said we have \ncut out the tax on the wealthy and we favor the wealthy at the expense \nof the poor at the very same time that we are cutting Head Start, and \nAmeriCorps. I say again we are not cutting. He likes to use the term. \nBut we are not cutting. At the same time we are reducing the increase, \nwe are cutting the tax on the malevolent rich who flee their country to \navoid taxation.\n  First, in this country, if you leave it for purposes of avoiding \ntaxation, we can tax you for 10 years. My good friend from \nMassachusetts has said, yes. But for 10 years. You can leave this \ncountry and you have what we call unrealized capital gains. Perhaps the \nprice of a stock goes up. The value goes up but you have not sold it, \nand you do not sell it for 10 years. That is an unusual situation. It \nis very unusual for somebody to leave and not touch their assets for a \ndecade. But if they leave this country now to avoid taxation, we can \ntax them for 10 years.\n  I will tell you what happened with this expatriate tax provision. I \nam frank to admit it was mostly my error in moving too rapidly. The \nHouse bill did not have this provision in it at all. We were doing what \nwe call the markup on this bill, and Senator Bradley offered the \nprovision to tax the expatriates. We had relatively little discussion \nabout it. We adopted it without even a rollcall vote; no hearings; did \nnot really grasp the significance of what we might be doing. We have \ndone this before in this body.\n  I remember John Williams, who was a Senator from Delaware, Senator \nRoth's predecessor, who served here 24 years, and he and I overlapped \nby 2 years. I was elected in 1968 he retired in 1970. But he used a \nwonderful expression once in which he said, ``We make more mistakes in \nhaste than we lose opportunities in delay.''\n  I will give you one mistake we made. This tax provision that we put \nin the Senate bill only applies to American citizens. We have any \nnumber of people who come to this country from Cuba, Italy, Poland, \nGermany, and they are legal immigrants. They work here. They pay their \ntaxes here. They are good citizens. They participate in life while they \nare here. But at the end of 30 or 40 years of work, and they have been \nvery successful and have made a fair amount of money, they choose to go \nback home. The tug of the home country is there for people. So they go. \nThey never became an American citizen. They are here legally. There is \nno complaint about that. They paid their taxes; no complaint about \nthat. This bill does not apply to them. They never became an American \ncitizen.\n  But take the same person from Poland, or Germany, or Cuba who comes \nhere, becomes an American citizen, is \n[[Page S5036]] naturalized, decides to go back to the home country, \nthey are taxed. We did not know that. It just did not occur to us.\n  I will give you another example. This is at variance of many \nnaturalized citizens; some who fled Cuba or were forced out of Cuba \nwhen Castro seized control; in many respects confiscated much of their \nproperty. You had engineers and doctors coming here in 1960, 1961, 1962 \nand went to work in the most menial of occupations here because they \nhad been driven out of their home land and had not yet passed licensure \nexams here, and had no money here. And over 30 years they have become \nvery successful. They are the leading citizens in the movement to free \nCuba of its dictatorial control. They will one day be successful. Some \nof them have become citizens, some not. My hunch will be when Cuba is \nfree many of them will want to return home. That does not mean they are \nbad Americans, although in some cases they have not taken out \ncitizenship. But it means they want to go back to their country when it \nis freed.\n  Are we going to tax them? Are they leaving for tax reasons? Are they \nleaving for patriotic reasons? Our bill taxes them no matter what. How \nmany occasions have we had where citizens all over this world have had \nto flee their country and go into exile for 5, 10, 15 years because of \na repressive government at home and they could not return until that \ngovernment became free? And then they go home. How are they to be \ntaxed? We did not consider it.\n  I will give you another example. A wealthy father sets up a trust for \nhis grandson. The grandson marries a foreigner, perhaps met the \nforeigner when the grandson was a student overseas or in the military \noverseas and takes out citizenship in that country. The grandfather is \nstill alive. The trust is revocable. Is the grandson, when he leaves \nthis country, taxed on what we would call the corpus, the amount of \nthat trust, even though he has not gotten it and may not get it? We do \nnot know. We did not consider that problem. Nobody raised that problem.\n  I will give you another example. A person works here all their life. \nThey are very successful. The employer for whom they work has been \nputting aside money in their pension plan. Finally, the accumulated \npension plan with the interest and everything on it is significant and \nthe person is to get x amount of dollars a month from the time they \nretire. He retires at 60, and goes back home. It is an American \ncitizen. I think the way this is drawn that corpus, that amount in the \npension plan, is taxed immediately. I think. I am not sure. Then I \nthink the payments are taxed also when you get your pension. Did we \nintend that or did we not intend that? I am not sure what we intended.\n  I say this only to attempt to ameliorate the argument that this was \ndone at the behest of or because of the rich in this country; this was \nadopted in haste and we did not grasp its full consequences.\n  In addition, it was not in the House bill and the House with a vote \non the floor before we went to conference with them instructed their \nconferees not to accept this provision. So the chairman of the Ways and \nMeans Committee and I have jointly put out a release saying we want the \nJoint Tax Committee, which is the professional group that so well \nadvises the House and the Senate, to study this problem, give us a \nreport by June 1. We will have hearings on it. There will be \nlegislation enacted. And the effective date of it will be February 6 of \nthis year so people cannot now get under the deadline in an attempt to \nflee the country at the moment before the law is in effect.\n  So the problem will be taken care of. But it will be taken care of in \na responsible way. I say again, in this case, in my judgment we did not \nact irresponsibly. We did not act malevolently. We just did not grasp \nthe consequences of what we were doing.\n  So I hope that the debate and the discussion would not be one of \nrancor and class warfare, that we are excusing the rich, and in order \nto do that we must eliminate programs for the poor. That is not the \ndebate over this issue. It is a debate over equal protection of the \nlaws, and under the equal protection of the laws everyone in this \ncountry is to be treated equally--the poor, and the rich, and you do \nnot suffer a particular penalty solely because you are rich. A penalty \nthat may--I emphasize ``may'' because we do not know--be unwise, may be \nunfair, may in some cases violate international treaties that we have \nagreed to. We are not sure.\n  I hope we can adopt very soon the conference report that we are \ndiscussing so that roughly 3.2 million self-employed working Americans \nin this country will know whether or not they can take a 25-percent \ndeduction for health insurance premiums that they buy for themselves.\n They are not employed. Their employer is not paying for this. They pay \nfor it. The longer we delay, the tougher it is going to be for them to \nknow whether or not they can make this tax deduction, which is now \ngoing to have to be filed in just 12 more days.\n\n  So I thank the Chair. I hope we can conclude this debate not in a tax \non the poor or a tax on the rich or an argument that the provision is a \ntradeoff so we have to cut programs for the poor. It is not that. And \nwhen this whole debate on spending and welfare and block grants is \nover, I hope it will be very clear to America that no one is cutting \nprograms for the poor. The question is are we willing to somewhat \nrestrain the increases so that we might achieve a balanced budget, so \nthat those very children we are talking about now do not face the \npossibility of bankruptcy of this Nation or the bankruptcy of the \nSocial Security System or the bankruptcy of Medicare--and that is only \n6 or 7 years away--so that they do not have to face that and pay for it \nbecause we refused to have the courage or the wisdom or the foresight \nto attempt to modestly reduce the increase in spending sufficiently to \ngive them a balanced budget.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak on the Daschle \namendment. Let me just comment briefly on the observations of my friend \nfrom the State of Oregon.\n  It is true that the volume of Senator Kennedy's remarks does not \nnecessarily mean that there is virtue to his remarks, but in this case \nI believe there is virtue in his remarks. And because my colleague from \nOregon speaks in a calm, less passionate voice does not mean \nnecessarily that there is virtue to everything he had to say, some of \nwhich I agree with, some of which I do not. That we should provide tax \nbreaks for the self-employed in their health insurance we agree \ncompletely.\n  When my colleague from Oregon says that this particular tax break is \ndesigned so that we have equal protection for everyone, the poor and \nthe rich alike, it is true that if you are either poor or you are a \nmillionaire and you move to the Caribbean and you renounce your \nAmerican citizenship, you can get this tax break. But there are not \ngoing to be very many poor people who are going to take advantage of \nthat. This is designed for those who are more fortunate economically.\n  When my friend argues that all we have to do in the future to achieve \na balanced budget is to restrain spending, he is correct. If you assume \nand we were to pass, we were to pick up one more vote for a balanced \nbudget amendment, if we had no cuts in interest rates--and every \nprojection, CBO, Data Resources, all of them say we will have reduction \nin interest rates--if we were to have no changes in Social Security, we \ncould increase spending 1.7 percent a year between now and the year \n2002 and achieve a balanced budget. So that argument by Senator \nPackwood is absolutely correct.\n  I serve on the Budget Committee. I want us to use not what we call \neuphemistically the current services budget but where we are now. That \nis how a family does it, as Senator Packwood says correctly.\n  But the Senator from Oregon is incorrect when he said these are not \ncuts. What he said, if he were making a speech on the 1996 budget, \nwould be accurate. In the rescission, what we are saying to groups is \nwe are giving you the money. Indian housing, we have told them we have \nappropriated X-number of dollars--I do not know the amount--for \ndesperately needed housing on Indian reservations, and now we are \ncoming along saying we are taking \n[[Page S5037]] back $100 million of the money that you received. And \nyou look through this.\n  To AmeriCorps, Senator Daschle will restore $210 million, \noverwhelmingly supported by the American public; 90 percent support the \nidea. The Los Angeles Times showed 60 percent of the people who call \nthemselves conservative support the idea.\n  Republican Governors. Montana's Governor says:\n\n       While balancing the budget, fighting mandates, and \n     streamlining government, I am committed to this community \n     service program for Montana.\n\n  Michigan's Governor:\n\n       AmeriCorps captures the promise found in all its citizens, \n     young and old, who see problems in their communities and work \n     together to solve them.\n\n  Massachusetts' Governor:\n\n       Governors of both parties have shared my enthusiasm for \n     national service.\n\n  Title 1 helps poorer people, the disadvantaged. The reality is we do \nnot do a very good job in the field of education in disadvantaged \ncommunities. I am not saying all education in disadvantaged communities \nis terrible, but it needs a lift.\n  It is very interesting that Sweden, which does not have the income \ndisparities we have in the United States, spends two to three times as \nmuch for education in the disadvantaged areas as in the more affluent \nareas. We do the opposite.\n  I was on a call-in program this morning with station WILL in \nChampaign, IL, and a faculty member of the University of Illinois got \non the phone and he interpreted my remarks as being negative about \nAmerican education. But he made this significant observation. He said \nsome of the finest students we have come from the Chicago suburbs.\n  The Chicago suburbs. Not the city of Chicago, where the need is so \ngreat, where, frankly, we are not spending the money. If there is any \nquestion about the value of title I since it was enacted, the gap \nbetween black and white students has narrowed significantly. For 9-\nyear-olds, the gap in achievement test scores has closed by 18 percent \nin math and 25 percent in reading.\n  This program works. And this is a program we are going to cut back on \nif we do not adopt the Daschle amendment. The dropout rate for 16- to \n24-year-olds has declined significantly for all students, from 17 \npercent in 1967 to 11 percent in 1993. The decline in the dropout rate \nhas been even more dramatic for African-American students, going from \n28.6 percent in 1967 to 13.6 percent in 1993: even with the present \nappropriation that this rescission would cut back without the Daschle \namendment, 13 percent of high-poverty schools will receive no funds at \nall. In the city of Chicago, the Chicago school district, you have to \nachieve 56 percent of poverty in your school before you receive any \nhelp. Clearly, a needed program.\n  Goals 2000. We hear a lot of talk around here how we are going to \nhelp the States. Goals 2000 says to the States you set your standards, \nyou establish the program, and we will provide some assistance. We cut \nback on that.\n  Safe and drug-free schools. Cut back $100 million out of $472 million \nappropriated. We are going to solve the problem of crime not just by \nbuilding more prisons but by drug treatment programs, drug prevention \nprograms, education programs--very much needed.\n  Head Start. Every study shows Head Start pays off in this country.\n   And just about every Head Start program has a waiting list of young \npeople to get into the Head Start program.\n\n  I visited the Head Start program in Rock Island, IL, where, like \nevery Head Start program, they have a waiting list. In Rock Island, IL, \non Monday morning, one group of children come in; Tuesday morning, a \nsecond group comes in; Wednesday morning, a third group, and so forth.\n  I asked the woman in charge: What would it mean if you could have the \nsame children in here not just 1 day a week but all week? She smiled \nand said, ``You can't believe the difference it would make in their \nlives.''\n  We save money by not funding Head Start so that all young people who \nneed the help can get into it, but it is extremely shortsighted.\n  The WIC Program; every study shows it pays off tremendously. That is \nthe health program for women, infants, and children.\n  School-to-work. I heard Gov. Tommy Thompson from Wisconsin--and, as \nthe Presiding Officer knows, he is a good Republican Governor--I heard \nhim praise what we did in school-to-work. We are spending a huge amount \nof our education dollar for those young people who go on and get a \nbachelors degree, but 75 percent of our students do not do that. \nSchool-to-work is designed for everyone, but particularly for those who \nare not going to go on to get that bachelor's degree. There was $30 \nmillion cut out of that.\n  Year-round youth training, under the JTPA Program, cut $100 million. \nWith the kind of youth unemployment that we have, I do not think it \nmakes sense.\n  Immigrant education. I hear a lot of speeches that we ought to make \nEnglish the official language around here. I do not know what it would \nmean, incidentally. Would that mean you cannot get a translation if you \nare in court if you speak Chinese or Spanish or some other language?\n  But it is interesting that when we come up for immigrant education to \nhave classes so that people can learn the English language--and that is \nreally the way you make English the official language, let people learn \nthe language, and we ought to do that--we are cutting $8.8 million out \nof that.\n  I believe that the amendment by Senator Daschle is a sound amendment.\n  I agree with Senator Packwood and I agree with our Presiding Officer \nthat we need a balanced budget amendment and that we ought to start \nfrom a zero base and not a current services budget. My hope is, and my \nbelief is, that Senator Domenici is going to do that with the Budget \nCommittee this year.\n  But, I think it is a mistake to cut back, particularly in this area \nof education.\n  I note on the floor the presence of the Senator from Vermont, who has \nbeen rightfully telling us for some time we ought to be spending a \nhigher percentage of our budget on education.\n  It is very interesting, as interest has grown because of the deficit, \nwe have spent less and less on education. In fiscal year 1949, believe \nit or not, 9 percent of the Federal budget went for education. Today, 2 \npercent of our budget goes for education. We will spend 11 times as \nmuch this year on the gross interest expenditure as we will spend on \neducation.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will adopt the Daschle amendment. This \nshould not be a partisan matter. I think it makes sense. I hope we will \ndo the right thing for the future of our country and vote for it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Cory \nHeyman, a Jacob Javits fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges \nfor today's proceedings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to talk to my colleagues \nabout the rescissions bill and also, in a broader context, about the \nsituation with respect to education in the country.\n  I am going to run through a relatively large number of charts today, \neach of which is very significant and with a great deal of information \ninvolved. As time progresses through the spring, I will go over each of \nthese areas in greater detail.\n  But I think now, as we begin talking about the rescission bill, it is \nimportant that we examine the cuts in the critical area of education.\n  When it becomes necessary to cut, it is easiest when everyone holds \nhands and says, ``Oh, let's take our cuts and suffer together.'' \nHowever, in some cases, cuts may exacerbate the deficit problem, not \nease it. Education is a critical item in this regard.\n  Earlier this year, business representatives from the Business Round \nTable, the National Alliance of Business, NAB, and the chamber of \ncommerce approached me with concerns about the state of the work force \nand its ability to meet the increasing effective international \ncompetition.\n  As a result, this Wednesday, a summit will be held here in \nWashington \n[[Page S5038]] with business and education leaders, parent and student \nrepresentatives, and political leaders.\n  I would like to share with you today the facts I will share with them \non Wednesday. It is my hope that, when you review this information, you \nwill agree that cutting educational funds could be most \ncounterproductive to deficit reduction and for our future.\n  When the Berlin Wall came down, we all breathed a sigh of relief. But \nas we were beating against the wall over the decades since World War \nII, our economic competitors were beating us in entering into the \nevolving markets around the world. They now stand ready to meet the \ndemands of the new markets of Asia, Eastern Europe, and the rest of the \nworld.\n  Ours remains the most productive economy in the world, but our \nfailing educational system and the inability to provide the necessary \nwork force for our industry is seriously threatening our edge and our \neconomic future.\n  Most worrisome is that the gap between our level of learning and that \nof our major competitors is increasing--that is, it is getting worse--\nnot decreasing. Especially in the critical areas of math and science, \nAmerican children trail their counterparts in Europe and Asia. And they \nare losing ground.\n  Let us take a look at the status of our education. I would remind \neveryone that in 1983, Secretary of Education Bell, under the Reagan \nadministration, set forth ``A Nation at Risk'' and analyzed our \neducational system, analyzed where we stood in the world and declared \nthat this Nation was at serious risk. In fact, he went on to say, in \nwords of this nature, that if an enemy of this country had forced upon \nus the educational system that we have in this country today, we would \nconsider it an act of war.\n  Since that time, 1983, a number of serious reports, documents and \nbooks have been written, all saying the same thing. We have had two \nsummits since then. We established goals in 1989, which were adopted \nthis past year, to determine where we must be in order to be \ncompetitive in the international world.\n  I think this first chart that I will show you, chart A, kind of says \nit all with respect to where we are with the rest of the world in those \ncritical areas of math education. Look at it. You can hardly even see \nit is on the chart.\n  But the most startling aspect of this chart is to look at who No. 1 \nis--China--China, by far. And when you consider that it has a \npopulation of nearly 1.2 billion people and when you consider the \nserious deficit that we have in our trade with China, can you not help \nbut be concerned that this is a serious problem.\n  But if you do not like that one, if you do not care about the \ninternational scene, if you do not think we have to worry about our \nmarket, take a look at this next chart. This is the one which shakes me \nup the most.\n  This one says that over half of the high school students in this \ncountry who graduate are functionally illiterate. That means they are \nunable to perform basic tasks to get a job.\n  That is so startling to me that I cannot help but wonder whether or \nnot this Nation is going to survive if we do not do something.\n  The business community is deeply concerned about this. In fact, there \nwas a report that came out a few weeks ago, which was reported in the \nNew York Times and elsewhere, which indicated that businesses do not \neven bother to interview high school graduates anymore. It is not worth \ntheir time. They are not educated enough. What business does then is \nspend some $200 billion a year to train and educate their workers. I \nwill show a chart later which illustrates the costs associated with a \nwell-trained work force.\n  Let us take a look at where we stand. We established a goal under \nGoals 2000, that everyone shall be educated at least to meet certain \nbasic standards. We set forth a curriculum and standards in the 1983 \nreport, ``A Nation at Risk.'' In 1990, only 22 percent of our high \nschool graduates were adequately educated in the recommended core \ncurriculum.\n  We have a serious problem. Yet, we have a hard time convincing many \nof that. I found myself going to my own local high school and asking \nthe question:\n  ``How are we doing?\"\n  And they said, ``We're doing fine.''\n  Then they told me, ``Well, our kids now are taking calculus and some \nof them are taking it in their junior year.''\n  I said, ``Wow, that's great, I didn't get it until I was in \ncollege.''\n  However, the problem with that is if you are in Taiwan, Japan, or \nother areas, you are getting calculus in your freshman year. And one \nwonders why we are so far behind.\n  I think the only way we can get people to understand is to show the \nimpact it is having upon the Nation as a whole. I feel in this Nation, \nwe have a tendency--I know I do--to compare our school system with the \none in the next county or our State with another State, but we fail to \ncompare it with those of our competitors.\n  If you take a look at this chart, and you will see as we go through \nthese charts, if we do not have an educated population and if you as an \nindividual do not have an adequate education, you will not have an \nadequate earning capacity in this Nation, to give you the kind of \nlifestyle you desire.\n  This chart basically shows that education means a job, and the more \neducation you have, the more money you are going to make during your \nlife. It also indicates that about 25 percent of the people who are \nschool dropouts, many of whom are also functionally illiterate, have an \nextremely difficult time finding employment.\n  But as this shows, if you get a bachelor's degree your earning \npotential almost doubles; if you go up to a master's, it will double \nagain. The point is if we do not have an educated population, if you \nare not well educated, you have a very limited earning potential.\n  Let us take a look now at the differences this means in the standard \nof living in this country. As I indicated, our education has not kept \nup. Our competitors are beating us. This is a chart which is used over \nand over again to show that in the last 20 years or more, the person \nwho drops out of high school has seen a decrease of 35 percent--I \nrepeat, a decrease of 35 percent--in their real income.\n  If you only have a high school diploma, you have seen an 18-percent \ndecrease in your median family income, and if you had some college but \ndid not graduate from college, there has been an 11-percent decrease \nover the last 20 years in your standard of living. Only those who went \nto college and beyond have seen an increase in their standard of living \nover the past 20 years. That is a sad commentary on where we are.\n  I think it is important that we keep this in mind and recognize that \nwe have to improve the educational system. In a few moments, I will go \non to explain what must be done and how I hope we can accomplish it.\n  Now let us get to the area we are discussing today and will be \ndiscussing in the next few months, and that is, what does the budget \ndo, what impact does it have on our future budgets? What we find on \nthis chart is that over half a trillion dollars in costs are suffered \nby this Nation because of a failed educational system.\n  Let me run through these figures. It costs $225 billion to our \nbusinesses each year--$225 billion each year--for remedial education, \nto teach the young people the things they should have learned up \nthrough high school, and for skill education, the things that they need \nto have to hold a job which will help us in our international \ncompetition in order to increase our Nation's productivity.\n  We spent $208 billion for various welfare expenditures in this \nNation. This is yet another reflection of what happens when people are \nnot sufficiently educated. There are some 80 million functionally \nilliterate individuals in this country who cannot fully contribute to \nour economy; $43 billion is the cost of crime to our society; \nincarceration costs anywhere from $20,000 to $60,000 per inmate, money \nwhich could be put to better use. Money is not the only way we suffer \nfrom crime; it also poses a danger to our society. Yet when we \nrecognize that close to 80 percent of the people incarcerated are \nschool dropouts, it indicates how extraordinary the impact of education \nis on our society.\n   [[Page S5039]] We have $200 billion for expenditures on our citizens \nfor lost productivity as well as, I mentioned, training.\n  What I want to point out is if we decrease our expenditures in \neducation, then we increase the social costs and in turn our deficit \nwill grow. But equally important--it is not shown on this chart--is \nthat if we did not have to pay for these undereducated individuals and \nif there was not the drain on the economy their lack of education \ncaused, we would actually have $125 billion more in revenue.\n  So when we cut back on education, we run the risk of not only \nincreasing social costs but also decreasing the amount of revenues we \nwill have at our disposal.\n  Let me go on and talk about the basic question which is relevant to \nthe area of the deficit.\n  There are people who will say--and they are correct--that lack of \nmoney is not necessarily the problem and, in many cases, this is true. \nWe spend more than any other society does, as a percentage of our gross \nnational product, on education. But what we do not do is get our kids \nto learn as much as other young people do in this world.\n  Let us take a look at one of the areas that should graphically \ndisplay why we are behind our international competitors. The only thing \nwe need to look at in this country is the number of hours our kids \nspend watching television.\n  Look at that chart, it shows that we have far outpaced all of the \nother children in the world by the amount of time they spend on \neducation, and yet we have the least amount of time spent on homework.\n  Yes, the problem is not just necessarily money. There is no question \nabout it. A lot has to do with parents, a lot has to do with our \nculture, which sometimes puts leisure time and TV ahead of homework.\n  Let us take a look at the next chart. The next chart I want to point \nout is that even though we expend a lot more money than other countries \ndo on our education, there are still areas we all agree are important \nand yet there are dire insufficiencies. For example, programs that \nassist lower-income individuals.\n  First of all, studies show that early intervention helps. A Michigan \nstudy, which was a 20-year longitudinal study, indicates that although \nkids will catch up in educational aspects, many who suffer for special \neducation needs, will suffer social misadjustment. Yet all of those \nproblems decrease substantially if you have a program like Head Start \npreschool education.\n  I remember when I first came to the Senate. A group of CEO's came to \nmy office. I thought they would talk about tax relief, but they said \nthe thing we need to do right away is to fully fund Head Start in order \nto get our educational system up to par.\n I will never forget that meeting because it made me fully aware of the \neducational needs of this Nation.\n\n  Title 1. That is, again, an educational program for low-achieving \nstudents in high-poverty areas, to help bring them up to par. Funding \nthis program fully would be another $12 billion a year.\n  Special education. I was on the committee that wrote the special \neducation law in 1975. It was a necessity. The courts ruled that every \nchild in America is entitled to an appropriate education. We wrote the \nlaw that established the national criteria to make sure that people \nwould be in compliance with the Constitution. We said we would fund it \nat 40 percent of the total costs of special education in the country. \nIf we were funding it at 40 percent right now, many educational needs \nwould be met and schools would not be in the dire circumstances they \nare in. Some 44 States are in crisis, as far as funding education. That \nwould cost us another $11 billion a year if we were to fully fund the \nneeds for special education--the funds that we promised our Nation when \nwe passed that law many years ago.\n  To reach full funding for all three categories, it would require \nanother $31 billion a year. That is to increase costs in programs that \neverybody has agreed are essential and necessary to education.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I want to say that we are faced with \nserious problems with respect to the deficit of this Nation. We know \nthat we have to bring down the cost of Government. But it is important \nto remember the importance of educational funding as we go forward. \nRight now, 50 percent of our young people do not have the basic \nrequirements of education to meet the demands of this Nation in order \nto be ready for a job. That is intolerable.\n  Take a look at international competition. People out there are \nseizing our markets. At a time when markets are expanding rapidly in \nAsia, Eastern Europe, and central Asia, we are not ready and will not \nbe ready unless we change right now the priority that education \nreceives in this Congress and in the country.\n  As I said, we will be having a summit meeting this week on Wednesday \nand we will have leaders from all over the country who will be \nexamining what we should do as a country to ensure that our work force \nis ready for the next century and that our industry, which has provided \nus with a bountiful living over many years in the past, will be there \nwhen we need it.\n  On the positive side, I note that recently we had six young men that \nwere involved in an international math competition. They not only came \nin first, but they had perfect scores. But as I pointed out earlier on \na chart, it is the average that counts. Our average is among the worst, \nnot the best.\n  Mr. President, I have traveled to cities and around this country and \nI have found programs that swell my heart with pride, and I feel that \nthere is hope and there are ways that we can succeed. But those \nexamples are few and far between. I have seen much more that indicates \nto me the frightful direction that our educational system is taking.\n  Mr. President, it is up to us in this body, in the Congress, to \nensure that we do not do what is so tempting in these times of strife, \nand that is cut education along with other programs. We should do all \nwe can to make sure that we bring education to a capacity that will \nmeet our needs in the next century. Mr. President, if we do not help \nour kids, then this country will fail. I feel very strongly, as \nchairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Education, that I have a \nresponsibility to make sure this body is aware of what must be done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to, at the outset, commend my \nfriend and colleague from Vermont for the focus and attention he has \nplaced in the area of education. I think all of us in this body know \nthat he has been a real leader, along with my friend and colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, in trying to bring a much greater focus and \nattention about the importance of the total investment in education as \na national priority. He has been prodding this institution--and I know \nthe appropriators--to try to give that major focus and attention.\n  As chairman of the Education Committee now, he continues his work, \nnot only in attempting to shape and refashion existing programs more \nefficiently, but also in terms of the priorities of investing in \neducation. I welcome his strong and clear statement. It is a very \nimportant statement. I just want to say that it is one that should be \nlistened to.\n  I think during the course of this week, after the disposition of the \nconference report, which I expect to be done in a very short period of \ntime, we will be back on the broader issues of Senator Daschle's \namendment and Senator Dole's amendment; and then, if those are not \nsuccessful, as I understand it, there will be additional opportunities \nlater in the week to focus on different parts of the composite \namendment, and in particular on education. So we will have some \nopportunity to, in a more exact way, address the priorities of \neducation. I certainly am hopeful that we can reflect in our ultimate \nrescissions bill some of the priorities that he has talked about.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to just take a few moments of time to address \nsome of the points that were made by my friend and colleague, the \nSenator from Oregon, about the various cuts that were being proposed \nand the impact there was going to be in terms of real people across the \ncountry.\n  I think there was reference made to the various provisions of the \nunderlying amendment, which is the Daschle \n[[Page S5040]] amendment, which brings some restoration of the funding, \nor at least does not eliminate moneys that were authorized and \nappropriated. As I think the membership understands, we are not talking \nabout additional appropriations. We are talking about appropriations \nthat have already been made and now are being diminished, or have been \ntargeted for reduction by the rescission program and the amendment \nwhich will be before the Senate again this afternoon, which will \nrestore some of that funding in some of these key areas.\n  The Senator from Oregon was pointing out that really these cuts are \nnot really so bad because they are not really cuts, but they are a \nreduction in the increase in expenditures. I know that is perhaps the \ndesire of some and perhaps the intention of a number. But the fact of \nthe matter is, particularly when you take a look at what is happening \nover in the House of Representatives, it is the Senator from \nMassachusetts talking about real cuts; it is, for example, the CBO that \ntalks about some $7 billion in current services, cuts in terms of the \ntotal nutrition programs, their estimate in terms of the nutrition \nprograms. The Food Stamp Program would be cut some $21 billion over the \nnext 5 years.\n  So I think that, quite frankly, these are more than just a reduction \nin increases. You are going to have some real impact and effects in \nterms of what is happening in the local communities. That is what I am \ngetting when I travel around my State of Massachusetts from people who \nhave been working in the vineyards for a long period of time and have a \ngood understanding and awareness of the various programs and what they \nmean in terms of the local communities.\n  Of course, when we talk about Head Start programs, as my friend and \ncolleague from Illinois pointed out, we are only talking about 35 to 38 \npercent of the total eligible children who are receiving it. We are \nvery far behind the curve.\n  I think the Senator from Vermont reviewed that in greater detail, as \nwell as some of the other education priorities, such as the school \nnutrition programs.\n  Currently, schools participating in the lunch program are reimbursed \nfor every lunch served to a child. Children from families with incomes \nat or below 130 percent of the poverty level are eligible for free \nmeals. Children between 130 percent of poverty and 185 percent of \npoverty are eligible for reduced-price meals. Children over 185 percent \nof poverty pay full price.\n  The School Lunch Program operates in 95 percent of all public \nschools, representing 97 percent of all public school children. The \ncash reimbursement rates are $1.75 for each free meal, $1.35 for each \nreduced-price meal, and 17 cents for paid meals.\n  While reduced-price lunches must cost no more than 40 cents, no \nlimits are imposed on the amount of money that can be charged for a \nfull-price meal. Some 25 million children participate in the School \nLunch Program--at different levels, obviously, in terms of the support.\n  During the last recession, the number of school children receiving \nschool lunches increased by 1.2 million.\n  We are now, even on the school lunch programs that are talked about \nin the House, that slack will not be picked up automatically in the \nSchool Lunch Program, but will be up to the whim of the priorities in \nthe various States.\n  If we look at what has happened in the States, particularly with \nregard to children over the period of the last 10 years, 3 million more \nchildren are living in poverty in the last 4 years. No one can have a \ngreat deal of satisfaction that they are the ones whose needs will be \nattended to.\n  Currently, as the number of children eligible for free and reduced-\nprice meals increases, the amount of Federal funds spent on the program \nincreases. That is because we made a decision that meeting the \nnutritional needs of children is in our national interest and, \ntherefore, all children who are eligible for a free or reduced-price \nlunch will be offered one. That fundamental national commitment has \nbeen altered or changed with the Republican block grant proposal.\n  With the block grants proposal, it says, well, we will leave it up to \nthe States. We think the States will do that, but we are not saying, as \na matter of national policy here in the Senate of the United States, \nthat that is going to happen.\n  We might expect they will, we might hope they will, but we are not \nproviding them either with the resources to do it or the guarantees \nthat it will be done.\n  That is a major difference. We can quibble about all that we want in \nterms of what is happening, but the fact of the matter is, children \nwill not get that fundamental guarantee, which is so important.\n  As I mentioned, the House proposal reverses that decision. Instead of \nguaranteeing every child a hot lunch--subsidized, of course, for those \nwho cannot afford to pay for lunch--the House bill caps the amount of \nfunds available for school-based nutrition programs, including school \nlunch.\n  So if the Republican position prevails, there will be no guarantee \nthat a hungry child will be fed at school. There is no guarantee of \nthat. There is now. That is a fundamental difference. Once the funds \nare used up by the States, that is it. Children are not guaranteed a \nlunch.\n  In fact, since the nutritional standards will be repealed if the \nHouse position prevails, the children fed will not meet the basic \nnutritional standards. We are not only repealing the guarantee, but we \nare repealing the nutritional standards.\n  As we pointed out before, the savings, so to speak, are being used \nfor the tax cuts.\n  There is no flexibility built in for the economic emergencies, \nwhether national, State, or local emergencies, and regardless of their \nnature. We will have repealed the entitlement nature of the program, \nreplaced it with a cap amount of funding containing no adjustments for \nchanges in the economy, population growth, or food price increases.\n  Some supporters of the block grants proposal try to make the argument \nthat the block grants provide more children with school lunches. This \nis simply not plausible. To take a program that automatically provides \nschools with reimbursement for each child's meal based on a family \nincome and replace it with a program that does not guarantee each child \na meal, that does not adjust the funding based on the number of poor or \nlow-income children needing lunch, that does not adjust for food price \ngrowth, is a cut in the program. It is a cut in the program, any way \nthat you look at it.\n  If the number of poor and low-income children who need a school lunch \ngrows beyond the funding that is authorized, children will have to be \ndenied a free lunch or be required to pay more than they can afford, or \nreceive an inferior lunch. Or maybe those who can pay will pay two, \nthree, or four times as much as they do pay now, the sons and daughters \nof working families, as well.\n  Then we hear, well, there is more money in this program. More money \ncompared to what? Compared to what CBO estimates is necessary to \ncontinue providing lunches to all school children who need them, like \nwe do today?\n  No. According to the CBO, in fiscal year 1995, all child nutrition \nprograms are funded at about $11.6 billion. It is $7.6 billion for \nchild nutrition programs like school lunch, school breakfast program, \nsummer food service; $400 million for commodities; $17 million for \nspecial milk; $3.4 billion for WIC. Funding would drop to $11.3 billion \nin fiscal year 1996 under the House Republican proposal; $6.6 billion \nfor the school-based nutrition program and $4 billion for the family \nnutrition block grant.\n  That is a $300 million cut, without even looking at inflation, \nwithout even looking at the 5-year numbers, without even looking at the \nfact that beyond food price growth, the school age population itself \nwill grow by 4-percent to 6-percent during the next 5 years. And the 4 \npercent to 6 percent growth does not include adjustment for any type, \nin the event that the economy slows down or unemployment increases.\n  Mr. President, I just cannot accept that this is just a reduction \nhere on the funding of programs that are meeting our needs. They just \nare not doing it. That is true not only on the nutrition programs, but \nalso on the other programs.\n  I talked about the school lunch programs. And the rescission bill \nwill reduce, in addition to the $2.5 billion cut \n[[Page S5041]] from child care programs over 5 years in the House bill, \nwill deny 378,000 children child care.\n  There are only 750,000--this is part of the child care program, very \nsmall child care return--but looking at the current situation, only \n750,000 out of 8 million children eligible for child care currently \nreceive assistance.\n  Many States have waiting lists for child care assistance that are \nsimply astounding. GAO found waiting lists of 40,000 children in Texas \nand 255,000 children in California, taking as long as 2 or 3 years to \nget help in those States.\n  During 1993, Florida and Illinois each reported waiting lists of \n25,000 children. A recent report by the Urban Institute found that it \ncan take 5 years to get a child care slot in San Francisco. Birmingham, \nAL, alone has 5,000 families on a waiting list.\n  The idea that people can come to the floor and say, ``We are cutting \nthe existing child care program,'' that it has gone through the \nappropriations--we are trying to just have a very, very, modest return \nof a child care program, based upon those kinds of needs.\n  Try to find, for working families in my State of Massachusetts, child \ncare for $5,500. You will be lucky in any part of the State. Some are \nmore costly in a number of communities. At the same time, we are \nputting pressure on these same parents to move out of a welfare \nsituation--they may have small children and they want to work.\n  We have to ask, what is happening to the parents when they are not \nable to get child care? They are either not getting jobs or they are \nlocking up their kids, or they are getting completely inadequate \ncoverage for their children.\n  Quality child care creates opportunity and increases productivity--\nnot just for one generation, but for two generations.\n  The GAO recently reported that assistance with child care makes it \nmuch more likely that low-income mothers will be able to work. And no \nwonder. The costs of child care consume over a quarter of the income of \npoor working families, as compared with just 7 percent of the income of \nnonpoor families. Without child care assistance, it is virtually \nimpossible for many poor parents to go to work. What is happening out \nhere is they are cutting back on these programs even more.\n  Child care is not about giving parents a blank check. It is about \ngiving them a fair chance. Cutting children makes no sense. It will \nonly pass the real life tragedy of dependency on from this generation \nto the next.\n  Families cannot afford that--and neither can we. That is why I \nsupport the restoration of funding for child care assistance for \nworking families in the Daschle amendment.\n  The Senate rescission package also cuts $35 million from the WIC \nProgram, which provides nutrition assistance to 7 million low-income \nwomen and children. It has long received bipartisan support, because it \nsaves money in health costs in the long run by reducing the incidence \nof infant mortality and low-birthweight babies.\n  Since its inception, the WIC Program has been a stunning success. GAO \nhas found that it has saved $1 billion--$1 billion--in medical expenses \nthrough the age of 18. We have spent $300 million and saved $1 billion. \nIf that is not a wise investment for our Nation's children, I do not \nknow what is.\n  Yet as many as 70,000 fewer children will be served by the WIC \nProgram each month over a 12-month period as a result of this \nunjustifiable cut.\n  We are talking about, here, really is basically investment in \nchildren and good quality care. We are talking about WIC. We are \ntalking about the Head Start Program, chapter 1, the drug-free schools. \nThese are the programs we are trying to restore.\n  As I mentioned earlier in the course of the day, at a time when, \nevidently, we have seen the loss of $3.6 billion, that has been lost \nsomewhere in that conference, hopefully to be recovered at an early \ntime, many of us are out here trying to restore these programs which \nare lifelines to the children in this country, it underscores the \nimportance of the Daschle amendment.\n  In a March 7, 1995, Boston Globe editorial, Prof. T. Berry Brazelton \nof Harvard Medical School wrote:\n\n       Simply put, WIC works. And it works because it has forged \n     an effective combination of state and federal involvement. \n     The states administer the program, but under strict federal \n     guidelines that ensure high nutrition standards, clear focus \n     and consistent impact. The risk in our rush to right our \n     nation's fiscal house is a loss of the very guidelines that \n     have made WIC so successful.\n\n  Berry Brazelton, for those who have not either heard of him or read \nhis articles, or listened to him on interviews, everyone who knows of \nhis work with regard to children--he is really the Nation's favorite \npediatrician. He is just an extraordinary human being who has appeared \nbefore our committees over a number of years and his words should be \ncarefully considered and measured and, I think, adhered to.\n  Dr. Louis Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services in the \nBush administration, said in a Washington Post article:\n\n       . . . Among my concerns . . . is that we may inadvertently \n     strip programs of the national standards and guidelines that \n     make them work. In the case of WIC, nutrition requirements \n     guide the program toward better health, and Medicaid savings, \n     while avoiding the potential confusion associated with \n     creating a complex web of fifty state rules. Our children's \n     health is not defined by state boundaries. Our nutritional \n     standards should not be either.\n\n  He makes the point good nutrition in schools, the WIC programs, are \nmatters of national responsibility. The WIC Program, as I know our \nMembers understand, has been something that has been enormously \nimportant. There is a very modest return in the Daschle amendment for \nthat particular program.\n  Both the House and the Senate rescission packages hit at-risk youth \nvery hard: 80 percent of funding for year-round youth programs--the \nprincipal training and employment assistance for poor out-of-school \nyouth--would be cut. Overall youth funding would be cut by about 40 \npercent, and the number of youth served would be reduced by over half. \nThe impact of these rescissions is compounded by the likelihood that \nthe cuts may be permanent, meaning that for the next several years \nclose to a million fewer youth each year will be served.\n  We are in the process now of working to improve many of the youth \ntraining programs. We have 400,000 children every year who are dropping \nout of our high schools. They are a source of unrest in many of our \nlocal communities.\n  We have woefully too few programs or efforts to try to reach out to \nthese young people. What we are trying to work through now, with \nSenator Kassebaum, is to utilize the school-to-work programs for the 70 \npercent of the children who do not go on into higher education. We want \nto work with the private sector in a partnership to move these young \nmen and women into employment and also, as you develop those programs, \nto try to reach out to a number of the young people who may have \ndropped out of schools to bring them into the process as well.\n  If you emasculate the existing programs, our chance to once again \nreach out to young people who are basically those at the highest risk \nin terms of the criminal element in our society will not come to \nfruition. It is serious, important, bipartisan efforts that are being \nworked through now. It seems, with the dramatic kinds of cuts that are \nsuggested here, we will basically undermine, in a very significant way, \nsome of the very useful work I think can still take place.\n  Mr. President, I know others want to speak on the floor on these \nmeasures.\n  Let me just say I am very hopeful we will move towards the completion \nof the conference report, that we will have an opportunity to vote on a \nresolution, which will hopefully be supported by Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, that will address the tax loophole that has been \nidentified and which was addressed by the Finance Committee earlier. I \nhope that we will be afforded that opportunity, and that Republicans \nand Democrats together will work to support that resolution.\n  As we have heard, the majority leader and others, Republicans and \nDemocrats, say it is their desire to address it. I am more than glad to \ndo it. It is a sense of the Senate that:\n\n       The Congress of the United States shall act as quickly as \n     possible to amend the Internal Revenue Code to end the tax \n     avoidance by U.S. citizens to relinquish their United States \n     citizenship.\n\n  And the effective date of such amendment to the Internal Revenue Code \nshould be February 6, 1995.\n   [[Page S5042]] That statement has been incorporated by the majority \nleader, the chairman of the Finance Committee, the Senator from New \nYork, and others on the Finance Committee as they desire. I hope we \ncould either act on this resolution or a joint leadership resolution of \nthe majority and minority leaders that would incorporate that concept.\n  I do not believe there has to be additional debate and discussion \nabout it. We have had a chance to talk about it. Let us set a time to \nbe able to do it. Let us send a message at the time that we are going \nto be debating the rescission package and the Daschle amendment that we \ncan afford to cut these programs for children--WIC, the school lunch, \nthe Head Start Programs--but we still cannot agree to close the \nloophole that is worth $3.6 billion.\n  I think the American people just cannot and will not understand it. I \nam very hopeful that we will be able to do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for what he is talking to now of fundamental \nprograms that constitute investments--not spending--to save spending, \nto eliminate deficits. If there is one misgiving that we have with the \nongoing exercise of the Contract With America --and it is good to bring \nin a new group and have a tonic, to turn our attention to where savings \ncan be had--but in the zeal to try to bring about certain savings there \nis a mix of arrogance and more or less mob action pellmell for hell, \nlet us just cut it all, everything, without any idea of what really \nsaves money and what costs money.\n  For instance, for every dollar spent on women, infants and children \nfeeding we save at least $3. For every dollar spent on Head Start we \nsave $4.75. For every dollar spent on title I education for the \ndisadvantaged we save another $6.50.\n  And having experienced government over the years, I have learned what \nsaves money. For example, I had a problem 25 years ago with my own \nState on the subject of hunger and feeding. I had made a mistake as \nGovernor. I had not paid too much attention to the hungry. In fact, a \nrejoinder had been given to me by my friend, the senior Senator, \n``Well, there was hunger and the hungry in the days of Christ, and \nthere will be hunger in the days after we are long gone, and it is \nalmost a given.'' Not so. Not so at all.\n  At that time, I met and studied with those in the medical profession \nand in the nutrition discipline--Dr. Neville Scrimshaw at Harvard, Dr. \nCravioto at Cornell, later at Columbia University, and Dr. Charles \nUpton Lowe, the chairman of the Committee on Nutrition of the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics at that particular time. They had found that \nevery adult has 13 billion brain cells in the cortex, and 10 billion of \nthe 13 billion develop in the first 5 months in the mother's womb.\n  However, there is as much as 20 percent less cellular development of \nthose brain cells resulting from the lack of nutrition, the lack of \nsynthesis of those nerve cells, and the lack of protein. It is much \nlike taking a television set off the desk here and dropping it on the \nfloor, putting it back here, and turning it on. The hundreds of wires \nof circuitry do not join, do not connect. And in the field of brain \nmedicine, they call that organized or general brain damage. That child \nis stultified in the first 5 months in the mother's womb and comes into \nthis world with organic, or generalized, brain injury, lacking an \nability, if you please, to concentrate, to assimilate, to be educable \nin the fullest of senses.\n  So I joined with Senator Humphrey after he came out of the Vice \nPresidency back into the Senate. I was not on the Agriculture Committee \nat that time. But we talked of this problem that we had in women, \ninfants, and children's feeding. We found out that if we rendered \nprotein supplements for expectant mothers, which now cost in the \nvicinity of around $400 over the 9-month period, we could save \npractically $30,000.\n  I just visited in the university hospital in my own hometown, the \nChildren's Hospital at the Medical University of South Carolina. They \nhad some 85 low-birth-weight infants. In my early days they would have \nbeen unaccounted for and lost; little low-birth-weight infants of 1\\1/\n2\\ pounds, 2 pounds, 2\\1/2\\ pounds. They had nurses around the clock. I \nwill never forget it. It cost some $15 million to keep some 85 nurses \ngoing around the clock treating those little infants. The average stay \nfor a low-birth-weight infant on that incubator in intensive care is 30 \ndays at $1,000 a day, or $30,000.\n  So this is not a sick call by the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts for liberal spending programs. This is a studied \ninvestment by liberals, conservatives, Republicans, and Democrats alike \nto spend now to save billions later. That is the one misgiving I have \nabout this so-called Contract With America because its proponents have \nno sensibility. They come here on the first day and all of sudden they \nhave wisdom. Without any experience or a day in public service \nwhatever, never having listened and learned anything, in a fell swoop \nthey come in with across-the-board so-called spending cuts that \nactually will cost us billions.\n  Mr. President, when that baby comes in as a low-birth-weight infant, \nlike it or not, it is yours and mine. We are going to take care of it \nin some children's hospital, in some intensive care unit, and for the \nwealthy parent or the poor, that cost is really going to the general \npublic.\n  So we need to stop these penny-wise, pound-foolish cuts to preventive \nprograms. We should never think in terms of tax cuts here for \nbillionaires who have made their wealth in America and then renounce \ntheir citizenship in order to avoid taxes. It is almost a treasonous \nkind of activity in this Senator's mind and never should be dignified \nor recognized in law as a worthy project when we are going around \ncutting spending.\n  I am for cutting spending. I am for freezing spending. I am for \nclosing loopholes, and I am for taxes. I have challenged this body and \nall Senators to give me their realistic budget plans since January. I \nwill never forget the distinguished chairman on the House side of the \nBudget Committee, Congressman Kasich. On December 18, 1994, on a \nnational TV program he came on and said, ``Don't worry about it. We \ndon't care what the President puts in. We have three budgets before us. \nWe are going to introduce them. But before we have tax cuts in January \nwe are going to have the spending cuts and have this budget.''\n  Well, it is now April. It is going to be May or June before they get \naround to specifying their cuts. I met that particular challenge in \nJanuary. I worked with the best of minds. I have introduced a list of \ncuts in the Congressional Record at least four times by now that shows \nthat in order to get on a glidepath of balancing the budget by the year \n2002, you have to cut $37 billion in domestic discretionary spending in \nthe first year. Even with those reductions, the interest cost rises \nfaster than the cuts. That is the only good, solid, credible attempt I \nhave seen to show the kinds of cuts that are necessary, and I do not \nthink I could vote for them all. And cuts of even this severity would \nrequire 7 years to reach a balanced budget.\n  I remember when President Reagan came to town. He said he was going \nto balance the budget in 1 year. Then, after he got in town, he said, \n``Oops. This is way worse than I thought. It is going to take me 2, \nmaybe 3 years.'' So the Budget Committee started submitting 3-year \nbudgets. Then by the mid 1980's, the committee said ``Whoops, it got \nworse. We are going to have 5-year budgets.'' Now they have 7-year \nbudgets. And I can tell you, after a few more years, they are going to \nhave 10-year budgets. It is like a football game where they keep moving \nthe goalpost.\n  A sincere effort to balance the budget will not cut out basic \ninvestments that save money in the long run. Realistically, it is going \nto take taxes as well as spending cuts, spending freezes, and loophole \nclosings.\n  I think the Senator from Massachusetts has really brought a sobering \nmoment to this body that allows us to understand that the proposals \nbefore us do not save money. Oh, the national media, lazy as they are, \nare running around saying that this rescissions bill has so much in \nspending cuts, and they \n[[Page S5043]] refer to these fine investment programs as cuts. But I \ncan tell you, when you consider the costs to Medicaid, to the \nhospitals, to the schools, to the workplace and the economy, and on \ndown the line, you will find that the proposed cuts actually increase \nspending. This is the lesson of those children at the medical \nuniversity.\n  So I hope we can listen to this debate and understand that the Senate \nis not just in a race to get so many marks on the so-called Contract \nWith America or whatever it is. It is a serious job of trying to cut \nback on overall spending while investing in programs that will save \nmoney in the long run.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I strongly support the conference report \nto H.R. 831, the Self-Employed Health Care Deduction Act.\n  There are approximately 9 million self-employed business owners \nrepresenting almost 10 percent of the working population. These \nindividuals are employed in all types of industries: from mining and \nservice industries to construction and manufacturing. They are the \nentrepreneurial small business men and women that spur our national \neconomic growth. These are the individuals that embody the American \ndream. This provision is critical to their survival.\n  My offices have been inundated with hundreds of calls from concerned \ntaxpayers around Pennsylvania urging the Congress to reinstate the \ndeduction. These callers are just a fraction of the 9 million self-\nemployed taxpayers that are relying on us to pass this measure as \nquickly as possible so they can continue to utilize this deduction for \nthe 1994 tax year.\n  Mr. President, I have consistently supported this deduction for the \nself-employed. In the 103d and the 104th Congresses, I introduced \nlegislation to provide targeted health-care reform. One of the major \nprovisions I included in that bill was 100 percent deductibility for \nhealth insurance for the self-employed. Under current law, businesses \nare permitted to deduct 100 percent of what they pay for the health \ninsurance of their employees, but self-employed individuals may not \ndeduct any of their cost because that provision expired on December 31, \n1993. It is hard to find a provision in the Internal Revenue Code that \nis more discriminatory than this one.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, 3.9 million \nuninsured workers are self-employed. Providing full deductibility of \nhealth insurance premiums, beginning with reinstatement of the 25 \npercent deduction for 1994 and researching 100 percent by 1993 for \nself-employed individuals is a simple matter of fairness. It should \nalso make health insurance coverage more affordable for the estimated \n3.9 million self-employed individuals and their families who are now \nuninsured.\n  On January 19, 1995, I signed a letter along with 74 of my colleagues \nto Majority Leader Dole and Minority Leader Daschle urging them to \nreinstate this expired provision. I believed then, as I do now, that \nthe interests of hard-working Americans need to be a top priority \nbefore the U.S. Senate.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the reinstatement of \nthis provision. This legislation is an important first step in \nproviding tax fairness to our Nations' self-employed business owners.\n  I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Dole, the following statement was printed in \nthe Record.)\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce my \nstrong support for H.R. 831 which would permanently extend the \ndeduction for health insurance costs for self-employed individuals. \nThis legislation will allow, on a permanent basis, self-employed small \nbusiness owners, sole proprietorships, and partnerships to deduct a \nportion of their health insurance costs for tax purposes. This \nlegislation will assist those small businesses which are so vital to \nthe economy of my State of Oregon, as well as the rest of the Nation. I \nam pleased that the 104th Congress is about to address this issue on a \npermanent basis.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today we take a step forward to correct a \nsituation adversely affecting small businesses and farmers which I have \nmany times called an absurdity.\n  During this tax filing season, over 9 million self-employed small \nbusinesses and farmers will fill out their tax returns. And when they \ndo, they will learn first hand of how this absurdity affects them and \ntheir family. The absurdity I am speaking of Mr. President is that no \npart of their health insurance premiums are deductible in their 1994 \ntax return due April 17--just over 3 weeks from today.\n  This in contrast to owners of large corporations that have a \npermanent 100 percent deduction, and that typically pay smaller health \ncare premiums because of their size. It is a double penalty Mr. \nPresident. A double penalty on innovators and job creators in our \neconomy--people who should be encouraged, not penalized.\n  Mr. President, this inequity must be corrected and it must be \ncorrected quickly. This should be a high priority for this Congress, \nand I am very happy that we are taking up this matter today.\n  I want to comment briefly on one aspect of this bill which is \nextremely important--and that is this deduction for health insurance \nwill be made permanent.\n  Many times we focus on the amount of the percentage deduction. In the \npast it has been 25 percent, and today's bill increases that percentage \nto 30 percent which is a very positive step toward the goal of a 100 \npercent deduction which I hope we will continue to work toward. In \nfact, Senator Grassley, Senator Roth and I introduced legislation in \nJanuary of this year to achieve a 100 percent deduction by 1997, and I \nlook forward to working with them again in the future to meet this \ngoal.\n  But Mr. President, I cannot stress enough the importance of making \nthis deduction permanent, and this is borne out by the history of the \ndeduction.\n  In 1986, the self-employed were first given 25 percent deductibility \nas part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986--with the understanding that it \nwould be eventually increased to 100 percent, the same deduction \nincorporated business enjoy.\n  In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, the deduction was \nextended for 9 months. In 1990, 25 percent deductibility was extended \nthrough 1991. And in 1991, 25 percent deductibility was extended \nthrough June 30, 1992. Mr. President, each time we scrambled to \nreinstate the deduction--uncertainty surrounding the deduction was \nhigh, and it was shameful to treat the self-employed in this way.\n  But on June 30, 1992, the worst scenario happened--the deduction \nexpired. Small businesses and farmers could not deduct the cost of \ntheir health insurance. The 1992 tax season came and went and still \nthere was no reinstatement of the deduction because of the difficulty \nof moving any tax bill. Then, in August 1993, as part of the Budget \nReconciliation Act, the deduction was retroactively reinstated from \nJuly 1, 1992, to December 31, 1993. Self-employed were required to \namend their 1992 returns to take the deduction, and no doubt some \nfailed to do so and lost their deduction.\n  So that brings us to 1994 when the deduction once again expired, and \nno bill has been moved to correct the inequity--until today. Mr. \nPresident, this uncertainty is unpardonable and it must not happen \nagain. Under this legislation the deduction will never again expire--it \nis permanent.\n  Mr. President, we all understand the difficulty of moving a tax bill \non the Senate floor where any of the 100 Senators my offer any \namendment with no time limit. So that is why I and my friend and \ncolleague on the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, sought signatures on \na January 19, 1995, letter to Senator Dole and Senator Daschle stating \nthat we would ``not support or offer any amendments to the \nlegislation'' should they schedule it for Senate floor action.\n  We were pleased to obtain 75 of our colleagues' signatures, and I am \neven more pleased today that no amendments will be offered and we will \nagree to the bill on a voice vote. I ask unanimous consent that a copy \nof the letter be printed in the Record, and I thank my colleagues for \nputting aside some issues very important to them in order to correct \nthis problem and quickly as possible.\n  [[Page S5044]] There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     Senate Minority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole and Senator Daschle: We are writing to \n     you regarding the need to extend the 25% deduction for health \n     insurance for the self-employed, which expired at the end of \n     1993. As you know, more than 9 million self-employed business \n     owners, representing almost 10% of the working population, \n     lost the ability to take this deduction when the law expired. \n     It is our hope that the Chairman of the Ways and Means \n     Committee will soon take up this legislation as a stand-alone \n     bill, and that the House will soon pass this bill and send it \n     to the Senate.\n       In order that we may move as expeditiously as possible, we \n     are writing to assure you that if you receive this \n     legislation, and if you schedule it for Senate floor action, \n     we will not support or offer any amendments to the \n     legislation. As many of these small business men and women \n     begin to file their 1994 tax returns, we believe that it is \n     essential that Congress act now to avoid the administrative \n     difficulties that could arise from amended returns if the \n     legislation is not passed until after April 15th.

Mr. President, we have before us the conference report to \nH.R. 831, permanent deduction of health insurance costs of self-\nemployed individuals. Passage of this conference report today will help \n3.2 million self-employed Americans across the Nation get one step \ncloser to deducting a portion of their health insurance costs.\n  The House has already passed this conference report. There are only \n14 more days to April 17--tax day. And the clock's ticking. It is \ncritical that this bill be signed into law prior to that day.\n  Since 1986, Congress has allowed the self-employed a 25-percent \ndeduction for their health care insurance costs. Almost every year, we \nhave had to extend the deduction, but we failed to extend it last year \nwhen it expired on December 31, 1993. Mr. President, H.R. 831 makes the \ndeduction permanent. We don't want to leave the 3.2 million tax filers \nin 1994, hanging on the edge of a cliff every year. And we don't want \nto tell them that although corporations can deduct 100 percent of their \nhealth care insurance costs, small businesses cannot. We decided 9 \nyears ago that in order to make the playing field more equitable, we \nshould allow small businesses to deduct their health care insurance \ncosts. H.R. 831 allows them to deduct 30 percent of their annual health \ncare insurance costs.\n  Mr. President, I want to say to many of my colleagues that the 3.2 \nmillion Americans we help today are farmers and small business owners \nthat live and work all across America. Although we were able to raise \nthe percentage of their annual health insurance costs that they can \ndeduct from 25 to 30 percent, I am disappointed that we were unable to \nraise this level even higher. It was my strong desire that we should \nhave been able to do so. But, we have been able to make this deduction \na permanent one, so that these Americans will no longer have to worry \nabout whether or not they will be able to take the deduction next year.\n\n\n                          EXPATRIATE PROVISION\n\n  Mr. President, included in the Senate version of H.R. 831 was a \nproposal to tax U.S. citizens who renounce citizenship. But, the \nmeasure was adopted without the benefit of hearings.\n  Subsequently, the Finance Committee's Oversight Subcommittee held a \npreliminary hearing. The House also held a hearing on this issue \nearlier this week. This proposal raises important questions, and the \nhearing exposed some serious concerns.\n  It is vital to enact H.R. 831, vital. But it is premature to enact \nthis expatriate tax provision. We cannot delay action on H.R. 831 while \nwe continue to consider alternatives to this expatriate provision.\n  Let me be clear on this--because my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle seem to believe that we are somehow opponents of the \nexpatriate provision. We want to get this done. And it is clear that it \nwill be effective as of February 6--but there are some serious problems \nwith this provision, so we will not enact it today. The conferees on \nthe bill have asked the Joint Committee on Taxation to study the \nprovision and to look at other alternatives and get back to us by June \n1, 1995. And so, I would say to my colleagues that this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution, asking us to do what we are already doing, is \nnothing but a filibuster. A tactic to waste time that we can ill-\nafford.\n\n\n                          offsetting revenues\n\n  We primarily pay for the deduction by repealing a Federal \nCommunications Commission [FCC] program that I believe is not only \nineffective, but costs the Federal Government billions of dollars.\n\n\n                   the fcc's tax certificate program\n\n  Congress, in 1943, gave the FCC authority to grant tax deferrals to \nowners of broadcast facilities who were forced to sell their properties \nto break up monopolies during World War II.\n  In 1978, the FCC expanded this provision to give a tax preference to \nradio, television, and later cable broadcasters who sold their \nproperties to minority-owned firms. For this policy, the FCC defines \nminorities as including blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska \nNatives, Asians, and Pacific Islanders.\n  The greatest flaw in this program is that the economic benefit \ndoesn't go to the minority buyer, the economic benefit does to the \nseller. It's like a kickback. If you sell to me and not the other guy, \nI'll give you a little extra something. And I won't be paying for it, \nthe American taxpayer will. I don't understand it, and I don't \nunderstand why people would think this is benefiting\n minorities when the monetary gain is going to the seller.\n\n\n                           affirmative action\n\n  Now, don't get me wrong. I am proud of my civil rights record. And I \nhave supported affirmative action in the past--that's no secret. But my \nrecord does not disqualify me from raising legitimate questions about \nthe continuing fairness and effectiveness of affirmative action--\nparticularly when the affirmative-action label is used to describe \nquotas, set-asides, and other group preferences.\n  Equal treatment, not preferential treatment, should be the standard. \nEqual opportunity, not equal results, must be the goal.\n  Last week, as we debated this same bill on the Senate floor, my \ndistinguished colleague from Maine, Senator Cohen, gave a very eloquent \nspeech where he pointed out that America is not a color-blind society, \nand he's right.\n  Discrimination continues to exist. The color-blind ideal is just \nthat--an ideal that has yet to be achieved in the America of 1995. But, \nMr. President, do you become a color-blind society by dividing people \nby race? Do you achieve the color-blind ideal by granting preferences \nto people simply because they happen to belong to certain groups? Do \nyou continue programs that have outlived their usefulness or original \npurpose? The answer to these questions is, of course, a resounding \n``no.''\n  The debate over affirmative action can be an opportunity to unite the \nAmerican people--not divide us.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  What we will accomplish here today is taking a million dollar, \nunjustifiable tax break, for millionaires, not minorities, and turn \nthem into health care for ordinary Americans. Americans who really need \nit.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this conference report.\n\n[[Page S5045]]\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the conference \nreport?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would simply like to state for the \nRecord the fact that the Committee on Finance, in dealing with the \nprovisions on the payment of tax by persons who expatriate, was \nconfronted by mixed assessments of the legality of such an action.\n  The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the \nUnited States ratified in 1992, article 12, section 2 states: \n``Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own.'' The \nquestion is whether there is a restriction on this right.\n  The point here is that present law provides that any taxpayer that \nrenounces his or her citizenship for tax avoidance purposes is subject \nto the current tax on gains on U.S. assets for 10 years. This has been \nthe law for roughly 30 years, but it has not been enforced. It probably \nhas not been enforceable. Regulations have never been issued. And we \nmean to do, we mean to do.\n  The President proposed this on February 6 in his budget, and what we \nwill do in the end will be applied as of February 6. There will be no \nwindows, no provisions of that kind.\n  Just that the record might show that we have been trying to be \norderly and have had some sense of due process here, on 24 March, I \nreceived a letter from Hurst Hannum, associate professor of \ninternational law at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, of whose \neminence I need hardly to remind the Senate, in which he wrote to \nexpress his serious concern over the proposed exit tax and the issue \nwhich he had addressed in his 1987 book, ``The Right to Leave and \nReturn in International Law and Practice.''\n  We responded to him with information he wanted further on the matter. \nHe writes on March 31 to say:\n\n       As I noted then, what appeared to be the imposition of a \n     tax solely on the ground that a person was renouncing his or \n     her citizenship could interfere with the right . . . [under \n     article 12 of the Covenant].\n\n  He says, ``I am gratified that the human rights issues related to \nthis bill have become a subject of serious debate.''\n  I said on Friday--it was commented on in our hearing--when we are \ndealing with civil rights issues, human rights issues, we must never be \nmore careful than when the group involved is a despised group.\n  I very much regret that the daily talking points of the Democratic \nPolicy Committee today said what Democrats believe--``We believe that \neducation for our children should not be cut.'' Fine, I so agree. \n``Especially while billionaire Benedict Arnolds are allowed to escape \ntaxation.'' They are not going to escape taxation. I am not sure they \nare Benedict Arnolds. They are people making decisions that they have a \nright to make under international law, and the United States has the \nright to collect taxes from them, under our law.\n  We now have a letter from Professor Hannum that says:\n\n       In sum, imposition of a nondiscriminatory tax on accrued \n     income at the time citizenship is renounced, in a manner \n     consistent with the way in which that same income would be \n     treated at the time of death, does not appear to me to \n     violate either the internationally protected right to \n     emigrate or the (somewhat less well protected) right to a \n     nationality.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that the letters be printed in the Record, and I \nyield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Tufts University,\n\n                                      Medford, MA, March 24, 1995.\n     Re: Tax Compliance Act of 1995, H.R. 981.\n\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: I am writing to express my serious \n     concern over the proposed ``exit tax'' included in Sec. 201 \n     of H.R. 981. This concern is based not on an evaluation of \n     its tax consequences, an area in which I am not an expert, \n     but rather on the possible inconsistency of the tax with \n     fundamental international human rights norms and U.S. \n     international legal obligations.\n       As you know, the U.S. is now a party to the Covenant on \n     Civil and Political Rights, article 12 of which guarantees \n     the right of everyone ``to leave any country, including his \n     own.'' By coincidence, the United States will present its \n     first report on compliance with the Covenant to the Human \n     Rights Committee in New York next week.\n       Although I understand that the ``exit tax'' is based on \n     renunciation of citizenship rather than on leaving the \n     country, it is difficult to see how one can ``punish'' the \n     former without seriously compromising the latter. Indeed, the \n     imposition of confiscatory taxes has been a policy pursued by \n     many countries to discourage emigration, whether on purported \n     national security grounds, specious economic arguments, or to \n     prevent `'brain drain;'' I address these and other issues in \n     my 1987 book, ``The Right to Leave and Return in \n     International Law and Practice'' (Martinus Nijhoff).\n       In 1986, a meeting of eminent American and European legal \n     experts adopted the ``Strasbourg Declaration on the Right to \n     Leave and Return,'' a copy of which I attach for your \n     information. I would particularly draw your attention to \n     article 5, which states, inter alia, that ``[a]ny person \n     leaving a country shall be entitled to take out of that \n     counry . . . his or her personal property * * * [and] all \n     other property or the proceeds thereof, subject only to the \n     satisfaction of legal monetary obligations, such as \n     maintenance obligations to family members, and to general \n     controls imposed by law to safeguard the national economy, \n     provided that such controls do not have the effect of denying \n     the exercise of the right.'' The tax in question would not \n     appear to meet these standards.\n       Without having examined the provisions of Sec. 201 in \n     greater detail, I cannot state definitively that it would \n     violate international law. However, the human rights \n     implications of such a provision appear to be extremely \n     serious, and adoption of the law would seem, at best, to be \n     hypocritical, given the legitimate and consistent U.S. \n     insistence on free emigration from other countries over the \n     years.\n       I hope that the Senate will examine these issues with great \n     deliberation before it decides to balance the budget on the \n     back of individual rights.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                     Hurst Hannum,\n     Associate Professor of International Law.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               Appendix F\n\n        Strasbourg Declaration on the Right to Leave and Return\n\n                     (Adopted on 26 November 1986)\n\n\n                                preamble\n\n       The Meeting of Experts on the Right to Leave and Return,\n       Recognising that respect for human rights and fundamental \n     freedoms is essential for peace, justice and well-being and \n     is necessary to ensure the development of friendly relations \n     and co-operation among all states;\n       Recalling that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \n     the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and \n     the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms \n     of Racial Discrimination, as well as regional conventions, \n     recognize the fundamental principle, based on general \n     international law, that everyone has the right to leave any \n     country, including one's own, and to return to one's own \n     country;\n       Emphasizing that the right of everyone to leave any country \n     and to enter one's own country is indispensable for the full \n     enjoyment of all civil, political, economic, social and \n     cultural rights;\n       Concerned that the denial of this right is the cause of \n     widespread human suffering, a source of international \n     tensions, and an object of international concern;\n       Adopts the following Declaration:\n\n                               Article 1\n\n       Everyone has the right to leave any country, including \n     one's own, temporarily or permanently, and to enter one's own \n     country, without distinction as to race, colour, sex, \n     language, religion, political or other opinion, national or \n     social origin, property, birth, marriage, age (except for \n     unemancipated minors independently of their parents), or \n     other status.\n\n                               Article 2\n\n       Every state shall adopt such legislative or other measures \n     as may be necessary to ensure the full and effective \n     enjoyment of the rights set forth in this Declaration.\n       All laws, administrative regulations or other provisions \n     affecting the enjoyment of these rights shall be published \n     and made easily accessible.\n                               Article 3\n\n       (a) No person shall be subjected to any sanction, penalty, \n     reprisal or harrassment for seeking to exercise or for \n     exercising the right to leave a country, such as acts which \n     adversely affect, inter alia, employment, housing, residence \n     status or social, economic or educational benefits.\n       (b) No person shall be required to renounce his or her \n     nationality in order to leave a country, nor shall a person \n     be deprived of nationality for seeking to exercise or for \n     exercising the right to leave a country.\n       [[Page S5046]] (c) No person shall be denied the right to \n     leave a country on the grounds that that person wishes to \n     renounce or has renounced his or her nationality.\n\n                               Article 4\n\n       (a) No restriction may be imposed on the right to leave \n     except those which are\n       (1) provided by law;\n       (2) necessary to protect national security, public order \n     (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and \n     freedoms of others; and\n       (3) consistent with internationally recognized human rights \n     and other international legal obligations.\n       Any such restriction shall be narrowly construed.\n       (b) Any restriction on the right to leave shall be clear, \n     specific and not subject to arbitrary application.\n       (c) A restriction shall be considered ``necessary'' only if \n     it responds to a pressing public and social need, pursues a \n     legitimate aim and is proportionate to that aim.\n       (d) A restriction based on ``national security'' may be \n     invoked only in situations where the exercise of the right \n     poses a clear, imminent and serious danger to the State. When \n     this restriction is invoked on the ground that an individual \n     acquired military secrets, the restriction shall be \n     applicable only for a limited time, appropriate to the \n     specific circumstances, which should not be more than five \n     years after the individual acquired such secrets.\n       (e) A restriction based on ``public order (ordre public)'' \n     shall be directly related to the specific interest which is \n     sought to be protected. ``Public order (ordre public)'' means \n     the universally accepted fundamental principles, consistent \n     with respect for human rights, on which a democratic society \n     is based.\n       (f) A restriction based on ``the rights and freedoms of \n     others'' shall not imply that relatives (except for parents \n     with respect to unemancipated minors), employers or other \n     persons may prevent, by withholding their consent, the \n     departure of any person seeking to leave a country.\n       (g) No fees, taxes or other exactions shall be imposed for \n     seeking to exercise or exercising the right to leave a \n     country, with the exception of nominal fees related to travel \n     documents.\n       h) Permissibility of restrictions on the right to leave is \n     subject to international scrutiny.

Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: I wrote you on 24 March expressing \n     my concern over the possible human rights implications of the \n     so-called ``exit tax'' called for in the above-referenced \n     bill. As I noted then, what appeared to be the imposition of \n     a tax solely on the ground that a person was renouncing his \n     or her citizenship could interfere with the right of every \n     person ``to leave any country, including his own,'' which is \n     guaranteed under article 12 of the Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights.\n       I am gratified that the human rights issues related to this \n     bill have become a subject of serious debate, and I \n     appreciate your contribution to that debate. Having now \n     received additional and more specific information about the \n     tax, however, I have become convinced that neither its \n     intention nor its effect would violate present U.S. \n     obligations under international law.\n       Although imposition of a special tax on those who wished to \n     renounce U.S. citizenship might be questionable, it is my \n     understanding that the tax in question is based on accrued \n     income and, in effect, treats renunciation of citizenship as \n     the financial equivalent of death for the purpose of \n     attaching tax liability. There are undoubtedly negative \n     consequences to the individual concerned in having to pay \n     taxes on gains while he or she is alive rather than after \n     death, but there is no internationally protected right to \n     escape taxation by changing citizenship. However, in order to \n     clarify that the purpose and effect of the proposed tax are \n     non-discriminatory, the language might be rewritten to offer \n     the individual the option of complying with the new tax or \n     electing to have realized gains taxed only as part of the \n     individual's estate--subject to an appropriate escrow account \n     being established for money which would otherwise be expected \n     to be beyond U.S. jurisdiction at the time of death.\n       In sum, imposition of a non-discriminatory tax on accrued \n     income at the time citizenship is renounced, in a manner \n     consistent with the way in which that same income would be \n     treated at the time of death, does not appear to me to \n     violate either the internationally protected right to \n     emigrate or the (somewhat less well protected) right to a \n     nationality.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to clarify my views on this \n     important matter.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                     Hurst Hannum,\n                         Associate Professor of International Law.\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I must rise today to support a program that some in \nthis body may argue is unnecessary, but that the American people \nwholeheartedly support.\n  As we debate the very difficult question of eliminating funds to \nvarious agencies, it frustrates me that some of my colleagues blindly \nlump the Corporation for Public Broadcasting into a general pool of \nrescissions.\n  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a true public service, \nowned by the American people. What other Government program can we \nclaim reaches 99 percent of all Americans?\n  Since 1967, CPB has developed public telecommunications services of \nthe highest quality to serve the American people. All of us on this \nfloor agonize over what serves the taxpayer most.\n  Certainly, public broadcasting has proven itself as a national asset \nsupporting television and radio stations in all 50 States, the District \nof Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.\n  Last year, CPB funded 351 public television stations and 629 public \nradio stations. Each week NPR touches the lives of 16 million listeners \nand more than 100 million viewers tune in to PBS weekly.\n  The numbers show that CPB is a Government program that works, and \nserves the people of this country. It is one program where the American \ntaxpayer is actually seeing a return on their dollar.\n  But is CPB a luxury? In these days of deficit reduction, can we \nafford this service? In thinking about this question, I have reflected \nback on my role as a mother and teacher.\n  I am not independently wealthy and have been faced with balancing a \ncheckbook my entire life. When times are tough, everyone suffers, but \nnever have I sacrificed the education of my children.\n  All parents worry about the uncertain future of their sons or \ndaughters. Frankly, that is why I am so committed to continued funding \nfor the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n  Education is at the heart of what public broadcasting does. CPB \nreaches almost every home, school, and business in America to make \nimportant learning resources available.\n  CPB is dedicated to helping and inspiring learners of all ages, in \nschools, at colleges and universities, at work, and at home.\n  Public broadcasting is not subsidized television but rather \naccessible education. More than three-quarters of the country's public \ntelevision stations offer for-credit adult courses at various levels.\n  Since 1981, 2.8 million people have taken public broadcasting \ntelecourses for college\n credit. Over 29 million students in over 70,000 schools receive public \nTV as an educational resource. Of the top 10 television programs used \nby teachers in the classroom, 6 are from public TV.\n\n  Sure, some may classify public broadcasting as entertainment. I even \nadmit that I became absorbed in ``The Civil War'' and rushed home to \ncatch ``Baseball.'' But therein lies the secret of public broadcasting. \nIts ability to education while holding our attention.\n  From ``The Electric Company'' to ``MacNeil-Lehrer,'' from ``Carmen \nSandiego'' to ``Great Performances,'' CPB has captivated audiences and \nprovided an educational alternative to network television.\n  Children today need the same educational stimulation my children had \naccess to, if not more so. Changing family structures and working \nparents mean more and more children are left home alone. These are the \nchildren dependent upon ``Sesame Street'' and ``Barney'' for guidance, \neducation and solace. If there is no one at home to pull the kids away \nfrom the set, or to choose programming, can't the Government at least \nprovide an accessible alternative which stimulates learning?\n  The average public television station airs more than 5 hours of \nquality, noncommercial children's programming every single day and 22.4 \nmillion children watch public television each week. The futures of \nthese children can be dramatically shaped by the programs they watch \neach day.\n  Remember that 1 year of programming from PBS and NPR, costs each U.S. \ncitizen just $1.09. Less than a penny a day. In fact, CPB's entire \nannual budget equals what the networks make in just 15 minutes of Super \nBowl commercials.\n  More than 95 percent of CPB funds go back to communities nationwide \nas support for their broadcast operations. More importantly, for every \n$1 of Federal funding directed through CPB, stations raise more than $6 \nfrom other sources.\n  I urge my colleagues on their next visit home to tune in a publicly \nsupported station within their State. Radio stations such as KPBX in \nSpokane and KFAE in Richland and television stations like KCTS in \nSeattle and KYVE in Yakima will prove to you how far a minimal Federal \ninvestment can be stretched.\n  Mr. President, the question here is should there be public \ntelevision. My answer is a solid, loud yes.\n  Just as we have public schools, public libraries, public roads, and \npublic parks, we should have public television.\n  ``Public'' means we, you, and I, own it. We have a say. We have \ninput. We have access.\n  To only have private television means that those who can afford to \nown the airwaves will decide what we watch and who can watch. Someone \nelse, someone with the wealth to afford it, will decide what opinions \nwill be aired and whose words will be heard.\n  I believe it is imperative that the public have access and input to \nthe airwaves.\n  Let us not be the Congress that is known as the one who took the \npublic out of television.\n  Let this Congress be remembered for turning the tide on the deficit, \nbut let us do so without sacrificing our children, their education and \ntheir future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5047-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5047-S5048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE FOURTH ANNUAL FIREFIGHTERS CHALLENGE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

We are prepared to make the \nreadiness argument with this President any time he wishes on why we \nneed the supplemental appropriations. The President sent me a letter. I \nthink I received it Saturday morning, and I responded Saturday \nafternoon to the President's letter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent those two letters be printed \nin the Record at this point just so we would have a record made.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Port-au-Prince, March 31, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I am writing to urge you to take prompt \n     action on the supplemental appropriations bill for the \n     Department of Defense. I know that you and all Members of \n     Congress have been working at a heavy pace the past three \n     months and that you have many issues on your agenda. But I \n     know you share the view that it is extremely important that \n     the defense supplemental be addressed before Congress \n     adjourns next Friday.\n       Both the House and Senate have passed defense supplemental \n     appropriations to pay for ongoing contingency operations. I \n     applaud those actions and agree with the Senate's decision to \n     meet our full commitment to Jordan, in furtherance of the \n     Middle East peace process, in this legislation. \n     Unfortunately, these matters seem tied up in the Conference, \n     and a deadline is looming that requires immediate \n     congressional action to recognize the emergency nature of \n     this supplemental bill and minimize offsetting reductions.\n       Secretary Perry and General Shalikashvili have repeatedly \n     told me and have reported to Congress that unless \n     supplemental funds were appropriated by March 31, the \n     readiness of our Armed Forces would be adversely affected. \n     That deadline has not been met. As you know, Secretary Perry \n     has told Congress that he will be forced to take specific \n     actions that will impair the readiness of our forces if \n     Congress fails to act by April 7. I realize the respective \n     committees are meeting and are making some progress, but the \n     Conference is still not resolved and time is very short.\n       I am also concerned about reports that the emergency \n     defense supplemental may be combined with rescission \n     legislation now pending before you. I know you will not \n     permit the Congress to hold the readiness of our Armed Forces \n     hostage to other debates. It is imperative that the Congress \n     approve the supplemental before you adjourn for the Easter/\n     Passover recess.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                Office of the Majority Leader,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 1, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As you know, many of my colleagues in \n     the Congress have long voiced concerns about the declining \n     readiness of our Armed Forces and its impact on the brave men \n     and women who so proudly serve. We have warned that the \n     severe defense cuts imposed by your Administration compounded \n     by costly ``peacekeeping'' operations, neither authorized nor \n     approved by Congress, will drain the readiness accounts and \n     strain our military preparedness. Indeed, these pressures \n     have already manifested themselves in unacceptable readiness \n     ratings for three Army divisions as early as last November. \n     Further, I remind you that several of my colleagues began \n     exhorting Secretary Perry and General Shalikashvili to send \n     us their defense request as early as possible, but for some \n     unexplained reason your Administration delayed that action \n     until mid February with the submission of your budget. Our \n     continued warnings have consistently fallen on deaf ears. Now \n     that a severe readiness crisis is upon us, I am hard pressed \n     to see this as the fault of the Congress. Your decision to \n     blame the Congress for any delays and the impending readiness \n     crisis is unfortunate.\n       Although we have been hampered by a laundry list of \n     amendments offered by members of your party, the House and \n     Senate have taken quick action on your defense supplemental \n     request. The delay in submission coupled with Congressional \n     desires to pay for these costs rather than add them to the \n     debt has made our job more difficult. However, as you point \n     out, we are now in conference and I am hopeful to bring final \n     action before the Easter/Passover recess. As to whether the \n     Congress will choose to combine your defense supplemental and \n     your domestic supplemental request will be a matter that we \n     will decide early next week. The readiness of our Armed \n     Forces is important to all of us as is reducing the deficit, \n     responding to emergency needs in California, and supporting \n     the peace process in the Middle East. Your leadership on \n     these matters would be useful in helping to limit the number \n     of extraneous amendments offered and in bringing all of these \n     issues to an early and acceptable conclusion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Bob Dole.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. It may be that the White House has no interest in the \npending supplemental legislation. If they do not, I do not know why we \nare here, why we are going to debate 97 amendments so certain people \ncan score political points. On every amendment offered on that side \nfrom now on there will be a second-degree amendment. It seems to me \nthat is about the only way to make certain both sides are protected \nhere. Because we have had all this talk about how the Democrats are so \nconcerned about children and we do not care about children, we are not \nsensitive to children. I wonder where they were on the balanced budget \namendment when we asked just one more Democrat to vote for a balanced \nbudget amendment so we might protect our children over the next 5, 10, \n15, 25 years, but we did not have any response to the argument then.\n  So now we are seeing efforts to put a little back here and a little \nhere, even though there are increases in all these programs, so the \nliberal press will write the right spin on the story that the Democrats \nare protecting children and, of course, we are depriving children of \nfood and medication and about anything else you could believe. I am \ncertain the liberal press will put that spin on it, as it always has in \nthe past.\n  So it is my view there should not be anything else happening on the \nbill unless there is going to be debate on the primary amendment from \nthat side, the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Daschle, and the amendment offered by this side, \nby the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, and others.\n  I am prepared to get consent that we have the debate, time divided \nequally between now and 6 o'clock. Then at 6:15 we debate whether or \nnot elephants can come to the Capitol. We may have to take a rollcall \nvote. But that will be 1 hour of debate, and the vote--we have not \ndetermined yet, hopefully it will not come until tomorrow morning.\n  I know the Senator from Massachusetts was here on Friday. He is here \nagain today. He wants to offer his amendment even though I do not think \nit is necessary. I think we are all for the amendment.\n  But if it is offered, it probably will be second-degreed and then we \nwill be right back in the same predicament we are in now. I hope the \nSenator from Massachusetts will let me and the Democratic leader try to \nwork out some agreement where the Senator from Massachusetts would be \npermitted to offer the amendment. I do not have any problem with that. \nIn fact, I support the amendment. So I do not want to be misunderstood.\n  Is there any way we could accommodate the Senator from Massachusetts \nand not offer the amendment today but let us proceed on the debate so \nat least we could have the debate? We are now working with the White \nHouse, with the Democratic leader, with our office \n[[Page S5049]] to see--if we cannot get any agreement, then none of the \namendments will pass in any event.\n  So I hope we could be permitted to have general debate equally \ndivided between now and 6:15, by sponsoring of the two major \namendments. And then at 6:15, the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator \nSmith, will be recognized to offer his amendment on House Concurent \nResolution 34.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader that I know \nthe majority leader had said on Thursday evening that he was hopeful \nthe amendment of the Senator from South Dakota would be up and he \nthought at that time it might have been disposed of on Friday. There \nwas certainly no objection from me on that. I thought that was probably \ngoing to be the case. Now the Senator has pointed out that we have both \nthe Daschle and the Dole amendments before the Senate.\n  I have indicated that I was quite prepared to just send my amendment \nto the desk, have it printed, and after we had disposed of the \nprincipal amendments of Senator Dole and Senator Daschle, I would hope \nthat we would be able to consider my amendment. But I would obviously \nrespond to the request of the joint leadership in terms of working out \nan appropriate time. I am more than glad to do this, recognizing that \nwe have a great deal of business before the Senate prior to the recess.\n  Mr. DOLE. If the Senator will yield, I understand the Senator will \nhave it printed today but it will not be offered today.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have talked on it quite a bit, Mr. President. I am not \nsure that I really have to take any more time on it. I would be glad to \nsend the resolution to the desk. Obviously, it would be a matter before \nthe Senate. I would like to get it printed. I would send it to the desk \nand have it printed, and then I would be glad to work out with the \nmajority leader and the minority leader the time when we could consider \nit. I am more than glad to accommodate. If we wanted to do it at the \nconclusion of the other two amendments, that would be fine.\n  I can assure the leader that I do not think it will take any more \nthan 5 or 10 minutes equally divided to dispose of it. I will be glad \nto give an assurance to the leader and to Senator Daschle that we would \nnot consider it until after the disposition of at least the two current \namendments. They really are the heart and the thrust of the issue here, \nand they are our first priority. I think they are enormously important, \nand we ought to consider them.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield further? The \nDemocratic leader indicated to me that he was prepared to vote on the \nD'Amato amendment, which indicates that he must have the votes to \ntable. Would there be any objection to having it follow the vote on the \nD'Amato amendment, because his amendment was pending prior?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand from the floor staff that Senator Daschle \nhas indicated willingness to go to the vote on D'Amato tomorrow, and it \nis entirely acceptable to me to vote right after the D'Amato amendment \non this amendment, if that is agreeable.\n  Mr. DOLE. The caveat, Mr. President, would be if we decided to pull \nthe bill down because there are so many amendments. I do not want \nanybody to be blindsided. But it could happen, with 97 amendments, \nwhich would take quite a while, that we might just pull the bill down \nuntil after the recess. As long as the Senator understood that, I think \nwe have an agreement. He could send it to the desk now, and have it \nprinted with an understanding that following the vote on the D'Amato \namendment, disposition of the D'Amato amendment, the Senator be \nrecognized for a vote on his amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk, and ask \nthat it be printed in the Record for the information of Senators.\n  It is my understanding that we will have the vote on the D'Amato \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the amendment text was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAX AVOIDANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     Congress should act as quickly as possible to amend the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to eliminate the ability of \n     persons to avoid taxes by relinquishing their United States \n     citizenship.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is satisfactory.\n  Mr. DOLE. As I said, the only exception would occur----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand what the Senator said. It could be \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think there is a serious effort by the \nDemocratic and Republican leaders and the White House to try to see if \nwe can bring this to closure. If we cannot, we will pull the bill down. \nIf we can, we will try to finish it tomorrow evening. There is no way \nwe can finish it with 97 amendments. That would take the rest of this \nweek and all of next week, and I have something else planned for next \nweek. In any event, many other Senators have plans for next week.\n  I wonder if it would be all right, between now and 6:15, the time \nequally divided.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--this has been cleared by the \nDemocratic leader--that all time between now and 6:15 p.m. be equally \ndivided between the Democratic leader and Senator Ashcroft, or their \ndesignees, for debate on the Daschle and Dole amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I further ask unanimous consent that at 6:15, whenever the \nSenator from New Hampshire is available, during that timeframe, that we \nproceed to House Concurrent Resolution 34, and that Senator Smith be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5048-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

The clerk will report the bill.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1158) making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations for additional disaster assistance and making \n     rescissions for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1995, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would like to speak to the proposal \nthat is before the Senate, and specifically I want to refer to a \nReuter's news account that was issued this morning. I am going to read \nfrom the account. It says:\n\n       This administration believes a strong dollar is in \n     America's interest, and we remain committed to strengthening \n     the economic fundamentals that are ultimately important to \n     maintaining a strong and stable currency.\n\n  That quote, Mr. President, is from our Treasury Secretary, Robert \nRubin. The story goes on, however, and says that the currency market \ndid not pay any attention to our Secretary of the Treasury driving the \ndollar down to yet another record low against the Japanese yen. Since \nthe start of the year, the dollar has plunged more than 13 percent \nagainst the yen.\n  The story goes on and says that America's bulging budget--bulging \nbudget--and trade deficits to its shrinking savings rate is driving the \ncurrency lower, and Washington--that is us--seems unable or unwilling \nto do anything about it.\n  Mr. President, Chairman Greenspan recently called the falling dollar \n``unwelcome and troublesome.'' He said just recently that ``Foreign \nmarkets were increasingly distressed about the huge amounts of \nWashington borrowing to pay for deficit spending.''\n   [[Page S5050]] The central bank chief--that is, Alan Greenspan--also \nlinked last week's projection--now 2 weeks ago--of the balanced budget \namendment by the Senate with the latest troubles facing our dollar.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury has gone before the world to try to \nstrengthen the dollar, and the world did not pay any attention. The \nChairman of the Federal Reserve said our dollar has suffered from the \nfailure to pass the balanced budget amendment and it is destabilizing \nour currency.\n  In deference to time, Mr. President, I am not going to read from the \nseven different economists who are defining the problem with our \ncurrency as being directly related, as the Reuter's story acknowledged, \nto our budget deficits; more importantly, to our unwillingness to do \nanything about it, to the defeat of the balanced budget amendment and \nto spiraling trade deficits.\n  Last week, in front of Emory University students in Atlanta, my home \ncity and State, the President and this same Secretary tried to tell \nthose students and America that we really are operating an operational \nsurplus. I said at the time that was not factual and, more important, \nit was harmful because by telling the Nation we have an operational \nsurplus, you are sapping the will of this country to do the things it \nneeds to do.\n  Mr. President, in light of these reports about the falling dollar \ntoday, I would like to call on the President of the United States to \nchange his mind and call on the Congress to pass a balanced budget \namendment. That is one of the strongest actions; these statements \nbefore the world are not having an effect. The world saw us defeat the \nbalanced budget amendment. The world saw the President's budgets with \n$200 billion deficits as far as the eye can see. The world is watching \nus argue about these minimal cuts right here today. Mr. President, the \nPresident should call on the six Senators on the other side of the \naisle that voted for a balanced budget amendment 1 year ago who changed \ntheir mind this year, who participated in what is now happening to our \ncurrency worldwide. And the best short-term signal we could send to \nthis world about our currency is that we are going to stand up and pass \na balanced budget amendment and send it to the States for ratification.\n  The Senators from New Mexico, North Dakota, California, Kentucky, and \nSouth Carolina decided to vote against it this year. They voted for it \nlast year. The President said he was for a balanced budget ``but.'' And \nI would suggest to you, Mr. President, that the world has taken more \nnotice of the word ``but'' than any of the other things that are \nemanating from the administration such as we really have an operational \nsurplus.\n  For Heaven sakes. By the way, the reason they calculated that was \nthey said you would not have to add in our interest on debt and then we \nwould have a surplus.\n  I was speaking to a group of business people today, and I said:\n\n       You remember when you went before the loan officer and the \n     loan officer said, ``I am sorry; I can't loan you any more \n     money because of your financial statement.'' And you turned \n     to the loan officer and said, ``Well, if you just forget the \n     interest payments I am making to you, I would have a great \n     financial statement.'' You know what the reaction of that \n     loan officer would be.\n\n  Mr. President, the world has taken note of the, ``I'm for a balanced \nbudget but I am going to oppose a balanced budget amendment. I am going \nto submit budgets to the Congress and to the people with huge and \nunending deficits.'' And the quickest way we could turn this around \nwould be for the President to call the leaders of this Senate and say, \n``Pass it.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I would like to get back \nto what I believe is the business before us. Are we on the Daschle \namendment as amended by the Dole amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. It seems as if we have been at this for \nsome time, and we have had some very enlightening discussions in other \nareas, but this bill, which the distinguished Senator from South Dakota \nseeks to amend, is an extremely important one. I spent some time last \nweek presenting the details of this measure and talking about reasons \nwhy it was necessary for us to rescind budget authority and outlays for \nthe coming year. Having made those points, I do not want to make them \nagain. I wish to instead focus on some of the basic underlying \nassumptions in the Daschle amendment.\n  You will recall that this bill as we reported it out of the \nAppropriations Committee provides in the current year and next year \nabout $6.7 billion for the California disaster relief effort. The \nDaschle amendment cuts $1.3 billion out of that.\n  Mr. President, I would have to say what a difference a week makes, \nbecause last week we heard from our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle that what we needed was an across-the-board cut in all Federal \nagencies as an emergency step in order to pay for the terrible natural \ndisasters which have afflicted the country this past year. In \nparticular, we heard a very compelling argument from the Senator from \nCalifornia about the tragedies in her State and the need to provide the \nmoney so that the residents of California would get their lives and \ncommunities back together. Thus, they offered an amendment to provide \n$6.7 billion in disaster funding and cut elsewhere across the board.\n  Today, it appears maybe they do not need all that money. Today, just \na few days later, the terrible California disaster described so \neloquently is not going to require the $6.7 billion it did last week. \nNow they only require $5.4 billion. Never have I seen $1 billion saved \nquite so quickly.\n  I had to ask myself why. Well, I soon discovered it is not that they \nreally want to save that money. Instead they want to spend it on some \nof their and the President's favorite programs. Today, instead of \nsetting the money aside to help disaster victims, they want to raid a \nrainy day fund and spend it on so-called volunteers or throw more money \nat HUD, an agency in the midst of its own financial and management \ndisaster. It is no wonder that many of my colleagues agree with the \nCongressional Budget Office's analysis of what happens when a rainy day \nfund for disasters is set up. I believe we ought to set money aside, \nbut there are some questions I have about setting it up.\n  Let me quote from the disaster task force report which was issued \nonly 3 weeks ago. I had the pleasure of serving with the distinguished \nSenator, Mr. Glenn, from Ohio as co-chair of that disaster task force. \nWe brought together all of the information on disasters and asked the \nagencies--CBO, GAO, CRS--about what we might do. In that disaster task \nforce report prepared by the agencies there was a very prophetic \nstatement. Our report said:\n\n       A tendency to spend accumulated funds might be a problem \n     unless the law restricted the types of disasters that would \n     qualify. Policymakers could become tempted to be more \n     generous in relieving small disasters or to raid the fund for \n     spending in other programs.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, that kind of looks to me like what we had. Only \n3 weeks from the report and days from the discussion of the rainy day \nfund the first raid is being attempted on disaster relief.\n  So let me tell my colleagues, if this is what we can expect, regular, \nsystematic raids on the disaster relief fund to pay for political \ngoals, then I for one, this Senator, is not going to support any sort \nof rainy day fund.\n  What kind of discipline does this show to the American people, that \njust days after arguing for a $6.7 billion rainy day disaster fund, the \nsame people now want to raid the fund for other purposes? How many \nfamilies set aside funds for emergencies and then successfully resist \nthe temptation to raid them? How many communities and small businesses \nset aside funds and then successfully resist the temptation to just dip \nin a little more for some reason? But not our colleagues here today. \nThey view the disaster relief fund as a honey pot which lets them avoid \ntough choices of where else to cut in order to spend more on the \nprograms they like.\n  Instead of standing up and saying, ``We don't like your proposed \nspending cuts; here are ours to replace them,'' our friends on the \nother side of the \n[[Page S5051]] aisle, once again show their colors on spending cuts. \nThey say, ``We want to spend first and worry about the deficit and the \ndebt later on''.\n  Again, I go back to the prophetic words of the disaster relief task \nforce. In that report the agency said:\n\n       Requiring the Congress to cut spending and other programs \n     would raise the political cost of providing disaster relief. \n     Now, increases in disaster relief increase the budget \n     deficit, which may impede economic growth over the long term. \n     But the effects on the standard of living of future \n     generations have far less direct influence on political \n     decisions than having to cut programs this year or next year.\n\n  No wonder our debt is nearly $5 trillion. No wonder the President's \nbudget thought it would be OK to leave the deficit at $200 billion a \nyear for the next 5 years, adding another $1 trillion to our national \ndebt. This is a debt, Mr. President, that threatens our economic \nstability.\n  Our distinguished colleague from Georgia has already spoken about \nwhat judgment the international financial markets are passing on the \nvalue of the dollar. And it is because we just do not seem to be too \nconcerned about adding another little $1 trillion to our national debt.\n  Well, Mr. President, I think it is very serious for our economy and \nit is very serious for our children and grandchildren who are going to \nbe carrying the burden of that debt on their credit card.\n  Let me speak about one particular aspect of the Daschle amendment. I \nwant to focus on that for, I hope, the enlightenment, perhaps, of my \ncolleagues. But maybe they all know it.\n  I want to focus on the proposal to restore national service funding. \nI believe this issue highlights the fundamental differences between \nthose who would shrink Government and those who still believe in \nbusiness as usual.\n  The bill before us proposed a cut of $210 million to bring AmeriCorps \nand other new programs authorized by the 1993 National and Community \nService Act back to the fiscal year 1994 level. The fiscal year 1995 \nappropriation for this year was $575 million; the rescission currently \nin the bill would bring that funding level back to $365 million. The \nNational Service Corporation had hoped to have 33,000 volunteers \nenrolled by the end of fiscal year 1995. The bill before us, as \nreported out of committee, would keep the number of volunteers--and I \nsay ``volunteers'' in quotes--at about 20,000. I urge my colleagues to \nvote against the Daschle amendment for the additional reason because I \ndo not believe the increase in funds for AmeriCorps is justified.\n  The cut we have proposed is legitimate. We are not gutting the \nprogram, as some have suggested. The corporation actually received a \nhuge increase for the current fiscal year over the fiscal year 1994 \nlevel. They had $365 million in fiscal year 1994 for AmeriCorps grants, \neducation awards, technical assistance, and related activities. They \nreceived $575 million in last year's appropriation for the current \nfiscal year. That is a 58-percent increase for an untested program. I \nhave not seen any increase of that level in any other discretionary \nprogram. At a time when we are running budget deficits of hundreds of \nbillions of dollars each year on top of a debt load of $4.8 trillion, \nwe just cannot afford the increase.\n  This rescission will not affect any programs now in operation. The \nfiscal year 1995 funds are not scheduled to be spent until the start of \nthe school year in September 1995. So we will not have to stop work \nthat is now going on. We are simply proposing that the amount available \nto the programs scheduled to begin this fall be the same as for those \nthat began last fall.\n  Under the Senate bill, none of the volunteers--or, actually, \nemployees--currently serving will be affected. The program would remain \nat the same level. The corporation could still increase the number of \nthose it hires and chooses to fund in State and local programs next \nyear by reallocating the money provided.\n  For instance, the corporation is now spending $32 million on \ninnovation, demonstration and assistance activities, which includes \ntraining and technical assistance for AmeriCorps programs. Presumably, \nmost not-for-profits that receive funds are already experienced \nthemselves in training new employees and providing services. And many \nof them are working with true volunteers.\n  The corporation also spent $3 million this year on planning grants. \nNow, those do not fund a single new position, but simply allow an \norganization to plan how they will use volunteers in the future. And, \nboth the National Service Corporation and the State commissions spend a \ngood deal of money on public relations and recruitment of volunteers--\nread ``employees.'' I would argue that we can do less of that since the \nprogram is now well established, if it is continued, and it is well \nknown.\n  In addition, the corporation awarded more than $14 million to Federal \nagencies this year, nearly 10 percent of the total amount available for \nAmeriCorps grants. Why are we padding the Federal payroll with paid, \nthey call them, volunteers--I call them employees--at the same time the \nadministration claims it is downsizing the civil service?\n  We cut it on one hand, but we call them volunteers and we spend $14 \nmillion hiring them on the other hand. I think there is a good deal of \nroom to make cuts in these areas if the corporation wants to increase \nthe number of those serving in State and local programs, under the \nbill.\n  I remain a great skeptic of the program. I am looking forward to \nconducting oversight hearings, which we will have in our subcommittee \nduring the next few months, to determine exactly where our money is \ngoing. And, in particular, I am concerned about the money going to \nAmeriCorps national direct programs.\n  Under the act, in 1993, there are three different ways that you can \nreceive funds. One-third of the funds are available to States according \nto a population-based formula. The States then choose which programs \nreceive funds. Another third of the funds are distributed to programs \nthat are first selected by the States and then submitted to the \ncorporation for competitive consideration. The final third of the funds \nfor AmeriCorps are distributed directly to the National Service \nCorporation to programs operated by national nonprofit organizations, \nprograms operating in more than one State, and to Federal agencies. I \nwould like to focus the attention of my colleagues on some of these \nprograms.\n  I think America would be surprised to learn where fully one-third of \nthe funds for AmeriCorps is actually going. I venture to guess that \nmost Americans believe that money in this pot is going to help support \nthe efforts of some well-established, reputable, mainstream volunteer \norganizations that we have all come to know and rely on. We would \nexpect, Mr. President, the funding would go to the Red Cross, the Girl \nScouts, Boys and Girls Clubs, Big Brothers and Big Sisters, and the 4-\nH; that they would be the ones receiving funds from that source. That \ncertainly was my expectation.\n  Needless to say, I was surprised to learn that is not where the money \nis going. So I asked, and the Corporation for National Service provided \nme, with a list of all applicants in the ``National Direct'' program \nfor 1994, as well as a list of those groups that receive funding.\n  I have made a chart of some of the examples that we have found. I \nthink they will be illustrative.\n  All of these groups applied for ``AmeriCorps Direct'' awards for \nfiscal year 1994, as well as many other groups. This is not the \nexclusive list.\n  Here is the list of who was funded and this is a partial list of \nthose who were not funded. Many well-established, reputable, and \nnoncontroversial voluntary organizations did not receive funds. But \nlook at the list of those who did receive funds, in addition to those \nthat are Federal agencies. Can you say ``politically correct''?\n  Take a look at what we funded. This was our volunteer money. We are \ndownsizing the civil service, cutting the Federal Government, getting \nrid of employees.\n  So why is the money going to hire people in the Department of \nAgriculture, the Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior, \nthe Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, the Department of \nTransportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department \nof Veterans Affairs?\n   [[Page S5052]] Sounds like a good way to cut the civil service. If \nyou get a program, call it a ``volunteer'' program and use it to fund \nthese.\n  And then there are others, ACORN Housing, Legal Services Corporation, \nNational Endowment for the Arts, National Community AIDS Partnership.\n  These are the programs being funded by the AmeriCorps direct funding \nprogram.\n  These are some of the ones that are not funded, and somehow it \nstrikes me as passing curious that they chose not to fund the Future \nFarmers of America, the National 4-H Council, the Girl Scouts of \nAmerica, the American Red Cross, Big Brother/Big Sisters, Boys and \nGirls Clubs, National Audubon Society, Appalachian Mountain Club, \nAmerican Library Association, United Negro College Fund, United Way of \nAmerica, and United Cerebral Palsy Association.\n  I have had an opportunity to work with many of these fine \norganizations, and when you are talking about volunteers, this is where \nI think you need support, if you need support, to get people who are \nactually doing volunteer work.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Are those not funded? Did they apply for grants and \nwere refused?\n  Mr. BOND. These are agencies all of which applied. ``Funded'' are the \nones which were funded by the AmeriCorps direct program. The ones ``Not \nFunded'' are the ones I just read, beginning with the Future Farmers of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is amazing.\n  Mr. BOND. That is exactly my point. I do not believe that the \npriorities chosen by the National Service Corps are the priorities of \nthe American people. Americans do choose where they give their time \nvoluntarily. We know where people want to give and work as volunteers. \nOver 80 million Americans choose to donate unpaid time to charitable \nvolunteer work each week and they choose their churches, their schools, \ntheir hospitals, the Red Cross, the Girl Scouts, the Big Brother/Big \nSisters. They do not choose to donate their time to the Environmental \nProtection Agency, the Department of Transportation, or the Department \nof Labor.\n  I think the American people might well be shocked to learn that these \nFederal agencies were chosen over other well-known, well-established \nand much respected volunteer organizations which were turned down.\n  I am sure that if you go back to the State programs, my colleagues \nwill undoubtedly show me examples of Girl Scouts and Red Cross programs \nfunded through the State commissions, one of two sources of funding, \nbut that is not the area of national priorities. The corporation has \nclearly chosen not to fund those groups. The further away from States \nand local communities where the volunteer work is actually being done, \nwhere people volunteer their time and their resources, that the \ndecisionmaking occurs, that is where decisions to fund the Federal \nDepartments and those agencies which carry out the politically correct \ngoals happen.\n  I suggest that the funding decisions of the national corporation may \nnot reflect the priorities of American people. I have not examined the \ndecision of the State commissions sufficiently to be able to comment on \nthose. We will explore those in the VA, HUD Appropriations Subcommittee \nduring our fiscal 1996 oversight hearings.\n  But for the purposes of the discussion of the Daschle amendment, I \nabsolutely do not believe we should restore funding for the Corporation \nfor National Service. In fact, considering some of the other tough \ndecisions we have made, there is room for further cuts. We are only \nbringing the program back to the 1994 level. Based on what I described, \nI believe that is overly generous.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to turn down the Daschle \namendment. The Daschle amendment has one provision which has been \ncalled to our attention by Senator Inouye, the problem with funding for \nIndian housing. I have been working with Senator Inouye and his staff. \nI believe we can accommodate the needs of Senator Inouye for the Indian \nhousing.\n  I think we need to take special recognition of the problems which may \narise there at a later time in the discussion of this bill when we have \nan amendment, however we work it out with Senator Inouye, who has been \na leader on this, and Senator McCain.\n  We will attempt to work out a good compromise to make sure that the \ncuts do not fall unnecessarily heavily on our native Americans. I will \ndiscuss the particular needs of that program. That, too, is included in \nthe Daschle amendment.\n  But the main point of the Daschle amendment is to cut $1.3 billion \nfrom what was described last week by my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle as ``critically needed, vitally important, let's-do-it-now \nemergency relief'' so we can go back and spend money on HUD, which is \nalready spending too much money, on the National Service Corporation, \nthe AmeriCorps direct dollars, which are keeping all those wonderful \npeople employed at Federal agencies.\n  Mr. President, I just do not believe we need to restore those cuts. \nSo I urge my colleagues not to accept the Daschle amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the junior Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to commend the senior Senator \nfrom Missouri for an outstanding presentation. The juxtaposition of the \nfunded agencies and the volunteer agencies is a stark and compelling \ncontrast. To think that the Future Farmers of America applied and were \nturned down when the Department of Agriculture was funded; to think \nthat the 4-H Council applied and was turned down while the Department \nof Energy was funded; to think that the Departments of Interior, \nJustice, and Labor were successful applicants when no ``volunteers'' \nwere provided to the Girl Scouts or the American Red Cross. In my mind, \nand I think my good friend would agree, this reflects very poorly on \nthe character and quality of the AmeriCorp Program.\n  Mr. President, we are not talking about rescinding Federal money in a \nvacuum. I believe this entire debate must be placed in the context of \nAmerica's financial condition. The American people are alarmed at a \n$4.8 trillion debt. Last November, they said ``It is time to stop this \nout of control spending, and put our fiscal house in order.''\n  In family budgeting, what father or mother would say, ``Even though \nwe are $72,000 in debt, business as usual will suffice.'' Despite our \nmassive debt and rising deficits, Bill Clinton has suggested just that. \nThe President has projected $200-billion-a-year deficits for as far as \nthe eye can see. Mr. President, this type of unrestrained spending must \nstop.\n   So, I rise today in support of the majority leader's amendment. If \nenacted, this package would significantly decrease discretionary \nspending for this fiscal year. More importantly, it would achieve that \nend by attacking non-essential government services. AmeriCorp, which I \ndiscussed earlier, is a perfect example. This so-called volunteer \nprogram, which costs $30,400 per participant per year, is not a \nvolunteer program at all. It is a way of paying individuals to do \nthings that people already do.\n  Mr. President, out of the $30,000 used to support each volunteer in \nthis program, $15,000 goes to administration and overhead costs. That \nmeans that this is really just a program to support the Federal \nbureaucracy. Then, when you think of the rest of the money--the $15,400 \nthat is left over for the volunteer after you have paid the $15,000 for \noverhead and costs--you have to understand that 20 percent of all of \nthose volunteers are working in the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, \nLabor, the Environmental Protection Agency, or the National Endowment \nfor the Arts.\n  AmeriCorps. It sounds like you ought to stand up and salute. The \ntruth is that the American people ought to stand up and grab their \nwallets because it represents a raid on their resources. And not just \nthe American people, but also the yet unearned wages of generations to \ncome.\n  Mr. President, we hear over and over again from the Democrat party \nthat we have to save the children. Well, let us save them from \nbankruptcy. Let us practice a little responsibility. The \n[[Page S5053]] Senator from California earlier today said, ``Say \ngoodbye to Big Bird,'' as if we were to curtail funding for public \nbroadcasting there wouldn't be any worthwhile children's programming. \nThis is nonsense and the American people know it. In fact, a recent Lou \nHarris poll found that public broadcasting is third on a list of \nFederal programs that should be abolished.\n  Only $7.5 million of the $300 million spent on PBS goes directly to \nchildren's programming. Where does the money go? It goes to purchase \nand develop programming for wealthy adults. According to one of its own \nmember stations, WMET, ``one out of eight contributors to PBS is a \nmillionaire. One out of seven has a wine cellar, and one out of every \nthree has spent time in Europe in the last three years.'' This is not a \nsocial welfare program, it is welfare for the rich. Mr. President, \nthese are the types of people taking advantage of PBS, and taking \nadvantage of the American taxpayer. As my friend Senator Pressler \nnoted, the wealthy donors to public broadcasting could easily make up \nthe 14 percent of Federal funding that CPB receives if they simply gave \nan additional $55 a year.\n  Mr. President, I believe we also need to look carefully at the \nforeign operations budget. The House suggested rescinding $191.6 \nmillion. The Senate cut only $100 million. Well, I think we ought to be \nrescinding what the House proposed. The additional $91.6 million would \nbring our total Federal foreign operations reduction to 1.4 percent. If \nwe are serious about balancing the budget, and if we really care about \nkids, we must at the very minimum do that.\n  So, we have an opportunity to say to the American people that we \nheard the message of November 8. We understand that it is important for \nus to make serious cuts. The Senate has a $13 billion rescission \npackage. The House was at $17 billion. Thus, we can add the $1.3 \nbillion in this amendment and still not make it to the House level.\n  Mr. President, during the debate on the balanced budget amendment, \nmember after member who opposed the bill talked about making tough \nchoices. Furthermore, they all indicated that they were ready to move \ntoward a balanced budget. Let me suggest that now is the time to begin. \nIt is time because that is what the American people sent us here to do. \nUnfortunately, the President continues to takes us down a different \nroad, a road of increased deficits and debt. Let this Chamber be \ndifferent. Let this Chamber fundamentally alter the way Washington \nworks. We should rescind the funds which were proposed by the committee \nand add to it what the majority leader has suggested. If we do, we will \nbegin to demonstrate responsibility, and that brings me to my last \npoint.\n  I think what Government does is teaches. We all talk about the value \nof education. The most important lesson we can learn is the lesson of \nresponsibility. Are we or are we not people who pay our bills? Do we \nlive with the consequences of the decisions we make? Are we willing to \naccept responsibility for what we do? If our citizens make that kind of \ncommitment, the coming era can once again be called the American \ncentury. Regrettably, as a Government, we have yet to make that \ncommitment. Some of us are concerned that as citizens we have not made \nthat kind of commitment either. Maybe our Government is not teaching \nresponsibility the way it ought to. Maybe our example speaks so loudly \nto young people that they believe they are not responsible for the \nactions that they take. After all, when we continue to appropriate and \nspend, when we continue to obfuscate and mislabel, government fails in \nits obligation to the citizenry.\n  Mr. President, let us instruct the young people of this Nation \nproperly. Let us show them that we have the willingness to exercise the \ndiscipline necessary to succeed in balancing the budget. In my mind, \nthis means not only having a rescission bill, but also supporting the \nmajority leader's amendment. It is my sincere hope that the Senate will \ndo just that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment by \nSenator Daschle, and I am doing so primarily because of my belief that \nwe should not make as drastic cuts in the education accounts as the \nmajority leader would have the Senate make.\n  Let me put this in context, Mr. President. I know there is a lot of \ntalk about, are you in favor of deficit reduction, or are you not in \nfavor of deficit reduction? I honestly believe that all Members are in \nfavor of deficit reduction here in the Senate. We want to find an \nappropriate way to accomplish that.\n  In my opinion, the test of whether we are serious about deficit \nreduction will come in two areas. First, our willingness to curtail \nspending in a whole range of areas--not just the areas being addressed \nby this bill, but all areas-- defense, intelligence, community funding, \nagricultural subsidy funding, foreign aid funding, as well as the \ndomestic accounts. Entitlements are a key part, when we are serious \nabout constraining spending.\n  The second area in the test of whether we are serious is whether or \nnot we will reject the siren call to cut taxes. There is a major \neffort, on the other side of the Hill this week to try to go ahead and \ncut everybody's taxes, particularly the taxes of the wealthy. In my \nview, that is not a responsible action if we are serious about deficit \nreduction. It does not make any sense to give speech after speech after \nspeech here in the Congress about our concern about the deficit and \nthen turn around and cut taxes and reduce the revenue that the \nGovernment is receiving to keep that deficit from escalating. Those are \nthe real issues.\n  Now I want to talk for a few moments about the impact of the proposed \nrescissions on education, because I believe very strongly that not only \nshould we try to maintain funding in education but wherever possible we \nshould try to increase funding.\n  As I travel around my State, Mr. President, and ask people in town \nhall meetings, ``What percentage of the Federal budget do you believe \nis committed to improving education?'' Some say maybe 5 percent, others \nsay, maybe 10 percent, and we get into discussions over how much money \nis spent on education. I respond, ``Let me tell you, it is 1.7 percent \nof the Federal budget that is committed to improving education in this \ncountry.''\n  That is a figure which is down substantially from what it was a \ndecade ago. In 1985 we committed 2.5 percent of our Federal outlays to \nimproving education. This last year, it was 1.7 percent.\n  Mr. President, education is not the cause of our large Federal \ndeficit. It has been taking its share of cuts all along and, in fact, \neven if the amendment of Senator Daschle is approved, there will be \nsubstantial cuts in education as part of this rescission bill. We are \nwilling to accept that.\n  There are 19 different programs that the Department of Education \noperates dealing with education. The proposed amendment of Senator \nDaschle would try to restore funding to the level we appropriated and \nauthorized last year in 7 of the 19--not in all of them--but in 7 of \nthe 19.\n  Programs such as the title I grants which go to schools with \ndisadvantaged children; the school-to-work opportunities, which help \nstudents to transition from school into employment; the Safe and Drug-\nFree Schools Program; and the Immigrant Education Program, aimed at \nthose people who are legally here in the United States legally working \nwith green cards and their children need to be educated.\n  The Head Start Program. Mr. President, there are many students, many \nchildren in my State who would like to participate in the Head Start \nProgram. However, there is inadequate funding for them to do that. In \nmost cases, these are children of very low-income families. I think \nthat the Head Start Program is a good investment for our country. I \nthink we can legitimately be for deficit reduction without cutting back \non the funding for the Head Start Program.\n  I want to urge my colleagues to think about priorities as we go about \nthis cutting exercise. It does not do any good to rush ahead with cuts \nin all areas. The American people want Members of Congress to be very \nselective in the cuts that we make. The Wall Street Journal and NBC \nNews did a poll recently that said that 79 percent of Americans believe \nthat cutting Federal \n[[Page S5054]] spending for education takes this country in the wrong \ndirection.\n  That is exactly what the majority leader is proposing that we do here \ntoday. He is proposing that we go ahead with major cuts in the Federal \nfunds for education. I think it is a shortsighted approach. I think we \nwill at some stage down the road regret our action.\n  This year, we are spending 1.7 percent of the Federal budget on \neducation. We can continue to ratchet that down. We can get it down to \n1 percent. We can get it down below 1 percent and we will still have a \nvery large Federal deficit. Mr. President, we are kidding the American \npeople if we suggest to them that cutting our funds for Head Start is \ngoing to solve the deficit problem. It is not going to solve the \ndeficit problem. We need to acknowledge that upfront and go after some \nof the areas where real money is being spent in our Federal budget. \nThere are many of those areas.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in some of the other proposals which \nwill undoubtedly be made as we get into consideration of the budget \nresolution, which involves serious cuts in Federal spending for the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, it is not as easy as just saying ``Cut, cut, cut,'' \nregardless of the impact on whoever in our society, and ``Cut, cut, \ncut'' regardless of what priority is thrown out the window in the \nprocess. We need to be specific about where cuts make sense and where \nthey do not make sense. Clearly we need to find ways to conserve \nfunding and to restrain Federal spending.\n  I expect by the end of this legislative session, I will have done at \nleast as much as most of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport cuts in funding for a variety of Federal activities.\n  However, cuts in education at this stage in our Nation's history do \nnot make sense. They are not supported by the American people. Senator \nDaschle tries to restore a few of the funds that are otherwise proposed \nto be cut. I support him in that effort. I wish we could restore more. \nHowever, we are not able to.\n  Even if the amendment of Senator Daschle is adopted, there will be \nrescissions in virtually all the programs, lesser rescissions than are \nproposed by the majority leader but rescissions still. There are 12 of \nthe 19 programs that are in the Education Department which will take \nsignificant cuts even if the Daschle amendment is adopted.\n  Mr. President, I will not belabor the point, but I do think the least \nwe can do here in the U.S. Senate this evening is to try to maintain \nlast year's level of funding in some of these key programs that relate \nto education. That is what Senator Daschle's amendment does. That is \nwhy I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I thank the Chair. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes of the remaining 20 \nminutes of the majority time to the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Let me take a couple moments, first of all, to address some of the \ncomments of my colleague from New Mexico, because I think the debate is \nfairly framed by some of the things which he had to say. It does \ndemonstrate the difference in approach that we take to this matter of \nreducing the Federal spending and trying to find ways to rescind \nspending from last year which is what the Dole amendment is all about.\n  The Senator from New Mexico makes a primary point that education \nfunding should not be further cut. I would like to make two points with \nrespect to this.\n  The first is, as far as I am concerned, it is not a matter of cutting \nspending. It is a question of who does the spending. Our idea here is \nthat the Federal Government should do less of the spending and that the \nfamilies of America should get to do more of the spending.\n  As a result, when we talk about a $500 tax credit for children, for \nexample, what we are saying is, who would you rather have spend the \nmoney on your children? The Federal Government or the family who is \nresponsible for their care?\n  We would rather give the family the $500 per child and let them \ndecide whether they are going to enroll their child in a special \neducation program, buy a new computer, get some books or in whatever \nway they feel it best to spend that money for their children's \neducation--to do that, rather than to assume that the Federal \nGovernment can put better use to that money than can the families of \nAmerica. That is the theory for our approach to this question of \nFederal spending.\n  Second, to get right to the point of the rescission package that is \nbefore us, the Dole amendment, says that we should add about $1.3 \nbillion in rescissions, in other words in cuts to the package that has \nbeen put before the body from the Appropriations Committee. This would \nconform, or get close to conforming, the Senate package of rescissions \nwith the House package, at roughly $16 or $17 billion.\n  Let us talk about how it might affect education. One of the items we \nwould like to rescind more of the money on is the AmeriCorps Program \nthat the Senator from Missouri was talking about a moment ago. The \nAmeriCorps program in the House rescinds, or has rescinded in it, about \n$416 million to a level of $158 million, close to $159 million, for \nnext fiscal year. The Dole amendment would conform the Senate position \nto the House position. Right now, the Senate position is to only \nrescind half that money.\n  How does the AmeriCorps program affect education in our country? Here \nis one way. The AmeriCorps Program spends as much money on one person, \none so-called volunteer--who, of course, as we know is not a volunteer \nat all but is paid for work, $20,000 to $30,000 a year, $40,000 in \nAlaska--as could be spent to fund eight Pell grants for needy students \nto come to school. As we know, the Pell Grant Program is based on need; \nit goes to needy students. So we could send eight needy students to \ncollege for what we are spending today on one volunteer in the \nAmeriCorps Program.\n  This chart makes the point. At this level here, you have the 3.9 \nmillion young people in America who are volunteers today, not being \npaid a penny for their volunteer service, and here you have the maximum \nof 20,000 young Americans who will participate in the AmeriCorps \nProgram.\n  What is the cost? Bear in mind, these almost 4 million people get \npaid nothing. These are the youngsters, the youth of our country, young \nmen and women, teenagers and young people who are doing volunteer work \nwho are between the ages of 16 and 24, as compared to these 20,000. \nWhat is it costing? This makes the point about the Pell grants, as I \nsaid. Here are the number of people, Pell grant recipients, who could \nbe funded with the money for one AmeriCorps volunteer in the State of \nAlaska.\n  Incidentally, we might ask the question, why does it cost over \n$40,000 a year for an AmeriCorps volunteer in Alaska, but we will leave \nthat for another day, perhaps.\n  The point is, with this Alaska volunteer, if we rescinded the money \nfor that AmeriCorps volunteer, we could send over 28 needy young \nAmericans to college next year. That is what education is all about. So \nwhen some of our colleagues say we need to pay more attention to \neducation, I say you bet we should, in two respects:\n  First, we should not waste it on programs that really do not help the \nneedy. We should put it where it does the most good. That means going \nalong with our package of rescissions here with respect to AmeriCorps.\n  Second, instead of talking about cutting education funding, we ought \nto talk about who actually does the funding. Who does the spending? It \nought to be the families of America, not the U.S. Government.\n  I was curious about the chart that was behind the Senator from New \nMexico, and I gather has been used by some of the Senators on that side \nof the aisle. The whole point of the chart is who gains and who loses, \nand that is the way a lot of liberals look at the American Government. \nIt is a zero sum game. We need to take from them so we will have \nsomething over here. It is never taught that John F. Kennedy used to \nengage in trying to expand the pie. Remember what he said, ``A rising \ntide lifts all boats.''\n  His point in saying that, by the way, was we needed to have a capital \ngains cut for corporations. It does not sound like the Democratic \nrhetoric that we hear today. But this was a Democrat \n[[Page S5055]] President who understood if we are all better off we are \nall better off, and you cannot be employed if there is no employer, and \nemployers need money to pay for people, to pay for their employees. So \nhe understood that making everybody better off is the name of the game, \nnot arguing over the size of the existing pie.\n  That is what the chart that the Senator from New Mexico was standing \nnext to basically tries to portray--who gains and who loses.\n  Our idea is that is the politics of envy. As I said, it is a zero sum \ngame. Our general point should be to reduce Federal spending generally \nso there is more left over for the American family to spend so there is \nmore left over for savings and for investment, for growth in the \nAmerican economy so that our children and grandchildren will have a \nbetter future.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Will the Senator from Arizona yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I will be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. This bill cuts $13 billion from the Federal budget. \nThat is roughly 1 percent.\n  If we cannot muster the fortitude to take 1 percent out of the budget \nhere and now, what does it say for future deficits?\n  Mr. KYL. I say to my colleague from North Carolina, that is the same \nquestion I had been asking all last week when various people said to \nme, ``My goodness, you are cutting something out of this and cutting \nsomething out of that?''\n  I said, ``This is just the beginning. If you do not have the \nfortitude to do this, how are you ever going to balance the budget?''\n  By the way, these were the same people who were against the balanced \nbudget amendment on the basis we were elected to make the tough \ndecisions. Looks like they are running for the woods now.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. What it amounts to is not only have we failed to pass \nthe balanced budget amendment, we are here in deep debate over whether \nwe can take 1 percent out of it. We saw, by failure to pass the \nbalanced budget amendment, very clearly that the value of the dollar \nagainst every other industrialized currency throughout the world took a \ndeep dive. The Senator from Georgia talked about it earlier. Now we are \nfurther reinforcing the idea throughout the financial communities of \nthe world that we do not intend to reduce the budget. We are simply \ngoing to talk about it.\n  Mr. KYL. I think the Senator from North Carolina makes an excellent \npoint there.\n  Mr. President, might I inquire how much time remains on this side, \nfor the Senator from Missouri?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Nearly 12 minutes remain.\n  Mr. KYL. Let me sum up. If the Senator from North Carolina has more \nto talk about here, that will be fine. Otherwise, let me take a minute \nto sum up because I know the Senator from Pennsylvania has something to \nsay about this, as well.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the Senator for allowing me to ask the \nquestion.\n  Mr. KYL. Let us just sum it up this way, because there are a whole \nlist of programs that are the subject of the rescission in the \namendment of the Senator from Kansas, the distinguished majority \nleader.\n  The majority leader's amendment--what we will be voting on tomorrow--\nis to add some rescissions, some additional reductions in spending to \nprograms like AmeriCorps, as we pointed out, foreign operations, the \nforeign aid program that the Senator from Missouri talked about, the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting that the Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas talked about, the Internal Revenue Service--there are a whole \nvariety of them. My colleague from Arizona, John McCain, had suggested \nabout $337 million in cuts that the President himself requested and \nthat this body has not seen fit to include in its rescissions package.\n  Let me conclude with this. It is not as if we are trying to do \nsomething rather odd here in suggesting a little more in the way of \nrescissions. On the AmeriCorps Program that we were talking about, what \nwas the vote in the House of Representatives for rescinding twice as \nmuch as the Senate is proposing to rescind? Was that a partisan vote? \nDemocrat and Republican? The vote was on March 15, 382 to 23. This is a \nbipartisan understanding of what we need to do to get our budget \ndeficit under control here. So, by a vote of 382 to 23, the House of \nRepresentatives voted to rescind about $416 million from AmeriCorps.\n  It seems to me that the Senate could do just as well.\n  So I hope that our colleagues will support the Dole substitute when \nit comes to a vote, and I appreciate the Senator from Missouri yielding \ntime.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes of the time allotted \nto the majority leader's amendment to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri for yielding. I would like to \nfollow up on what the Senator from Arizona and others have spoken about \nwith respect to this amendment by the Senator from Missouri, both the \nsenior and junior Senators with respect to the AmeriCorps Program.\n  I would first like to touch on the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting. We are proposing in this amendment to increase the amount \nof rescissions--in other words, to reduce the deficit--by an additional \n$1.3 billion, restore the California disaster relief funds of $1.3 \nbillion, and add $1.3 billion in cuts with the Dole amendment.\n  The principal area that we are trying to deem the cuts, so to speak--\nthe biggest one--is the President's own rescissions package, which is \n$337 million of what he termed pork, special interest demonstration \nprojects put in by Members of Congress, both the House and Senate. They \nare the President's own rescission. We are saying let us vote on your \nPresident's own rescissions, and let us reduce the deficit as he would \nlike to have seen done with these rescissions.\n  Another big area is the AmeriCorps Program, which is the national \nservice program, which we have heard some talk about, which I will \nmention briefly.\n  But the one that I think has gotten a lot of publicity which I think \nis just an amazing program that gets funded here is the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting. This is a very controversial measure. I think I \nhave received more mail on attempts to cut the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting than any other single issue that has been before the U.S. \nCongress.\n  That is interesting in the sense that it is only $285 million in the \nbudget. I was reminded by a television station in Pennsylvania, WHYY, \nthat it is only .003 percent of the national budget, so it is not \nsignificant. ``Why are you picking on us?'' I heard the Senator from \nNew Mexico say, ``Well, education overall is only 1.7 percent of the \nbudget. Why are you picking on us?'' We are not going to balance the \nbudget on education. We are not going to balance the budget on the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting, nor on AmeriCorps. If you keep \ngoing down, do you know what are going to come up with? We will not \nbalance the budget because we will never get any of this stuff. We will \nnever balance the budget.\n  What is the answer? Let us cut the big programs. OK. Let us all line \nup here. Everybody who wants to cut Medicare, come on down the aisle. \nCome on. Come on down the aisle. There is nobody coming down the aisle. \nNobody wants to cut Social Security? Come on. It is a big program, $200 \nor $300 billion. Come on down the aisle. Where is everybody? Where is \neverybody who wants to cut Medicaid? Where is everybody that wants to \ncut national defense? Where is everybody who wants to cut the big \nprograms? The Government is made up of a few big programs but lots of \nlittle programs. A lot of these little programs are very good programs. \nA lot of them are well-meaning programs. But, frankly, a lot of them \nneed to be pared back or need to be eliminated.\n  I happen to believe the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is one. \nThe reason we are having so much trouble, frankly, is because of \nletters like this sent out by the president of WHYY-TV in Philadelphia, \nand as a result of numerous public broadcasting infomercials and public \nbroadcasting, both on radio and television, to write your Congressman \nand Senator and \n[[Page S5056]] say, ``Do not let them take Barney and Big Bird off the \nair. Do not let them take our subsidy away. Go out there and lobby on \nour behalf,'' hiring lobbyists and people to come down here and try to \nconvince us to keep the money flowing. Keep that money flowing to the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting.\n  I have written a letter of I think three or four pages in response to \nthe constituents who have asked me. It is a letter that I gave a lot of \nthought to, and I said here are all the reasons why I think the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting should be cut.\n  These stations in Pennsylvania decided they are going to write a \nletter responding to my letter and lobbying and pointing out all the \nflaws in my letter.\n  I ask unanimous consent to submit for the Record following my \nstatement a copy of this letter and a copy of my response point by \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I will tell you that, while he says all these things are in fact not \ntrue, the fact of the matter is they are all true. Everything that I \nhave in that letter is exactly right. He is providing information. I \ncan go through just some of them. I suggest in my letter that there are \nmany private sector sponsors who would like to be involved, and who \ncould--and in fact are--supporting public broadcasting. And we could in \nfact privatize the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is the \nentity by which the Federal funds flow through.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I yield an additional 2 minutes from the time allotted to \nthe majority leader for his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you. I thank the Senator from Missouri.\n  I say you can privatize the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, \nwhich is an entity located here in Washington that the Federal dollars \nare allocated through. He responds and says that public broadcasting \nstations may not by Federal regulation be for-profit enterprises. Well, \nI did not say anything about for-profit stations beings owned by the \nprivate sector. What I said was that we could privatize the \norganization that provides some funding to those stations, which in \nfact we can, and which the Senator from South Dakota, Senator Pressler, \nis in the process of trying to do by statute.\n  This is the bait and switch which is going on in this letter. In his \nletter he says:\n\n       The Senator describes American public broadcasting--an \n     effort in constant threat of financial starvation, forbidden \n     to sell anything and forbidden to make a profit--as ``well-\n     endowed.''\n\n  I do say they are well endowed. I justify that by saying that \n``Barney'' and ``Sesame Street'' combined have royalties of about $2 \nbillion of which the Corporation for Public Broadcasting gets virtually \nnothing.\n  Various other programs--I have my share of ``Shining Time Station \nPuzzles'' for my 4-year-old and my 2-year-old. I have my share of other \nthings from the ``Puzzle Kids,'' whatever they are called, something \nlike that. I do not know--``The Puzzle Gang.'' I have a bunch of this \nstuff--Mr. Rogers, a wonderful man from my hometown of Pittsburgh, who \ndoes a tremendous job for the community, does a tremendous show. But \nthese assets can and should be used, instead of going to public \nbroadcasting, go to the taxpayers, who go out and work darned hard for \ntheir dollars, to have it funneled through here to pay for the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting, to pay for a lot of the other \nthings.\n  He mentions one other thing. He says the Senator's comments are \nideological, that I come at it from an ``ideological standpoint.'' He \nis absolutely right. I do come at it from an ideological standpoint. My \nideology is that the Federal Government should not be supporting these \nthings, that we need to reduce the size of Government. But it certainly \nis not from the ideological standpoint that I do not agree with what is \non there. That is irrelevant. Does the Federal Government, when we have \nlimited resources, have a role of supporting broadcast television in an \nera where broadcast television is almost as much a dinosaur as the \ncrank phone when we are going to cable and direct satellite \ncommunications? We should support public broadcast television? It is \nridiculous. We have to move into the 21st century in the U.S. Senate \njust like public broadcasting has to move in the 21st century in \ntelecommunications.\n  That is what this is all about. I can tell you that we are going to \nhave a battle about this. I do not know if we are going to win. I tell \nyou, if we do not win, I question the sincerity of the people in this \nChamber to really do anything about reducing the deficit. I really \nquestion whether we are really willing to stare at children who are \nfacing 82 percent tax rates, as Paul Coverdell says, in 10 years only \nhaving five Federal programs left if we just do nothing. How can we \nstare those children in the face, that we say, as in the Daschle \namendment, we care about so much? How can you care about someone and \nlet them keep 18 percent of what they earn? How can you care about \nsomeone if you are not willing to stand up and defeat the special \ninterests and do what is right for the long-term interest of the \nAmerican children? This Daschle amendment, putting more money in \nprograms today, is not the answer. Preserving the fiscal integrity of \ntomorrow is what really is going to help America's children.\n  I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Text of Senator Rick Santorum's Letter to Constituents\n\n       Federal funds for public broadcasting are administered and \n     distributed by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). \n     The CPB makes direct grants to public television and radio \n     stations, as well as grants to the Public Broadcasting \n     Service (PBS) and national Public Radio (NPR) for program \n     projects and productions. In 1994, the CPB received $253 \n     million from Congress.\n       The majority of funding for public television and radio \n     does not come from the CPB, but rather from member stations, \n     educational institutions, corporations, and private citizens. \n     For example, in 1993 the CPB provided only 14.2% of the \n     industry-wide spending for public broadcasting. It is also \n     important to note that PBS and NPR are not divisions of the \n     CPB; they are private, nonprofit organizations that utilize \n     federal funds to supplement their operating budget. In 1993, \n     the CPB provided only 13.9% of the total PBS budget and 4% of \n     the total NPR budget. It is therefore not accurate to suggest \n     that ``Sesame Street'' and other popular PBS shows would be \n     forced off the air if CPB funding were reduced or eliminated.\n       In this time of federal downsizing and fiscal reform, tough \n     decisions need to be made about government spending. Last \n     year Congress reduced funding for the Low-Income Home Energy \n     Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which is vital to Pennsylvania \n     senior citizens. Congress has also taken steps to close the \n     Philadelphia Naval Shipyards, which employs thousands of \n     Pennsylvania residents. With cuts of this nature taking \n     place, it is hard for me to justify the continued use of \n     federal resources to subsidize the well-endowed public \n     broadcasting industry.\n       If Congress acts to scale back, privatize, or eliminate the \n     CPB, I am confident that the resulting loss of funds for \n     public television and radio will be compensated by new \n     corporate sponsorship and public support. Several major \n     corporations have already expressed interest in supporting a \n     privatized Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n       In addition, PBS, a major contributor and supporter of \n     public television, has yet to utilize its full range of \n     funding options. You may or may not be aware that commercial \n     products related to Barney, the amiable children's character \n     on PBS, grossed almost $1 billion last year. PBS receives \n     almost none of these profits because it chose not to secure \n     licensing rights for commercial products related to PBS \n     shows. PBS will also receive very little of the $800 million \n     grossed by ``Sesame Street'' products. To put it bluntly, I \n     do not think taxpayers should pay to put Barney on public TV \n     for Barney to make billions of dollars. If PBS were to secure \n     even a small percentage of these earnings through product \n     licensing, the lost share of federal funds would be easily \n     replaced, or even doubled.\n       Congress has also provided other means of support or public \n     broadcasting besides direct funding through the CPB. Over \n     thirty years ago, Congress directed the Federal \n     Communications Commission (FCC) to designate specific VHF \n     television channels for educational broadcasting. This FCC \n     frequency allocation program continues to allow public \n     television and radio stations to remain exempt from the \n     sizeable fees and costs paid by private commercial stations. \n     Congress has also given non-profit status to public \n     broadcasting stations, allowing them to receive \n     [[Page S5057]] tax-deductible contributions and avoid paying \n     corporate taxes, which amounts to a federal government \n     subsidy. I continue to support these significant \n     accommodations made by Congress for public broadcasting.\n       After considering the factors of private funding, \n     commercial licensing, and additional federal supports for \n     public broadcasting, I have reached the conclusion that the \n     future of public broadcasting in the United States is not \n     dependent on continued funding through the CPB. The CPB has \n     played an important role in expanding access to public \n     broadcasting and improving program quality since its \n     establishment in 1967. Now that these primary goals have been \n     achieved, I believe it may be time for Congress to evaluate \n     proposals to downsize, privatize, or discontinue this \n     organization.\n       Americans have shown a strong commitment to supporting \n     public television and radio. This commitment will continue as \n     long as PBS, NPR, and their local affiliates remain committed \n     to the production and broadcasting of programs that enrich \n     the educational and cultural life of our nation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               (tv 12 WHYY 91 fm),\n\n\n                                       Independence Mall West,\n\n                              Philadelphia, PA, February 21, 1995.\n       Thank you for sending the copy of the letter you have \n     received from Senator Santorum. It seems clear that the \n     national conversation about public broadcasting is based more \n     on political posturing than on reasoning and fact. That \n     conversation needs to be elevated.\n       The Senator suggests that ``tough decisions need to be made \n     about government spending.'' He's right, and most Americans \n     agree. Why, however, does he join those who aim so fiercely \n     at a national instrumentality that provides educational and \n     cultural services and earns the great majority of its money \n     from non-federal sources? Why does he join those who single \n     out, with great fanfare, a national educational effort that \n     accounts for only .0003 of the national budget?\n       To me, the answer is that Senator Santorum writes from an \n     ideological standpoint, and his arguments are the common ones \n     in the current national discussion about public broadcasting. \n     The danger is that misinformation is too often treated as \n     fact.\n       The Senator describes American public broadcasting--an \n     effort in constant threat of financial starvation, forbidden \n     to sell anything and forbidden to make a profit--as ``well-\n     endowed.'' The facts are, simply and clearly, otherwise.\n       The Senator suggests that ``several major corporations have \n     already expressed interest in supporting a privatized \n     Corporation for Public Broadcasting.'' This is a pretty far-\n     fetched notion, since CPB is merely a funnel for federal \n     money. Does he mean that a private corporation will provide \n     the $285 million each year currently appropriated by CPB? It \n     seems unlikely. In addition, public broadcasting stations may \n     not, by federal regulation, be owned by for-profit \n     enterprises.\n       He goes on to suggest that commercial products resulting \n     from the Barney series could fuel PBS, which shows a basic \n     lack of understanding concerning public broadcasting and how \n     is subsists.\n       The Senator's suggestion that ``Congress directed the \n     Federal Communications Commission to designate specific VHF \n     television channels for educational broadcasting'' is \n     incorrect. The FCC's Sixth Report and Order of 1952, which \n     set aside both VHF and UHF channels for educational use, was \n     not ordered by Congress.\n       He goes on to suggest that the ``non-profit status'' of \n     public broadcasting stations was ``given'' to them by \n     Congress. That is untrue. The nonprofit status was ordered by \n     the FCC, which prohibited commercials on the new stations, in \n     order to eliminate possible competition between commercial \n     and educational stations. He also claims that ``private \n     commercial stations' pay ``sizable fees and costs'' that the \n     educational stations do not. This is simply not so.\n       It's important that the current conversation about public \n     broadcasting in America be elevated to a reasonable, civil \n     level, a level on which fact, opinion and fantasy can be \n     separated, a level on which ideology plays a minimal role and \n     a level on which service to Americans is the goal.\n       We appreciate your continued interest.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Frederick Breitenfeld, Jr.,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                       The Erroneous WHYY Letter\n\n     From: Frederick Breitenfeld, Jr., President, WHYY, TV12, 91 \n         FM, Independence Mall West, Philadelphia, PA.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  WHYY/Frederick Breitenfeld, Jr.             Facts/RJS Position        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n``Why . . . does [RJS] joint those   My aim is fierce at deficit        \n who aim so fiercely at a national    reduction.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to reiterate why \nwe believe this amendment is important.\n  Fundamentally, it goes to the heart of what it is that we as \nDemocrats believe we are here for: protecting working families, \ninvesting in children, and doing that in a meaningful way without \nreducing the overall commitment to deficit reduction one iota.\n  That is really what this amendment does. It provides the kind of \ncommitment we need for working families, and the commitment especially \nwe need for children. But it also recognizes the need for deficit \nreduction because children and working families are directly affected \nby that as well.\n  We do so by restoring some of the cuts that were made in areas that \ndirectly affect children in the most significant way--children \ndependent upon child care, so that working families can meet their \nobligations at the workplace; Head Start for children who depend upon a \nprogram that has now been in use for more than 30 years, clearly which \nhas shown to be one of the most important ways with which to prepare \nchildren to be better students and to be more able to cope with all of \nthe challenges in early life.\n  We also protect young adults interested in national service. These \nyoung people are committing themselves to their country in a way that \nmakes a significant contribution to our country through national \nservice and community assistance, and at the same time to generate the \nability to go back to college or to go to college in the first place to \nadvance their education in as many ways as they can.\n  We also recognize that women, infants, and children of all ages \nreally depend upon adequate nutrition. If they do not have adequate \nnutrition, they really do not have the ability to ensure good health. \nIf we learned anything in the debate over the last couple of years \nabout health care, it is that perhaps the best investment we can make \nis an investment in preventive care. Making sure people stay healthy is \nthe best way to ensure that they are not going to need expensive care \nlater on.\n  That is exactly what the Women, Infants and Children Program does. It \nassures adequate nutrition, adequate nutrition assures adequate good \nhealth, and with good health we assure the opportunities for young \npeople and for women to be productive citizens in this country.\n  Aid to schools, of course, is something that we have long felt is \nperhaps the single best investment this country can make. As we look at \nthe real defense of this country, as we look at ways to maximize the \nsecurity and the strength of this Nation, there is no better way to do \nit than to ensure that our schools have the resources they need to \nprepare young children to be good adults later on.\n  Obviously, we have gone through some very disappointing days last \nweek, in that we thought we were going to have a good debate as early \nas last Thursday on this very issue, whether we ought to be able to \nprotect 1 million children who are affected by all of these programs. \nWe were denied that debate. And, unfortunately, as well, the majority \nhas now offered a \n[[Page S5058]] second-degree amendment that would gut this amendment \nand would further the attack on some of these programs directly \naffecting kids and families.\n  So we are anxious to debate priorities as we go about the difficult \ntask of balancing the budget. But I hope that we would not replace a \nvote on the priorities we place on kids and families with a vote on \ncutting the deficit further. We really ought to accomplish both things.\n  We recognize the importance of deficit reduction. We recognize the \nimportance of investment in children and families. That balance is \nreally what we are trying to strike in the first place. We agree that \nthe deficit has to be reduced. We agree that the $15.3 billion that \nbill now provides is a significant reduction and ought to be supported.\n  Where we apparently disagree is whether or not we could take some of \nthe funding in the out years for FEMA, funding that goes beyond what \neven the House has proposed, and use it to direct resources to people \nwho are really dealing with emergencies right now.\n  It is an emergency if you are a young family and cannot get child \ncare. In some cases it is going to be an emergency if some of these \nschools do not get impact aid funding or some of the money that they \nare counting on in this year's budget to ensure that they meet their \nobligations later on.\n  So it is really a very fundamental question of providing the delicate \nbalance between addressing those concerns, the investments in the \nfamilies of 1 million children, and investing, as well, in meaningful \ndeficit reduction over the course of the next 24 months.\n  We also, of course, had an opportunity to address the issue of \nbillionaires who renounce their citizenship in order to avoid paying \ntaxes on their fortunes. I am very pleased that the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts has indicated his determination to \nultimately resolve this issue. I think the Senate will go on record one \nway or another, hopefully sooner rather than later, that that is not \nsomething that we support; that we recognize that, as we are trying to \nmake very tough decisions about priorities and about kids and where the \nresources ought to go, to say no to child care, no to Head Start, no to \nAmeriCorps, but yes to billionaires who renounce their citizenship is \nnot a set of priorities I think anybody in this Chamber is very \ncomfortable with. So we want to find a way to deal with that issue, as \nwell.\n  I applaud the effort that others have made to talk about priorities \nas we deal with the rescission package and the offsets required for \nFEMA. I hope, as we go through this whole debate, we will be very \ncognizant of the need to ensure a proper balance between that \ninvestment and meaningful deficit reduction.\n  We want some bipartisan cooperation here, as well. We want to ensure \nthat our amendment is adequately debated, that we have a vote on this \namendment; not one in the second degree, not on some substitute, but an \nup-or-down vote on this amendment, so we can say, without equivocation, \nthese are our priorities, unaffected by whatever additional amendments \nothers may want to offer.\n  We want to have a clear statement of priorities and a clear statement \nof intent with regard to what our investment truly is.\n  We are at a crossroads. I think that crossroads, to a certain extent, \nis going to be affected by decisions we make on this particular bill. \nWe can choose to work together and find ways with which to ensure that \nDemocrat concerns can be addressed as well as Republican concerns.\n  But second-degree amendments used to prevent us from having an up-or-\ndown vote on something we hold to be very important sends the wrong \nmessage, I believe, about our desire to work together to accommodate \nboth sides as we take up very serious legislation.\n  We have legitimate amendments that reflect our thoughts about the \ndirection our country should take on balancing the budget. Whether it \nis in this bill or whether it is in bills that will be taken up at a \nlater date, I hope that the majority would allow votes to be cast on \neach and every one of these issues.\n  We have a difference of opinion with the majority over how best to \ncut $1.3 billion. We have about $1.2 trillion to go as we balance the \nbudget over the course of the next 7 years. We are not going to get \nthere unless we work together.\n  The approach taken by the majority on this bill so far does not bode \nwell. The overwhelming majority, if not all of our colleagues, on the \nDemocratic side support the amendment that we have laid down.\n  Let there be no mistake. This was not done at the behest of the \nPresident of the United States, as has been suggested. This proposal \nwas the response of our caucus. We feel compelled to stand up for \nchildren. We feel compelled to speak up for working families.\n  If the other side moves to table our amendment and has the votes, \nthere will be others offered to address the needs of working families \nby cutting other less urgent priorities. But we are willing to offer \nthem in a deliberate process that can be performed expeditiously, and I \nhope the majority would respect that.\n  If, on the other hand, our amendment would be agreed to, we could \ncomplete our work on this bill even more expeditiously. And I hope that \nremains a possibility. I hope that Republicans and Democrats could \nagree that, indeed, we must reduce the deficit, indeed we must find \nways with which to maximize the opportunities to fund FEMA, but I think \nwe would also agree that respecting the investment that we have made in \nour commitment to kids and our commitment to schools and our commitment \nto working families ought to be respected, as well.\n  So, we really have a choice here, Mr. President. I hope that we could \nsupport both the need to ensure that the Federal Emergency Management \nAdministration has the resources necessary to continue its \nextraordinary work in providing emergency assistance to communities all \nover the country, and I hope that we could also move ahead with \nmeaningful deficit reduction.\n  But I also hope that in addition to those two priorities, what I have \nsaid about our commitment to investment in kids in education could be \nat the top of the list as well.\n  There have been calls on the other side of the aisle to privatize the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting, and the majority leader's \namendment is the first step in laying that groundwork by cutting the \nfunding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. That is another \nissue. I hope that those of us who are opposed to taking that draconian \napproach toward public broadcasting will have the opportunity to debate \nit up or down.\n  But the issue here is not public broadcasting; it is not anything \nother than what we have listed on this chart. The issue here is child \ncare; it is Head Start; it is giving kids an opportunity to earn \ncollege access and college tuition by participating in national \nservice; it is ensuring we have good preventive care; it is ensuring \nthat we have the kind of investments in schools that we really need if, \nindeed, we are serious about maintaining the commitment to schools to \nmaximize their educational opportunities to the children who walk in \nthe doors each and every day.\n  So those really are the issues here, Mr. President. We hope that \npeople understand the need to restore the child care opportunities for \n5,000 children, as we have listed. It tells working families that we \nwant them to continue to work and to generate all the income their \ntalents will allow and we are going to assist them in their child care \nneeds. Without child care, many low-income parents may find themselves \non welfare. Our amendment will enable those parents to continue work.\n  We had an opportunity just last week to meet a couple who \nparticipated in a news conference with us on minimum wage. It was a \ncouple from Pennsylvania who had been on welfare who came to the \nconclusion less than a year ago that they were not going to allow \nthemselves to be dependent anymore, who decided they were going to go \nout and find jobs, and find the kinds of opportunities in the private \nsector we have been admonishing them to go out and find.\n  Unfortunately, all they could find were minimum-wage jobs or \nsomething slightly above minimum wage. I think, in one case, one of the \njobs they had paid $5 an hour rather than $4.25. They did not have \nhealth insurance. They \n[[Page S5059]] have two children. The children get sick from time to \ntime. They have no way with which to address their children's illness. \nThey try to keep their health care bills low, but they said, ``It was \nso much easier when we were on welfare. We had Medicaid. We could go \ninto the hospital and we knew at least we had minimal coverage. We had \nincome that was almost as good as what we have right now, and we did \nnot have to worry about child care.''\n  That is exactly the dilemma a lot of young families are facing. They \ndo not want to be on welfare. They want to find alternatives. What we \nare trying to tell them is if you go out and do the right thing, we are \ngoing to reward work. We want to reward work by making sure that your \nincome at the end of a hard-working week is not going to relegate you \nto poverty, even though you may be struggling.\n  We know that you have to go out and find perhaps a second job, and we \nare willing to accept that. But if you go out and make sure you do what \nwe expect you to do, that is, not rely upon welfare to meet your needs, \nwe want to the extent we can help you with meaningful child care, and \nwith meaningful pay for the work that you do each and every day. We \nwant to send you the message that we are glad that you made the \ndecision not to be on welfare and that you are going to continue to be \nproductive citizens within your community by working at jobs that we \nhope will begin paying more.\n  But that is really the issue here with regard to taking care of their \nchildren, with regard to educating their children, with regard to \nproviding them with adequate nutrition, with regard to ensuring that \nonce their children go to school that they have the necessary resources \nto be taught and to be as competitive in the United States as they need \nto be, given the competition in other countries.\n  So, Mr. President, that is really what our message is. We want to \nmake work pay. We want to make work pay by providing meaningful \nopportunities for children who may need child care support. We want to \nprovide meaningful opportunities for children who are beneficiaries of \nthe Head Start Program. And we also, as I said, want to help 36,000 \nyoung people who will benefit from national service by the continuation \nof a program that, in our view, has worked exceedingly well in the very \nshort period of time that we have seen it in operation.\n  If our amendment is not adopted, a promise will be broken to tens of \nthousands of young Americans, the communities they serve, and the \ncharitable groups they help. These organizations and communities have \nnow been told we are going to have this program there; it is going to \nwork; you can count on people assisting you as you go through the \ndifficult decisions you have to with regard to how you are going to \ncope with your budget and how you are going to address many of the \noperational challenges that you face every day.\n  This program is really a partnership, a partnership with communities, \na partnership with organizations, a partnership with young people who \nrecognize that when there is an expectation that assistance can be \nprovided for college that, indeed, the reciprocal responsibility is to \nensure that those children and those young people understand that there \nis a commitment required of them, as well.\n  So national service is something I hope is around for a long period \nof time, a program that I believe deserves our full support. Simply to \neliminate it, to forget its success already, would be very \nshortsighted, indeed. In fact, I hope that Republicans can join us, as \nthey have in the past, in recognizing just what a tremendous \nopportunity it is for a lot of young people.\n  So, Mr. President, I think the message is very clear; it is pretty \nsimple. The message is simply that we want to do what everybody here \nsays we ought to do, and that is reduce the deficit to the extent that \nwe can; provide the funds necessary to ensure that the Federal \nEmergency Management Administration is given the adequate funds \nnecessary to continue in their role; but then, third, we also recognize \nthe very delicate balance that we have in providing the investment that \nwe need to provide in ensuring the continuity of a lot of the services \nthat we now provide schools, children, and working families.\n  So I hope that as we make our decision about this amendment, we \nunderstand that there is a need to maintain that balance; we understand \nthat it sends exactly the wrong message to say no, we are going to have \nto cut child care, Head Start, cut funding for something as valuable as \nnational service, but somehow we are going to protect those expatriates \nwho renounce their citizenship in order to save tax dollars. We should \nnot say that we are going to protect the billionaires, but we are not \ngoing to protect the children.\n  I know that there are many people in this Chamber who would support \nthat notion, but I think it sends the wrong message if we are on record \nas willing to allow the billionaire expatriates to avoid paying taxes \nand yet vote to cut successful children's programs as dramatically as \nthis.\n  So I hope, Mr. President, we can be cognizant of the message our vote \non this amendment will send. We want to ensure that deficit reduction, \nthat FEMA funding, and that investments in kids and working families \nare all protected. This amendment does that. It does that by restoring \nsome of the balance that was lost, especially in the House, restored in \npart in the Senate Appropriations Committee, and now can be restored \nalmost in its entirety by voting in favor of the amendment we are \noffering now.\n  We will have more to say about it certainly tomorrow morning and in \nthe coming debate over perhaps the course of the next day or so. I hope \nwe can convince our Republican colleagues that this is an amendment \nworthy of their support.\n  I would like to see a strong bipartisan message that Republicans and \nDemocrats support the commitment we have made to kids, the commitment \nwe have made to working families. I certainly hope that before the end \nof this debate, Republicans and Democrats can demonstrate that support \nand vote in favor of this amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 40 minutes \nto be equally divided on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, can the \nPresident inform the Senate as to what the current unanimous-consent \nagreement allows with regard to remaining time on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are nearly 26 minutes left under the \nunanimous-consent order on this debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask the Senator from Iowa whether it is his intent to \nseek 40 minutes in addition to that 26 minutes? I have not yielded back \nthe 26 minutes, so I want to protect that in case other Senators may be \ninterested in coming to the floor to speak on the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. My request would be in addition to the 26 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of the committee's \nactions regarding AmeriCorps. I particularly want to commend Senator \nBond for his work in this area. But I also have had an opportunity to \nhear Senators Kyl, Ashcroft, Santorum and Faircloth speak very \neloquently on the very same subject. I compliment them for their fine \nremarks.\n  I know that Senator Bond has been closely reviewing the AmeriCorps \nProgram and has found, as I have, that there are many unanswered \nquestions concerning AmeriCorps, and further increases at this time do \nnot seem to be advisable.\n  I have been looking closely at AmeriCorps since last July when I \nbegan a series of letters requesting information and data about \nAmeriCorps. Unfortunately, I did not receive answers to many of the \nquestions that I asked, or the information I received was either \nmisleading or incomplete.\n  Recently, AmeriCorps has promised me access to much of the data that \nI requested, and I hope this reflects a genuine change of attitude and \na willingness to cooperate.\n   [[Page S5060]] However, even from the information that I have been \nprovided, there are many reasons to question the merits of this \nprogram. Let me first focus on the cost of the program, because in \nreviewing the actual AmeriCorps grant awards, we have found program \nafter program where costs are $30,000 to $40,000 per AmeriCorps worker.\n  For example, the organization ACORN recently received a grant of over \n$1 million from AmeriCorps. ACORN also receives funds from Fannie Mae \nas well. This program is for 42 AmeriCorps workers, and the cost per \nworker of over $41,000.\n  In comparison we could help 20 young people go to college through the \nuse of Pell grants with that same amount of money. Let me add that the \ncosts of the ACORN program do not include the significant Federal \noverhead, nor the fact that many AmeriCorps workers drop out of the \nprogram. Thus, the cost per successful worker, which ought to be the \ntrue cost measurement of this program, would be significantly higher \nthan $41,000.\n  As I mentioned, the cost of $41,000 per worker is by no means out of \nthe ordinary for AmeriCorps. Legal Services Corporation received almost \n$1 million from AmeriCorps with the cost per AmeriCorps worker of over \n$48,000. Recently, AmeriCorps finally admitted that in one grant to a \nLos Angeles school district the taxpayers were paying a consultant $50 \nan hour--that is an hour, Mr. President.\n  We are being told that AmeriCorps is beneficial. I do not know what \nbenefit the taxpayers are getting by having somebody on an hourly wage \nearning the equivalent of over $100,000 per year. This is outrageous \nand, of course, it gives other boondoggles a bad name.\n  Mr. President, let me compare AmeriCorps workers with the Boy Scouts, \nfor instance--a well-known group of people who are out doing good every \nday. They do not receive any money from AmeriCorps. In fact, they were \nturned down for funding by AmeriCorps so that funding could be provided \nto such traditional volunteer groups as the EPA and the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  The Boy Scouts have over 5.3 million young people and adults \nperforming volunteer work and helping in their communities. According \nto the Boy Scouts' 1993 annual report, for the National Capital Area \nCouncil, their total expenses were $4.8 million, for over 50,000 \nScouts, that is $95 per Scout per year.\n  Well, that sounds about right, does it not? The Federal Government \npays someone $50 an hour for 750 hours of work for a total of $37,500 \nto consult about volunteering. And the private sector can give you \nalmost 400 actual volunteers with the same amount of money without a \ndime of cost to the taxpayers. Let me say that these Scouts are doing \njust great work. For example, last November, 40,000 Scouts in the DC \narea distributed 1 million bags to doorsteps of homes in their \ncommunities to help a food collection effort. The next week the Scouts \nreturned to collect the filled bags and to bring them to a central \ndistribution center, which was distributing the bags then to the needy \nduring the holiday season.\n  I want to now clarify a few points regarding AmeriCorps. First, \nAmeriCorps workers are spending a significant amount of their time \ndoing work other than helping their communities. For example, under \nAmeriCorps' own regulations published in the Federal Register, \nAmeriCorps workers can spend taxpayers' money studying for the GED. I \ndo think that it is fine and good that young people are taking time to \nstudy for the GED. However, it is questionable whether our taxpayers' \nmoney should pay some young people to study for the GED, when hundreds \nof thousands study for it without receiving a single dollar from the \ntaxpayers.\n  The second point I want to make, in summary, is that AmeriCorps was \npresented to Congress as a way to help young people pay for college. \nYet, according to AmeriCorps' own admission, at least a fifth of the \nworkers have not attended college and probably will not attend college. \nThey are not receiving an educational award. They are instead getting \ncash awards, as was revealed by NBC news very recently. For many, this \nis just another Government jobs program.\n  Mr. President, AmeriCorps is a program with costs that are far \nexceeding the estimates provided by the administration. It is a program \nthat may not be managing the taxpayers' money properly. In many \nrespects, it is a questionable use of taxpayer funds. Since we could \ncertainly stretch these dollars a lot further in programs such as Pell \ngrants.\n  Finally, AmeriCorps is a proposal that is duplicating, at enormous \nexpense, services that are being provided by the private sector. I, \nlike Senator Bond and so many others, am a skeptic of this program. I \nam holding off final judgment until I receive the information promised \nme by AmeriCorps and by the results of the General Accounting Office \nreport that is reviewing the cost of the AmeriCorps Program. Once the \ndata is in, the program may need reinvention. Certainly, we can \naccomplish the goals of this program without awarding grants with costs \nof $40,000-plus per worker.\n  To increase funding for AmeriCorps at this time, with so little known \nand with so many problems that are known, is not in the best interest \nof the taxpayers. We need to proceed cautiously with this program until \nall of the data is in.\n  So I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against any efforts to \nincrease funding for this program.\n  I yield the floor and yield back any of my unused time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. How much time is remaining on the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just over 12 minutes remain in the debate.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to continue the discussion on the \nDole amendment which, again, provides an additional cut in spending of \n$1.3 billion for this fiscal year, the year we are in right now. It \nwould supersede the Daschle amendment that would put back another $1.3 \nbillion in spending, and it leaves in place the $1.3 billion that was \ngoing to be taken away from the original purpose of this bill, which \nwas a disaster relief fund.\n  So $1.3 billion is scheduled to go to California under this bill. \nAgain, the reason for this bill even being here is because of the \nearthquake disaster in California.\n  The amendment of the Democratic leader takes $1.3 billion, takes that \naway, and replaces it with a whole bunch of other programs.\n  What we do is leave the money there, take his programs away and, in \nfact, reduces the deficit by $1.3 billion more.\n  We think that is the general direction that we should try to reduce \nthe deficit and programs that we believe merit further scrutiny and \nreduction without being disruptive here in the middle of a fiscal year.\n  One of the programs, as the Senator from Iowa just very articulately \nsaid, is the AmeriCorps Program. This is the one area where not only is \nthere a contention whether we should cut it, but where the Democratic \nleader wants to increase funding for AmeriCorps from the current bill, \nand the majority leader wants to decrease funding from the bill.\n  It is the one area we have in common on the two amendments, but we \nare going in opposite directions. I think it is appropriate, because it \nprobably represents the best discussion of the differences between the \ndirection of the two parties when it comes to the role of Government in \nproviding services to individuals, and, really, the concept of what \nGovernment should do and what can be left to the private sector.\n  Interestingly enough, we have a program such as the AmeriCorps \nProgram which hires Corps volunteers. Most people say, if you hire \nsomeone, they are no longer a volunteer.\n  That is somehow lost on the people who created the AmeriCorps \nProgram, because hiring a volunteer is, in fact, part of the \nvernacular. They hire volunteers in the AmeriCorps.\n  What do the volunteers get paid? We heard the number around here, I \nwill give you a number, from Wisconsin, which is put together by \nRepresentative Tom Petri from Wisconsin. That AmeriCorps volunteer, the \none who was, in fact, mentioned by President Clinton, I guess it is \nKentucky, a woman who was mentioned by President Clinton in his speech \non the state \n[[Page S5061]] of the Union, who teaches second-graders to read in \nrural Kentucky, a compelling story that the President used during his \nState of the Union Address. This person gets paid $9,000--not a lot of \nmoney--but $9,000 in stipend pay. In addition, she gets a voucher to \npay for her higher education of a little over $5,000; she gets roughly \n$8,000 in child care benefit paid to by the Government under this \nprogram; she gets Medicaid coverage which is $4,000 for her family of \nfive; because most of her benefits are tax free she qualifies for \nanother $3,200 in earned income tax credits, making this job that she \nhas equivalent to a job that pays $34,000 in the private sector. Now, \nthat is a lot for a volunteer.\n  I happen to agree with what the President of the Ohio-West Virginia \nYMCA said:\n\n       The national service movement is about institutionalizing \n     Federal funding for national and community service. It is \n     about changing the language and the understanding of service \n     to eliminate the words ``volunteer'' and ``community \n     service'' and in their place implant the idea that service is \n     something paid for by the Government.\n\n  That was someone from the YMCA.\n  This is dangerous program. People say, wow, dangerous program. Is \nthat not extreme? How can this program be dangerous? This is dangerous \nto the whole philosophy of who America is, what we are all about.\n  Are we a country that is a great country because we have great \nGovernment employees? I would think that the people around the world \nlook at America and they say we are a great country, but probably not \nanywhere in their top 50 of their reasons is that we have great \nbureaucrats, that is the reason America is a great country.\n  I can guarantee on the top 10 of any list is that America has a great \nspirit of community and helping your neighbor and voluntarism. As de \nTocqueville said, ``America is great because it is good. When it ceases \nbeing good, it will no longer be great.''\n  Paying volunteers decreases our goodness. It is not the American \nspirit. It is not reaching out to help your neighbor just because they \nare neighbors, not because you get paid for it.\n  Do not tell me all these compassionate stories of how these people \nare so wonderful because they are helping. They are wonderful. It is \ngreat to help. But they are no different than the insurance agent who \nhelps someone who comes and has their car wrecked and comes and helps \nthen. It is their job. It is a wonderful job. It is an important job. \nIt is necessary for the insurance person who helps. But do not raise \nthis to some elevated standard of national and community service when, \nin fact, it is paid bureaucrat.\n  I have a suggestion. I happen to agree that there is a lot of work \nout there that can and should be done by folks in the genre of the \nAmeriCorps Program. We have a solution for that. It targets the people \nwho need the jobs. It targets the people that need the training, who \nneed the work experience.\n  I heard the Democratic leader say ``all these young people in \nAmeriCorps.'' Again, talk to the facts. You can be 60 years of age and \nbe in AmeriCorps. It is not focused at young people. You can be a \nmultimillionaire and you can be in AmeriCorps. There is no age other \nthan up to 60, and there is no income qualifications.\n  Now, I can tell Members that we have a pool of people who desperately \nneed help, who desperately want to work to feel that they can give \nback. The community needs them as much as they need the community. It \nis people on public assistance. People on welfare.\n  We create a program as we do in the Republican welfare reform bill \nthat puts people needing job skills, training, and just some success in \ntheir life, give them the opportunity to go out and work that job. Why \nnot give them the chance? Why give some rich doctor's kid $34,000 a \nyear to go to school?\n  That is not what this program should be about. That is not a program, \nI do not think, this body wants to defend. It sounds so grand and it \nsounds so wonderful when they talk about how wonderful voluntarism is, \nbut, folks, look at the facts.\n  As well-meaning as this program is, this is a program that is another \nsocial experiment based in Washington that is destructive of our nature \nand our character as Americans. We should end it. Quickly, decisively, \nand hopefully, tomorrow.\n  I reserve the balance of our time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on behalf of the minority leader, I yield \nmyself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, as has been mentioned during the course of the debate \non the Daschle amendment, part of the Daschle amendment applies to \nrestoration of some $210 million for the AmeriCorps Program. This \nprogram has been addressed earlier, in the course of the afternoon, and \nI will take a few moments to comment upon it.\n  First of all, Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to hear from \nmy colleagues who talk about how even a stipend which effectively is \nthe minimum wage should not be available for individuals who want to \nvolunteer in their community.\n  There are many in this institution who would evidently like to \npreserve voluntarism just for the very wealthy individuals in our \ncountry. There are a lot of needy kids, a lot of poor people, who have \na sense of idealism and a commitment to service, and who would like to \nbe able to take the time that others who have the financial resources \ncan take in order to volunteer and to do good works.\n  The AmeriCorps concept is to give people an opportunity to work in \ntheir communities. It does provide a stipend which is basically the \nminimum wage. It does provide an award at the end of service to \nencourage people to go back to school, or to go to school. These are \npeople who otherwise probably would not be able to afford it.\n  The educational award is about $4,700. We basically took what was \ngoing to be an average cost for tuition in State universities across \nthe country. Most of those State universities' costs have gone up. But \nit is still a good start. So AmeriCorps lets young people go there--it \ncombines service and education.\n  I am so interested to hear some people say that some of these \nprograms are not going well. Talk to your Governors. This is a State \nand local responsibility, not a Federal program. Ask your Governors how \nit is working. I know that in Massachusetts, the participants do a \nsuperb job.\n  There are outstanding business men and women. There are local \ncommunity leaders and activists--all of whom are involved in the \nshaping and the fashioning of the program.\n  If there are some programs that are not working, I am sure Eli Segal \nwants to know about them. We will get busy trying to do something about \nthem. But the fact of the matter is, this is not a Federal program \ncontrolled from the top down. This is a program that is developed and \nrun in local communities, with local support and initiative.\n  I would like to mention a recent study which surveyed what 1,654 \nAmeriCorps workers accomplished in 5 months. These 1,654 workers are \nonly 8 percent of the 20,000 total AmeriCorps participants.\n  These 1,654 people taught and tutored 15,480 children from preschool \nto junior high school. These children had no other opportunity to get \nthis kind of additional educational help and assistance.\n  These 1,654 people established afterschool programs for 4,650 \nchildren. Those are children of working-class and working families, \nchildren who probably would have been left unattended if they had not \nbeen involved in those afterschool programs. The AmeriCorps \nparticipants work under supervision to develop tutorial programs and \nother effective programs.\n  These 1,654 people organized community service projects for 4,400 \nchildren.\n  These 1,654 people escorted some 8,500 children in schools through \nsafe corridors. We can say, what does that really mean? The fact is, if \nyou get children who live in difficult areas with high crime rates, the \nAmeriCorps people work out a system so the children can go safely to \nthe school and return to school. Maybe it is difficult for us to \nunderstand what is happening out there in many of the urban areas--in \nthe inner cities. But you have thousands of children who are so \nintimidated that they will not go to school. The AmeriCorps members \nhave developed programs that have the broad support of the children and \nthe parents, programs that permit the children to go to school through \nsafe corridors.\n   [[Page S5062]] These 1,654 people have been doing work with gangs to \nreduce gang violence, as well as work with victims of domestic violence \nand other troubled teenagers.\n  The list goes on--a number of immunization programs as well. I will \ninclude in the Record a list of the accomplishments--these are all \naccomplishments of only 1,654 volunteers, or 8 percent of the total, \nand these were randomly selected.\n  I should also mention the work that has been done in southern Texas \non immunization programs. There are thousands and thousands of children \ntoday who are immunized, and without that program they would not have \nbeen immunized.\n  A study recently released of the first 5 months of the AmeriCorps \nprogram surveyed 52 program sites--or about 8 percent of the total \nsites. 1,654 participants--out of a total of 20,000--were working at \nthese sites. Here is a sample of what they accomplished.\n  On education, the 1,654 AmeriCorps members worked largely in poor \nurban and rural areas;\n  They taught and tutored 9,068 pre-school, elementary school, and \njunior high school students in basic educational skills;\n  They developed or ran enriched learning programs such as computer-\nbased instruction, scientific experimentation, and peer tutoring for \n6,414 children;\n  They established after-school and vacation programs for 4,656 \nchildren;\n  They organized community service projects for 4,469 children;\n  They provided literacy or employment training for 694 adults; and\n  They provided intensive educational support--including regular \ncounseling--to 30 troubled teenagers living in group homes and 22 \nhomeless preschoolers.\n  On public safety, the 1,654 AmeriCorps members worked to reduce \nviolence in families, in schools, and on the streets;\n  They escorted 8,500 children to school through safe corridors;\n  They started 258 neighborhood safety programs and patroled 250 vacant \nbuildings;\n  They resolved 414 school conflicts that might otherwise have ended in \nviolence, and taught conflict resolution to 8,119 children;\n  They counseled 1,350 potential or actual gang members and taught \nalternatives to violence;\n  They answered crisis hotlines and made referrals for 878 victims of \nsexual and domestic violence, and provided counseling for 470 such \nvictims; and\n  They counseled 1,180 teenagers about alcohol and drug abuse.\n  On health, the 1,654 AmeriCorps members provided medical services and \ninformation to low-income families;\n  They trained 1,144 inner-city residents in CPR;\n  They provided emergency medical services to over 1,500 people;\n  They screened 1,100 low-income children for lead toxicity and other \nhealth risks;\n  They distributed 150 car seats to low-income families, and immunized \n158 people;\n  They provided health counseling and transportation to 220 low-income \nfamilies and over 5,000 individuals, and provided health information to \nover 4,500 individuals; and\n  They conducted workshops and distributed information on AIDS and \ntuberculosis to over 7,000 people, and conducted 301 HIV tests and \ncounseled patients on the results.\n  On meeting basic needs, the 1,654 AmeriCorps members provided food, \nshelter, and support for senior citizens, low-income families, and \nhomeless people;\n  They helped 123 elderly persons, 50 visually impaired adults, and 9 \nvisually impaired children to live independently;\n  They organized weekly social activities for 400 nursing home \nresidents;\n  They built wheelchair ramps at five low-income homes, four public \nbuildings, and three parks;\n  They trained and supervised 58 volunteers and then repaired the homes \nof 256 senior citizens;\n  They renovated 238 inner-city housing units and 99 rural homes, and \nare working on the renovation of 121 more;\n  They refurbished 2 homeless shelters and began to renovate a home for \nsenior citizens, a home for battered women, and a home for the formerly \nhomeless;\n  They distributed food to more than 16,625 low-income people and \npacked 7,000 dinners and 32,000 breakfasts for the hungry;\n  They found shelter for 400 homeless families, and they sorted and \ndistributed clothes to 350 homeless individuals;\n  They secured hospice housing for 27 people with AIDS and helped \nweekly to feed 1,250 people who are HIV-positive;\n  They provided housing information to over 500 low-income and homeless \nfamilies; and\n  They found donated furniture, repaired it, and delivered it to 300 \nnewly housed families;\n  On environmental and neighborhood restoration, the 1,654 AmeriCorps \nmembers responded to emergencies, restored the natural environment, and \nimproved urban neighborhoods and parks;\n  They inspected and repaired 87 small dams, protecting 200 farms;\n  They provided disaster recovery assistance to 350 small land owners \nrecovering from a flood, including advice on floodplain management;\n  They fought 2 major forest fires, saved 1 national park road from \nwashing out, and joined 5 search and rescue efforts;\n  They planted 212,500 trees;\n  They restored 320 acres of wild land and 27 miles of riverbed and \nstream banks;\n  They removed 2,000 pounds of trash from an urban river;\n  They surveyed 5,700 acres of National Forest land and monitored \nreforestation efforts;\n  They built, restored, or maintained 311 campsites, 88 miles of \ntrails, and 17 bridges, 4 beaches, and 3 duck blinds;\n  They converted 29 overgrown lots into green space, built 7 community \ngardens, and planted trees along 30 city blocks;\n  They created 4 playgrounds and restored, repaired, or maintained 19 \nhistorical landmarks;\n  They distributed 1,375 water-conserving toilets and 1,700 water-\nconserving showerheads in low-income neighborhoods; and\n  They renovated 11 community buildings, including an inner-city \nmedical clinic, community centers, and public schools.\n  This is only a small sample of what community service participants \nhave done. These examples are from a survey of 52 randomly selected \nAmeriCorps sites between September 1994 and January 1995. In 5 months, \njust 1,654 participants accomplished all this.\n  In all, there are 20,000 AmeriCorps participants in the field this \nyear--and they will work for at least 9 months. They are doing \nimportant work--work that makes their communities and the Nation a \nbetter place.\n  In addition, hundreds of thousands of children are learning about \ncommunity service through their schools with the help of grants from \nthe ``Learn and Serve'' part of the Federal legislation. These children \nare learning the ideal of service, and they will keep it all their \nlives.\n  They are also getting things done in their communities. In \nSpringfield, MA, Putnam Vocational High School had the highest dropout \nrate in the district. It received an $1,800 grant through the ``Learn \nand Serve'' part of the program, and a group of students built a health \nfacility for the school and the community.\n The students did the carpentry, electrical wiring, and construction \nwork as part of their vocational courses. The result is a new health \nclinic that includes four examining rooms, two counseling rooms, a lab, \nand an auditorium for health education classes.\n\n  Is this the kind of initiative Republicans want to stop?\n  To my colleagues who say that we need to be spending our tax dollars \nwisely, I ask, isn't it wise to give young people the opportunity to \ntutor young children, build low-income housing, and work to prevent \ngangs?\n  We must not let partisan politics derail this important initiative. \nIf you want to know whether community service is a good investment, ask \nthe 20,000 Americans who are participating in full-time service though \nAmeriCorps or the more than 300,000 students from kindergarten through \ncollege who are doing service that is integrated into \n[[Page S5063]] their academic studies through ``Learn and Serve.''\n  Even more important, ask the people whose lives they have touched. \nAsk the homeless preschoolers who received counseling and education. \nAsk the chidden who can go to school with less fear of being shot. Ask \nthe senior citizens who received support and home repairs. Ask the low-\nincome families who received hot meals or new homes. Ask the small \nfarmers whose land was protected from floods. Ask the parents who lived \nnext door to the polluted river.\n  I do not know where the opposition to this program is coming from. \nWith all the problems we have in this country, we are trying to give an \nopportunity to some 20,000 young Americans who want to do something for \ntheir communities. I can't believe the hours that are being taken to \ntry and demolish that program. Surely we have other needs in our Nation \nand better things to do than trying to dismantle the voluntary service \nprograms in this country.\n  Yet, Mr. President, it seems that there are those who want to do \nthis. I think it is appropriate that we have a chance to debate this \nissue.\n  I want to just mention some of the businesses that are involved in \npartnerships with the nonprofit organizations that develop and sponsor \nthe AmeriCorps programs.\n  In my own State, Timberland is a well-known and enormously successful \ncorporation. It helps pay for participants' uniforms, sponsors \nindividual teams of young people, provides employment opportunities for \nCity Year graduates, and runs a national marketing campaign to benefit \nthe program.\n  Timberland invested some $5 million to be used over the next 5 years \nto help City Year expand in new communities across the Nation. They \nknow that this is not just some program that is not worth its salt. \nThey are not in there to just throw $5 million around--throw $5 million \naway. This is one of the really outstanding companies that has decided \nthat City Year is a good, valuable program, and they are down there, \nworking with these young people and helping to develop, on the basis of \nsuccess in Boston, this program in other cities around the country.\n  The Bank of Boston is also allied with the City Year Program in \nBoston. The bank director, Ira Jackson, told the Boston Herald last \nweek, ``Our commitment to City Year has been the most successful \nphilanthropic investment this institution has made in its 208-year \nhistory.''\n  This is the Bank of Boston, and its association with the City Year \nProgram is their best philanthropic investment in 208 years.\n  J.P. Morgan supports a program called AmeriCorps Leaders which places \nexperienced graduates of community service programs in new programs to \nhelp them get started.\n  IBM helped develop an AmeriCorps program called Project First that \naims to improve students' technology skills. Community service \nparticipants serve alongside retired IBM retirees in public schools to \nhelp bring the new technologies into the classrooms and integrate \ncomputers into the curriculum. In Boston, for example, they might work \nwith children and with computers in the many schools that do not have a \ngreat range of electronics. They work with them, tie them into graduate \nstudents--for example, over at MIT or other technical institutes--to \nhelp those children work, to help them figure out their homework, to \ngive them additional assistance with school. It is a very creative, \nimaginative program that is already paying off significantly with \nenhanced academic achievements and accomplishments. It is also an \nenormous source of satisfaction for the volunteers.\n  General Electric, in partnership with the United Way, has invested \nsome $250,000 in national community service.\n  These corporations I am mentioning, if they had listened this \nafternoon to the critics of these programs, they would not have \nunderstood what they were hearing. They would not have recognized the \nprogram that these critics were describing. They would have wondered \nwhat they are doing with their dough. These are major American \ncompanies and corporations that generally get value for every dollar \nthat they spend. They have been enthusiastic about investing money in \nnational and community service programs.\n  This is a partnership program. These programs are developed in local \ncommunities, with the help of businesses and nonprofit organizations, \nand then they are approved at State level.\n  Mr. SANTORUM assumed the chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. You know, this has been a modest program. We agreed to \nphase it in over 3 years--$300 million, $500 million, $700 million. We \nare not saying this program will answer all the problems facing us. But \ncertainly, we as a country ought to be able to challenge our young \npeople to give something back to the community in return for all it has \ngiven to them. That is basically what this program is about. We are \nsaying, ``Look, during the period of the 1980's and early 1990's, we \ndid not provide a lot of opportunities for young people who wanted to \nbe a part of the process and be involved in the community.''\n  Sure, voluntarism is a time-honored tradition and of significant \nvalue. Sure, it is taking place. Sure, there are a lot of young people \nin this country who do not need this kind of stipend and do not need \nthis support. But I do think that, when you review these programs, you \nwill find--I know in my own State, with which I am more familiar than \nwith other parts of the country, although I have met AmeriCorps workers \nfrom all over--you will find that the participants are outstanding.\n  Maybe some of my colleagues who have been the most critical have \nspent a good deal of time in their States and in their local \ncommunities visiting these programs and talking with the participants. \nMaybe they have. I see my friend and colleague, the Presiding Officer \nnow, from Pennsylvania. I should tell him that I have heard good \nwitnesses from Philadelphia who talked about this program. Pennsylvania \nhas been an important leader in developing these programs, both in \ncities and in rural areas. We have had inspirational testimony about \nthe difference that this program has made in those young people's \nlives.\n  I think we ought to be able to reach out to young people across this \ncountry who are trying to make a difference for their communities and \nfor their Nation. I think we ought to support them in their efforts. I \nam proud of the AmeriCorps Program. I am proud of the young people who \nserve in this program, who are trying to give something back to their \ncommunities. I think the program deserves the support of this Congress. \nI am very hopeful it will have that support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself time from the distinguished \nminority leader's allocated time. How much time is remaining under \nthat?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 33 minutes and 48 seconds.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, my colleagues, I have listened with a \ngreat deal of interest this afternoon, and last week to some extent, to \nmy colleagues speak on the program known as National Service or \nAmeriCorps. Unfortunately, I think it has become more of a political \ndebate than it has been a debate on the merits of this concept.\n  I was thinking the other day that if two Members of Congress, perhaps \ntwo Members of the Senate, would have the opportunity to sit down one \nevening and pretend that they were neither Republicans nor Democrats \nand they would say to each other, ``Well, let us for the sake of \nargument see if we can in the privacy of this room sit down and come up \nwith a program, not thinking about who gets the credit, but come up \nwith a program designed to bring about new ideas and how we might teach \nto our young men and women in this country something about community, \nsomething about opportunity, and something about responsibility, what \ntype of a program would we write, if we were not concerned about who \ngets the credit?''\n  I would think that in that room perhaps they would look out over the \nhistory of our country and say, ``All right, when Congress had that \nopportunity in the past, what type of programs did \n[[Page S5064]] Congress write?'' I think they would think back to one \nof the most successful programs being the GI bill. The GI bill was \nbased on a very simple premise; that was, people who served their \ncountry have an opportunity to get back something from their Government \nbut that they got something from their Government because they had \ngiven something to their Government in the first place. That was what \nthe GI bill was based on. It said to returning GI's who had served this \ncountry in the military that because of your service, your country is \ngoing to help you. We were going to help you go to the college of your \nchoice. And as a result of that program, we gave literally hundreds of \nthousands of young Americans the opportunity to go to college, not \nbecause it was a handout, not because it was a grant, not because it \nwas some sort of entitlement, but it was based on the theory that they \nhad given something to their country and, therefore, their country was \ngoing to give them something back. And what we gave them was an \nopportunity for an education.\n  I would think then that the two Senators would say, ``All right, let \nus see if we can now craft a program that builds on that GI bill, that \nconcept that has served so many millions of Americans who have gone to \ncollege under the GI bill, let us see if we can craft a program that \nteaches young Americans something about responsibility, teaches them \nsomething about the communities that they live in, and something that \nalso gives them an opportunity to better themselves. And, oh, by the \nway, let us make sure that program that we write will cost no more than \none-thirtieth of 1 percent of our national budget.''\n  That would be a real challenge. But I guarantee you, if the two \nSenators did not care who got the credit, they would come up with \nsomething that is very close to the National Service Program, the \nprogram known as AmeriCorps, which today is facing the prospect of \nbeing slashed and burned and killed before it has a chance to ever-\npresent young Americans with opportunities, to teach them \nresponsibility, and teach them something about their community.\n  Suppose people when we talked about the GI bill had said, ``We are \nnot going to do that. Let them go out and earn their own living, let \nthem work. We are not going to have a GI program to help kids get to \ncollege. We don't care what their status is. We are not going to do \nthat.'' How many young Americans would not have had the opportunity to \nbe as successful as they are as a result of that program?\n  So what we have, I think, Mr. President, is a National Service \nProgram that should be allowed to continue. It should be allowed to \nprosper. It should be allowed to flourish. What that program says to \nyoung Americans is that we are going to ask you to work in your \ncommunity, not in a far-off country in another part of the world, \nalthough those services are needed, but we are going to ask you to work \nin your State, in your city, in your county. We are going to ask you to \nwork with your local people who have identified what their problems \nare, what their concerns are, where they need help, if they need help \nin education, if they need help in police protection, if they need help \nin environmental cleanup programs, if they need help in health services \nfor their local community. We are going to ask you to go back to your \nlocal community, and we are going to ask you to work in that local \ncommunity. We are going to pay you a minimum wage stipend because we \nknow you are not going to be able to do it if you do not have some form \nof assistance to allow you to feed yourself and clothe yourself and \nhelp you live your life.\n  We are going to pay you a minimum wage and ask you to do that, \nknowing that you could be making a lot more money in some other job, \nparticularly if you have already graduated from college and are now \npaying back these loans. But in return, if you do that, we are going to \nhelp you go to college. We are going to help you with a grant to go to \ncollege based on the fact that you have worked in your community to \nmake it a better place to live. That is the concept of reciprocal \nresponsibility. That is saying to young men and women that your \nGovernment is going to help you if you give something back, if you give \nsomething back to your community and this country right here in \nAmerica.\n  That is the whole essence of what the AmeriCorps Program is all \nabout. It is not a giveaway program. It is not saying we are just going \nto give you money because that is what Government is all about and go \nto college because your Government is giving you something and asking \nnothing in return.\n  Those two Senators, who would not care about which party got the \ncredit, would be very proud of this new direction, of this new \npartnership, of this new way of thinking, that says, yes.\n  We have programs that give grants to go to college. In most cases you \nhave to show that you are poor. In most cases you have to go through a \nlot of paperwork to show that your parents do not have enough money. \nBut this program will be based on the fact that we want to help anybody \nwho believes enough in their country to believe in working in their \nlocal communities, assuming some responsibility at a time in their \nlives when that is very, very important, connecting that young person \nto their community in a way that perhaps they have never had the \nexperience in doing before. And based on what they do, your Government \nwill help you go to college with assistance. I would suggest that \nprogram would be one that we could all be very proud of.\n  We know, unfortunately, the problem is Congress sometimes gets \ninvolved with who gets the credit, who gets the blame. I think a good \nprogram like this should have enough credit for everybody to take claim \nfor it.\n  I was interested just the other day in reading an article by one of \nour Republican colleagues from the House. He said in talking about this \nprogram and the Republican effort to slash it and to kill it and to, in \neffect, terminate it, this Republican House Member said, ``We have a \nwounded President.'' He further said that AmeriCorps ``is something \nthat this President deserves to be proud of, but it is a target for \nthose people who do not even want to give him that.''\n  I would suggest that is the real message that we are leaving on the \nfloor today, not that this is not a good program, not that it does not \nteach a young person something about his own community or her own \ncommunity, not that it does not teach them responsibility, that a \ngovernment will help you if you do something. There is no free lunch. \nAnd I would not suggest they are not going to have it because it gives \na young person opportunity by allowing them to have a college \neducation. No. I would suggest that this House Member hit the nail on \nthe head when he said that we have, in his opinion, a wounded \nPresident, this is a program that this President can and should be \nproud of, but that it is a target and it is a target not because of the \nmerits; it is a target because of the politics. I would suggest that is \nnot how we should legislate the future of young men and women in this \ncountry.\n  We have heard a lot of numbers thrown out on the floor today about \nhow much the program cost. It is costing us one-thirtieth of 1 percent \nof our national budget.\n  Is that too little to invest in giving young men and women an \nopportunity, a sense of community, and teaching them about \nresponsibility? I think not. In return for each full year of \ncommitment, a 2-year maximum, a volunteer can receive $4,725 in tuition \nassistance and health care and a stipend which is approximately the \nminimum wage.\n  So we pay young men and women a minimum wage to work in their local \ncommunity doing things that are extremely important in that local \ncommunity, and then, after they have done it, we say we will now help \nyou with tuition for you to go to college.\n  I think that is a bargain. I think that is a new way of thinking \nabout the role of individuals and their Government, that their \nGovernment is going to help them when they show responsibility and a \nwillingness to contribute to their local community. I would suggest \nthat is much better than just sending them the check and saying, \n``Well, we are the Government; here is the check; go to college.''\n  What we are saying with this program is that we are going to help you \nif you do something in return. I think that makes a great deal of \nsense.\n   [[Page S5065]] Some people say, ``Well, if you pay someone a minimum \nwage, they are not a volunteer.'' The former distinguished chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, the Senator from Georgia, Sam Nunn, my \ngood friend, almost laughed at that suggestion because we all know now \nwe have a volunteer army. Does anybody suggest it is not voluntary \nanymore because we pay them a salary? Of course, not. We pay everybody \nwho volunteers in the military. We pay them more than a minimum wage. \nWe pay them a livable salary. But the whole military is voluntary now. \nNo one is drafted. No one is required to serve. It is an All-Volunteer \nArmy, and yet we still pay men and women who voluntarily join the \nmilitary.\n  So I would suggest that paying a young person a minimum wage stipend \nin order to work in their local community does not detract from the \nfact that this is a voluntary program. Many of these young graduates \nwho return to work in their local communities are voluntarily doing it. \nThey could earn a great deal more if they would go right into the \nprivate sector at a high-wage job. But, no, they are saying this is \nwhat I wish to do. This is a way to pay back my Government for what it \nhas done for me. It is still clearly a voluntary program.\n  I do not understand why we are arguing about this. Some of the polls \nthat I have seen say that over 90 percent of the American public, when \nthey are explained in a rational and reasonable tone what the national \nservice program is all about, say this is a good idea; why did we not \nthink of it before? Why do we only have grants coming out of Washington \nthat you have to go through weeks and months of paperwork to make sure \nyou have the right income level to finally qualify? Why not say to all \nAmericans we are going to help you if you are willing to serve in your \ncommunity?\n  That is the essence of what national service is all about. That is \nthe essence of what AmeriCorps is all about. The Peace Corps was a \nsuccessful program. We sent men and women from our country to far-off \nlands to help improve conditions in those far-off countries and people \nthought it was a good idea. It was and it still is.\n  Here is a Peace Corps Program for our own country to help urban \nareas, to help rural areas, to help local officials who desperately \nneed young, talented, future leaders of this country working in their \ncommunities. I think the beautiful thing about it is that it is a \npartnership, it is a reciprocal partnership between you and your \nGovernment to help people quit thinking the Government owes them \nsomething, that just because they are born the Government owes them \nsomething and is going to pay for it. It is a partnership.\n  Again, if I could have those two Senators who did not care whether \nthey were Republican or Democrat, who did not care that this was Bill \nClinton's idea, I guarantee they could walk out of that room and say we \nthought of something that really makes sense. Let us make sense.\n  Is it perfect? Of course, not. Nothing is perfect. Are there some \nexamples of how things should not have been done? Of course. But the \nprogram is in its infancy stage. Let us let it breathe for a few years \nto try to get it on track. If there are some problems with it, let us \nfix the problems and make sure they do not occur again. But do not kill \nthe program. Do not say to the young men and women of America, we are \ngoing to continue to try and teach you there is something like a free \nlunch, because this program is just the opposite. This program says you \nwill get from your Government help and assistance when you agree to \ngive something back.\n  Funding was $575 million for fiscal year 1995, one-thirtieth of 1 \npercent of our budget. Can we not invest one-thirtieth of 1 percent in \nthe lives of future Americans, young men and women who want to learn \nabout community, who want to learn about responsibility, who want to \nhave opportunity given to them for what they have invested?\n  I think that is a wise expenditure of tax dollars. I think we are \ngoing to see great dividends paid, maybe not right now but in future \nyears; that when somebody sits back and compares some of the good \nprograms that Congress has done they will point to the GI bill as one \nof our most wonderful programs, but at that time, if we are successful, \nthey can also say that when Congress had the opportunity in the 1990's \nthey built on the GI bill and passed a national service program, and \nnow, maybe 10, 20 years later, it is producing the results we would \nlike to see.\n  Mr. President, I will be offering an amendment to help restore some \nof the draconian cuts that were passed by the House on this program. My \namendment would allow for still a 20-percent reduction in the spending \nfrom last year. Most programs come in and say we need more money, more \nmoney, more money. My amendment is going to say, all right, in this \ntime of fiscal balance and concern about deficits, let us reduce last \nyear's spending by 20 percent even though we have more money and more \nrequests than we did before. Let us reduce by 20 percent the \nPresident's request for the National Service Program, but let us keep \nit viable. Let us keep it working. Let us keep the innovative ideas \nthat are coming out of that program so that we can say, when we had the \nopportunity to teach our young men and women in this country the things \nthat are needed in order to make this country great, we stood up and \nwere counted and voted in favor of my amendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 minutes and 7 seconds.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of the minority leader's \ntime.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Daschle amendment. \nThis amendment is essential to restore funding for critical national \neducation and children's needs that were disproportionately targeted \nfor reduction in the rescission bill.\n  Last week, the Children's Defense Fund released its annual report, \n``The State of America's Children.'' CDF reports that child poverty has \nreached its highest level in more than 30 years. Last year, one in \nevery four children in our Nation was poor.\n  CDF reports:\n\n       An American child is reported abused or neglected every 11 \n     seconds; is born into poverty every 32 seconds; is born to a \n     teen mother every 62 seconds; is arrested for a violent crime \n     every four minutes; and is killed by guns every two hours.\n\n  Mr. President, no great nation can long survive if it does not \nprovide adequately for its children. I know of none of my colleagues \nwho would disagree with this statement. But, I know of too many who are \nprepared to violate its spirit by reducing funding for proven and vital \nprograms, by slashing welfare programs to save money, and by \nelimination the safety net that protects American families.\n  The rescission bill before us today contains $13 billion in cuts in \nFederal programs. Overall, this is a much better bill than the one that \npassed the House. But, nonetheless, a large and disproportionate share \nof these cuts are targeted at programs that benefit children and youth.\n\n\n                                children\n\n  This bill contains a 20-percent reduction in the President's \ninvestment programs. That reduction translates into a $42 million cut \nin Head Start.\n  Mr. President, last year I authored the Human Services Act that \nreauthorized the Head Start Program. At the time, I was prepared for a \nreal challenge and a spirited defense of the legislation on the floor. \nInstead the legislation passed unanimously with no dissension and no \nacrimony. Head Start is a proven program that gives disadvantaged \nyoungsters an early and important step forward in their educational \ndevelopment--yet this rescission bill goes after it.\n  The bill before us also includes an $8.4 million cut in the child \ncare and development block grant. Currently, eight States have more \nthan 10,000 children on child care assistance waiting lines. And many \nmore child care slots will be needed as we seek to move people from \nwelfare to work.\n  The Women, Infants, and Children's Program takes a $35 million hit in \nthis bill. WIC has always been a popular and bipartisan program. The \nprogram is a wise investment providing nutritional assistance to low-\nincome pregnant women and children. It saves money and lives in the \nprocess. Last year, I \n[[Page S5066]] joined with 70 of my colleagues in requesting full \nfunding for this vital program.\n  The Daschle amendment would restore the cuts in these three important \nprograms, and it would pare back cuts in education.\n\n\n                               education\n\n  Today, our Nation faces tremendous and unparalleled economic \nchallenges. Increased global economic competition and rapid advances in \ntechnology have created major structural changes in our work force.\n  If we are to meet the economic challenges of the 21st century, it is \ncritical that we invest in the education and training of our work \nforce--even if it takes us a little longer to get our budget fully into \nbalance.\n  Yet at precisely the time in our Nation's history when our \neducational challenges are greatest, the Federal commitment to \neducation has diminished. Since 1979, we have cut in half the Federal \ncommitment to elementary and secondary Education as a share of total \neducation spending. This decrease has exacerbated the disparities in \neducation spending across school districts and threatens to compromise \nour future economic productivity.\n  Education takes a heavy hit in this bill. It includes a $100 million \ncut in the only Federal program that seeks to combat violence and drug \nabuse in our schools--the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities \nAct.\n  It includes a $72 million cut in the title one program for \ndisadvantaged children. It includes a $68 million cut in the Goals 2000 \nProgram. This cut would deny seed money for implementing comprehensive \nreform plans to about 1,550 schools.\n  The Daschle amendment recognizes that these shortsighted cuts cost \nour Nation more in the long-run than they save today.\n\n\n                                Housing\n\n  The largest cuts in the rescission bill occur in Federal housing \nprograms. The rescission bill includes more than $4.5 billion in cuts \nin the Department of Housing and Urban Development's current budget. If \nenacted, these cuts will hurt low-income people struggling to find \ndecent housing and reduce economic opportunity in our urban \ncommunities. Forty percent of public housing residents are single women \nwith children.\n  Even without the recommended rescissions, current funding levels for \nHUD's public and assisted housing programs serve only about a third of \nthe persons eligible for benefits. In Connecticut, there continues to \nbe a shortage of affordable housing. There are 15,000 homeless people \nin my State, including more than 3,000 children.\n  The Daschle amendment would restore $500 million to the public \nhousing modernization account. These funds are critical for families \nliving in public housing. Without them, we will have more roofs with \nholes, rusting stairwells, and boarded-up windows. Unless we restore \nthese funds, thousands of families will be forced to raise their \nchildren in substandard housing.\n  The Daschle amendment is essential to help us maintain decent living \nconditions at many public housing developments across the country.\n\n\n                            National service\n\n  The rescission bill cuts national service by $210 million. The \nAmeriCorps Program has provided thousands of Americans with the \nopportunity to serve in their communities and earn a post-service \nbenefit for further education and training. Currently, 20,000 young \nAmericans have answered this call to service and are working in \ncommunities across the country to meet vital needs. The AmeriCorps \nProgram represents all that is best about America. the Daschle \namendment recognizes this fact and restores funding for this program.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  After consulting with high-paid political pollsters, some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have begun cloaking their \npolitical goals in the guise of helping kids.\n  They have learned to talk about deficit reduction in terms of its \nimpact on our children's future prosperity. And they have learned to \ntalk about tax cuts in terms of their impact on families with young \nchildren.\n  They've become better at framing issues to score quick political \npoints and worse at thoughtfully examining the impact of their \npolicies.\n  Clearly it is important that we reduce our deficit and our debt. But \na child who is denied food on the table, adequate child care, or a \ndecent education is not worried about what may happen to them 20 or 30 \nyears down the road. They are worried about their health and safety in \nthe present. And we should be too.\n  The cuts in this bill compromise the immediate nutrition, housing, \nand developmental needs of thousands of our children. The Daschle \namendment lessens the severity of these cuts.\n  The Children Defense Fund's report should powerfully focus our \nresolve to strengthen our investment in children's needs, not to lessen \nthem.\n  I urge my colleagues not to undermine our commitment to our kids. I \nurge my colleagues to support the Daschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back the time.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield back the remainder of the time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back the remainder of the \ntime.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

AND BARNUM & BAILEY CIRCUS ANNIVERSARY COMMEMORATION\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Rules \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of House Concurrent \nResolution 34 relative to the Ringling Bros. Circus and the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration under the following time \nagreement: 1 hour under the control of Senator Smith to offer an \namendment regarding elephants. I further ask that following the \nconclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on \nthe Smith amendment, to be followed immediately by a vote on adoption \nof House Concurrent Resolution 34.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 34) authorizing the \n     use of the Capitol grounds for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum \n     & Bailey Circus Anniversary Commemoration.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that the \nresolution that we have before us is a resolution to allow the Ringling \nBros. Circus to come on the Capitol Grounds at some point this next \nweek. I believe it is Wednesday. I could be wrong on the date.\n  As a youngster, I enjoyed the circus many times, as most of us have. \nI have no objection to many of the acts that you see in the circus. My \nobjection here to this resolution is the issue of using elephants in a \nway that they are used in the circuses throughout the United States, in \nthis case Ringling Bros., because they are planning to bring, I cannot \nget the exact number, a certain number of adult elephants onto the \nCapitol Grounds.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 449\n\n  (Purpose: To prevent the use of elephants in the Ringling Bros. and \n                  Barnum & Bailey Circus celebration)\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am going to offer an amendment, and that \namendment should be at the desk. I will offer that amendment at this \ntime, an amendment to the underlying resolution. It is a very simple \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 449.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, strike lines 9 through 13, and insert the \n     following: ``performers, on the Capitol Grounds, on April 3, \n     1995, or on such other date as the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and President pro tempore of the Senate may \n     jointly designate.\n     [[Page S5067]] SEC. 2. CONDITIONS.\n\n       No elephants shall be allowed on the Capitol Grounds for \n     the purpose of this event.''.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, the amendment is a very simple amendment. \nIt simply says the circus can proceed on the Capitol Grounds without \nthe use of elephants.\n  Now, this is the type of amendment that tends to bring some ridicule \nof me by others who have in some way expressed their concern about \nthis. I am going to go through this because I think it needs to be \nsaid. I am going to be very methodical about it.\n  It concerns two areas. One area is how the elephant in a circus is \ntreated; not how you see the elephant out there doing its performance, \nbut how it is treated in order to do that performance, and how it is \nkept, how it is transported. And, second, I am going to outline a \nnumber of incidents that have taken place in the past few years \ninvolving these huge, several-thousand-pound animals that are used in \nthe circus.\n  I am not going to in any way try to misrepresent facts. I realize--\nand I want to say it up front--that in some areas the Ringling Bros. \npeople do some very fine things with animals. I know for a fact that \none of the trainers at Ringling Bros. who trains dogs saves some of \nthose dogs from death at the pound and trains those animals to be used \nin the act. I do not object to any of that.\n  This involves elephants.\n  I hope that the cameras can pick this up, but this, in only a very \nsmall way, conveys the horror of what I am talking about, because I \ncannot explain it or show it with pictures. I have films. I have tried \nfor about 2 weeks now to interest any of my colleagues, any one of my \ncolleagues--any one--in this issue, to no avail.\n  So that all my colleagues will know, lest they be worried about it, I \nhave decided not to call for a rollcall vote on this issue, because I \nknow what the vote will be. It will be a voice vote.\n  But I want my colleagues to know that what they are doing by allowing \nthese animals on the Capitol Grounds is a grave risk, a grave risk not \nonly to the animals but also to the children who have been invited to \nbe here.\n  This elephant in this picture here was shot over 100 times when it \nwent berserk in Honolulu. It killed a trainer and injured some people.\n  These animals--you might say, what is it about them that would cause \nthem to do this? Well, for those who care, I would think that they must \nnot have reacted too well to some of the training and some of the \nthings that they are required to do in these acts.\n  Now, does this mean that deliberately people try to inflict harm upon \nthese animals? In some cases, that may be true. Are they fed well? Of \ncourse, they are fed well. But that is not the issue here. The issue \nis, should an animal this big go through the procedures that we put \nthem through, and is it safe to have them around little children on the \nCapitol Grounds?\n  Now, I want to again repeat, I do not object to Ringling Bros. being \nhere. I know they do a lot of things in the breeding of elephants and \nhelp to somehow enhance some species that may even be on the endangered \nspecies list.\n  That is not what I object to. I object to them being transported and \nused in the way they are used.\n  I have a film of this animal from beginning to end. I have asked some \nof my colleagues to look at it. Nobody has taken me up on it. Maybe if \nthey took me up on it, somebody might come down on the floor and ask \nfor a recorded vote. It would be nice to have a little company.\n  But let me start by relaying some incidents. Because, bear in mind, \nnow, sometime this week, or whenever we do it--I would like to be wrong \non the number and I stand corrected if I am--but somewhere around 15 \nelephants are going to be brought onto the Capitol Grounds. Maybe it is \nless. I do not know how many it will be. I have not been told. I cannot \nfind out. So many elephants are going to be brought on the Capitol \nGrounds here.\n  How do you restrain an elephant?\n  So they are going to be brought on to the Capitol Grounds. As we hear \nabout these elephants being brought on the Capitol Grounds here, \nremember this is my objection.\n  Let us talk about some of the things that happened to elephants in \ncircuses in the last few years. Let us just take a few minutes and go \nthrough them.\n  I have talked to Mr. Ireland, who is a representative of the Ringling \nBros. Circus. We had a very nice conversation. He is a good friend of \nmine; a former Congressman. He represents Ringling Bros. He came in and \nspoke to me. He made a very strong case, a good appeal to me.\n  I ask him if he would simply remove the elephants from the act on the \nCapitol Grounds. This circus is going to be performing downtown in the \narmory for 20 days. All I ask is that the elephants be removed from the \nacts on the Capitol Grounds, because I thought first, it was a danger; \nand second, I objected to some of the ways and methods that were used \nto train these animals, to no avail. There was no agreement. They would \nnot agree to do that.\n  I cannot understand why it is so important to have these huge animals \nroaming around the Capitol Grounds. If people want to see them, they \ncan go down the street at the armory, go to the circus and see them \nthere. But they said that was out of the question. They would not \nagree. So here I am.\n  It is an issue of public safety, Mr. President. It really is an issue \nof public safety.\n  Now, it would be very easy for the skeptics, because, after it is all \nover, if nothing happened--and I pray to God nothing does; but if it \ndoes, then do not say I did not tell you so-- and if it does not--and I \nhope it does not--they will all say, ``Well, there was Smith out there \nwailing away on nothing. It is irrelevant. He took the Senate's time. \nNobody cares about this.''\n  Well, at least 15 people have been killed by animals in the last 5 \nyears in circuses--15 people. And I am going to go through these right \nnow.\n  This one here, 2 weeks ago, a circus elephant trampled two men to \ndeath in Bangkok. OK, that was not in America. OK; fine. I am preparing \nmyself for the comments that will be coming. So let us move on.\n  Ringling Bros.--that is who we are talking about here; that is who is \ncoming to town, Ringling Bros.--Ringling Bros. Circus' most experienced \ntrainer, Alex Gautier, was trampled to death in 1993.\n  Lest somebody would doubt me, I have the obituary on that somewhere. \nLet me see if I can find it. I have it right here.\n  This is an obituary from the New York Times. He was Ringling Bros.' \nelephant trainer. He was trampled to death 2 years ago by an elephant. \nHe had been with Ringling for 35 years. So it was not exactly some \ninexperienced kid that came out and said, ``I'm going to train an \nelephant.'' He represents 35 years of training.\n  Even if Ringling's most experienced trainers are at risk, how about \nthe kids on the Capitol Grounds? Does anybody care about them? Hundreds \nof schoolchildren are going to be here.\n  I heard Speaker Gingrich say how wonderful it was going to be; we are \ngoing to have animals on the grounds; it was going to be a wonderful \nthing for the children.\n  A 51-year-old elephant trainer, leading trainer of elephants, \nperformer all these years, died 2 years ago at a hospital at the \nUniversity of Florida, Gainesville. One of the elephants he was working \nwith at the Ringling Bros. elephant farm in Williston, FL, knocked him \ndown and stepped on him. He was taken by helicopter to the hospital. He \nwas a feature performer at one of the show's traveling circuses where \nhe had been appearing in Asheville, NC. He was making a brief visit to \nthe farm to check on the conservation and breeding program in the herd \nof 20 elephants.\n  So that is the first instance.\n  In 1994, Alan Campbell was crushed to death and a dozen spectators--a \ndozen spectators--were injured when an elephant with Circus \nInternational went on a rampage through downtown Honolulu. This is that \npicture. That elephant killed the trainer, came out of the little \ncircle, the arena, came out of the tent, through a fence, out into the \nroad. There was absolutely no protection for the people against this \nhuge animal.\n  They had to shoot this animal with anything they could find--\nrevolvers, whatever they could gear up; there was absolutely no \nprotection--100 times before the animal fell down against a car, and \neven then they could not kill it \n[[Page S5068]] with a gun. Somebody got there with some type of drug \nand was able to immobilize the elephant for when they finally killed \nit. So 100 times. It was the second incident at the circus in 1 week.\n  Was that Ringling? No. I am not maintaining that it is. It was a \ncircus and that happened. Elephants are elephants. I do not think \nelephants know the difference between a Ringling Bros. Circus and any \nother circus. If they are asked to stand up on one leg on a barrel, I \ndo not think they understand if it is Ringling asking them to do it or \nanybody else.\n  If anybody can tell me how they know that, I would be happy to hear \nit.\n  Backstage at ``Live with Regis and Kathie Lee,'' Yelena Aleynikova \nhad her skull fractured, ribs broken and a lung punctured by a Moscow \nCircus elephant in 1994. She is suing the circus, the show, and ABC as \na result of that incident.\n  I hope our insurance is paid up on the Capitol Grounds, by the way.\n  Schoolchildren looked on as an elephant crushed a man to death at the \nSan Salvador National Zoo in 1993. He was the second person that this \nvery elephant had killed.\n  Char-Lee Torre was kicked to death by an elephant at the Lowry Park \nZoo in Florida in 1993.\n  Christopher Ponte was crushed to death in 1993 by an elephant at the \nClyde Beatty-Cole Bros. Circus in New York.\n  And in 1992, Jubal Cox was grabbed and slammed to death by an \nelephant in Texas while visiting the San Antonio Zoo.\n  There is more.\n  Eight children and their parents were pinned under a fence by an \nelephant at the Circus International in 1994--children.\n  Twelve spectators were injured and a police officer was thrown to the \nground when an elephant went on a rampage in Florida at the Great \nAmerican Circus in 1992. The elephant was shot and killed by police.\n  Again, members of the audience were trampled after an elephant at \nCircus Benneweis attacked her trainer and went running through the \ntown's busy harbor area in 1994. The elephant later returned and was \nkilled.\n  In 1994 in Utah, Jordan Circus animal trainer Rex Williams suffered \nbroken ribs, a broken arm and organ damage after being thrown and \ntrampled by an elephant on whom children--children--were riding.\n  Here is a Ringling animal trainer, George Lewis:\n\n       An elephant, when brought into captivity, must make a \n     tremendous adjustment to live with man . . . They come to \n     hate their human masters, who are responsible for keeping \n     them confined . . .\n\n  That is a Ringling trainer.\n  I do not have them all up here on the chart, but let me give you a \ncouple more.\n  On August 15, 1994, 10 people were injured when an elephant pinned \nthem under a fence separating the ring from the audience in Honolulu, \nHI.\n  Lion Country Safari: On February 1, 1992, 12 people were injured, \nincluding one police officer, when an Indian elephant broke loose \nduring a performance at Brevard Community College in Palm Bay, FL.\n  On June 8, 1990, a man was injured when an elephant attacked her \ntrainer and ran into a crowd in Reading, PA. The trainer had repeatedly \nstuck the elephant in the mouth with a hook to gain her attention just \nprior to the attack. The trainer got her attention, I might add.\n  In July 1987, two children were injured in Milwaukee, WI, by an \nelephant when she escaped from trainers with children on her back. The \ncircus recovered the animal and she resumed giving children rides 2 \ndays later. I wonder if the parents of the children who were brought to \nride the elephant after the incident were told the animal had done that \ndays before.\n  Hanneford Family Circus: On June 21, 1990, David Dickerson, an \nelephant trainer, was killed when the elephant he was training crushed \nhim after being startled by a passing car in Fort Lauderdale, FL.\n  Commeford & Sons: On August 31, 1991, Brian Corring was severely \ninjured by an elephant carrying children on her back during the \nChamplain Valley Fair in Essex Junction, VT. While the children on the \nelephant were unharmed, the parents felt the officials ignored the \nseverity of the situation. This was the second time that the elephant \nhad injured someone.\n  Just a couple more.\n  The Gatini Circus: Elephant trainer Eloise Berchtold was killed by an \nelephant during a performance at Rock Forest, Quebec. The elephant \nstepped on Berchtold and would not let anyone near her to provide \nmedical assistance.\n  Tarzan Zerbini International Circus: July 15, 1992, nine people were \ninjured when elephants toppled a barricade during a performance at a \nshopping center in Lafayette, IN.\n  I have been trying for the past several days to get somebody around \nthis place to care about this, and I cannot do it. I cannot find \nanybody that cares. There is not exactly a crowd on the Senate floor \nright now.\n  I asked the Sergeant at Arms how much does it cost for the extra \nsecurity, extra police--just the extra police, not what it costs us \nevery day. The extra police, just for a couple of hours while the \ncircus is here for overtime--overtime for officers--$52,000.\n  I then said to the Sergeant at Arms, ``I want to know what protection \ndo we have for the children and the spectators on the Capitol Grounds \nif this elephant, or any elephant of the elephants you have on the \ngrounds, goes berserk, what do we do?''\n  He said to my staff person, ``I will not tell you that. I will not \ntell you what the protection is.'' The implication is that it would be \na security matter, and I respect that. But I am a U.S. Senator. The \nlast time I looked, the Sergeant at Arms worked for us. Maybe somebody \nelse has a different perspective on that. I thought the Sergeant at \nArms worked for the Senate.\n  I am a Senator, and I asked him, ``What do we have available to us if \nan elephant goes berserk on the Capitol Grounds?'' He refused to tell \nme. He refused to tell me. He did not say, ``I'll put it off,'' ``I'll \ntell you tomorrow,'' ``I'll look it up,'' or ``It is the following.'' \nHe said, ``I won't tell you,'' period. ``I don't have to tell you, and \nI won't.'' And he did not, and I do not know why. I assume 99 of my \nother colleagues do not care. They are just going to have the elephants \nhere.\n  I was told by the office of the Senate Sergeant at Arms that the \nsecurity requirements for this circus for 2 hours would be the \nequivalent of the State of the Union Address. So, apparently, they must \nthink it is pretty serious.\n  We were also told that the cost was mainly associated with the \nexpected demonstrations against the involvement of the elephants in the \ncircus. Of course, the elephants themselves pose a serious security \nthreat and, thus, an enormous cost to the taxpayers in excess security \npersonnel, but I cannot find out what the security is.\n  It is my understanding that all shifts of the Capitol Police--all--\nwill be on duty during this event when they bring the circus to town. \nThe Senate Sergeant at Arms told me it would require paying overtime \nfor a number of officers--again, $52,000.\n  Let us go into it a little bit more because sometimes when you talk \nabout money around here, it is the only time you get anybody's \nattention.\n  If a person does not care about the elephants, and they do not care \nabout the kids out there, maybe we can get your attention with money. \nOf course, that is not including the regular Capitol Police officers \nwho will be on hand, that is $200,000, in addition to the $52,000. If \nthere are any arrests, any at all, anybody gets arrested out there--\nprotesting, demonstrating, making love, whatever they are doing out \nthere on the grounds--each arrest will cost additional overtime hours \non top of the $52,000. This does not include the additional security \ncosts for the Washington, DC Police Department. It also does not \ninclude the setup costs of the circus. The Architect of the Capitol \nestimates that could be about $7,000. Remember now, the circus is right \ndowntown for 20 days.\n  Mr. President, for the past several days we have been debating \ndecisions of previously appropriated funds. It is not an easy task, \nbecause many of the projects are worthy. These programs will be paid \nfor. These programs we have been debating on the floor of the Senate \nwill be paid for by our children and their children.\n  Ringling Bros. said the elephants must be in the circus, cannot have \na circus without elephants. I asked if \n[[Page S5069]] they would bring the circus here so I could come and \nenjoy it as well, without the elephants. Clowns, acrobats, dancing \ndogs. No, no, no, they want to see that, but the kids want to see the \nelephants.\n  Well, I hope the kids enjoy it because they are paying for it. Right \nnow the national debt says each child in America today is $18,500 in \ndebt, so we will add to your debt. So I hope you enjoy the elephants. \nWe will pay for it years from now. They will pay when they join the \nwork force. By then, the national debt will be--I do not know what it \nwill be by that time. It will be $6 trillion by the next 3 or 4 years.\n  So, I suppose I could say if I was cynical, if we want to cut the \ncost of Government, we could vote for this amendment. If we pass the \namendment, there will be no protesters, there will be no threat of \nelephants running amok on the Capitol Grounds. And we can pass it by \nunanimous consent. We save the taxpayers $52,000.\n  There are all sorts of events on the Mall here in Washington. Cirque \ndu Soleil has done performances on the Mall. No elephants, no protests, \nno threat to security, no cost to taxpayers. The kids loved it. They do \nnot need elephants to have a good time. Neither does Ringling.\n  Ringling Bros. circus is performing at the armory. If the kids really \nwant elephants, they can go and see them at the armory or they can see \nthem at the National Zoo. They can see them for free at the National \nZoo. There are several there, as a matter of fact, for the benefit of \nanybody who might be listening who cares, including a baby elephant.\n  They are not asked to stand on their heads or climb up on a barrel \nabout the size of 1 foot, parade around with a hook in their mouths. \nThey are just there, well-taken care of at the zoo.\n  So, let me again comment on the Sergeant at Arms, because this is \nvery critical. I think there is an arrogance here, No. 1. We have a \nright to know. A U.S. Senator asked the Sergeant of Arms about \ninformation about an event here on the Capitol Grounds. We have a right \nto know what it is. I will find out. With or without a vote on this \namendment, I will find out what they are going to do and what the plan \nis.\n  I asked, and the only reason I have not found out, I was not here, \nand I had to have a staff person do it on my behalf. I will find out or \nthere will be hell to pay as to why I do not find out.\n  Given all the instances I have mentioned that is not an unreasonable \nconcern. What do they have on the grounds. How do we stop an elephant, \nMr. President, if it goes berserk? What do we do? Do you use an AK-47? \nAn M-16? An AR-15? They are illegal in Washington. A person cannot even \ncarry them. All illegal. All banned. This is gun control in the city of \nWashington. Highest crime rate in the world, we have gun control. All \nillegal.\n  Frankly, would that stop an elephant? I doubt it. I really doubt it. \nDo they have a bazooka? What is their plan of action? What is the plan \nif something happens? It took 100 rounds in this poor animal here that \nwent wild in Honolulu and that still didn't kill it. It needed to be \nkilled by lethal injection.\n  People ought to see the film. My colleagues ought to look at the film \nof that. That is really something to watch. Look at the policemen, and \nthen see if you can vote against this. I do not know where we will get \n100 rounds. Last year's crime bill banned the manufacture, sale, or \npossession of all clips over 10 rounds, so I assume we will have 100 \nofficers standing out there with pistols, with 10 rounds in a clip. I \ndo not know. I cannot find out.\n  Now, do we want to be firing AK-47 rounds around little children if \nsomething happens? I do not know. These are the issues that ought to be \nof concern.\n  Overreacting, they will say. Yes, always overreacting until something \nhappens. Is that not the way it is?\n  Even those who do not have strong feelings about the treatment of \nanimals ought to be concerned about the issue of public safety, as well \nas the cost.\n  I want to stress a few points in closing here. Ringling Bros. \nmaintains their training practices are not cruel and they are not \nabusive. I think they mean that. They may think that.\n  But let me say when the elephants go berserk the first person they go \nafter is the trainer. That ought to say something. When I met with Mr. \nIreland he said that while Ringling Bros. does, in fact, use whips, \nwhips are used because of the cracking sound, which is an audible cue \nto the elephants.\n  I am not an elephant trainer. I do not know what the function of a \nwhip is or how it works. I suppose if someone was whipping a cracking \nwhip behind me I would probably do whatever they said, too.\n  I have concerns about a number of other practices that are regularly \nemployed in the training of elephants. I am not going to get into \nwhether Ringling employs these are not. I do not know. We may never \nknow, because no outside organizations are allowed to monitor or film \ntheir trainers.\n  I was offered the opportunity to go down to a Ringling training area \nwhere they train elephants by Ringling. They said, ``You can come in \nand watch us train.'' I found that somewhat humorous. If they had any \nmethods I would object to, I do not think they would use them while I \nwas there. Maybe they would, but I doubt it.\n  So, let me mention a few articles that I have here.\n  Before I do, let me call my colleagues' attention to a section of the \nNational Geographic. This piece from the National Geographic shows the \nmethods that are used. Obviously, I cannot show it here. We do not have \nthe facilities to do that. Might be a good thing to do some time.\n  These tapes, I have them. I will be more than happy to provide them \nfor my colleagues to look at, anytime they want to look at them. The \nhooks that are used, the methods of training the animals down, the \ncramped quarters to house the animals, and the methods used in breaking \nwild elephants.\n  Let me just say for the record on wild elephants, Ringling has \nassured me they do not use wild elephants, that they breed their own \nand take young elephants, and I have no reason to deny that.\n  In the past, and, in fact, in some other circuses, baby elephants are \ncaptured in the wild, taken from their mother, and beaten for days at a \ntime while they are screaming. It is on the tape. Members ought to \nwatch it. Beaten, for days and days, in shifts, by these people in the \njungles of Thailand and Laos. Wherever the elephants are captured, \nbeaten consistently until their spirit is broken, and until they have \nnothing left to offer resistance to. Screaming and crying. Ought to \nwatch the tape.\n  Does Ringling do that? No, I want to make it clear. But young \nelephants are captured and are used in circuses in that way.\n  Now, the issue, we could go on and on and on. Elephant incident after \nincident after incident, where elephants have been on the rampage and \ndone some of these things.\n  The issue, really, is this. Should an animal this big, this wild, be \nused for entertainment? I do not think so. I do not see the need for \nit. There is no need for it. We do not see what happens when the circus \nis not around. When we are not watching the circus.\n  We are seeing the animal out there with his trunk around another \nelephant's tail and gets up and does a trick. That looks cute and I \nhave seen it.\n  Frankly, before I knew more about this I thought it was great. How do \nthey transport an elephant from Florida to California? You cannot put \nthem on an airplane, so they put them in some kind of a truck. Ever \nlook at the width of a highway? There is only so much size of a truck \nthat can be used.\n  So they are in cramped quarters. Now, when you have them on location \nfor a circus--let us say down here at the Armory--how do you restrain \nthese animals? How do you restrain an animal that weighs several tons? \nLet me tell you how you restrain them. You chain them. You chain them \nup.\n  You can say we feed them hay, we feed them grain, we take good care \nof them--these are wild animals. So that is why things like this \nhappen. That is why elephants go berserk, because they are not meant to \ndo these kinds of things and it is cruel. It is cruel.\n  We have an opportunity here today in the Senate to make a very small \nstatement. We are not going to stop this by doing this. We are not \ngoing to \n[[Page S5070]] stop it. But we could say, as U.S. Senators and U.S. \nCongressmen, that we do not want to risk having an incident like this \nhappen on the Capitol Grounds, No. 1; and, No. 2, we think that, even \nthough it is not intended to be cruel, the result is that it is cruel \nin the way that we treat these animals. They ought to be left alone in \nzoos, in parks, wherever we can; and not use--or abuse--them in the \nways that is being done in these circuses.\n  The little kids ought to be able to go down and see these elephants \nchained and restricted, or watch the training, which we are not allowed \nto watch.\n  I think it is sad because all we have to do is just make a statement: \nNo, we are not going to let the elephants come here on the Capitol \nGrounds because we do not think it is right. The elephants are still \ngoing to be performing down at the Armory. We are not going to be able \nto stop that. But we make a statement and maybe, by making that \nstatement, we show the world and show the country that we care a little \nbit.\n  I know the types of criticism and the ridicule that I get. People say \nyou are an animal rights nut. I am not. I am not. But they do not have \nanybody. There is nobody who can come out here on the floor. An \nelephant cannot come out here on the floor. No animal can come out \nhere. It does not have any Congressmen or Senators to represent it. So \nif somebody does not speak up, who do they have?\n  So it is a very small thing to do, really. It is not a big deal. We \njust say Ringling, come on up; bring the clowns, bring the dog acts, \nbring the rings, bring the trapeze artists, and entertain the kids. But \nleave the elephants in the zoos and in the parks. Leave them alone.\n  Circuses started back in the days when we did not understand this, or \nwhen we did not care. Those days are past. Let us move on. Let us get \ninto the 21st century here.\n  Elephants are a vanishing species, anyway. I doubt very much 100 \nyears from now, when somebody stands here at Daniel Webster's desk \nwhere I stand now, I seriously doubt that person is going to know what \na live elephant looks like. Unfortunately, I have to say that.\n  In some cases, some of these groups like Ringling do a good deed by \nbreeding these animals. But you do not have to use them in circus acts, \nwhich are unnatural for these animals. That is why these incidents \nhappen.\n  We have another quote here:\n\n       Physical abuse and dominance control remain a major method \n     of training elephants.\n\n  That is by John Lehnhardt, the assistant curator at the National Zoo \nright here in Washington. These guys know what they are talking about. \nDo not take my word for it. These are people who work with these \nanimals every day. They know what they are talking about. It is \nunnatural to make huge beasts the size of an elephant do the things we \nask them to do. They are telling us that. They are warning us.\n  Henry Ringling North, the Ringling Circus founder, said:\n\n       When it came to teaching [the animals] the more involved \n     tricks, [Ringling animal trainer Alfred Court] had to use a \n     whip. If an animal got out of line, he flicked that animal in \n     the most sensitive place you could hit either a male or a \n     female. He hit, but only because the animal had made a \n     mistake.\n\n  Really? That is what the kids are going to patronize when they come \non the Capitol Grounds.\n  Let me just repeat, Mr. President, when I started this process I said \nif I get some support, if I get some people who will come forth and \nparticipate in this debate with me and share my concern, I would \nprobably call for a rollcall vote. But it did not come. I know where \nthe votes are and are not. There is no point in taking the Senate's \ntime anymore on this. I will not call for a rollcall vote.\n  I will call for a vote, however, at whatever time the Senate wishes \nto have it, either now or tomorrow. Unless someone else asks for a \nrecorded vote, I will call for a voice vote on this matter and, if the \nwishes of the Senate are that it be now, in just a moment, I will do \nthat by yielding the floor.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, before I yield back the remainder of my \ntime, of all the materials that back this up. This is not the only \nincident. There are many incidents like this. I will say again, in \nsummary, I hope nothing happens. But I also say we are not prepared for \nit if it does. We are not prepared to handle a rampaging elephant with \na bunch of little schoolchildren out on the Capitol Grounds. If we are \nprepared for it--and the Sergeant at Arms refuses to tell me whether we \nare or not--if we are, it would have to be with some humongous weapon, \nwhich would have to impose a danger on the children who would be here, \nbecause we do not know what direction this elephant would run, or any \nelephant would run, or elephants, if they were to do that, if they \nwould be so inclined to do it.\n  I have made my case. I think I have told the world, the Senate, and \nhopefully many families and children out there who may want to be \ncoming to the circus--I hope, frankly, you do not. I hope you send a \nstatement that this is wrong and we ought not to do it and we ought to \nbe somewhat considerate, in a very small way, by saying this is wrong.\n  Mr. President, at this time, regretfully, I yield the floor without \nrequesting a recorded vote. At this time, I yield the remainder of--I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New Hampshire. I do not doubt in any way \nthe sincerity of the Senator from New Hampshire in his beliefs and \nstrong feelings on this subject. I will only make two very brief \npoints.\n  First, we already have on the books rules and regulations that govern \nthe handling of wild animals and, indeed, all animals that appear in \ncircuses: How they are treated, how they are transported, how they are \nfed, how they are cared for, how they are treated when they are sick. \nThose rules and regulations are already on the books. If indeed those \nrules are deficient, the appropriate committees in the Congress of the \nUnited States should review those rules and then make recommendations \nto the full body. None of that has been done in this case.\n  Second, I trust the Sergeant at Arms, whom I know the Senator from \nNew Hampshire knows very well. I am certain he has reviewed the risks \nand lack of risks associated with the appearance of a portion of \nRingling Bros. Circus on the Capitol Grounds. He, indeed, has the \nresponsibility of determining whether events can take place on the \nCapitol Grounds that do not impair the safety of the Members of this \nbody, as well as the employees who work here, as well as, in fact, the \nphysical grounds that constitute the Capitol of the United States. I \ntrust, I am certain he has made a decision that these events can take \nplace without putting any person at risk, any Members at risk or, \nindeed, any of the physical structures of the Capitol at risk.\n  Therefore, Mr. President and colleagues, I think the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New Hampshire, in good faith and with all \nsincerity--I admire the work he has put into this--I suggest is \ninappropriate at this time and ask for its defeat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded, the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The amendment (No. 449) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the adoption of the House \nConcurrent Resolution 34.\n  The resolution (H. Con. Res. 34) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5066-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5070-S5072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       RESCINDING $230 MILLIONS IN MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, last month the Senate debated the \nDefense supplemental appropriations bill. Although I supported this \nlegislation, I expressed my dismay that the Appropriations Committee \nchose to fully offset the $1.9 billion supplemental from the fiscal \nyear 1995 Defense budget. In a practical sense, that action cut the \n [[Page S5071]] Defense budget by almost $2.0 billion at a time when \nthe readiness levels of our Armed Forces are teetering on the edge.\n  Since 1985, the Defense budget has decreased by 40 percent in buying \npower. The 1995 Defense budget, which is being used to fund the \nAdministration's ill-conceived foreign ventures, has already been \nreduced by $40 billion below the 1990 budget even without the reduction \nin purchasing power from inflation. Today, with this supplemental, we \nadd insult to injury by further cutting the 1995 Defense budget to fund \ndomestic programs.\n  The committee's amendment to H.R. 1158 further reduces the already \nconstrained Defense budget by over $200 million, including the $104 \nmillion in critical base closure funds, $27 million for projects to \nmeet environmental responsibilities at our overseas base, and $69 \nmillion for NATO infrastructure funding.\n  I must point out the irony here, in the committee's attempt to reduce \nfunding, it may actually be increasing the cost to the Department by \nrescinding the NATO funds. I am advised that these funds have all been \nobligated and this rescission may require breaking contracts and \ntherefore incurring additional costs.\n  Possibly the most damaging effect this supplemental will have is on \nbase closure. The recommendation to further cut the base closure \naccount at a time when the Base Closure Commission is reviewing \nrecommendations to add more bases to the closure list is, in my \njudgement, misguided.\n  It does not make sense to reduce funds critical for the closing and \ncleaning up of bases--funds that are used to pay civilian severance, \nenvironmental restoration, and the civilian and military relocation \ncosts associated with closing a base. These cuts, proposed by the \nAppropriations Committee, will not only delay the closure process, they \nwill negatively impact communities that are desperately looking for \nalternative uses for these bases to speed up their economic recovery. \nJust last year, Congress rescinded $507 million in this same account \nand caused havoc to the closure process and our communities which are \nstill trying to recover from the cuts.\n  I have an amendment prepared to offer which will restore the funding \nfor the base closure account. However, in order not to delay this \nprocess any longer, and after conferring with the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Military Construction who assured me he would consider \nrestoring the funds during the joint conference on the bill, I will not \noffer the amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me close by stating that reducing the Defense \nbudget every time there is an unexpected defense or domestic need \nrequiring a supplemental is not a sustainable policy over the long \nterm, nor is such a policy in the interest of our national security. \nThe men and women of our Armed Forces expect better from the Senate. \nThese dedicated individuals, who risk their lives daily and endure long \nseparations from their families, have earned our support. I am \ncommitted to providing that support and hope my colleagues in the \nSenate and on the Appropriations Committee will join me in stopping \nthis erosion to the Defense budget.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter addressed to me \ndated March 10, 1995, from John Deutch, Deputy Secretary of Defense, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              The Deputy Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 30, 1995.\n     Senator Strom Thurmond,\n     U.S. Senate, Chairman, Committee on Armed Services.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to request your assistance \n     in resisting the proposed rescission of $230 million in the \n     fiscal year 1995 Military Construction appropriation.\n       The Senate proposed rescission of $104 million for the Base \n     Closure and Realignment Account (BRAC) impacts the Department \n     of Defense's ability to implement the base closures as \n     mandated by law. The Department makes every effort to \n     minimize the impact on communities. The ability to close as \n     expeditiously as possible not only saves the federal \n     government money that we have counted on, but also provides \n     the communities with early opportunities for economic \n     development and job creation. Our experience with the fiscal \n     year 1994 rescission was that it severely impacted both \n     Service and community closure efforts.\n       The proposed $69 million rescission of NATO funds is of \n     significant concern. These funds are currently obligated and \n     any rescission would incur additional costs for contract \n     terminations of ongoing construction projects. It also sends \n     a very negative signal concerning our support for the NATO \n     Alliance.\n       The proposed overseas reductions of $27 million primarily \n     affect our ability to meet our environmental \n     responsibilities. The worldwide unspecified reduction of $30 \n     million places a burden on the Services to find alternative \n     sources of funds for needed projects. We already face a $137 \n     million unallocated reduction in the fiscal year 1995 \n     appropriation.\n       On behalf of the Department of Defense, I request that the \n     Senate reconsider the proposed $230 million rescission.\n                                                      John Deutch.\n              restoring rescission of base closure funding\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support the efforts of my colleague from \nSouth Carolina, Senator Thurmond, to restore funding $104 million in \nfunding for base closure accounts, which the Appropriations Committee \nrecommended for rescission. It is vitally important that these funds \nremain available to pay for the necessary costs of closing, cleaning \nup, and transferring unnecessary military bases to the communities for \nreuse.\n  The Appropriations Committee indicates in the report accompanying the \nbill that these rescissions are being taken because large amounts of \nappropriated funds remain unobligated in these accounts. That may be \ntrue. But that in no way means that the funds are not necessary.\n  The accounts from which the committee recommended rescinding $104 \nmillion include the funding for environmental restoration at closing \nmilitary bases. These costs are not insignificant, and they represent a \nFederal liability which must be met.\n  On Monday, March 27, the Washington Post reported on yet another \nstudy that concluded that ``the cost of cleaning up military bases is \nskyrocketing * * *.'' My colleague from Alaska has often raised this \nproblem of the increasing cost of cleaning up closing military bases as \na reason to delay the BRAC process. Yet, now the committee is \nrecommending that we rescind funds already appropriated for \nenvironmental cleanup at closing military bases. I cannot understand \nthe logic of doing so.\n  These accounts from which the committee recommends we rescind money \nalso include funding to pay for military construction at bases where \nconsolidations and realignments will occur because of BRAC actions. The \ncost of providing this new infrastructure was factored into the BRAC's \ndecision-making process and is important to provide necessary support \nfor activities moved to other locations. It is not reasonable to assume \nthat adding functions to an existing base will not require some \nexpenditure of funds for buildings and support.\n  All of these funds are necessary to complete the base closure and \nrealignment process. There are specific projects and activities for \nwhich these funds were appropriated--jobs which need to be completed so \nthat the communities surrounding the closing bases can implement their \nreuse plans as quickly as possible.\n  I wonder whether the committee would consider, as a possible reason \nfor the large amount of unobligated balances in these accounts, that \nthe process for closing bases is, without exaggeration, ponderous.\n  In my home State of Arizona, Williams Air Force Base, which was \nordered closed in 1991, has been screened for Federal agency reuse at \nleast three times. Homeless applications are still pending at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. The Air Force Base Conversion \nAgency and the local communities have not yet agreed on the final \ndetails of reuse of the base. Here we are, nearly 4 years after the \nBRAC ordered the base closed, and the Air Force is still paying the \nbill for maintaining the base. And more importantly, the community is \nstill not able to recover fully from the economic impact of losing the \nbase.\n  The base closure process ought not take 4 years to complete. I intend \nto introduce legislation to streamline the Federal screening process \nand to give greater flexibility to recognized community groups to \ncoordinate, develop, \n [[Page S5072]] and implement reuse plans for closing bases.\n  Until the process is fixed, however, it is not surprising that large \namounts of the base closure funding remain unspent. Again, though, that \ndoes not mean that the funds are not needed. Eliminating these funds \nwould only exacerbate the difficulty of closing bases and conveying the \nproperty to the subsequent owners in a timely fashion.\n  This is a painful enough process for a community that relied on the \nmilitary base in its midst for jobs and economic stability. Let's not \naggravate the situation by imperiling the Services' ability to complete \nthe process as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I understand that Senator Thurmond has received \nassurances from the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nSubcommittee on Military Construction that the conferees on this bill \nwill consider restoring these funds in the conference. I applaud that \ncommitment.\n  I must state, however, that I support restoring these funds with one \ncondition. I believe that the restoration of these funds must not be \ndone at the cost of increasing the Federal deficit. I believe the $104 \nmillion in restored funding must be fully offset by rescissions of low \npriority funds.\n  Mr. President, I had intended to offer a second degree amendment to \nrescind $104 million from the administrative and travel accounts of the \nFederal Government.\n  The amendment would have provided a full offset for the cost of \nrestoring the BRAC-related funds in the amendment of Senator Thurmond. \nThe Senate bill already provides $13 billion in total spending \nrescissions, but this is $4 billion less than the House bill. We should \nnot further exacerbate the shortfall in deficit reduction funds, if we \ncan find an offsetting reduction.\n  I believe the reduction of $104 million in Government administrative \nand travel expenses would have been an appropriate\n reduction. The Office of Management advised me that, in fiscal year \n1995 alone, $107.2 billion will be spent for administration and travel. \nThe amendment would have rescinded only $104 million from a $107 \nbillion account--less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the total \nexpenditures. Out of a budget of $107 billion, it seems quite likely \nthat the small amount which would be rescinded by this amendment will \nnot be devastating to the operation of any government office. One-tenth \nof 1 percent of the administrative and travel budget of any Federal \norganization should not hamper the operations of that organization.\n\n  Mr. President, the Department of Defense and the communities \nsurrounding closing bases need the funding in the BRAC accounts to \nfinish a job already underway. We should not rescind those funds. I \nbelieve we should rescind a minuscule portion--less than one-tenth of 1 \npercent--of the Federal Government's administrative and travel budget \nto pay for these necessary BRAC-related activities.\n  Unfortunately, we were unable to come to agreement on the offsets I \nintended to propose. Therefore, Senator Thurmond has chosen to rely on \nthe assurances he has received from Senator Burns concerning restoring \nthese funds in the conference. I respectfully urge the conferees to \nidentify offsetting rescissions in other areas to pay for the \nrestoration of these funds.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that we not decrease the amount of \ndeficit reduction in this bill. We are undertaking the daunting task of \nprioritizing Federal spending and reducing the Federal debt, working \ntoward a balanced Federal budget. By eliminating unnecessary and \nwasteful spending of prior year appropriated funds, we can begin our \nreview of the fiscal year 1996 budget with money in the bank.\n  Therefore, the conferees on this bill should ensure that an \noffsetting reduction is made for the restoration of these BRAC-related \nfunds. The conference agreement should preserve at least the level of \ndeficit reduction contained in the Senate bill, and in my view, should \nmove toward the greater deficit reduction in the House bill. As \nimportant as this funding is for BRAC cleanup and implementation, I do \nnot believe it should be restored at the cost of increasing the \ndeficit.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat would allow the Department of Defense to provide transportation \nfor children with disabilities seeking medical treatment in the United \nStates. I am pleased that Senator Inouye has joined me in cosponsoring \nthis measure.\n  The Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children in Honolulu currently \nprovides free medical treatment for disabled children. However, many of \nthese children must wait several months before funds are available for \nthem to travel from their homes in the Pacific to Hawaii. As of \nFebruary 28, 1995, Shriners Hospital had 177 Pacific rim children with \ndisabilities seeking medical treatment.\n  The legislation I am introducing authorizes the Department of Defense \nto offer transportation, on a space available basis, to a disabled \nchild seeking free medical treatment. The children would come from \nUnited States territories, such as American Samoa and Guam, and from \ncountries with historic ties to the United States, including the \nFederated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Saipan, Palau, \nWestern Samoa, and the Philippines.\n  Providing transportation for disabled children from these Pacific rim \ncountries and territories will enhance the United States relationship \nwith these entities. The goodwill generated by this initiative will \ncontribute to our efforts to be ``good neighbors'' in the Pacific. The \ncost of this measure would be nominal since transportation would be on \na space-available basis.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LOTT:\n  S. 661. A bill to require the continued availability of $1 Federal \nreserve notes for circulation; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                         save the greenback act\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the following bill \ndesigned to preserve the status of the American $1 bill. The dollar \nbill--also known as the American greenback--has been a staple of our \ncurrency since 1862, and since 1869 has carried the likeness of the \nfounder of our Nation: George Washington.\n  During that entire period, we have never heard the American people \nexpress their disagreement, or their displeasure, with the $1 bill. In \nfact, as many of you are well aware, the mere mention of any redesign \nof our currency inevitably triggers an onslaught of calls from \nconstituents.\n  In past Congresses there have been misguided efforts by special \ninterests to replace the $1 bill with a coin. The proponents of this \ncoin make three bold claims: that it will be easier to handle, that it \nwill be popular with the American people, and that it will save money.\n  Let me address each of these claims in turn: Imagine if you will, \nreplacing ten $1 bills in your wallet with ten $1 coins in your pocket. \nAfter several days, one might suspect a conspiracy by clothing \nmanufacturers in drafting the dollar coin proposal. I do not know \nanyone who prefers a pocketful of coins to a wallet containing dollar \nbills.\n  As to the coin's so-called popularity with the American people; there \nhave been three national polls on this issue during the past year. In \nevery poll, the American people overwhelmingly rejected any attempt to \ndo away with the dollar bill and have expressed their displeasure for \nreplacing it with a coin.\n  The most recent poll was conducted in January, under the auspices of \nthe House Budget Committee. Only 18 percent of those questioned \npreferred a dollar coin. Earlier polls have indicated a very real \nconcern by American people that if the coin bill becomes law, the price \nof items purchased from vending machines such as food, laundry, and \nsoft drinks will rise. They also expect to see increases in the costs \nof other everyday items such as parking meters and pay telephone calls.\n  Mr. President, legislation designed to eliminate the dollar bill will \nbe an excuse by special interests to raise prices on everyday items. \nEliminating the dollar bill and replacing it with a dollar coin will \nlikely result in two things: Higher prices to consumers, and more \nweight in our pocket.\n  None of us really want to see a repeat of the Susan B. Anthony drama \nin \n [[Page S5074]] which the dollar coin was overwhelmingly rejected by \nthe public. It did not save us a nickel when it was minted, although \nofficials said at the time that savings would be realized. At this \nmoment, there are over $300 million in Susan B. Anthony coins sitting \nidle in the U.S. Mint. Will we have to make room in a few years time \nfor another dollar coin, because we didn't heed the lessons of the \npast?\n  It is not enough to blame the failure of the Susan B. Anthony dollar \non its design alone. The people overwhelmingly rejected it as part of \nthe currency system. The people had a choice and they voted against it. \nThe bill I am introducing today seeks to protect the consumer from the \nhidden cost increases which would result from a mandated replacement of \nthe dollar bill with a dollar coin.\n  As I travel around Mississippi, I hear people telling me that we need \nto reform welfare, slam the door on convicted criminals, and eliminate \nwaste. I do not hear a lot of complaints that we need a dollar coin to \nreplace the face of George Washington in our wallets.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Mr. Murkowski):\n  S. 662. A bill to implement the interim agreement for the \nconservation of Yukon River salmon stocks agreed to by the Government \nof the United States of America and the Government of Canada on \nFebruary 3, 1995, and for other purposes; to the committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                         yukon river salmon act\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation today that would implement the new interim agreement for \nthe conservation of Yukon River salmon stocks reached between the \nUnited States and Canada on February 3, 1995--the Yukon Agreement.\n  The title of my bill is the ``Yukon River Salmon Act of 1995.''\n  A total of 1,875 miles long, the Yukon River is the fourth largest \nriver in North America, and runs from head waters deep in Canada, \nthrough the heart of Alaska, and into the Bering Sea.\n  Commercial and subsistence fishermen from Canada to the Alaskan \nshores of the Bering Sea rely on the salmon resources of this massive \nriver.\n  The Yukon Agreement will assure both Alaskans and Canadians living \nalong the Yukon River that these vital salmon resources will be \ncarefully managed, restored, and enhanced in the years ahead.\n  I would like to commend the State Department, State of Alaska, and \nthe many Alaskans who were instrumental in bringing about this \nagreement.\n  It is great to see the positive results that can occur when we work \ntogether with our Canadian neighbors.\n  The bill I am introducing today would provide for U.S. representation \non a new Yukon River Panel created under the Yukon Agreement.\n  The Yukon River Panel will include representatives from both the \nUnited States and Canada, and will make management, restoration and \nenhancement suggestions to the entities responsible for conserving and \nmanaging Yukon River salmon on both sides of the United States-Canada \nborder.\n  Under the bill, the United States would have six Yukon River Panel \nmembers: one appointed by the Secretary of State; one representing the \nState of Alaska; and four representatives knowledgeable and experienced \nwith Yukon River salmon fisheries who would be appointed by the \nGovernor of Alaska.\n  At least one of the four panel members appointed by the Governor must \nrepresent the Upper Yukon; at least one must represent the Lower Yukon; \nand at least one must be an Alaska Native.\n  Panel members will serve 4-year terms, and will be eligible for \nreappointment.\n  The Secretary of State and Governor of Alaska would be authorized to \ndesignate an alternate panel member, meeting the same qualifications, \nfor each of the panel members they have authority to appoint under the \nbill.\n  The Yukon River Panel would be exempt from the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act, similar to the treatment of the Pacific Salmon \nCommission and Pacific Salmon Treaty panels under the Pacific Salmon \nTreaty enabling legislation--Public Law 99-5.\n  Panel members would be paid at the GS-16 rate while on duty, which is \nconsistent with the pay received by panels under the Pacific Salmon \nTreaty enabling legislation.\n  Decisions by the U.S. section of the Yukon River Panel would occur by \nthe consensus of five of the panel members: the State of Alaska's \nrepresentative, and the four at-large panel members. The Federal member \nwould not vote. This is similar to the voting structure of the Pacific \nSalmon Commission.\n  As with the Pacific Salmon Commission, the Federal representative \nwould serve as a neutral and objective party if disagreements arise \namong members of the U.S. section of the panel.\n  The bill also authorizes an advisory committee, with members to be \nappointed by the Governor of Alaska.\n  This advisory committee would include between 8 and 12 members \nknowledgeable and experienced with regard to salmon fisheries on the \nYukon River.\n  Advisory committee members would receive no compensation for their \nservice, but could be reimbursed for travel expenses.\n  Advisory committee members would serve 2-year terms and would be \neligible for reappointment.\n  The Yukon Agreement requires each country to designate a responsible \nmanagement entity for the harvest of salmon originating in the Yukon, \nwhich will receive recommendations of the Yukon River Panel.\n  My legislation would designate the State of Alaska's Department of \nFish and Game as the responsible management entity for the United \nStates.\n  The Alaska Department of Fish and Game does most of the salmon \nresearch and assessment on the Yukon, and is the primary manager of \ncommercial harvests on the Yukon.\n  The designation of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game is for the \npurposes of the Yukon Agreement, and is not meant to expand, diminish \nor change Federal or State authority with respect to salmon management.\n  The Yukon River Panel would be authorized under the bill to make \nrecommendations to the Department of Interior, Department of Commerce, \nDepartment of State, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, and \nto other Federal or State entities as it feels appropriate.\n  Recommendations by the Yukon River Panel under both the agreement and \nthe legislation I am introducing today are advisory in nature.\n  The Yukon Agreement states that if the Pacific Salmon Treaty should \nterminate before the termination of the Yukon Agreement, the Yukon \nPanel would become the Yukon River Salmon Commission and continue under \nexisting provisions of the treaty that apply to the Yukon.\n  The bill I am introducing allows for the shift from the Yukon River \nPanel to the Yukon River Salmon Commission should the Pacific Salmon \nTreaty terminate.\n  If the Pacific Salmon Treaty fails, the provisions in the bill which \napply to the Yukon River Panel would thereafter apply to the Yukon \nRiver Salmon Commission, and all provisions of the bill, such as the \nvoting structure, would remain in effect.\n  The legislation would authorize $400,000 in each of fiscal years \n1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999 to the Secretary of Commerce to make the \npayment necessary under the Yukon Agreement to the Yukon River \nRestoration and Enhancement Fund.\n  This money will be used primarily for restoration and enhancement in \nCanada, which helps all fishermen along the Yukon. In accordance with \nthe Yukon Agreement, the Yukon River Panel will decide how this money \nis spent.\n  The bill would also authorize appropriations to pay panel members, \nand to reimburse panel members, alternate panel members, advisory \ncommittee members, and U.S. members of a joint technical committee for \ntheir travel expenses.\n  The Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries has received testimony on \nthe Yukon Agreement and relating to this implementing legislation \nduring our recent hearings on the Magnuson Act reauthorization.\n  [[Page S5075]] It is my hope to include the Yukon River Salmon Act--\nwhich I believe to be noncontroversial--on S. 267, the Fisheries Act of \n1995, when S. 267 goes to the Senate floor.\n  I am joined by Senator Murkowski in introducing the Yukon River \nSalmon Act of 1995.\n  I request that the bill be printed in full in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 662\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the week before last I had the \npleasure of cohosting a breakfast with Congressman Gilman for Lu Ping. \nMr. Lu is the head of the People's Republic of China's Office of Hong \nKong and Macau Affairs, as well as a body known as the Preliminary \nWorking Committee. In other words, he is the Chinese official in charge \nof overseeing the transition of Hong Kong from a dependent territory of \nthe United Kingdom to a special administrative region under the \njurisdiction of the People's Republic of China in the summer of 1997.\n  Mr. Lu and his group were, in effect, on a public relations tour of \nthe United States to convince policymakers here--as well as an audience \nback home--that Hong Kong will continue to thrive as a bastion of \ncapitalism after 1997. Mr. Lu did his job well. He spoke eloquently and \nreassuringly, painting a rosy picture for the colony's future without \nsounding phony or unrealistic. While I greatly appreciated the \nopportunity to meet with Mr. Lu and hear his views, I have a concern \nwith his pronouncements which I would like to share with my colleagues.\n  Despite his polished presentation it seemed to me that his views \ndiverged little, if at all, from the official party line. Certainly, \nthis was not entirely unexpected. Members of the PRC bureaucracy are \nnot often given to flights of independence of thought or opinion. While \nhe certainly seemed genuine and straight-forward, I could not shake the \nfeeling that his statements were simply a glossy version of what we \nhave been hearing from Beijing on this topic for some time. He spoke at \nlength about how Hong Kong's present status would be protected, but \nsaid nothing substantive about the mechanics of that protection. As a \nwriter for the Nanhua Zaobao, South China Morning Post, so accurately \nput it:\n\n       [D]espite having an excellent ambassador in the eloquent \n     English-speaking Mr. Lu, and in spite of the articulate back-\n     up of sharp minds like those of Rita Fan and Simon Lee, the \n     fact remained that they had--to American earns at least--very \n     little to say. The style was good, but the U.S. needs a lot \n     more meat in its sandwiches.\n\n  Moreover, while painting a picture of a bright fairy-tale scene full \nof sunshine and singing birds, Mr. Lu neglected to peer at the troll \nunder the bridge: The increasing threats made to the rule of law in \nHong Kong. In 1984, the People's Republic of China and Great Britain \nfinalized a document known as the Joint Declaration. The declaration \nset forth PRC guarantees for Hong Kong's continued autonomy after 1997, \nan elected local legislature, and the continuation of its common-law \nlegal system. Unfortunately, since that time Beijing has acted in such \na way so as to call its commitment to these basic principles into \nquestion. In 1990, the National People's Congress enacted what is known \nas the Basic Law, the statutes that will govern Hong Kong after 1997. \nIn contravention of the Joint Declaration, it--inter alia--subordinates \nthe colony's legislative council to an executive appointed by Beijing, \nand assigns a power of judicial interpretation not to the local courts \nbut to the Standing Committee of the People's Congress. In 1993, a \nsenior official of the PRC's judicial branch intimated that the \nPeople's Republic of China will replace Hong Kong's common-law system \nwith one more closely resembling China's where the civil law is merely \nan extension of the party.\n  Finally, and most ominously in my opinion, the People's Republic of \nChina has called into doubt its commitment to\n establish a Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong. Presently, final \njudicial decisions are appealable to the Privy Council in London. Of \ncourse, that cannot continue to be the case after reversion, and one of \nthe principle concerns of the residents of the colony is that, after \n1997, local legal decisions continue to be appealable to a court with \ninterests not inimicable to the common law and judicial independence \nfrom extralegal influences. Without a local final appeals court, they \nworry--rightly in my opinion--that the final arbiter of the law in Hong \nKong will be a party cadre in Beijing. So, the Joint Declaration \nprovided for the establishment of a Court of Final Appeal [CFR]. Since \nthat time, however, there has \n [[Page S5078]] been increased wrangling between Beijing and London, \nand Hong Kong, over the form of the court; and, for a variety of \nreasons I will not expound upon here, the future of the CFR is much in \nquestion. While it is probably not fair to lay 100 percent of the blame \nfor the imbroglio over the CFA on China, that country, I believe, bears \na lion's share.\n  Mr. President, the continuation of the rule of law in Hong Kong after \n1997 is synonymous with its ability to remain a thriving center of \nfinance and democracy at the doorstep of the Communist behemoth to the \nnorth. The rule of law ensures that business can be conducted in a fair \nand secure way, that contracts are binding, and that there is a \npredictable and impartial means of settling disputes and appeals. Just \nwhat kind of problems the absence of the rule of law creates in China \nis easily illustrated. McDonald's had a contract with the Peoples \nRepublic of China for a restaurant on Tiananmen Square. It operated \nthere for several years, until the Chinese Government decided that it \nwanted to give the choice location to someone else. Consequently, \ndespite contractual provisions to the contrary, the Chinese kicked \nMcDonald's out of their location. Another company, Revpower, Ltd., \nentered into a contract with the Government-owned Shanghai Far-East \nAero-Technology Import and Export Corp. After a dispute between the two \nwas settled by arbitration, an arbitral award in the amount of $6.6 \nmillion was made against the Shanghai firm. Despite its contractual \npromise, however, the Chinese firm refused to abide by the results of \nthe arbitration. Revpower subsequently sought the assistance of the \nShanghai Intermediate People's Court in enforcing the award, but the \ncourt has failed to act or even acknowledge the existence of the suit. \nOne can see why the absence of the rule of law would make businesses \nskittish.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today as the chairman of the \nSenate Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs to let the people \nof Hong Kong--as well as the government in Beijing--know that the \nUnited States take great interest in the future of Hong Kong. We will \nbe keenly watching to be sure that the parties live up to the letter \nand spirit of the Joint Declaration, especially any developments \nregarding the CFR and the rule of law. The People Republic of China \nshould know that we will use how it treats Hong Kong as a strong \nindicator on how it will be expected to act in other areas such as the \nWTO or similar body, for example. If the PRC fails in the former, then \nI will be hard-pressed to support its accession to the latter. The \nworld is watching, Mr. President; let us hope that we will like what we \nsee.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5077-5", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CAROL FITZGERALD\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding member of the Nevada judicial system who is retiring today \nafter 30 years of service. I rise to honor Carol C. Fitzgerald. Ms. \nFitzgerald's career culminated in 1994, her final year of service, with \nthe receipt of the prestigious Angie Award from the Federal Court \nClerks' Association. The Angie Award honors those individuals who \nconsistently display unrelenting commitment to improving the \nadministration of justice, fearless pursuit of causes and goals \nregardless of their popularity, and unblemished integrity. Ms. \nFitzgerald demonstrated all of those characteristics throughout her 30 \nyears of service.\n  She joined the clerk's office in the District of Nevada on March 15, \n1965, and was appointed clerk of the court on April 1, 1976 by the \nHonorable Roger D. Foley. Under Ms. Fitzgerald's capable leadership, \nthe clerk's office grew from less than 10 employees to well over 50. \nThe number of case filings for the district of Nevada has reached the \nthird highest in the Nation.\n  Carol has consistently been active in Nevada's judicial community. \nShe served 4 years as a member of the district clerk's liaison \ncommittee to the ninth circuit judicial conference, was a member of the \ngender bias subcommittee, and was chair of the liaison committee. She \nwas a member of the ninth circuit automation and technology committee, \nthe ninth circuit task force on court reporting, and the chair of the \nsubcommittee on court reporter/recorder management. Ms. Fitzgerald was \nalso president of the Federal Court Clerks' Association.\n  As a practicing trial attorney, I first hand witnessed the tireless \nefforts of Carol Fitzgerald to serve the interests of the public, the \nbar, and the judiciary. Her efforts culminated in a relationship of \nefficiency and trust by all three. As a member of the House of \nRepresentatives and the United States Senate, I also witnessed Carol's \nadvocacy of the Federal court in the federal bureaucracy. Her endeavors \non the court's behalf bore fruit in the outstanding link now found \nbetween the Nevada Federal judiciary and the Nevada congressional \ndelegation.\n  So, as this fine woman moves from the court to another sphere of \ncommunity involvement, I congratulate and applaud her good works and \nfriendship.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5078-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ABOLISH THE SOURCE TAX\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I speak in support of an \nimportant piece of legislation designated to eliminate an unfair \npractice affecting thousands of senior citizens in my home State of \nWashington. It is S. 44, introduced by my distinguished colleagues from \nNevada, Senators Reid and Bryan, to abolish the so-called source tax.\n  As it stands today, retirees living anywhere in the country may find \nthat their retirement pensions are taxed by a State in which they no \nlonger reside. A State may tax a nonresident's pension simply because \nthe person spent all, or part of, his or her working years in that \nState. This unjust tax is, in many cases, automatically deducted from \nthe retiree's pension benefit every month.\n  Retirees are outraged because their taxes are going to pay for \nservices of which they cannot take advantage. They are not able to \npartake in the senior services, medical services, transportation \nfacilities, or public parks in States where they no longer reside. They \ndo not vote in those States and cannot influence how their tax dollars \nare being spent. They are, however, forced to pay taxes to support \nthese services so that others may benefit from them. The seniors in my \nState characterize this practice as taxation without representation. I \nagree.\n  The source tax is not only taxation without representation, but also \na further drain on the already limited and fixed incomes of our senior \ncitizens. Seniors, dependent upon fixed incomes to pay their bills and \nbuy their groceries, are shocked when they learn that they may not have \nenough to get by because of the taxation policies of other States.\n  Many senior citizens have written to me about this burdensome \npractice. Seniors throughout the State of Washington have expressed \ntheir outrage and frustration at being taxed by other States. And, as I \ntravel around the State listening to the concerns of the citizens, this \nissue is continually brought to my attention.\n  We need to correct this practice now. That is why I cosponsored S. \n44, the Source Tax Elimination Act. I encourage my colleagues to help \nme pass this bill and restore tax fairness to our retirees.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5078-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               ANNOUNCEMENT OF POSITION ON CERTAIN VOTES\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I regret being absent for several \nvotes on Thursday, March 30, 1995. However, I felt an obligation to be \nhome in order to take part in the Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission hearing and site tour of Malmstrom Air Force Base. These \nevents will help determine Malmstrom's future: and I firmly believe \nthat Malmstrom plays a crucial role in our national defense and the \ncommunity of Great Falls, MT.\n  Yet I want to briefly express my support for two amendments, one \noffered by Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and the other offered by Senator \nShelby, that would have curbed wasteful spending on Federal \ncourthouses. This is a problem I helped bring to light last year during \nan investigation I conducted as chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee.

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate PVS \nChemicals, based in Detroit, MI, on the occasion of its 50th \nanniversary. Jim Nicholson, president and chief executive officer of \nPVS, and son of founder Floyd A. ``Nick'' Nicholson, has a great deal \nof which he should be proud. Since he came to head PVS in 1979 Jim has \ndiversified its products and services and expanded into the \ninternational marketplace while maintaining the company's commitment to \nsafety, quality,environmental responsibility, customer service, and \nemployee and community support.\n  Founded in 1945 in Detroit as Pressure Vessel Service, Inc., PVS has \ngrown and expanded dramatically. Today it manufactures inorganic \nchemicals for industry, and also for municipal water treatment. With \nreported sales of $121.7 million in 1994, PVS also expedites recycling \nof selected chemical wastes and operates a licensed waste treatment \nfacility in Detroit.\n  In addition to its commitment to the Responsible Care Program of the \nChemical Manufacturers Association and to the Responsible Distribution \nProgram of the National Association of Chemical Distributors, PVS \nmaintains an active concern with improving the quality of life in the \ncommunities in which its plants are located. Each PVS location chooses \na direction for its own community outreach activities. Educational \nsupport has been a major focus, including scholarships, intern \nopportunities, mentoring, tutoring, career day participation, equipment \nand materials donations, and significant contributions at the college \nlevel. Site adjacent cleanup activities also are a common PVS \ncontribution to the community. River cleanups, trash pickup, and even \nadoption of park areas and vacant blocks characterize these efforts to \nspruce up PVS neighborhoods. And PVS plans to extend and integrate all \nof these activities to better help their communities.\n  PVS' public spirit clearly stems from the vision of its president and \nCEO, Jim Nicholson. Jim took over PVS in 1979 after serving a stint \noverseas with the First National Bank of Chicago and serving in PVS as \na vice president and later treasurer. He is an active member of his \ncommunity, having served as vice chairman for economic development for \nMayor Archer's transition committee, on various boards of directors and \non the Advisory Board of United Way for Southeastern Michigan, the \nDetroit Institute of Arts Founders Society Corporate Relations \nCommittee, and the dean's board of advisors for the Wayne State \nUniversity School of Business Administration. He also is actively \ninvolved with the Michigan Chapter of the Nature Conservancy and the \nUnited Negro College Fund and has served on committees for the American \nHeart Association, the American Lung Association, and several other \ncharitable causes.\n  Mr. President, this Nation needs more companies like PVS, which take \nseriously their obligations to the communities in which they work and \nlive. I congratulate PVS on 50 years of responsible, successful work, \nand wish them many more.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5079-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO GEORGE D.

Mr. President, I would like to express my deep \nconcern about S. 395, and other similar legislation which would permit \nthe exportation of Alaskan North Slope crude oil. Lifting the ban would \ncause severe economic strain in Oregon and Washington, and could raise \nthe Nation's gas prices as well as jeopardize national security.\n  In 1973, Congress passed legislation authorizing construction of the \nTrans-Alaska Pipeline System. As part of the agreement, we required \nthat none of the Alaska North Slope crude be exported unless the \nPresident and Congress found that it was in the national interest to do \nso. In imposing this restriction, we made sure that no individual oil \ncompany would decide that their interest in profit was more important \nthan the national interest to preserve our economy and our national \nsecurity.\n  Congress is being asked, by the sponsors of S. 395, to lift the \nrestriction. Mr. President, I understand the potential for significant \neconomic benefits for both Alaska, and the oil industry, if this ban \nwere lifted. The economics are simple to follow. Alaska receives money \nfrom oil produced in the State based upon the wellhead price. The \nwellhead price is figured at a price less transportation. Thus, the \nlower the transportation cost, the more money Alaska will receive. If \nthe oil can be transported to Korea, as it can without the restriction, \ncheaper than it can be transported to the United States, exports will \ngenerate more revenue for Alaska.\n  My primary concern is that, while lifting the export restriction will \nenhance Alaska's oil-rich economy, this comes at the expense of \nthousands of lost American jobs and a weakened domestic tanker fleet, \nall with particular impact in my home State.\n  Passage of the 1973 export restriction on Alaskan North Slope oil \nensured that U.S. repaired vessels would be carrying U.S. crude oil. In \n1976, realizing the increase in the demand for large repair facilities, \ncitizens of Portland invested $84 million in a shipyard expansion \nprogram to handle the repair needs for the Alaskan north Slope very \nlarge crude carriers. Today, 60 percent of Portland's current ship \nrepair work comes from these tankers. The 1973 restriction reassured \nPortland that there was a market out there for shipbuilding repair, and \nPortlanders took a big risk in providing this market. Today, between \n500 to 800 family wage jobs in Portland have been directly supported by \nthe repair needs of these large crude oil tankers, on top of another \n1,000 jobs that are indirectly connected to the port's tanker repair \nactivities.\n  S. 395 does have a provision which makes it mandatory that any tanker \nused to export Alaskan oil would be U.S. owned and operated. And \naccording to U.S. maritime law, any U.S. flagged vessel seeking repairs \noverseas would be assessed an ad valorem penalty of 50 percent of the \nrepair cost. While this sounds as though U.S. ships would have a \ndisincentive to seek overseas repairs, this simply will not happen. Not \nonly are loopholes available where virtually any tanker can seek an \nexemption from the 50 percent assessment penalty, but because the U.S. \nship repair industry is faced with strict labor laws, environmental \ncompliance laws, minimum wage standards, and labor union demands, it is \nstill more cost effective, even with the penalty, to seek repairs \noverseas in markets where no strict compliances exist. In addition, \naccording to the new shipbuilding agreement being prepared by the \nOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development, we may even lose \nthe right to assess an ad valorem 50 percent penalty. Nevertheless, \nwith or without penalty, S. 395 serves to increase the incentive to \nrepair ships in foreign yards by making it possible for ships to take \nrevenue-producing cargoes of Alaskan North Slope oil to the Far East \nprior to undergoing repair. This incentive to seek repairs overseas \nwill not only cause serious environmental risks, but will virtually \ndestroy the ship repair industry in Portland, as well as the rest of \nthe entire west coast. As many as 10,000 maritime and \n [[Page S5080]] shipyard jobs could be lost. Let me be crystal clear, \nthere is no true disincentive to seek repairs in foreign ports by U.S. \ntankers. As a result, we will witness the demise of the U.S. tanker \nrepair industry in Oregon.\n  Furthermore, lifting the restriction could increase our vulnerability \nto outside influence on U.S. foreign policy. Our Nation may become more \nexposed to foreign pressures, particularly from the volatile Middle \nEastern nations. This poses a great danger to our ability to \nsuccessfully maintain our independence in global politics.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, there is no doubt that lifting this \nexport restriction will hurt the American merchant fleet. It is going \nto hurt the ship repair yards on the west coast, it is going to raise \nthe cost of crude oil to the United States, it is going to threaten our \nnational security, and it is going to cost thousands and thousands of \nAmerican jobs, particularly in Oregon. I do not find this to be in the \nnational interest, and I am confident that my colleagues will \nconcur.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5079-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO KRISTEN AND SKIP AVANSINO\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, on Tuesday, April 11, Kristen and \nRaymond ``Skip'' Avansino will be honored by the American Jewish \nCommittee's Institute of Human Relations for their efforts to protect \nthe religious, political, and economic rights of all Americans.\n  It is with pleasure that I take this occasion to recognize and \ncommend them for their many years of service to the people of Nevada \nand throughout the country.\n  Skip Avansino has had a long and remarkable career, and is a role \nmodel for all young people who wish to succeed in public and private \nlife. After graduating from the University of Nevada, Reno, Skip earned \na degree in law from the University of San Francisco and a masters of \nlaw in taxation from New York University.\n  He returned to the University of Nevada as an assistant professor of \nbusiness, real estate, and accounting law. Following a 4-year term on \nthe Nevada Gaming Commission, Skip entered private practice \nspecializing in corporate tax and gaming law. In the mid-1980's, Skip's \ntalents were recognized by the Hilton Hotel Corp. and he was appointed \nto the corporations board of directors.\n  In February 1993, he was elected president and chief operating \nofficer of Hilton Hotels where he is responsible for overseeing one of \nthe largest resort/casino operations in the world.\n  Kristen Avansino is equally talented. An accomplished dancer and \nchoreographer, Kristen has served as professor of dance at the \nUniversity of Nevada, Reno, and as an instructor for the Nevada Museum \nof Art.

Mr. President, I commend the work of two \nNashvillians whose efforts to help inner-city children have often gone \nunrecognized--Glenn and Tara McLain. As directors for the Lindsley \nlocation of Nashville's Youth Hobby Shop, Glenn and Tara McLain have \nworked to provide a positive role model and change the lives of inner-\ncity youth, one by one.\n  In an area where violence and poverty prevent children from achieving \ntheir dreams, the McLains have tutored more than 100 children each week \nin the Youth Hobby Shop and have worked to keep the kids off of drugs. \nIn addition, they serve as counselors and friends for many of the \nchildren and teenagers who participate in the many activities at the \nLindsley hobby shop location. As a result, many of these people \ninvolved in Youth Hobby Shop stay in school, enter college, or join the \nwork force. Mr. President, this program is changing the lives of our \nyoung Americans, and in turn, is helping to change the direction of \nthis country toward a more independent, self-sufficient, and productive \nsociety.\n  When it was founded more than 36 years ago, the Youth Hobby Shop used \nhobbies and crafts to help children in Nashville who could not help \nthemselves--those who had no one to come home to after school or needed \nalternatives to the dangerous streets. As the needs of inner-city \nchildren have changed, so has the program. Now Youth Hobby Shop \nprovides tutoring in a variety of subjects, as well as drug prevention \nprograms, parenting classes, field trips, summer camps, and a first-\nrate basketball league to keep the children off the street and guide \nthem toward productive futures.\n  A recent survey of residents living within a mile radius of both \nYouth Hobby Shop locations found that 79 percent of the households knew \nof the hobby shop's programs and spoke highly of them. The survey also \nsuggested areas in which the program could expand, including adding job \ntraining and a neighborhood child care service.\n  Volunteerism is a key to the great success of this program. Most of \nthe hobby shop's funding comes from donations from individuals, \ncorporations, and churches--and Glenn and Tara McLain have not only won \nthe support of children in the Lindsley Avenue neighborhood, but they \nhave attracted the support of more than 75 university students and \nadults who volunteer regularly to help the kids improve their reading \nskills. At the beginning and end of each school year, the children's \nreading skills are tested to measure their progress.\n  Glenn and Tara McLain have dedicated their lives to helping inner-\ncity children, and for that, Mr. President, I want to thank them. The \nsuccess of their hard work and dedication is immeasurable and their \nimpact on the city of Nashville is invaluable.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5080-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5080-S5081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   BURUNDI: ON THE BRINK OF DISASTER\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Central African nation of \nBurundi is once again on the brink of disaster. Exactly 1 year after \nthe world witnessed a genocide in Rwanda, and 1\\1/2\\ years after ethnic \nviolence between Hutus and Tutsis killed more than 100,000 people in \nBurundi, we are watching a similar catastrophe unfold before our eyes \nagain. We must do what we can to try to deter another bloodbath.\n  After months of a tense calm in Burundi, political violence began \nescalating in the last several weeks as extremist Tutsi militia, with \nthe complicity of the Tutsi-dominated military establishment, stepped \nup attacks against Hutus, and Hutu extremists prepared for military \nactivity. The violence directly threatens the power-sharing agreement \nnegotiated in September 1993, and disrupts what we all had hoped would \nbe a transition to coexistence in Burundi.\n  In the last couple of weeks, Amnesty International reports that \nhundreds of people have been killed or disappeared in Burundi, and \nthousands of Hutus have fled their villages to seek refuge in Zaire and \nelsewhere. Some are being held hostage in their own villages, \nsurrounded by hostile armed youths and cut off from outside contract. \nRwandan refugees who sought refuge in Burundi last year are now \nbeginning to flee to Zaire and Tanzania out of fear that similar terror \nwill prevail in the refugee camps.\n  The latest round of violence comes on the heels of the assassination \nin early March of the Minister for Mines and Energy, Ernest \nKabushemeye, a Hutu leader, and the discovery of the dismembered body \nof a retired Tutsi army officer, Lt. Col. Lucien Sakubo. A week later, \n17 more, including 3 Belgians and a 4-year-old child, were killed in a \nhighway ambush by Hutu extremists outside of Bujumbura. Last weekend, \nat least 200 people were killed \n [[Page S5081]] in the capital, according to Amnesty, and more than 100 \npeople were found dead, lying along a rural road south of Bujumbura.\n  The situation in Burundi has so deteriorated that families of \nAmerican and European diplomats are being urged to leave. After \ninitially resisting such guidance, the dependents of the United States \nAmbassador to Burundi, Robert Krueger, also left this week.\n  The Prime Minister of Burundi, Antoine Nduwayo, has issued a plan of \naction designed to strengthen law and order in Burundi, and the \nmajority leader of the Burundian Parliament, Bubugive, is traveling \nthroughout Africa to coordinate regional efforts to help Burundi. We \nshould be prepared to offer any support we can for these diplomatic \ninitiatives.\n  Mr. President, the U.N. Special Representative, Ahmedou Ould \nAbdallah, has told the Associated Press that ``this country * * * is \nheaded toward collision with disaster.'' And, in reaction to the \nviolent sweeps of Hutu neighborhoods by Tutsi gangs last weekend, \nBurundi's President, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, predicted, ``I really \nsee a genocide, because those things were\n well prepared and carried out fairly systematically.''\n\n  Genocide is a loaded word, and I use it very carefully and sparingly. \nGiven the past events, Burundi's current crisis could explode into a \nsecond genocide in Africa within a year.\n  President Clinton has taken a personal interest in Burundi, \nbroadcasting a plea over Voice of America to the people of Burundi to \n``say no to violence and extremism.'' National Security Adviser Tony \nLake and Secretary of State Christopher have called for diplomatic \nintervention. Our Ambassador to Burundi has done a stellar job at \ncommunicating the dangers and involving himself where appropriate. I \nadmire and thank him for his commitment.\n  As events were worsening this week, U.N. Secretary General Boutros \nBoutros-Ghali proposed that a U.N. peacekeeping force be earmarked for \nintervention so that if there is a need, troops can be promptly \ndeployed.\n  Last week, the U.N. Security Council also issued a warning that those \nresponsible for ethnic violence in Burundi could eventually be tried in \ninternational courts for crimes against humanity. I was encouraged by \nthis since I, along with the Senator from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, \nchair of the Africa subcommittee, and 10 of our colleagues sent a \nletter to our Ambassador to the United Nations, Ambassador Madeleine \nAlbright, urging her to support the request made by the Government of \nBurundi to the U.N. Security Council to establish a judicial commission \nof experts. This commission would be essential to investigating those \nwho have committed past human rights violations, and could serve as a \ndeterrent for others. If extremists who perpetuate ethnic violence in \nBurundi go unpunished, further violence would only be encouraged.\n  Wednesday marks the anniversary of the beginning of the genocide in \nRwanda. The Subcommittees on African Affairs of both the House and the \nSenate will hold a joint hearing on Central Africa. I urge my \ncolleagues to pay attention to this hearing because we will hear \ntestimony on the aftermath of last year's violence, and examine options \nto avert another catastrophe this year. I also expect we will discuss \nhow American initiatives, such as the African Conflict Resolution Act, \nintroduced by the distinguished Senator from Illinois and past chair of \nthe subcommittee, Senator Simon, can help avoid future tragedies.\n  Our national attention is properly turned to rescissions, \nconstitutional amendments, and other pressing domestic matters now. But \nwe would be remiss to ignore disaster elsewhere because it will come \nback to haunt us. We may be called upon to contribute money and \nsupplies for humanitarian relief; or support U.N. troops deployed to \nquell the rampant, sickening violence; or deal with destabilization in \nAfrica because of a massive refugee spillover; or we may face other \nunforseen long-term consequences, such as threats to our health, \nenvironment, food supplies, and who knows what, if we completely ignore \nCentral Africa.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in confronting the complicated \nproblems in Central Africa, and to consider the price we may pay--not \nto mention the humanitarian disaster that may result--if we pretend \nAfrica does not exist.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5080-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PAUL SAUCEDO\n\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of \nNevada's outstanding citizens, who, through a courageous act has given \nanother person a chance to live. It is my privilege today to honor a \nman from Carson City, Paul Saucedo.\n  In 1989, Paul was diagnosed with Hepatitis C he believes was \ncontracted from a blood transfusion. His condition began to deteriorate \nand soon, the disease had scarred his liver so badly he began to suffer \nfrom increased pain and mental confusion. In 1994, Paul was \nhospitalized a half-a-dozen times. Paul soon had to retire as an \nengineer at the Nevada Department of Transportation, because he was too \ntired during his illness to do much of anything. Last summer, he was \ngiven a 30 percent chance of survival. A liver transplant was needed to \nsave Paul's life.\n  In August of last year, California Pacific Medical Center in San \nFrancisco contacted Paul and informed him a liver was available. When \nboth Paul and his wife learned of a baby girl in the hospital that also \nneeded a liver, Paul decided to give it to the little girl. Even though \ndoctors gave him little chance of surviving another year, Paul never \nexpressed regret about passing the first donated liver to the little \ngirl.\n  Another liver was finally available in early February and Paul \nunderwent a successful 15 hour transplant surgery. Paul, is now at his \nhome in Carson City doing well. Through his story, Paul has sparked \ninterest in the donor program and blood drives in northern Nevada.\n  Paul could have chosen to take the first donated liver to save his \nown life. Instead, he chose to put a little girl's life ahead of his \nown. Paul's altruism serves as an inspiration to all of us. I wish him \nwill in the future and commend him for his heroic act.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5081-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                APPOINTMENT BY THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The school was later relocated to Columbia, SC and in 1880, it \nwas renamed for Bishop Richard Allen, the founder of the African \nMethodist Episcopal Church.\n  [[Page S5082]] Allen University has a long tradition of producing \nclergy and lay leadership for the African Methodist Episcopal Church, \nas well as scholars, attorneys, physicians, teachers, business and \ngovernmental leaders, and other professionals who have risen to \nprominent positions in our society.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in commending Allen University and \nextending our best wishes to the university under the leadership of \nBishop John Hurst Adams and President David T.

Mr. President, I would like to report to the Senate on \n [[Page S5084]] the status of the telecommunications bill. On March 23, \nthe Commerce Committee voted overwhelmingly in favor of the \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995.\n  It is my strongest hope now that we can get this bill up for action \non the floor this week, before the recess. The danger in delay is that \nit could be picked apart by the various interest groups.\n  This bill would be a roadmap for investment for the next 15 years, \nuntil the wireless age. There will be an explosion of investment if we \npass it. The benefits to consumers will be tremendous.\n  I wish to urge Members of the Senate and the various interests and \nconsumer groups that are lobbying and working on this bill to remember \nthat if we give one group a special consideration, then we have to give \nit to others.\n  It seems that everybody wants to have a bill. CEO's all say they want \na bill; the administration wants a bill. But we will not have a bill \nunless we have some cooperation and everyone working together. That has \nbeen my message.\n  So I do hope we get the telecommunications bill up this week. If not, \nwe will pass it later--but it is far better to act sooner than later. I \nwould implore the various interests in this country which are following \nthis bill to work together. This is the sort of bill that is not on \nevery American citizen's mind every day, but I think it is the most \nimportant bill for our country's economy in the Congress today. It is \nup to those of us in the Senate and the House and the White House to \nwork together cooperatively. I look forward to doing that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/03/senate-section/article/S5083-5", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
