Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself and Mr. \n     Cohen, proposes an amendment numbered 319.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment appears in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer today in behalf of \nSenator Cohen and myself the Federal Reports Elimination and \nModification Act of 1995 as an amendment to the pending bill.\n  Our amendment will eliminate over 200 outdated and unnecessary \nreporting requirements. These are reporting requirements which have \nbeen placed into the law over many, many years that are now useless. \nThese are over 200 reports that are not needed or used by congressional \ncommittees. They require up to $10 million of cost in their \npreparation. We have gone through each of the reports mandated by law. \nWe have talked to each of the agencies. We have consulted with each of \nthe congressional committees. This is the list of those reports which \nare totally dispensable which for the most part no one even uses \nanymore. But they just stay in the law, filed every year or every 6 \nmonths by agencies at great cost.\n  My subcommittee, the oversight subcommittee of governmental affairs, \nwhich Senator Cohen now chairs and which I am now the ranking member \nof, has gone through all of the reporting requirements. We have again \nmade this assessment as to those reports. Each committee having \nproposed what their needs are, these reports are the ones that are no \nlonger needed.\n   [[Page S3548]] This legislation is designed to improve the \nefficiency of agency operations by eliminating unnecessary paperwork \nand staff time by consolidating the amount of information that flows \nfrom the agencies to Congress.\n  So this amendment is the product of a coordinated and a thorough and \naggressive effort to identify the congressionally mandated agency \nreporting requirements that have outlived their usefulness and now \nserve only as an unnecessary drain on agency resources,\n resources that could be devoted to more important program use. In \nfact, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that enactment of this \nlegislation could result in savings of up to $5 to $10 million.\n\n  This is the second wave of reports elimination from the Subcommittee \non Oversight of Government Management which Senator Cohen chairs and on \nwhich I now serve as the ranking Democrat. We passed a similar bill \nthat eliminated or modified other reporting requirements in 1985.\n  Since it had been over 8 years since that effort, I decided it was \ntime once again to take a look at agency reporting requirements that \nwe, in Congress, have enacted and take those reports that have outlived \ntheir usefulness off our books. That is much easier said than done. \nThere are literally thousands of different congressionally mandated \nreporting requirements. Each of those reporting requirements was \nenacted for a reason. To make a responsible choice about whether or not \na particular reporting requirement should be eliminated, that reason \nmust be identified and evaluated as to whether it remains valid. That \nis time-consuming, painstaking work; however, it is necessary work.\n  For example, by the time the 1985 legislation was enacted into law, \nthe number of report eliminations contained in the bill had dropped \nfrom over 100 on introduction to just 23. The General Accounting Office \n[GAO] did a review of the 1985 reports elimination effort to see why \nthe number of reports in the bill dropped so drastically. GAO uncovered \ncertain weaknesses in that effort; primarily that the agencies did not \nconsult with Congress when making their recommendations for \neliminations or modifications and that the agency recommendations were \nnot accompanied by adequate justifications.\n  We took heed of GAO's findings in developing this legislation. The \n1985 legislation was based on a list of agency recommendations \ngenerated by the Office of Management and Budget. This time around, \nthere was no such list available, so we had to generate our own. In \n1993, Senator Cohen and I wrote to all 89 executive and independent \nagencies and asked that they identify reports required by law that they \nbelieve are no longer necessary or useful and, therefore, that could be \neliminated or modified. In our request letter, we stressed the \nimportance of a clear and substantiated justification for each \nrecommendation made.\n  We received responses from about 80 percent of the agencies. For the \nmost part, the agencies made a serious effort to review and recommend a \nrespectable number of reporting requirements for elimination, but given \nthe opportunity our effort presented, some were surprisingly less \naggressive. Certain agencies already had report elimination projects \nunderway. For example, the Department of Defense, at the request of \nSenator McCain, conducted an internal review of the congressionally \nmandated reporting requirements for all of its services. Numerous \nreporting requirements were then eliminated and modified in the fiscal \nyear 1995 defense authorization bill and were not included, therefore, \nin this legislation.\n  After receiving the agency responses, a member of the\n   subcommittee staff generated a master list of all the agency \nrecommendations. At the same time we sent to the chairman and ranking \nmember of each of the relevant Senate committees, for their review and \ncomment, the recommendations made by the agencies under their \nrespective jurisdictions. Feedback from the committees of jurisdiction \nis necessary to ensure that this effort eliminates as many reporting \nrequirements as possible without losing needed information. We also \nasked that the committees provide us with any additional \nrecommendations for eliminations or modifications they might have.\n\n  Many of the committees responded to the request for comments. Those \nresponses were generally supportive of the subcommittee's efforts and \nmost contained only a few changes to the agency recommendations. Those \nchanges were primarily requests by committees to retain reports under \ntheir jurisdiction because the information contained in the report is \nof use to the committee or, in some cases, of use to outside \norganizations. We adjusted the master list of eliminations and \nmodifications based on those committee comments. Subcommittee staff \nthen worked with the Senate legislative counsel's office to check \nstatutory references to make sure we are addressing the correct \nprovisions in law.\n  Senator Cohen and I introduced S. 2156 on May 25, 1994. As \nintroduced, the bill contained nearly 300 recommendations for \neliminations or modifications. Senators Glenn, Roth, Stevens, and \nMcCain cosponsored that bill.\n  Shortly after the introduction of S. 2156, Senator Cohen and I again \nwrote to all the committees and asked for comments on the bill as \nintroduced. This was a continuation of our effort to avoid the problems \nof the 1985 effort by including the committees of jurisdiction in each \nstep of the development of S. 2156. Certain committees have responded \nto that second request and generally they have asked for few changes to \nthe bill.\n  While most of the recommendations we received from the agencies and \nincluded in the bill concern targeted, agency-specific reporting \nrequirements, we did receive several recommendations regarding \ngovernmentwide reporting requirements. Again, we turned to the \ncommittees of jurisdiction for guidance on how or whether to enact \nthese governmentwide agency recommendations. A number of these \nrecommendations concerned reporting requirements that fall under \nvarious financial management statutes such as the Chief Financial \nOfficers Act. Our bill does not address these particular \nrecommendations due to the proposal contained in H.R. 3400 and other \nlegislation to allow the administration to set up a pilot program aimed \nat streamlining the reporting and other requirements contained in these \nlaws.\n  We are in the process of reviewing other governmentwide reporting \nrequirements to see if some changes can be made. For\n instance, there were several recommendations to change inspector \ngeneral [IG] reports from semiannual to annual. From our initial \ndiscussions with the IG community and the relevant committee staff it \nseems that it might be possible to make this shift without jeopardizing \nthe oversight responsibilities of the IG's. We will continue to discuss \nthis recommendation to see if we can't achieve some change. Another \nissue that we will be looking at is creating thresholds for \ngovernmentwide reporting requirements. We received several \nrecommendations from smaller agencies that talked of the burden of \ncomplying with certain governmentwide reporting requirements that have \nno relevance to their small agency.\n\n  Every reporting requirement takes away resources that could be used \nelsewhere in the agency. Sometimes the burden is slight--as low as a \nfew hundred dollars. Sometimes the burden is great--as high as a few \nmillion dollars. Enactment of this legislation will save time and \nmoney.\n  This legislation gets at those reports that no one uses. These are \nthe reports that come into our offices and sit in staff in-boxes for \nweeks, maybe months, until they are either rerouted to someone else or \nfiled in that popular circular file drawer. On several occasions in the \nprocess of drafting this legislation, agencies told us that, for \nwhatever reason, they hadn't been doing or had never done the reporting \nrequirement they were now seeking to eliminate. Apparently no one had \nnoticed the agency's failure to report or, if they did, no one \ncomplained. We have taken care to be aggressive in identifying reports, \nbut deferential to the committees with substantive responsibility that \nmay use these reports.\n  This amendment, which is the same as S. 2156 with a few changes, is a \nbipartisan effort. It was unanimously reported out of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee by voice vote on August 2, 1994. We tried to get it \nto the floor last \n [[Page S3549]] year, but were unable to do so. I am pleased that the \nSenate will act on this legislation today to move the Federal Report \nElminiation and Modification Act of 1995 one step closer to becoming \nlaw. In today's day and age, we need all the resources we can get. The \nlonger the reporting requirements contained in this bill stay on the \nbooks, the more resources are unnecessarily spent to comply. I thank \nSenator Cohen and his staff for their assistance in developing and \nmoving this bill through the legislative process. I also want to take \nthis opportunity to thank Tony Coe of the Senate legislative counsel's \noffice for his fine work in drafting this legislation. I also want to \nthank Kay Dekuiper who was a member of the Oversight Subcommittee staff \nwhen this legislation was being developed and who did the bulk of the \nhard, tedious work putting this legislation together. She has since \nleft the Senate to pursue her career elsewhere, but our appreciation \nfor her efforts while she was here remain undiminished.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been cleared on the other \nside. I spoke to Senator Roth about this last night. He, again, was a \nsupporter of this in the last Congress.\n  This matter came up quite quickly last night, so we did not even have \nan opportunity to list him as a cosponsor. I am quite confident, \nhowever, from his quick comments to me last night on the floor, that he \ndoes support this amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on behalf of the manager of this \nlegislation, my understanding is that this is not a controversial \namendment. I am basing that, at least partially, on the assurances of \nthe distinguished Senator from Michigan. I also understand from the \nstaff that this amendment is acceptable.\n  So, at this juncture, there will be no objection to this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Again I thank the manager of the bill for his support.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 319) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 320\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 320.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress should not enact \n     or adopt any legislation that will increase the number of \n     children who are hungry or homeless.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me start out with a definition for \nmy colleagues. The definition of hunger. This amendment talks about \nhunger among children.\n\n       The mental and physical condition that comes from not \n     eating enough food due to insufficient economic, family or \n     community resources.\n\n  Mr. President, the way in which this is measured would be if there \nwas a ``yes'' on at least five of the following eight questions.\n\n       Does your household ever run out of money to buy food to \n     make a meal?\n       Do you or other adult members of your household ever eat \n     less than you feel you should because there is not enough \n     money to buy food?\n       Do you or other adult members of your household ever cut \n     the size of meals or skip meals because there is not enough \n     money for food?\n       Do your children ever eat less than you feel they should \n     because there is not enough money for food?\n       Do you ever cut the size of your children's meals or do \n     they ever skip meals because there is not enough money for \n     food?\n       Do your children ever say they are hungry because there is \n     not enough food in the house?\n       Do you ever rely on a limited number of foods to feed your \n     children because you are running out of money to buy food for \n     a meal?\n       Do any of your children ever go to bed hungry because there \n     is not enough money to buy food?\n\n  Mr. President, the Food Research Action Council Community Childhood \nHunger Identification Project, estimated in 1991 that there are 5.5 \nmillion children under 12 years of age who are hungry in the United \nStates. Let me repeat that. There are 5.5 million children today, with \nexisting programs of support, who are hungry in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Council of Mayors Status Report on Hunger and \nHomelessness in American Cities in 1994 found that 64 percent of the \npersons receiving food assistance were from families with children.\n  I could go on with other definitions and would be pleased to do so as \nwe move forward with this amendment.\n  Homelessness. The U.S. Council of Mayors Status Report on Hunger and \nHomelessness in American Cities estimated that 26 percent of the \nrequests at the emergency shelters were for children, homeless \nchildren.\n  In 1988, the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, \nestimated that there were 100,000 children who are homeless each day--\n100,000 children, Mr. President, homeless in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, on the very first day or the second day of this \nsession, going back to the Congressional Accountability Act, I brought \nthis amendment to the floor. I said that I feared that what was going \nto happen in the 104th Congress would go way beyond the goodness of \npeople and that part of the safety net would be eviscerated, in \nparticular, support for children in America. That was voted down. I \ncould not get the Senate to go on record.\n  Then, Mr. President, with the unfunded mandates bill, I came out and \nsaid, ``Why don't we at least do a child impact statement so we know \nwhat we are doing with these cuts, be they rescissions or proposed cuts \nin the budget and reconciliation bill?'' That was voted down.\n  Then I brought a motion to refer which was a direction back to the \nBudget Committee as a part of the balanced budget amendment. At that \ntime, I held up some headlines, and I said, ``I have been told by \ncolleagues, `Senator Wellstone, there is no reason for you to come out \nhere with scare tactics because we are not going to cut nutrition \nprograms for children. We are not going to do anything that could lead \nto more hunger or homelessness among children.'''\n  I came out here just last week with several headlines, one from \nFebruary 23, ``House Panel Votes Social Funding Cuts, Republicans Trim \nNutrition and Housing.'' Another one, ``House Panel Moves to Cut \nFederal Child Care, School Lunch Fund.''\n  Mr. President, today, just by way of background, what is the headline \nin the Washington Post, Tuesday, March 7? It is a front-page story \nabout a school in Fayette, MS. The headline is ``School Fearful That \nJohnny Can't Eat''--not ``School Fearful That `Johnny Can't Read'''--\n``School Fearful That `Johnny Can't Eat.'''\n  The Congress' school lunch debate worries some in rural Mississippi.\n\n       I got a little boy come in here every morning and eats \n     everybody's food. Just licks the plate. And you know he's not \n     the only one,'' said Jeanette Reeves, eagle-eyed and dressed \n     in starched white, a cafeteria manager who doesn't have to \n     tell the children twice to eat all their lima beans. ``Many \n     of these children get their only meals right here at school. \n     Lord, it'll be cruel to change that.\n\n  That, Mr. President, is a front-page story from the Washington Post. \nNow we are moving to the point where we are not worried about whether \n``Johnny can't read.'' We are worried about whether or not ``Johnny \ncan't eat''--cuts in School Lunch Programs and School Breakfast \nPrograms and Child Nutrition Programs.\n  Mr. President, the same Washington Post piece, page A-4, headline: \n``House Panel Votes to Curtail Program for Disabled Children.''\n   [[Page S3550]] Mr. President, I think we have just plain run out of \nexcuses here on the Senate side.\n  Let me just give a little bit more context. Last week we had charts \nout on the importance of the debt and the annual budget deficits. I \nhave brought some charts out about the importance of children in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article by Bob Herbert, ``Inflicting Pain on Children,'' in a New \nYork Times op-ed piece, Saturday, February 25.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 25, 1995]\n\n                      Inflicting Pain on Children\n\n                            (By Bob Herbert)\n\n\n  the helpless are taking the brunt of the Republicans' attack on our \n                             social system\n\n       The Republican jihad against the poor, the young and the \n     helpless rolls on. So far no legislative assault has been too \n     cruel, no budget cut too loathsome for the party that took \n     control of Congress at the beginning of the year and has \n     spent all its time since then stomping on the last dying \n     embers of idealism and compassion in government.\n       This week Republicans in the House began approving measures \n     that would take food off the trays of hungry school children \n     and out of the mouths of needy infants. With reckless \n     disregard for the human toll that is sure to follow, they \n     have also aimed their newly powerful budget-reducing weapons \n     at programs that provide aid to handicapped youngsters, that \n     support foster care and adoption,that fight drug abuse in \n     schools and that provide summer jobs for needy youths.\n       They have also targeted programs that provide fuel oil to \n     the poor and assistance to homeless veterans. And they have \n     given the back of their hand to President Clinton's national \n     service corps.\n       The United States has entered a nightmare period in which \n     the overwhelming might of the Federal Government is being \n     used to deliberately inflict harm on the least powerful \n     people in the nation. The attacks on children have been the \n     worst. If the anti-child legislation that is moving with such \n     dispatch through the House actually becomes law, ``the \n     results will be cataclysmic,'' according to James Weill, \n     general counsel to the Children's Defense Fund.\n       Mr. Weill said: ``The Republican leadership has targeted \n     children for almost all of the pain. They've cut, I think, $7 \n     billion out of the child nutrition programs, and that's not \n     even counting food stamps, which they haven't done yet.\n       ``Foster care and adoption have been cut by $4 billion over \n     five years. They've cut Aid to Families with Dependent \n     Children, and they're eliminating most of the entitlements as \n     they go along. They're just smashing their way through all of \n     the children's programs. To me, this so-called revolution is \n     more like a massacre of the innocents.''\n       President Clinton denounced the cuts and accused the G.O.P. \n     majority in Congress of ``making war on children.'' At a \n     press conference yesterday in Ottawa, Canada, Mr. Clinton \n     said: ``What they want to do is make war on the kids of this \n     country to pay for the capital gains tax cut. That's what's \n     going on.''\n       There is a breathless, frenzied quality to the Republican \n     assault, as if the party leaders recognize that they must get \n     their work done fast--while the Democrats are still in a \n     post-election stupor, and before the public at large becomes \n     aware of the extremes of suffering and social devastation \n     that are in the works.\n       ``This agenda is too harsh,'' said Senator Paul Wellstone, \n     a Democrat from Minnesota. ``I realize that the Republicans \n     won the election, but these measures are too extreme, too \n     mean-spirited. They go beyond what the goodness of the people \n     in this country would permit. Most Americans do not want to \n     see vulnerable people hurt, especially children.''\n       Mr. Wellstone has irritated some of his Republican \n     colleagues by frequently offering a legislative amendment \n     that says the Senate ``will not enact any legislation that \n     will increase the number of children who are hungry or \n     homeless.'' Each time it is offered, the amendment is \n     defeated.\n       The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, dismissed the \n     Wellstone amendment as an ``extraneous'' measure designed \n     solely to make Republicans ``look heartless and cold.'' No \n     doubt. But Senator Wellstone is right on target when he says \n     that the Republican legislative strategy was carefully \n     designed to hurt the people ``who aren't the big players, who \n     aren't the heavy hitters, who don't make big contributions, \n     who don't have lobbyists, who don't have clout.''\n       If anything is funny in this dismal period, it's that the \n     Republicans are touchy about being called heartless and cold. \n     That's a riot. Has anyone listened to Newt Gingrich lately? \n     To Dick Armey? To Phil Gramm? This is the coldest crew to \n     come down the pike since the Ice Age.\n       An indication of just how cold and heartless the \n     Republicans have become is the startling fact that Mr. Dole, \n     of all people, is starting to look a little warm and fuzzy.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I quote from that article:\n\n       The Republican jihad against the poor, the young and the \n     helpless rolls on. So far no legislative assault has been too \n     cruel, no budget cut too loathsome for the party that took \n     control of Congress at the beginning of the year and has \n     spent all its time since then stomping on the last dying \n     embers of idealism and compassion in government.\n       This week Republicans in the House began approving measures \n     that would take food off the trays of hungry schoolchildren \n     and out of the mouths of needy infants. With reckless \n     disregard for the human toll that is sure to follow, they \n     have also aimed their newly powerful budget-reducing weapons \n     at programs that provide aid to handicapped youngsters, that \n     support foster care and adoption, that fight drug abuse in \n     schools and that provide summer jobs for needy youths.\n\n  Mr. President, 1 day in the life of American children: 636 babies are \nborn to women who had late or no prenatal care. One day in the life of \nAmerican children: 801 babies are born at low birthweight; by the way, \nto many women who never had any proper nutrition, and we now have \nproposed cuts in the Women, Infants, and Children Program. One day in \nthe life of American children: 1,234 children run away from their \nhomes. One day in the life of American children: 2,255 teenagers drop \nout of school each school day. One day in the life of American \nchildren: 2,868 babies are born into poverty. One day in the life of \nAmerican children: 7,945 children are reported abused or neglected. One \nday in the life of American children: 100,000 children are homeless. \nOne day in the life of American children: Three children die from child \nabuse. One day in the life of American children: 9 children are \nmurdered; 13 children die from guns; 27 children--a classroomful--die \nfrom poverty; 63 babies die before they are 1 month old--63 babies die \nbefore they are 1 month old; and 101 babies die before their 1st \nbirthday.\n  Mr. President, it is just time for the U.S. Senate to go on record. \nLet me just make it clear again what this amendment does. This \namendment on the paperwork reduction bill is just a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment. We are not going to do anything that creates more hunger or \nhomelessness among children. There is no excuse not to go on record. \nThe U.S. Senate needs to take this position.\n  Mr. President, a little bit more in context, I have a report: \n``Unshared Sacrifice; The House of Representatives' Shameful Assault on \nAmerica's Children,'' March 1995, the Children's Defense Fund, that I \nask be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n             [From the Children's Defense Fund, March 1995]\n\n Unshared Sacrifice--The House of Representatives' Shameful Assault on \n                           America's Children\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       In a ``revolution'' that so far has spared just about \n     everyone else, the House leadership and key committee \n     majorities have targeted America's children for the earliest, \n     broadest, and by far the deepest pain in budget cuts, program \n     restructuring, and rescissions. In less than two weeks key \n     committees and subcommittees have voted to cut $40 billion \n     from crucial child survival programs, and to end the federal \n     safety net for children and their families. This is a wholly \n     unshared sacrifice: the House seems to be postponing for a \n     later day, if ever, any contemplation of major cuts for other \n     constituencies. Savings from savage cuts in programs for \n     needy and helpless children would be used to fund a new and \n     unnecessary defense build-up; to pay for a capital gains tax \n     cut of which 71 percent goes to the richest 1 percent of \n     Americans; and to reduce a tax on the richest 13 percent of \n     the elderly by $56 billion (over 10 years) when that tax goes \n     to pay part of Medicare's cost.\n       While the House majority's welfare plan has gotten most \n     media attention, that plan's unprecedented savaging of \n     children is merely symptomatic of a broad-gauged assault on \n     hungry children's nutrition programs, disabled children's \n     disability assistance, preschool children's child care and \n     child development centers, unemployed youths' summer jobs, \n     sick children's medical care, and abused children's foster \n     care and hope for adoptive families. Block grants, \n     rescissions, and consolidations are being used in a multi-\n     front attack on children's services. Not even proven money-\n     saving programs like Head Start have been spared. And in the \n     midst of this series of brutal reductions, the most severe \n     have been reserved for the most vulnerable children--those \n     who are disabled or in foster care.\n       Based on data from the Congressional Budget Office, the \n     Department of Health and \n      [[Page S3551]] Human Services and the Department of \n     Agriculture, and analysis of congressional numbers by the \n     Children's Defense Fund, $40 billion in core safety net \n     program cuts were adopted in the past two weeks that would \n     force out of these programs millions of the children eligible \n     under current rules (see chart, next page).\n       These numbers assume that states would reduce spending by \n     the amount of federal reductions, and do so by eliminating \n     eligible children from the program rather than reducing \n     benefits across-the-board. In some programs like AFDC and \n     SSI, the strategy of dropping children is virtually dictated \n     by the proposed legislation. In others, it is possible for \n     states to spread out the cuts and reduce benefits for more \n     children, but completely deny benefits to fewer. In that \n     case, many more children would be hurt, but the damage to \n     each would be a bit less. In either instance, the pain will \n     be massive.\n       The numbers in this report actually understate the real \n     depth of the cuts, since they assume there is no recession \n     driving up the number of children needing help; assume there \n     are no transfers from the new block grants to other programs \n     (as is allowed with some of the funds); assume that there are \n     not larger cuts in state funds by states that would be freed \n     from any matching requirements; and do not account for how \n     cuts in one area (such as AFDC) will drive up the need in \n     other areas (such as foster care). Moreover, the AFDC losses \n     in 2000 disguise the full impact of the House welfare plan: 3 \n     million to 5 million children could lose AFDC when that plan \n     is fully phased in.\n\n                                             THE UNSHARED SACRIFICE                                             \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                   Percentage of\n                                                                                                   all eligible \n                                            Dollars cut over   Dollars cut in    Children losing   children who \n                                                 5 years       the fifth year    benefits in the    would lose  \n                                                                   (2000)           year 2000       benefits in \n                                                                                                   the year 2000\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAFDC......................................  $12.8 billion...  $3.7 billion....  1.7 million (3-5            18.1\n                                                                                 million in                     \n                                                                                 later years).                  \nSSI for children..........................  $12.1 billion...  $5.5 billion....  516,000.........            67.0\nFoster Care and Adoption Assistance.......  $5.5 billion....  $1.7 billion....  111,000.........            26.0\nSchool Lunches............................  $2 billion......  $510 million....  2.22 million....             8.8\nChild Care................................  $2.5 billion....  $612 million....  378,000.........            24.0\nChild and Adult Care Food Program.........  $4.6 billion....  $1.1 billion....  1,048,000.......            50.0\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       This assault on America's children is also an assault on \n     America's future. The millions of infants and toddlers who \n     would be denied food necessary for their physical and \n     intellectual development in the years ahead are the ones \n     America will want to be computer programmers in 2017. The \n     millions of five-year-olds who would be denied any cash aid \n     for housing, food, or clothing are the ones we will want to \n     be learning in college or apprenticing in industry in 2010. \n     The thousands of battered 10-year-olds denied counseling and \n     foster care and adoptive homes are the ones we will want not \n     to be violent 16-year-olds in 2001. By ravaging the \n     childhoods of millions of American children, the House \n     simultaneously will be pillaging America's economic and \n     democratic future.\n       The assault on children is unique in its size and severity. \n     No other group, except for legal aliens, has been touched by \n     more than a small fraction of the cuts aimed at children. No \n     massively subsidized corporation has yet to see a dime \n     threatened. (In fact, a handful of big\n      businesses got a $1 billion gift from higher prices on \n     infant formula--and less formula purchased--when the House \n     Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities voted \n     down competitive bidding in the WIC program, a step USDA \n     says will cause ``increased malnutrition, growth stunting, \n     and iron deficiency anemia.'') No farmer has had his crop \n     subsidies cut. No military or civil service retiree--or \n     member of Congress--has seen his pay or health insurance \n     or retirement benefits cut. Defense contractors have been \n     given a gift of new and higher spending. Programs for poor \n     families have faced extra cuts in order to spare \n     traditional ``pork'' like visitors' centers or NRA-\n     sponsored efforts to teach school children to shoot guns.\n       The House majority has put almost all its cost-cutting \n     effort into slashing and burning its way through programs for \n     children and the parents, grandparents, foster parents, and \n     others who are struggling to care for them.\n       This is not what America voted for last November. This is \n     not what Americans want. This is not what America needs. \n     Nevertheless, in just 10 days in February, House committees \n     voted to slash these basic supports:\n       Food for children. The House Economic and Educational \n     Opportunities Committee voted to take away the guarantee that \n     low-income children can get free or reduced-price school \n     lunches and breakfasts. The plan indiscriminately lumps these \n     school-based programs together and cuts them by $2 billion \n     over five years. In a separate block grant, the committee \n     ended the guarantee of food for children in Head Start and \n     child care centers through the Child and Adult Care Food \n     Program and lumped this with the WIC program of food for poor \n     pregnant women and infants, the summer food program, and food \n     for the homeless, and cut the package by $5 billion over five \n     years. Cutting fat? Hardly. Experts estimate that hundreds of \n     millions fewer meals would be served to needy children in the \n     year 2000, thanks to the cut. And 60,000 Head Start \n     placements are likely to end because programs will have to \n     spend the Head Start money on food to replace the child care \n     food program cut for hundreds of thousands of children. \n     Sharing the pain? Hardly. No other food program has yet been \n     cut, whether the cafeteria for members of the House of \n     Representatives or the programs that feed the elderly. House \n     Speaker Gingrich has promised, as well as he should, not to \n     cut food programs for the elderly. But it is perverse to \n     treat food for seniors as deserving of protection but food \n     for children as a waste of national resources. We can afford \n     to feed both.\n       Income support for children. The House Ways and Means \n     Committee's Human Resources subcommittee voted to take away \n     the guarantee that poor children can get AFDC; voted to order \n     states to deny throughout childhood any aid to children born \n     out of wedlock to young mothers (even though the mother may \n     eventually requalify for aid); and voted to limit to five \n     years the receipt of welfare for children who might still \n     qualify despite the other rule changes. In the year 2000, \n     $3.7 billion will be taken away from poor children. Is this \n     aimed at parents and personal responsibility? Not really. The \n     plan cuts off children even when parents can get benefits, \n     cuts off families even when they have been working and \n     complying with all rules, and tells a child who has been \n     living with his low-income, elderly grandparents since birth \n     that she'll get no help after the age of five. Cutting fat? \n     No! In the year 2000, 1.7 million children who by definition \n     do not have enough for food or shelter are projected to lose \n     AFDC. Even more will lose help if states cut back further or \n     divert state and federal AFDC funds to other purposes. \n     Sharing the pain? Hardly.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will just read a couple of operative paragraphs.\n\n       In a ``revolution'' that so far has spared just about \n     everyone else, the House leadership and key committee \n     majorities have targeted America's children for the earliest, \n     broadest, and by far the deepest pain in budget cuts, program \n     restructuring, and rescissions. In less than two weeks key \n     committees and subcommittees have voted to cut $40 billion \n     from crucial child survival programs, and to end the federal \n     safety net for children and their families. This is a wholly \n     unshared sacrifice: the House seems to be postponing for a \n     later day, if ever, any contemplation of major cuts for other \n     constituencies. Savings from savage cuts in program for needy \n     and helpless children would be used to fund a new and \n     unnecessary defense build-up; to pay for a capital gains tax \n     cut of which 71 percent goes to the richest 1 percent of \n     Americans; and to reduce a tax on the richest 13 percent of \n     the elderly by $56 billion (over 10 years) when that tax goes \n     to pay part of Medicare's cost.\n\n  Mr. President, when I go to gatherings of senior citizens, they list \nchildren and their grandchildren right at the top of their concerns. We \ntalk about their concerns about block granting congregate dining and \nMeals on Wheels, which older Americans made sure did not happen in the \nHouse. The first thing they say to me is, ``Senator, we also want to \nmake sure that the school lunch program is not eliminated or cut back. \nWe want to make sure that there are not cuts in childhood nutrition \nprograms.''\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that we do not have, in this \nContract With America, we have not seen in any of these rescissions, we \nhave not seen in any of the action on the House side, one word about \noil company subsidies being cut, one word about coal company subsidies \nbeing cut, one word about pharmaceutical company subsidies being cut, \none word about the privileged, about the powerful, about Pentagon \ncontractors having to sacrifice at all.\n  Instead, those citizens who are being asked to sacrifice and tighten \ntheir belts are the very citizens who cannot--the children in this \ncountry. I suggest today that there is a reason for that. They are the \ncitizens who are not the heavy hitters. They are the citizens who are \nnot the well connected. They are the citizens who do not have all the \n [[Page S3552]] lobbyists. They are the citizens with the least amount \nof political power. I do not think we should be making decisions on \nthat basis.\n  How interesting it is, Mr. President, that we are willing to cut free \nlunches for children, but we are not willing to ban gifts and cut free \nlunches for Senators and Representatives. Let me repeat that once \nagain: How interesting it is that in the U.S. Congress, on the House \nside, there is a willingness to cut free lunches for hungry children, \nbut no commitment to have a gift ban and end free lunches for \nRepresentatives and Senators. That small example tells a large story \nabout what is going on here right now in the U.S. Congress.\n  Mr. President, people voted for change. But it always begged the \nquestion, What kind of change? With these cuts in nutrition programs, \nnow we have to have fear, in the schools of Ohio, Minnesota, \nMississippi, and all across the land, not that Johnny cannot read, but \nthat Johnny cannot eat. These cuts go beyond the goodness of people in \nthis country.\n  This is not what people voted for. And when we see the rescissions \ncoming over, and some of these block grants and mean-spirited cutbacks \nin child nutrition programs, and mean-spirited cuts in other children's \nprograms that will lead to more homeless, all I ask my colleagues in \nthe U.S. Senate to do today is to go on record with a mild sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution that we will not do anything that will increase \nmore hunger or homelessness among children.\n  Now, Mr. President, I say to my colleagues--because I have had this \namendment on the floor over and over again--that I do not think they \ncan hide any longer. First, at the beginning of the session, it was all \nabout prerogative, not on the Congressional Accountability Act.\n  I also heard about this type of rationale and even read in the New \nYork Times Magazine about this the other day in relation to gift ban. \nNo, we do not want to do that because we want to show that we are in \ncontrol. Or we do not want to give a Senator ink. I did not think we \nmade decisions on that basis, but the gift ban amendment was voted \ndown. This amendment was voted down also. Then I brought it up again on \nunfunded mandates--it was voted down. Then I brought it up as just a \nmotion to refer to the Budget Committee, not as an amendment to the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. Senator Hatch was on \nthe floor, a Senator whom I deeply respect, and he said, ``Look, \nSenator Wellstone, I really think that this is based upon your \nopposition to the balanced budget amendment, and these amendments are \nnot going to be amendments we will accept.'' Fine.\n  But now we have a bill that is sailing through the Senate. There is \ntremendous support for it. I support it. And all I am doing, since this \nbill is out here, is asking for a sense of the Senate. We see the front \npage stories; we hear it on the radio; we see it on television. \nSometimes, I think, Mr. President, if I had time, I would retrace the \nhunger tour that Senator Robert Kennedy took. I really would. I almost \nfeel as though Senators need to see it themselves.\n  All I am saying is, the writing is on the wall. We see where the deep \ncuts are. We see what its effects on children are going to be. \nEverybody agrees that these programs are harsh, that these programs \nwill have a very serious impact on children, the most vulnerable of our \ncitizens, the poor children of America.\n  I am saying, because all eyes are on the Senate to put a stop to \nthis, today is the day. Let Members go on record. We can do this on a \nnonpartisan basis. We should have Democrats and Republicans in a \nresounding vote go on record that we will not do anything to create \nmore hunger or homelessness among children. Let Members agree on that. \nLet Members agree when it comes to deficit reduction, there will be a \nstandard of fairness. Let Members agree we will represent children in \nAmerica and we will represent them well. Let Members agree this is a \npart of the priorities of what we stand for. Let Members put to rest \nthe fears that so many people have in this country that what is \nhappening right now in the Congress is a juggernaut that is mean \nspirited, that will hurt so many children in the country.\n  We, today, can go on record saying we are not going to do that. That \nis what I ask my colleagues to do.\n  Mr. President, I do not really understand. One of the things that has \nbeen interesting to me is the silence on the other side of the aisle. \nWe know rescissions are coming over here. We know the kind of cuts that \nhave already taken place in committee and on the floor in the House of \nRepresentatives. So there is not one Senator who can look me in the eye \nand say any longer, ``Senator Wellstone, you're crying Chicken \nLittle.'' That is what some of my colleagues had to say to me at the \nbeginning of the session.\n  But now the evidence is irrefutable and irreducible. We know the \nproposed cuts. We know what is coming over here. I do not think there \nis one Senator who can come out on the floor and say to me today ``You \nare wrong, we don't need to go on record with this statement, because \nno one will do this to children in America.'' The evidence is clear it \nis being done. Nor are there any excuses any longer about it being the \nbeginning of the session or about it being the constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget. It is all very clear.\n  One more time, Mr. President:\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that Congress should not \n     enact or adopt any legislation that will increase the number \n     of children who are hungry or homeless.\n\n  Is that too much to ask of my colleagues?\n  Moments in America for children, a Children's Defense Fund study last \nyear:\n  Every 5 seconds of the school day a student drops out of public \nschool;\n  Every 30 seconds a baby is born into poverty;\n  Every 2 minutes a baby is born at low birthweight;\n  Every 2 minutes a baby is born to a mother who had late or no \nprenatal care;\n  Every 4 minutes a child is arrested for an alcohol-related crime;\n  Every 7 minutes a child is arrested for a drug crime;\n  Every 2 hours a child is murdered;\n  Every 4 hours a child commits suicide.\n  Mr. President, we cannot savage children in America today. It is \nunconscionable, as I look at what the House of Representatives is doing \nright now, that we in the U.S. Congress seem to be willing to cut free \nlunches for poor children in America, but we have not yet passed a gift \nban that would end free lunches for Representatives and Senators. Today \nI ask the U.S. Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, to go on \nrecord, ``It is the sense of Congress that Congress should not enact or \nadopt any legislation that would increase the number of children who \nare hungry or homeless.''\n  How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Minnesota has \n23 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have no request for time on this side. We \nare prepared to yield our time back if the Senator from Minnesota is \nready to conclude the debate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before I do, and while my colleague is \non the floor, I would like to get his attention just for a moment. I \nwill be pleased to do so, and I understand the votes will all take \nplace after our caucus meetings this afternoon.\n  I have a lot of respect for the whip. I think we have a good \nfriendship, agree or disagree, on all issues. But I want my colleague \nto know why I continue to bring this amendment to the floor. It \ncertainly is not for ink because there has not been a lot of coverage \nfor this amendment.\n  I said at the beginning I was going to do it, and every day as I read \nthe papers and hear what is happening on the House side, I realize that \nit is really going to be up to the Senate, Republicans and Democrats \nalike, in a careful nonpartisan way to take certain action that I think \n90 percent of the people in the country want us to take.\n  Part of that action is to certainly not, for example, cut nutrition \nprograms for children. I refer the Senator from Mississippi to this \narticle today regarding Fayette, MS, and there were \n [[Page S3553]] two parts to this. There are wonderful interviews with \nsome of the parents and some of the women who work at the cafeteria and \nteachers who work with children about the tremendous fear.\n  The headline is ``School Fearful That `Johnny Can't Eat','' not \n``Johnny Can't Read.''\n  Congress' school lunch debate worries some in rural Mississippi. The \nSenator may have been off the floor. It starts out with this quote. I \nfind this quote to be, at a personal level--it moves me and really \nworries me.\n\n       ``I got a little boy come in here every morning and eats \n     everybody's food. Just licks the plate. And you know he's not \n     the only one,'' said Jeanette Reeves, eagle-eyed and dressed \n     in starched white, a cafeteria manager who doesn't have to \n     tell the children twice to eat all their lima beans. ``Many \n     of these children get their only meals right here at school. \n     Lord, it'll be cruel to change that.''\n\n  And then there are some teachers, I say to my colleague from \nMississippi. This is in Fayette, MS, and they say, ``Listen, these \nchildren just cannot learn, if they are not going to have at least one \ngood meal a day, they can't learn, they can't do well in school.''\n  Mr. President, we all say we are for the children in America. As I \nhave said on the floor before, I think that includes all God's \nchildren, not just our children, and that includes the children that \nare poor and, unfortunately, a sizable percentage of children in \nAmerica are poor.\n  I say to my colleague from Mississippi, if there is no further \ndebate, I would be pleased to yield back the remainder of my time, but \nI am hoping that in the absence of debate today that finally the Senate \nis willing to go on record:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress should not enact \n     or adopt any legislation that will increase the number of \n     children who are hungry or homeless.\n\n  I do not think there should be one Senator who should have a problem \nvoting for this. I think it is time we go on record as an institution. \nIf there is no debate, I take that silence as consent, and I yield back \nthe remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield back the remainder \nof time, but first, since my State has been referred to several times--\nthat is normal, if you want to make a case, it has been the practice \naround here for 20 years to attack Mississippi.\n  Frankly, we do not appreciate that. But also I just want to \nemphasize, there is a lot of misinformation out here. What we would \nlike to do is to take nutrition programs, a lot of other programs, \nreform them, get the fraud out of them where it exists--and it may not \nbe the case in the nutrition program--cut back on administration costs \nbecause there is a lot of waste and money going to the administration \nof these programs instead of getting to children, food for children, \nnutrition for children.\n  One of the points that people in Washington seem to miss is----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield? Can I ask the Senator before \nhe moves to table if I could have a couple minutes to respond?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am sure we can work that out.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LOTT. I just ask the Senators here, is there anybody among us who \nwould not like to see us find some savings in programs, maybe actually \nget more money to the children? What I understand is being proposed in \nthe House of Representatives actually with the block grants is that you \nwould get more money actually going for food to the children by cutting \nout the bureaucracy and the redtape.\n  It seems to me like that is a good idea: More flexibility for the \nStates, a better way, perhaps, being found to administer these \nprograms. The Governors believe that can happen--the Governor of my \nState, the Governor of Michigan.\n  So what we are talking about is a better program, a better deal that \nwill help more children. What we have been doing is we are feeding \nbureaucrats. How about if we feed the children instead?\n  What everybody is saying is we cannot change anything. ``Oh, no, \ndon't touch this one, don't touch that one.'' For 40 years this stuff \nhas been building up. It is a bureaucratic nightmare, with all kinds of \nwaste. It is time that we find a way to improve some of these programs. \nWe believe we can do that. That is all we are seeking with these \nnutrition programs. There is a tremendous amount of misinformation out \nthere on this and other programs.\n  Last week we had debate on the balanced budget amendment. They said, \n``Oh, we don't need this. Let's just go and find a way to reduce the \ndeficit.'' And then the list begins: ``Oh, but, you can't touch this \nprogram, you can't even improve it, you can't limit the rate of \nincrease in spending on programs.''\n  That is all we are talking about. Most of these programs we are not \ntalking about cutting a nickel; we are talking about controlling the \nrate of growth. So here they come, the same crowd we heard in the \neighties: ``Oh, don't cut this one, don't cut that one, don't cut the \nLow Income Energy Assistance Program,'' that gives $19 million for air \nconditioning in the State of Florida, and I am sure a lot of money for \nair conditioning in my State.\n  We all have our little program and say, ``Don't touch this one.'' You \ncannot have it both ways. You cannot find ways to begin to control \nspending and reduce the deficit without looking at every program, every \nagency, every department and seeing if we cannot do a better job. If we \nsay do not touch any program, we will never get anything done.\n  I did not want to start a full debate here, but I had to at least get \nthat on the record. I think what we are talking about is better \nprograms, less bureaucracy, and more funds for people who really need \nthe help.\n  Does the Senator wish to use additional time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I might just ask for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Since the Senator yielded back his time, I will yield back \n5 minutes from our time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Let me just be really clear about, first of all, what this vote is \non. I do take exception to some of what my colleague had to say. But I \nam not even debating today whether or not some of what has been \nproposed in block grants will work better or not. I take what the \nSenator has said to be said in good faith.\n  What this amendment says is the Senate goes on record that we will \nnot enact or adopt any legislation which will increase the number of \nchildren hungry or homeless.\n  So the Senator from Mississippi would agree with me on that. He has \nnot proposed that we do make cuts that would increase hunger and \nhomelessness.\n  This does not cast judgment on any particular proposal. Given what is \nmoving through and given some of the discussion, let us go on record \nthat we are not going to do anything that would do that. I should think \nthe Senator would agree. That is my first point. To vote for this means \nthat Senators are willing to go on record saying certainly one thing \nthat is important to us is not to increase any hunger or homelessness \namong children. That is all this says. That is point one.\n  Point two--and I say this with some sense of sadness to my \ncolleague--actually there is a considerable amount of empirical data \nabout the cuts. I have before me a Department of Agriculture study, and \nactually there are many other studies that are now coming out about the \ncuts that are being proposed, cuts I say to my colleague, in child \nnutrition programs State by State. Alabama, school-age children, fiscal \nyear 1996, $1,972,000; preschool children, $15,098,000; Mississippi--\nbut I will get to Minnesota so you do not think it is just \nMississippi--$2,421,000 for school-age children and $14 million cuts \nfor preschool children in nutrition programs. In my State of Minnesota, \ncuts of $1,627,000 for school-age children and $15,189,000 for \npreschool children.\n  That is why I am worried about this, I say to my colleague from \nMississippi. So, first, there is no one any longer who is really \narguing we are not facing deep cuts that will have a harmful effect on \nchildren. But, even if I was to agree with what my colleague just said, \nthat is not what this amendment is about. We should together vote for \n [[Page S3554]] this because then we make it clear that regardless of \nour disagreement about specific policies, one thing we are in agreement \non is that the Senate as an institution certainly is not going to take \nany action that would increase hunger or homelessness among children. I \ndo not know how my colleagues can continue to vote against this.\n  Finally, I would like to say this by way of an apology because I \nagree with my colleague from Mississippi about this. I think this is a \npowerful story, but in no way, shape or form did I intend to pick on \nMississippi. I believe that one of the things we do over and over again \nis that we look everywhere but home. It is so easy for those of us in \nPennsylvania or Minnesota to focus on Mississippi, and I fully \nunderstand the sentiment of my colleague from Mississippi. \nUnfortunately, Mr. President, I say to my colleague, I can point to \nchildren that are struggling in Minnesota. I am sure that the Presiding \nOfficer can in Pennsylvania. The kind of issues that concern me are all \nacross the United States of America, not just in the State of \nMississippi, which, indeed, is a wonderful State. But this is a \nwonderful story because it puts faces, it puts real people, it puts \nreal children behind all the statistics, and that is why I use this as \nan example.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi. I really hope I \nwill have support from colleagues on this.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield back the remainder of our time, and I move to table \nthe amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, does the Chair have business pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota [Mr. Wellstone] is recognized to offer an amendment on which \nthere shall be 90 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, yesterday, I had reserved time for \nanother slot and had considered an amendment, which is the gift ban \namendment, and again the connection I make over and over again today, \nit just strikes me as being more than ironic; I think it is \nunconscionable that, apparently, as I look at what the House of \nRepresentatives is doing right now, we are willing to cut free lunches \nfor children but we are not willing to pass a gift ban that ends free \nlunches for Senators and Representatives.\n  However, Mr. President, while I think there has to be action on this, \nI look forward to working with my colleagues, Senator Levin from \nMichigan, Senator Feingold, Senator Lautenberg, and certainly the \nmajority leader, who has gone on record in favor of this. So this \namendment will be in the Chamber, though not today, and we will have a \nvote on it. I will not propose this amendment today.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to say to the Senator from Minnesota and \nremind all of our colleagues that the majority leader, Senator Dole, \nhas indicated this issue will be addressed. He is working on \nlegislation in the gift ban area, and I do expect that we will have a \nvote in this area in the not too distant future. So rest assured, we \nare going to take up this issue.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Mississippi, \nand I would just say I appreciate that. Rest assured, I will be out in \nthe Chamber with other colleagues with this amendment and keep pushing \nthis, and hopefully we will all do this together.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this time I had the right to offer an \namendment. I do not intend to offer the amendment at this time and \nwithdraw that right.\n\n\n                           the oregon option\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, recently, the State of Oregon and \nseveral Federal agencies signed a memorandum of understanding to create \na new partnership which will test unique methods of delivering \nGovernment services in a better and more efficient manner. When this \nrevolutionary partnership, called the Oregon option, is fully \nimplemented, Federal grants or transfers to State and local governments \nin Oregon will be based on results rather than compliance with \nprocedures.\n  I believe that this project has the potential to vastly improve \nintergovernmental service delivery in my State and may well prove to be \na national model for future governmental partnerships. For this reason, \nI am pleased the managers of the pending legislation, the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1995, have included in their bill my sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution urging the Federal Government to continue to be an \nactive partner in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I would specifically like to thank Senators Roth and \nGlenn for their assistance and would also like to thank Senator Nunn \nfor his help in including my amendment.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of this important \nlegislation, I am pleased that the Senate will soon pass the Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1995. I am a longtime supporter of the Paperwork \nReduction Act which seeks to reduce the Federal paperwork burdens \nimposed on the public.\n  I have been particularly concerned about the effects of the Federal \nregulatory burden on small businesses throughout my years in Congress. \nAmericans spend billions of hours a year filling out forms, surveys, \nquestionnaires, and other information requests for the Federal \nGovernment at a cost of several hundred billions dollars. Increasing \npaperwork burdens force small businesses to redirect scarce resources \naway from activities that might otherwise allow them to provide better \nservices to their customers or provide additional jobs. America's small \nbusinesses are the backbone of our economy and, as such we need to \nensure that they are not crippled by regulatory burdens that hinder \ntheir ability to compete in the increasingly competitive global \nmarketplace.\n  I am also pleased to cosponsor an amendment offered by Senator Levin \nto eliminate or modify over 200 statutory reporting requirements that \nhave outlived their usefulness. This is an issue that Senator Levin and \nI have worked on for a number of years in our capacity as chairman and \nranking minority member of the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on \nOversight of Government Management. The Levin amendment is consistent \nwith efforts by the administration and the Congress to reinvent \nGovernment and make it more efficient. It is based on a bill Senator \nLevin and I introduced last Congress which CBO estimated would reduce \nagencies' reporting costs by $5 to $10 million annually. The \nlegislation was the product of more than a year's worth of discussions \nwith Government agencies and congressional committees.\n  Examples of the types of reports that the amendment will eliminate or \nmodify include a provision to eliminate an annual Department of Energy \nreporting requirement on naval petroleum and oil shale reserves \nproduction. The same data included in this report is included in the \nnaval petroleum reserves annual report. Another provision would modify \nthe Department of Labor's annual report to include the Department's \naudited financial statements and, thereby, eliminate the need for a \nseparate annual report for all money received and disbursed by the \nDepartment.\n  The Levin amendment is consistent with the goals of the Paperwork \nReduction Act. It is intended to reduce the paperwork burdens placed on \nFederal agencies and streamline the information that flows from these \nagencies to the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to make a few statements about the \noverall legislation. The bill before us contains provisions to maximize \nthe use of information collected by the Federal Government and keep in \nplace the 1980 act's goal of reducing the paperwork burdens imposed on \nthe public through \n [[Page S3555]] an annual governmentwide paperwork reduction goal of 5 \npercent.\n  It reauthorizes the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \n[OIRA], within the Office of Management and Budget [OMB], which \nimplements the act and requires each Federal agency to thoroughly \nreview proposed paperwork requirements to make sure they are truly \nneeded and have a practical utility. It also enhances public \nparticipation in reviewing paperwork requirements.\n  The bill clarifies that the act applies to all Government-sponsored \npaperwork, eliminating any confusion over the coverage of so-called \nthird party burdens--those imposed by one private party on another due \nto a Federal regulation--caused by the U.S. Supreme Court's 1989 \ndecision in Dole versus United Steelworkers of America. This decision \ncreated a loophole for agencies to avoid public comment and OMB review. \nFlorida Gov. Lawton Chiles, who authorized the Paperwork Reduction Act \nwhen he was in the Senate, filed on amicus brief with the Supreme Court \narguing that no such exemption for third party paperwork burdens where \nintended when the act was created. Unfortunately, the Court held that \nthe plain meaning of the statute could not support such a finding.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the Governmental Affairs Committee \naccepted an amendment I offered in committee to make changes to the \ninformation technology provisions of the bill and allow the opportunity \nfor information technology reform later this Congress. This is an \nimportant issue that warrants separate legislative consideration. In \nclosing, I want to commend Senators Roth, Glenn, and Nunn for their \nwork in this area. The bill enjoys broad bipartisan support and I hope \nmy colleagues will move expeditiously to vote on final passage.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/07/senate-section/article/S3547-4", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL 2:15 P.M.\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

OREGON OPTION PROPOSAL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Federal, State and local governments are dealing with \n     increasingly complex problems which require the delivery of \n     many kinds of social services at all levels of government;\n       (2) historically, Federal programs have addressed the \n     Nation's problems by providing categorical assistance with \n     detailed requirements relating to the use of funds which are \n     often delivered by State and local governments;\n       (3) although the current approach is one method of service \n     delivery, a number of problems exist in the current \n     intergovernmental structure that impede effective delivery of \n     vital services by State and local governments;\n       (4) it is more important than ever to provide programs that \n     respond flexibly to the \n      [[Page S3562]] needs of the Nation's States and communities, \n     reduce the barriers between programs that impede Federal, \n     State and local governments' ability to effectively deliver \n     services, encourage the Nation's Federal, State and local \n     governments to be innovative in creating programs that meet \n     the unique needs of the people in their communities while \n     continuing to address national goals, and improve the \n     accountability of all levels of government by better \n     measuring government performance and better meeting the needs \n     of service recipients;\n       (5) the State and local governments of Oregon have begun a \n     pilot project, called the Oregon Option, that will utilize \n     strategic planning and performance-based management that may \n     provide new models for intergovernmental social service \n     delivery;\n       (6) the Oregon Option is a prototype of a new \n     intergovernmental relations system, and it has the potential \n     to completely transform the relationships among Federal, \n     State and local governments by creating a system of \n     intergovernmental service delivery and funding that is based \n     on measurable performance, customer satisfaction, prevention, \n     flexibility, and service integration; and\n       (7) the Oregon Option has the potential to dramatically \n     improve the quality of Federal, State and local services to \n     Oregonians.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Oregon Option project has the potential to improve \n     intergovernmental service delivery by shifting accountability \n     from compliance to performance results and that the Federal \n     Government should continue in its partnership with the State \n     and local governments of Oregon to fully implement the Oregon \n     Option.\n\n     SEC. 105.

Mr. President, in the 21 years I have served in this body, \nI have never seen the level of partisanship that we are seeing on the \nbalanced budget amendment. So maybe I should not have been shocked last \nFriday to see my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Lott, blatantly \nmisrepresent my words of 1994. Clearly, his only purpose was to further \ndivide the American public and to tarnish the reputation of Senators \nwho have only sought to pass the best amendment possible.\n  Senator Lott quoted me as saying, Mr. President, and I will quote it \nverbatim from the Record; this is what Senator Lott said I said:\n\n       I hear so much about ``if 40-some-odd Governors can operate \n     a balanced budget, why can't the Federal Government.''\n       * * * I operated under it.\n\n  When I said ``I,'' Mr. President, as Governor:\n\n       It worked.\n       * * * I think implementation of this amendment will work. I \n     think we can make it work.\n       * * * I do not understand why it takes a brain surgeon to \n     understand how you operate a budget the way the States do.\n       * * * this is an opportunity to pass a balanced budget \n     amendment that will work and will give us a financially sound \n     future, not only for ourselves but for our children and our \n     grandchildren.\n\n  End of the quote that Senator Lott put in the Record.\n  To that I say, Mr. President, read the full statement, and the \nfallacy will become clear.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both of my floor statements from last \nyear be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statements were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n             [From the Congressional Record, Feb. 25, 1994]\n\n       Mr. Ford. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada \n     for allowing me this time.\n       I support a balanced budget amendment and always have. The \n     borrow and spend policies of the past must not continue. We \n     all know that. The ability to expand our economy and provide \n     job opportunities for this and future generations, much less \n     provide for a nation that can function beyond simply \n     servicing its debt, absolutely depends upon bringing the \n     deficit under control. I think that my friend from Illinois \n     would agree with this sentiment and I agree in principle with \n     his amendment. I think that the Senator has done the Nation a \n     great service by his tireless work on behalf of this serious \n     matter. However, there is room for improvement in most things \n     including, the original language of Senate Joint Resolution \n     41.\n       It is the job and the responsibility of the Congress to \n     control the spending of our Nation. Unfortunately, we have \n     abandoned this role, to a large degree, by running large \n     budget deficits during normal times. By normal times I mean \n     not during war, or recessions. This practice is not only \n     fiscally irresponsible, but with the huge debt we are now \n     passing along to our children, it has become morally \n     irresponsible as well. We as a congress and, being the \n     representatives of the people, as a nation must begin to \n     regain control of our spending policies. We need something \n     that forces us to do this. An amendment to the Constitution \n     would do just that. While one law can be changed by passing \n     another law, this legislation would make fiscal discipline \n     mandatory.\n       However, the Congress must not pass the buck once again by \n     relinquishing control of the budget all together. \n     Congressional control must be maintained and our amendment \n     does just that. Deficit spending by itself is not the \n     problem. The problem is chronic deficit spending in good \n     times not just bad ones. Furthermore, we are not borrowing at \n     the present time to rebuild infrastructure by building roads, \n     airports, or an information super highway. Nor have we been \n     borrowing for the last 30 years to bring a faltering economy \n     out of recession or prepare for war. We have had the need \n     from time to time during that period and during these \n     periods, borrowing represents sound fiscal policy. During \n     times of war or economic downturn, these policies help the \n     economy and help our Nation as a whole. But this is not what \n     we have been doing at all. What we have been doing is \n     borrowing to pay the interest on previous debt.\n       Let me put this in terms that every American can \n     understand. When a company decides to expand or buy more \n     efficient equipment, it generally borrows the money, knowing \n     that this investment will more than pay for itself in the \n     future. The profit earned is used first to pay off the loan \n     and the extra is kept as income. The key word in all of this \n     is invest. Investment as our President has been saying for \n     some time is good, it provides benefits in years to come. We \n     invest a great deal of money on the Federal level, upwards of \n     $200 billion. This money is well spent and will pay dividends \n     to our children and their children. When we build a highway, \n     it increases economic efficiency and activity, real dividends \n     that pay off in real jobs and increased incomes. Congress \n     should not cut off its nose to spite its face. Our amendment \n     protects this vital investment portion of spending. It keeps \n     responsibility with the Congress and gives us the flexibility \n     that we need during hard times and the discipline we need \n     during the good ones to manage the budget in a responsible \n     manner.\n       Let me get back to my example of a business borrowing to \n     expand or upgrade its facilities. Bad fiscal policy is when \n     all of the profits earned from the improvements are frittered \n     away on other expenses, and the loan is never repaid. When \n     this happens, the situation goes downhill fast. If the belt \n     is not tightened and the loan is not paid off, the company, \n     no matter what, will go bankrupt. It can borrow more money \n     for a time but eventually it must pay off its loans or the \n     banks will eventually turn that company down. We are a nation \n     that is getting perilously close to that last loan. We are \n     borrowing not to invest for growth, but instead simply and \n     irresponsibly to pay off interest on past loans. All the \n     while our debt continues to mount and we have nothing to show \n     for it. This is the type of behavior that must be stopped and \n     our amendment is the prescription for this sickness. It stops \n     the bad borrowing but keeps the Congress in control of \n     investing in our Nation's future.\n       Our Founding Fathers placed the country's purse strings \n     under the explicit control of the Congress. Our amendment \n     keeps the control here. The judicial branch of Government has \n     no business deciding on what program should be cut or what \n     revenue should be raised. That is our responsibility. Our \n     amendment keeps that responsibility right where it belongs. I \n     won't talk on this point too long because, I think there is \n     complete agreement among us on this point. However, I cannot \n     stress enough that we in the Congress must make the hard \n     choices, and if we do not our amendment calls for an internal \n     solution. Should this happen, this legislation calls for \n     uniform cuts; with everyone and every program paying equally. \n     That is fair and just and it would be a congressional action.\n       Let me speak on another matter of grave concern to many of \n     our citizens. That is the sanctity of the Social Security \n     system. Many years ago, our Nation made a pact with its \n     people to help them in retirement, whether that be in old age \n     or by disability. Our amendment respects that agreement, in \n     fact it reinforces it, makes it stronger, safer and more \n     secure. This amendment has a lot to do with responsible \n     action and nowhere is that needed more than on dealing with \n     Social Security. It is exempt from our amendment, thus \n     securing and fortifying its position as a separate trust \n     fund. Neither receipts nor outlays will be counted as part of \n     the budget under this provision. As my friend, and colleague \n     from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] has pointed out, ``the Social \n     Security system is not causing the deficit.'' Its revenues \n     and surpluses should not be used to mask the deficit nor \n     should its outlays be counted as part of expenditures. Our \n     proposal protects the sanctity of this most vital program.\n       In closing, I would like to stress just how strongly I \n     favor a balanced budget amendment, but it must be the right \n     amendment and our amendment is it. I have supported and \n     continue to support my colleague from Illinois in his efforts \n     to control Federal spending, however, our proposed changes \n     make this a more honest and more workable amendment. \n     Surpluses in trust funds whether it be for airports, Social \n     Security or highways, will not be used to mask the true size \n     of the deficit. And, equally important, it will allow \n     Congress to maintain the flexibility \n      [[Page S3571]] needed during wars or recessions while \n     protecting our capital investments and curtailing our \n     practice of borrowing to pay interest on past loans.\n       Mr. President, I do not think anyone in this body with \n     certainty can tell us what will happen in the future if we \n     have a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution. I do \n     not think we can say with certainty. And so with uncertainty, \n     we get all the horror stories. And all the horror stories if \n     this does not pass; something is going to happen. If it does \n     pass, some other things are going to happen.\n       The implementing legislation that is required, if and when \n     a balanced budget amendment passes, will give us some idea \n     and eliminate some of the uncertainties, but that will be the \n     legislative branch prerogative to pass the implementing \n     legislation. So I wish to kind of put a little oil on the \n     water if I can as to all the uncertainties we have been \n     hearing about in the last few days.\n       We also hear the horror stories that if the Simon amendment \n     passes, the courts will become the legislative body. Well, we \n     scurried around and I guess now you have the Danforth \n     amendment included in the Simon amendment, because the horror \n     story was that the courts would then become the legislative \n     body of this land. They would tell us what new taxes to \n     impose and what programs to cut or what all new taxes and no \n     programs cut or programs cut and no new taxes. So under the \n     Simon original amendment the courts would have had \n     jurisdiction over the legislative body. So we scurry around \n     and find an amendment that will basically eliminate it. Not \n     good enough. Not good enough because the Reid amendment says \n     only the legislative body.\n       Well, then we hear we have no way to say to those of us who \n     will make a vote, have discipline because the courts will \n     not. So whichever way you go, you can find somebody on the \n     other side.\n       It reminds me when I was president of a civic organization, \n     and we had a question that was bothersome to me. I turned to \n     the legal counsel for the civic organization, and I said, \n     ``Which way should we go on this?'' He said, ``Mr. President, \n     go either way and we will make a heck of a case out of it.'' \n     And so that is what I think we find here. Go either way and \n     we will make a case on it.\n       We eliminate the worry of the courts telling the \n     legislative body that is elected by the people what to do and \n     what not to do, and that was our idea which was finally \n     accepted by the so-called Simon amendment.\n       In 1983, the Social Security Program was in horrible shape. \n     Everyone in this body understands that we were in real \n     trouble with Social Security. But we all came together in a \n     bipartisan way and corrected the problem with Social Security \n     in outyears. Now they say the only way that you can save \n     Social Security is a balanced budget.\n       Well, we are still collecting out of my check every month, \n     and I suggest my distinguished colleague from Illinois is \n     having his taken out every month. I do not know what that has \n     to do with a balanced budget except if it is out there you \n     can use it to help balance the budget.\n       So what the Reid amendment says is that after we have gone \n     through the 1983 labor to fix the Social Security question, \n     we have included in this amendment that we would not touch \n     Social Security. On this floor you hear it. ``Don't touch \n     Social Security.'' Now we are trying to say a balanced budget \n     saves it. That is the only way because they do not have this \n     exclusion in this amendment. In the cloakrooms you hear talk, \n     ``We have to save Social Security.'' And over the lunch table \n     we hear it, ``We should not destroy Social Security.'' So the \n     Reid amendment or resolution has taken care of that problem.\n       Do you know something, Mr. President? You can sympathize \n     with me over this a little bit. I have heard for days now, \n     and really for years: If 40-some-odd Governors can operate \n     under a balanced budget, why cannot Federal Government? Well, \n     Mr. President, I had the privilege, as you did, given me by \n     the people of my State to serve as Governor. I even had the \n     line-item veto. And the Kentucky Constitution states that the \n     Governor--nobody else--the Governor must reduce expenditures \n     if it is determined that the State would have a shortfall. \n     But if you want to raise taxes, you have to call a special \n     session for the purpose of raising taxes.\n       Now we hear that we do not want to operate like Governors. \n     We just want to use them as operating under a balanced \n     budget. We are going to give you an opportunity to say that \n     you do not want to operate like Governors. You just want to \n     use them as an image out there that operates under a balanced \n     budget because Governors must operate under a balanced \n     budget. Then we think that is good. But we do not want the \n     Federal Government to do that.\n       Let us follow the State procedure, if it works. And it is \n     simple. I operated, as I said earlier, under this procedure. \n     We had an operating account and a capital account. I never \n     vetoed a budget. I never exercised the line-item veto in 4 \n     years. And I left $300 million in surplus. Pretty good, I \n     thought, a lot better than we are doing here. We had the \n     operating account and we had the bond issue. We have T bills \n     here. Whatever the legislative process is, after the \n     amendment is approved or disapproved, if it is, right now \n     they are a little bit light. They call our amendment light. \n     But they are light in votes, and they are struggling now to \n     try to figure out a way to get some more. They are condemning \n     our proposal because it has, in my opinion, more common sense \n     in it than theirs.\n       So we had our operating account. We had our bond issue. We \n     had the payments to be made out of the operating account. We \n     paid it. We had a balanced budget. We had a surplus. Our \n     estimates were pretty good.\n       If we had not gotten the agreement, as we now have, to vote \n     next Tuesday at 3 o'clock, and then 4 hours later on the \n     second amendment, we would have had the opportunity to vote \n     on each one of those amendments to the Simon amendment, \n     because many in this Chamber felt the Simon amendment did not \n     include the exclusion of the courts. That is one. Social \n     Security is another. You would have the operating and capital \n     construction accounts to vote on up or down. And we would \n     have had to vote on each one of those separately. We would \n     delay moving towards a balanced budget, and the delays would \n     have been, I think, helpful to those that oppose a balanced \n     budget.\n       Mr. President, I interrupted the distinguished Senator from \n     Illinois [Mr. Simon], awhile ago when he was reading from the \n     newspaper that this amendment is just a stalking horse to \n     give cover to those who want to vote for a constitutional \n     amendment that probably will not pass, and then that gives \n     them a reason to vote against Senator Simon.\n       Let me clear everybody's mind. I am for a balanced budget \n     amendment. And I intend to vote for a balanced budget \n     amendment, and maybe two before next week is over. But some \n     ideas around here might just be worth looking at for a \n     moment. There might be a moment. If you look into the future \n     and how we are going to operate, this may be a pretty decent \n     idea to try.\n       I hear that, ``Oh, well, if we are going to vote for this, \n     we will not have to do anything for 7 years.'' I thought we \n     were under a budget constraint now. I thought we had caps on \n     our budget now. I thought this was the third straight year of \n     deficit decline, unprecedented in the last 31 years since \n     Harry Truman. I thought we would have to continue to do that \n     even though we required 2001 to have the budget balanced or \n     begin that process.\n       I think this is a way we can do this to accommodate most \n     people, rather than take the position that it is this way or \n     nothing. I come from the State of Henry Clay. Henry Clay was \n     a great compromiser. Henry Clay described compromise as \n     ``negotiating hurt''--negotiating hurt. You had to give up \n     something most of the time that you really did not want to, \n     and it hurt to give it up. But for the sake of progress, for \n     the sake of bringing a consensus together, compromise is a \n     pretty good thing.\n       So, we offer to the colleagues in the Senate the ability to \n     say, we are not going to disturb Social Security. I do not \n     care what you say about a balanced budget as long as you take \n     it out of your paycheck and put it into a Social Security \n     account. That is where it belongs.\n       We talk about capital construction of the highways. We are \n     taxing now and not spending it. We are not spending it. We \n     have billions; a $15-, $17-, $18-billion surplus in the \n     highway account. We are not spending it.\n       Talk about airports capital construction; 10 percent of \n     every ticket that is purchased goes into the airport \n     improvement trust fund. There is $7, $8 billion in there not \n     building airports. What is a balanced budget going to do for \n     that? We are already charging the tax.\n       We can have our operating account. We can have our capital \n     account. Some say that we ought to balance the Federal budget \n     like we do our house account or our budget at home. We have \n     an operating account at home. That operating account is the \n     amount of income we have. We buy a car.\n       We can buy a car, maybe not a luxury car, but one within \n     our means and what we can pay for. We decide we want to buy a \n     house, and it may not be a mansion, but it is what we can pay \n     for. What we should have in an operating account is our \n     income. We make those payments on those capital investments \n     that we have, and we keep our operating account balanced. I \n     do not see anything wrong with it. If Governors operate that \n     way--and some are beating their chests saying if Governors \n     can do it, we can do it--here is how Governors do it. I \n     operated under it. I understand it. I had a veto of the \n     budget; I had the line-item veto; all of those, when I was \n     Governor. We operated out of an operating account and out of \n     a capital account. It was in the budget. We made our payments \n     and we had a surplus.\n       I do not understand why that is not at least tickling the \n     interest of some folks. But we are rigid right now. ``It is \n     ours or nothing.'' Well, you may just get nothing, with a \n     capital ``N.'' And you are light right now on votes. If you \n     are light on votes, why not look at something that will be \n     workable, because you will get some votes for this one. With \n     the others, you might just pass this amendment. But the way \n     you are going now, you are light by several votes.\n       My colleague keeps talking about taxes. I do not know that \n     this brings new taxes. That one does. That is all I have \n     heard is ``the courts imposing taxes.'' Yes; we will have to \n     pay taxes. For the Simons resolution, the report was $570 in \n     new taxes per individual in my State. If you want it, I will \n     get it and give it to you. Everybody quotes the paper around \n     here. I will give you an article out of the paper. They do \n     not necessarily have to be true, but we sure do quote them. \n     So all of this propaganda is being put out.\n        [[Page S3572]] So I hope that those who are so rigidly \n     stuck to one amendment could at least give this one a little \n     read; look at it a little bit. We take care of depression; we \n     take care of war; we take care of those things. I think it is \n     important that we have the opportunity to put something in \n     place. If you are going to tinker with the Constitution now, \n     give the Constitution something that will work. Give it \n     something that you think would have a chance of working. And \n     then the implementing legislation will set up the procedure \n     whereby we use the operating account, and what is the capital \n     construction, and how do we pay for it? Do we use T-bills for \n     capital and pay the bills off?\n       We heard the Senator from Illinois say that it was Albert \n     Gore, Sr. that said pay as you go and put on new taxes, and \n     President Eisenhower was saying let us bond it and pay the \n     bonds off. That was a difference of opinion then. So we taxed \n     the payoff; rather than having an operating fund to pay off \n     capital construction, pay off the bond issue.\n       So I hope that we will give this very serious \n     consideration. I will have other things to say before the \n     vote comes next Tuesday, and I welcome any cosponsors. We \n     have had many come to us this morning to talk about it. We \n     have picked up a good many votes today. We are further away \n     from passing this amendment than Senator Simon is, but if we \n     combined our efforts, we would pass it.\n       You say I am a stalking-horse? No; I am not a stalking-\n     horse. You say I am trying to give people cover. No; they are \n     not getting cover from this one. We have a legitimate \n     proposal to be given to the colleagues in the U.S. Senate, \n     that they can go back home and say: I voted for a \n     Constitutional amendment to balance the budget that is \n     doable.\n       The other one is, you either eliminate or increase taxes, \n     or both. I do not think this one puts you in the posture of \n     raising taxes. That is a great, great difference, in my \n     opinion. I have been listening very carefully as to raising \n     taxes and how much new tax it is going to cost to pay for the \n     Simon resolution, and I think it is time we take a step back \n     and look at an opportunity now to have a balanced budget \n     amendment. I do not have the words to get you out on the edge \n     of the seat or the ability to say, boy, that is it. I just do \n     not have that ability.\n       I do believe sincerely that we have an amendment that is \n     important, an amendment that should be considered, and maybe, \n     just maybe, we can put our two groups together and say that \n     we have a resolution here that could be doable; it is \n     workable, and we could vote for a balanced budget, and the \n     future of Senator Simon's unborn grandchildren will be saved.\n       I yield the floor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n             [From the Congressional Record, Mar. 1, 1994]\n\n       The Presiding Officer. The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford] \n     is recognized for 10 minutes.\n       Mr. Ford. Mr. President, I have but a few minutes to speak \n     this morning on behalf of the Reid-Ford-Feinstein balanced \n     budget amendment. So I will concentrate my remarks this \n     morning on trust.\n       The public trusts the Congress to keep the Nation's \n     finances in order. Nowhere is that agreement and that trust \n     more evident or more important than in governing the Social \n     Security trust fund.\n       In the debate over our amendment and the Simon amendment, \n     honesty and protection of the trust fund have played a very \n     big role. Right now, surpluses in the trust funds are being \n     used to hide the true amount of the deficit. The biggest \n     example of this is in Social Security, but it is by no means \n     alone in this distinction.\n       During the 1980's, we allowed the Federal trust funds to \n     run up huge surpluses. We would collect a gasoline tax to \n     fund highway construction but then not spend it all on \n     highways, thus creating an accounting surplus. The problem \n     is, we did spend money elsewhere creating masked deficit and \n     budgetary illusions.\n       The Simon amendment will allow us to continue to do this. I \n     have a speech in my folder that I made back in October of \n     1987 that addressed this very issue. This particular speech \n     dealt with the Aviation trust fund. At the time, it \n     represented a $6 billion surplus.\n       Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that that is only \n     peanuts when compared to Social Security. According to OMB, \n     from 1985, when the Social Security System started to run a \n     surplus, to 1993, it singlehandedly covered up $366 billion \n     in Government red ink. Social Security covered up $366 \n     billion in Government red ink.\n       If you think that is bad, wait until we look to the future. \n     From 1994 through the year 2001, the date that Senator \n     Simon's amendment would likely take effect, CBO projects \n     another $703 billion in budgetary chicanery, for a grand \n     total of $1.69 trillion worth of deception.\n       When compared with that, the deficit hidden by the other \n     trust funds are small potatoes--only another $35 to $40 \n     billion. Pretty soon though, as we have heard in the past, it \n     adds up to real money. We pat ourselves on the back and claim \n     to cut spending and do what is right for our electorate, all \n     the while our Social Security trust fund is full of IOU's.\n       Well, I, and those who support our amendment, mean to do \n     something about that. Our amendment respects the pact our \n     Nation made with its people many years ago. It reinforces it, \n     makes it stronger, safer, and more secure. Social Security is \n     exempt from our amendment, thus securing and fortifying its \n     position as a separate trust fund. If you do not believe me, \n     just listen to the Gray Panthers, and they will tell you \n     themselves. I have here three letters to that effect. AARP, \n     the National Alliance for Senior Citizens, and the National \n     Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, all \n     endorse Social Security's treatment under this amendment.\n       Other trust funds will be treated honestly as well. They \n     will be considered as a part of the capital budget that \n     invests in infrastructure and development. Building highways \n     and airports pays dividends in the future through higher \n     productivity and job opportunity and growth. Social Security \n     and these other trust funds did not cause the deficit, and \n     under our amendment they will not be used to hide the deficit \n     either. This is honest budgeting and a workable balanced \n     budget amendment.\n       Mr. President, time is short and a vote on the Reid-Ford-\n     Feinstein balanced budget amendment is near. Unfortunately, I \n     fear that it is not near passage but defeat. Standing beside \n     that defeat will be a good faith effort of those who are \n     truly concerned about the world that we leave for future \n     generations. Standing beside that defeat will be the last \n     attempt of this Congress to face reality and tackle an ever-\n     crippling debt and deficit problem. Standing beside that \n     defeat will be faith in Government. I support the efforts of \n     my friend and colleague from Illinois to take on this \n     persistent fiscal dishonesty, but his version of the \n     amendment will go down to defeat as well.\n       The Reid-Ford-Feinstein amendment is the only amendment \n     that could stand the chance of final passage. We all know \n     that. Yet standing by the defeat of yet another balanced \n     budget will be my colleagues from the other side of the \n     aisle. Instead of getting what they could, they will go home \n     proud of taking the supposed moral high ground. If that is \n     what they want, they can have it. What I want and what 70 \n     percent of our Nation's people want is a sound financial \n     future. What they will get is more of the same under the \n     Simon amendment, for standing tall at the end of the day will \n     be disenchantment, dishonesty, and fiscal irresponsibility.\n       I hear so much about ``if 40-some-odd Governors can operate \n     a balanced budget, why can't the Federal Government.''\n       Well, I give them an opportunity. I operated under it. It \n     worked. We had a huge surplus when I left the Governor's \n     office. We had an operating account. We had a capital \n     account.\n       They say operate like you do at home. At home you have \n     income, your salary. That is your operating account. You buy \n     a car within your means. You pay that out of your operating \n     account. You buy a home. You pay that out of your operating \n     account. But your operating account is always balanced. And \n     we have a time period in which to pay it off.\n       They say, ``Oh, we will never implement that legislation.'' \n     How do you know we will not? I have seen some amazing things \n     come out of this Chamber. I have seen people work and do the \n     right thing.\n       I think implementation of this amendment will work. I think \n     we can make it work. But on the other hand, if we want an \n     issue, fine. Stay with Senator Simon and Senator Hatch. Stay \n     with them and then have an issue when you go home.\n       But do you want a balanced budget amendment? There are \n     enough votes with those who are supporting that amendment \n     that we can get one.\n       Oh, I hear all this, ``The House is going to make us do \n     it.'' I have never seen us make the House do anything. I have \n     never seen the House make us do anything. So when they pass \n     their balanced budget amendment, what is it going to do? It \n     is going to die between here and there. That is what is going \n     to happen to it. It is going to die between here and there.\n       ``Oh, we will be forced into it.'' Nope. The House will not \n     do that to us. We will not do it to the House. So if you want \n     a balanced budget amendment operated like Nebraska was \n     operated, like Kentucky was operated, I will guarantee you \n     that we can do the right thing.\n       That is what it is all about here today, to do the right \n     thing. We have an operating budget. We are going to pay this \n     in 10 years. The slice is in here. We have IOU's in the \n     Social Security. We are going to buy it. It is in operating. \n     We buy it, pay it off. So Social Security is sound. I do not \n     understand why it takes a brain surgeon to understand how you \n     operate a budget the way the States do.\n       And so, Mr. President, I would hope that we would \n     reconsider between now and 3 o'clock this afternoon that this \n     is an opportunity to pass a balanced budget amendment that \n     will work and will give us a financially sound future, not \n     only for ourselves but for our children and our \n     grandchildren.\n       I hear my distinguished friend say he is going to do it for \n     his unborn grandchildren. I have five. The Senator is no \n     ``Lone Ranger.'' I am just as worried about my grandchildren \n     as he is. And I think I have a pretty good idea. I have had \n     to work under it. I had to operate it. I understand how it \n     works. There are few in this Chamber who do. You will find \n     that most of those will vote for this amendment because it \n     works.\n       Do it like the Governors do; pass the Reid amendment. Do it \n     like you do at home and operate your own budget; pass the \n     Reid amendment. It is just that simple, Mr. President.\n       [[Page S3573]] I do not know how much time I have \n     remaining, but I will reserve it.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, because of the way that the quotes were \nlifted from my speeches, this action can only be viewed as intentional. \nSenator Lott falsely states that I was talking about the balanced \nbudget amendment that had been introduced by his side of the aisle \nwhen, in fact, I was speaking about my own substitute amendment, with \nother Senators here, one that, among other things, excluded Social \nSecurity. This action can only be viewed as irresponsible.\n  Further reading of my original quote clearly indicates I was \nadvocating the same position a year ago that I advocated on the Senate \nfloor last week and that I remain committed to today: Ensuring that \nSocial Security is not used to balance the budget.\n  The truth of the matter is that this error has backfired. This \nattempt to discredit me and my intentions has instead shown from day 1 \nthat I have had serious reservations about what could happen to Social \nSecurity. While I was voicing my concern about Social Security, my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle were putting together \nproposals to carve up the Social Security trust fund.\n  Mr. President, I have papers right here, drafted in the form of a \nbill, which show the amount of Social Security moneys that would be \nused from the trust fund. That was offered to me as an alternate \nproposal. They were going to use the Social Security trust fund. This \none is for 10 years.\n  Generally, something like this might be passed off as an isolated \nincident. But, unfortunately, this appears to be one segment of a large \nRepublican National Committee strategy, and I submit further proof of \nthe scurrilous activities RNC releases that commit the same wrongs.\n  Mr. President, I submit those for the record and ask unanimous \nconsent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [RNC News Release, Washington, DC, Mar. 2, 1995]\n\n Statement by RNC Chairman Haley Barbour Following the Senate Balanced \n                         Budget Amendment Vote\n\n       By blocking passage of the balanced budget amendment, Bill \n     Clinton and the Democrats who voted against it in the Senate \n     today made the difference between Republican leadership and \n     Democrat retrenchment more crystal clear than ever. While \n     Republicans are keeping our promise to end business-as-usual \n     in Washington, Clinton and his Clinton Corps in the Senate \n     banded together in a blatant exercise of politics-as-usual.\n       Tom Daschle, Jeff Bingaman, Dianne Feinstein, Wendell Ford, \n     Byron Dorgan, and Fritz Hollings have become apprentices in \n     The Clinton School, where the fine art of saying one thing, \n     but doing another is taught. They told the people of their \n     states they were for a balanced budget amendment. They voted \n     for a balanced budget amendment in the past, some of them \n     more than once. But when Clinton and the Democrats needed \n     them, they switched their votes and defeated the balanced \n     budget amendment. They put party above the interests of the \n     children of their state.\n       Their hypocrisy extends even to the excuses they're \n     scrambling for. The six Democrats who today defeated the \n     balanced budget amendment are trying to use Social Security \n     as a cover for their flip-flop, but in 1993 the same six \n     voted to cut Social Security income by raising taxes on \n     beneficiaries. They voted for a virtually identical balanced \n     budget amendment last year without any mention of Social \n     Security. The fig leaf they`re trying to hide behind wouldn't \n     hide a gnat.\n       Clinton, the liberal Democrats in the Senate and the big-\n     spending special interests might have succeeded in stopping \n     passage of the balanced budget amendment today, but the \n     voters will have the last word.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nHaley's Comment by Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour\n\n       A lot of Americans are very mad tonight . . . very mad at \n     Bill Clinton and the Democrats in Congress who defeated the \n     balanced budget amendment by a single vote this afternoon.\n       According to a CBS/New York Times poll, 79% of Americans \n     support passage of the balanced budget amendment, and no \n     wonder. The budget has been balanced only one year since \n     1960. Under Bill Clinton's new budget the deficit goes up, \n     and it stays at the $200 billion level for the rest of the \n     century. In 2002, the year this amendment would have required \n     a balanced budget, Clinton's budget deficit will be $320 \n     billion.\n       The voters know the only way to stop the spending spree is \n     through the constitutional discipline of this amendment. The \n     big-spending liberals know that too, so they joined Bill \n     Clinton in pulling out all stops to kill the amendment.\n       In the end, the left focused on six Democrat senators, who \n     had voted for the virtually identical amendment just last \n     year. Clinton and company needed all six. If any one voted \n     for the amendment, it would pass.\n       Last year Fritz Hollings of South Carolina said on the \n     Senate floor, in support of the balanced budget amendment, \n     ``No more weaseling, no more excuses, just make the hard \n     choices and balance the budget.'' Today Hollings weaseled; he \n     voted no.\n       Wendell Ford of Kentucky voted for the amendment in 1986 \n     and 1994, when he said we needed a constitutional amendment \n     to regain control of spending. In his speech in support of \n     the constitutional amendment, he referred to Congress as \n     representatives of the people. Today Ford decided he'd be a \n     representative of the Democrat Party instead. So he turned \n     his back on the people of Kentucky, and voted no.\n       Tonight you've seen the Daschle, Dorgan and Feinstein \n     campaign ads, extolling their support of the balanced budget \n     amendment.\n       No wonder people are cynical. Voters have grown accustomed \n     to Bill Clinton promising one thing but doing just the \n     opposite; saying what you want to hear during the election, \n     but never intending to do it. Now we've learned this tactic \n     is contagious in the Democrat Party. All six of these \n     senators--Dorgan, Daschle, Hollings, Feinstein, Ford and \n     Bingaman voted no today, despite what they had said in the \n     past. They formed the hypocritical Clinton Corps, who told \n     their constituents they're for the balanced budget amendment \n     but voted against it today.\n       It is not lost on the voters that at the same time \n     Republicans are keeping our word by fulfilling the mandate \n     given us by the American people last November, it was \n     Democrats, breaking their promises, that caused the balanced \n     budget amendment to lose today.\n       But today won't be the last day. Senator Bob Dole has said \n     he will bring it up to vote on again. Between now and then I \n     hope you and every other outraged American let these senators \n     hear from you.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  The Defeat of the Balanced Budget Amendment: Hypocrisy on the Record\n\n       In 1992, Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) ran a campaign ad touting \n     his support for a balanced budget amendment. In the ad, he \n     looks at the camera (as the state's voters) squarely in the \n     eye and says: ``This country's in deep trouble. Everybody \n     knows that. The question is, what can we do about it. Well, \n     we can fight to change things. I'm convinced we can put this \n     country back on track, but to do it, we've got to put an end \n     to these crippling budget deficits. So here's what I'm \n     fighting to do.'' He then unveils the ``Dorgan Plan'' and \n     describes its final, critical component: ``I'm working for a \n     constitutional amendment that forces a balanced budget.'' He \n     even voted for the balanced budget amendment--with no strings \n     attached--in the 1994 campaign year, saying ``I am convinced \n     that it is the right thing to do and the necessary thing to \n     do.'' (Congressional Record, March 1, 1994)\n       Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), who voted for the balanced budget \n     amendment--no strings attached--last year, had made his \n     support of the balanced budget amendment a central issue in \n     his campaign in 1986, airing an ad showing red ink pouring \n     over the Constitution as the announcer reads: ``The national \n     debt. America is awash in red ink. But in 1979, Tom Daschle \n     saw the damage these deficits could do to our country. His \n     first official act was to sponsor a constitutional amendment \n     to balance the budget. For seven years, Tom Daschle has \n     battled party leaders and special interests to cut waste and \n     close loopholes.'' Apparently, he just wasn't up to the \n     battle anymore this year, when he caved to President Clinton.\n       Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) saw fit last year--when she was \n     up for reelection--to support the balanced budget amendment, \n     no strings attached. She, too, put her support for the \n     amendment on public display in a campaign ad, which touts her \n     ``courageous votes for the balanced budget amendment'' as \n     central to her fight to ``create jobs and get California's \n     economy going again.'' The tag line of the ad says, ``She's \n     our Senator, Dianne Feinstein.'' From her flip-flop today, it \n     appears she's now Bill Clinton's Senator.\n       Wendell Ford (D-Ky.) voted for the balanced budget \n     amendment both in 1986 and 1994. Last year he said, ``We as a \n     Congress and, being the representatives of the people, as a \n     nation must begin to regain control of our spending policies. \n     We need something that forces us to do this. An amendment to \n     the Constitution would do just that.'' (March 1, 1994) Today, \n     as the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, he sided with \n     his party, taking the opposite position from a majority of \n     the people of his state.\n       Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) voted for the balanced budget \n     amendment both in 1986 and 1994. When he voted for it last \n     year, he said: ``By writing a balanced budget amendment into \n     the basic law of the land, we will compel Washington to do \n     its job. No more weaseling. No more excuses. Just make the \n     hard choices and balance the budget. And do not be surprised \n     when a balanced U.S. budget turns out to be the best economic \n     growth program this country has ever seen.'' (Congressional \n     Record, March 1, 1994)\n\n  Mr. FORD. I for one am fed up with this type of political \nmudslinging. It does a disservice to serious discussion \n [[Page S3574]] of the issue, and I hope that the American people are \ntired of it, too. I hope that this incident forces my colleague and his \nassociates at the RNC to actually read the full text of my speeches and \nstop the blatant misrepresentation.\n  And Mr. President, from the National Journal's Congressional Daily, \nthey have a quote on page 8 of March 2.\n\n       On Wednesday, Ford's Washington office received 407 phone \n     calls supporting the balanced budget amendment and 765 \n     opposing it, according to the office spokesman. The ratio has \n     remained about the same throughout the week in the Washington \n     and State offices, he said. In addition, Republican National \n     Chairman Haley Barbour shrugged off a claim by Ford that RNC \n     ads running in Ford's home State of Kentucky backfired and \n     helped solidify Ford's position on the amendment.\n\n  And I quote Mr. Barbour. Mr. Barbour says, and I quote:\n\n       ``I was born at night but not last night,'' Barbour said, \n     adding that he does not believe ``any member of the United \n     States Senate could vote against the wishes of his \n     constituents merely because he got his feelings hurt by a TV \n     ad.''\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I was born at night, but I was not born last \nnight. What I said was when they started running the ads against me in \nKentucky, it stirred up a hornet's nest. It caused other groups that \nwere opposed to the amendment to gear up. They put on radio ads; they \nput on TV ads, and they stirred it up. If he had left it alone--that is \nwhat I am saying. He stirred up the activity himself, and it did not \nhurt my feelings. I am a grown man. I have been around a long time. Dad \ntold me, in politics, when they tear the hide off of you, just remember \nit grows back and you are tougher.\n  You are looking at one tough son of a gun today, Mr. President. I \njust want people to understand, lest we forget, they put that out and \nmisquoted us again. They misquoted us again. I think that the record \nought to be made straight, and I have all the documentation necessary \nto prove that this statement of mine was lifted from the Record, not \nactually the statement I made. It was a statement I made as it related \nto a substitute amendment that we thought would be a better amendment \nthat would work better for the American people and, yes, would help our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  And so, Mr. President, I make this statement just to defend myself \nbecause I do not want this statement to hang out there longer because \nit would, I think, be detrimental to what I hope my constituents \nunderstand and what I believe to be the facts.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to follow on those comments by \nsaying that my experience with respect to information put in the \nCongressional Record about statements I made last year was similar to \nthat of the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford].\n  Other Senators have spoken on the floor of the Senate about our \nsincerity in working to protect Social Security. They were asking--\nabout the Senator from Kentucky, my colleague from North Dakota, the \nSenator from California, myself and others--these other Senators were \nwondering where were we last year when we voted on the same identical \nbalanced budget amendment? Senators were asking why we were not worried \nthen. Why did we not, et cetera, et cetera.\n  And then they put parts of our statements in the Record. The problem \nis that what they put in was not all of the statements, but simply a \ncouple of paragraphs.\n  Let me read, if I might, from last year's statement that I made on \nthe floor of the Senate. Let us see whether the Senator who mentioned \nthis statement might want to modify his remarks, because I think, if he \nhad known all of what I had to say last year, he might have spoken \ndifferently last week. These are my words last year on the Senate \nfloor. I said to Senator Simon:\n\n       I would like to ask the Senator a question about the Social \n     Security issue.\n       We are now, by design, running surpluses in the Social \n     Security system in order to prepare for the time when we will \n     need them, when the baby boomers retire. I do not want to be \n     in a situation where we use those surpluses to balance the \n     Federal budget. That would be dishonest.\n       If we did that, we would, in effect, steal money from a \n     trust fund. We collect this money from the payroll taxes, out \n     of workers' paychecks and businesses, and we assure them that \n     this money will go into a trust fund. We promise people that \n     it will be used only for trust fund purposes.\n       If we use that money to offset the operating budget \n     deficits, we are misusing that money. We cannot allow that to \n     happen.\n\n  That is me speaking last year, not this year.\n  Again, quoting myself, speaking last year.\n\n       The fact is we must not count the surplus between now and \n     the year 2035. Between now and then we will have an enormous \n     bubble of surplus * * *.\n       The reason we increased taxes on payrolls in this country \n     is we decided we must force national savings to meet a need \n     after the turn of the century. To fail to do so is \n     irresponsible.\n       That is why I say to the Senator from Illinois (speaking to \n     Senator Simon that day) that--whether it is under the current \n     budget scheme in Congress without respect to this \n     constitutional amendment, or whether it is with respect to a \n     constitutional amendment--we must do the right thing with \n     respect to the Social Security trust funds. The right thing \n     is not to count them in the balanced budget computation.\n       That is the only way to achieve national forced savings \n     that we promised the workers and businesses in this country \n     we were going to achieve.\n\n  Now, I read that to say that is what I said in the Chamber last year, \nand yet Senators have come to the floor and wondered where I was last \nyear. Senators said that we did not bring this up, that we did not talk \nabout this. And they put in the Record part of the statement and left \nall of this out.\n  Now, I hope it is an accident because accidents happen. But maybe we \ncan be accurate with each other about what we did or did not do and \nwhat we said or did not say. Maybe we can decide that we respect each \nother's views. We differ. We feel strongly about things on this floor, \nand we represent the people the best we can. But I think that we ought \nto understand that what we should give each other in this Chamber is \nnot just the truth but the whole truth, the whole truth. We do not need \nto in any way--and I would never, and I will not impugn motives here--\nbut I do not think we should ever intend, nor do I expect anyone would \never intend, to misrepresent.\n  So believing that to be the case, I hope others who will take the \nfloor in the future will not ever again say this: Where were they last \nyear? Why were they not making these kinds of representations last \nyear?\n  I will not read this a second or third time, but anybody who heard \nwhat I just read could not fail to understand. If you heard, you cannot \nfail to understand I raised exactly the same points last year as I \nraised this year.\n  I hope I do not hear someone again make the mistake, and I assume it \nis a mistake, not to include those statements I made in the Chamber \nlast year in representations that they bring to the floor this year.\n  All of us understand what a lot of this is. It is a lot of politics. \nThat is fine. We operate in a political system. I am not defensive \nabout it. I just believe that when we discuss things with each other, \nlet us do it with all the facts, let us do it with the truth and the \nwhole truth.\n  That is what I hope to do with all of my colleagues in this Chamber. \nThat is what I hope they would do with me as well.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Kentucky yielding.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I ask the Senator from Kentucky to yield for an \nadditional statement?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the Senator can get the floor in her own \nright.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky does not have the \nfloor.\n  Mr. FORD. The Senator can get it in her own right.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I speak as in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/07/senate-section/article/S3570-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3574-S3576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CORRECTING THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT DEBATE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I also would like to correct the \nrecord, \n [[Page S3575]] and so I rise today to set it straight. I am reacting \nto the fact again that the Senator from Mississippi submitted a portion \nof my floor statement from balanced budget debate last year and \nincorrectly described the context of my remarks, and I would like to \nput those remarks in context.\n  The Senator claims in the Congressional Record that the statement was \nmade in response to the balanced budget amendment as submitted by \nSenators Simon and Hatch. In fact, there were two proposals last year \non the balanced budget amendment. The statement that is attributed to \nme was made in reaction and in support of the balanced budget amendment \nproposed by Senator Reid, which would have protected the Social \nSecurity trust fund. I would like to put the statement submitted by the \nSenator from Mississippi in context by briefly reading a couple of \nparagraphs from my floor speech made on February 24, 1994.\n\n       I am here to speak on behalf of the Reid amendment. I \n     believe it is improved over the Simon amendment. This \n     amendment would protect Social Security. I do not believe \n     that the trust fund should be used to balance the budget. It \n     would allow the creation of a capital budget (that is this \n     amendment), just as many cities and States do now. It would \n     allow flexibility in times of recession. And it would keep \n     the courts from mandating actions that are legislative \n     prerogatives.\n\n       These changes make this amendment a much more workable \n     balanced budget amendment.\n       There are many in this body who believe that amending the \n     Constitution is very strong medicine, perhaps too strong. I \n     have listened very carefully to those arguments. But I have \n     come to the conclusion that without the strong medicine the \n     patient is not going to heal.\n       People have said to me: You come from California and you \n     supported an amendment for earthquake disaster relief that \n     was off budget.\n       Yes, I did. Disaster relief for floods was off budget. \n     Disaster relief for Hurricane Iniki was off budget. Disaster \n     relief for Hurricane Andrew was off budget. So why should \n     California be treated any differently? That is why we need an \n     amendment to make everyone play by the same rules.\n       I think this is the heart of the matter. If people believe \n     that under our present way of doing business we can balance \n     this budget, then they should vote against a balanced budget \n     amendment.\n\n  This is the part that I was quoted in.\n\n       If in their heart of hearts they believe we are not going \n     to be able to balance the budget under the current process, \n     then I believe they should support the balanced budget \n     amendment. At least that is the conclusion to which I have \n     come. Without a constitutional amendment, a balanced budget \n     just is not going to be achieved.\n\n  That is the context of my remarks, out of which one paragraph was \ntaken and attributed to my not being concerned about Social Security \nlast year. I submit this as proof that I was concerned about Social \nSecurity last year. This year I presented a substitute amendment which \nwas the balanced budget amendment with Social Security excluded, and it \nlost before this body.\n  If I might just quickly restate my views, because I believe it is \nimportant. Let me speak as someone who does believe in a balanced \nbudget amendment. It may not be the same identical one you believe in, \nMr. President, but then that is why we are legislators, to legislate, \nhear the ebb and flow of debate, make up our minds, and improve \nlegislation. I quite genuinely believe, and I think the figures will \ncorroborate, that we can take Social Security off budget, create a \ncapital budget--as the city of which I was mayor does, as the State of \nCalifornia does, as more than 40 other States do--and actually, by so \ndoing, have less trouble balancing the budget by the year 2002 than we \nwould if the present balanced budget amendment passed.\n  Now, perhaps the Federal Government is so far removed from States or \ncities that they cannot countenance financing large items of capital \nlike aircraft carriers, at $1 billion per, through a capital budget, \nbut I think we can. I think there is room for people to have different \nviews about a balanced budget amendment. And I hope that, as others \nstate our views, that they would do so correctly.\n  I have heard many Members supporting a balanced budget amendment \nsay--and heard one on tape just a half-hour ago--``We have no \nintentions of using Social Security to balance the budget.'' That is \nwrong. Social Security's revenues would be used in the balanced budget \namendment recently voted on to balance the budget.\n  Why do I believe that Social Security is as important a contract with \nAmerica as the revisionist Contract With America? The reason I believe \nit is because for years people have been paying FICA taxes with the \nassurance that those taxes are not used for budget purposes, they are \nused for their retirement. That is a contract with America. You pay 6.2 \npercent of your salary, your employer matches it, the Federal \nGovernment holds that and invests it in Treasury bills, and you get it \nback as you retire.\n  I believe that obligation ought to be kept intact. If we find we \ncannot keep the obligation intact because more people are retiring and \nnot enough are earning, then the system needs adjustment. And I am the \nfirst one to say that. Or the money is not going to be there, do not \nmake young working people with young families pay the FICA tax today. \nDo the honest thing and cancel the FICA tax.\n  So I think there are very major and legitimate public policy \nquestions at play in this balanced budget amendment and I hope that the \nmentality that I have been surprised to see in the last week--which is \nalmost the mentality that anyone who dares disagree with the great \npundits and proponents of the balanced budget amendment is not quite as \ngood an American and does not have the right to disagree--would cease. \nI think that makes a mockery out of the public policy debates of the \nNo. 1 one public policy forum of the United States, the U.S. Senate.\n  I believe we have a right to listen to debate. I believe we have a \nright to try to forge a better amendment. And I think taking Social \nSecurity out of the balanced budget amendment does in fact make it a \nbetter amendment and there is a way to compensate for the loss and that \nis by doing something that most States and every big city in this \nNation does, which is fund their major capital improvements through a \ncapital budget.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, last week, I inserted in the Record a list \nof quotations concerning the balanced budget amendment, from several of \nour colleagues who voted against the balanced budget amendment on March \n2 of this year. Those quotes demonstrated their support for the \nbalanced budget amendment in earlier years, especially in 1994, when \nthere was little chance that it would actually pass.\n  Earlier this afternoon, our distinguished colleague from Kentucky, \nSenator Ford, suggested an error in the words attributed to him. As I \nunderstood him, he has not claimed that he never said the words I \nquoted him as saying. But rather, he said them in support of a \nsubstitute amendment to the balanced budget amendment, not in support \nof the original legislative language.\n  That substitute--a Reid-Ford-Feinstein amendment--had the effect of \nexempting Social Security from the constitutional strictures of the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  The Senator is correct in pointing that out. The words I quoted were \nspoken on March 1, 1994, in support of that substitute amendment, \nwhich, because of its Social Security exclusion, did differ from the \nbalanced budget amendment the Senator voted against on March 2 of this \nyear.\n  If I had been aware of that, I would have duly noted it in the \nmaterial inserted in the Record, but not read. So I apologize to the \nSenator for that misimpression. But in the interest of fairness, I \nthink we should lay out the whole story. As another of our colleagues \nsaid here this afternoon, we want, not just the truth but the whole \ntruth.\n  And the whole truth is that, after our distinguished colleague from \nKentucky spoke those quoted words in support of the Reid-Ford-Feinstein \namendment, that amendment was rejected by the Senate by a vote of 22 to \n78.\n  The next vote came 5 hours later. It was a vote on final passage of \nSenate Joint Resolution 41, the balanced budget amendment virtually \nidentical to the one narrowly defeated by the Senate only last week. \nAnd on that vote, Senator Ford voted ``yea.''\n  Let me make that clear. Although the Senator's words I quoted were \ndirected toward the Reid-Ford-Feinstein \n [[Page S3576]] substitute amendment, the Senator from Kentucky did \nindeed vote for the original balanced budget amendment last year which \nwas basically identical to the one we voted on this year which he voted \nagainst.\n  Methinks, maybe, he protest too much.\n  I was raised to believe that actions speak louder than words. And the \npoint of my remarks in the Record  last week was that the actions of \nseveral of our colleagues with regard to the balanced budget amendment \nlast year just do not compute, as Dr. Spock would say, with thier \nactions this year.\n  I do regret any inconvenience to the Senator caused by the \npublication of his quote from 1994. And I want to assure him that all \nfuture quotes will be triple-checked for their precise parliamentary \ncontext.\n  But at the same time, those of us who truly support a balanced budget \namendment owe it to the public--to the taxpayers--to make clear why \nthat amendment was defeated, at least temporarily, in this body last \nweek.\n  It was defeated because several Senators who voted for its exact \nlanguage 1 year ago found some reason, some excuse, to change their \nposition 180 degrees this year.\n  Whatever their reasons for doing so, that abrupt change is what is at \nissue here. It is what the public is asking question about. And, in \nsome cases, it may be difficult to explain.\n  One thing is for sure: No one can explain away that radical change in \nposition regarding the balanced budget amendment by pointing to the \nReid-Ford-Feinstein substitute of 1994. That substitute was indeed the \nsubject of Senator Ford's remarks as I quoted them, but it ws the \noriginal, untouched, unamended, unaltered, authentic balanced budget \namendment for which he voted on March 1, 1994.\n  And it was the same amendment, with only the beneficial addition of \nSenator Nunn's language concerning the federal judiciary, which he \nvoted against on March 2, 1995.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for \nnot to exceed 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment fight has \nended for the moment, but some rather unattractive reverberations seem \nstill to be echoing in this Chamber and around this city. Honorable men \nand women wrestled with their consciences and did the best that they \ncould to reach the right decision on the balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution. Thirty days of good solid debate in the best Senate \ntradition persuaded some that the amendment was the right thing and \nsome that it was the wrong thing. That is exactly what the \nconstitutional Framers intended when they set up the difficult amending \nprocess laid out in the Constitution. But the Framers probably did not \nforesee the aftermath of political guerilla-warfare tactics that is now \nin progress, nor would they have understood or appreciated this \nparticular unfortunate turn of events.\n  Attack ads are already running in the States of certain Members who \ncould not support the amendment this year because of its glaring \ndeficiencies. Because of the thorough examination of the amendment on \nthis floor and elsewhere, the constitutional amendment has been \nsomewhat discredited. The idea has lost some support with the people \nand in its present form, it has lost the support of some Senators who \nhad supported it in the past. There is nothing unusual about that. \nProposals often fall out of favor when careful examination reveals \ntheir flaws. That is healthy. That is good for the Republic. That is \nrepresentative democracy.\n  But, the ugliness which continues to pervade the air on the days \nafter the amendment's defeat is unwarranted, unwise, and to be \nregretted.\n  Senators who have used their best judgment are under attack and in \nthe most extreme of cases one Senator, it is rumored, has been \nthreatened with his position on a Senate committee.\n  When Senators are asked to check their integrity at the door to \ncontinue in good standing their membership in any political party, \nsomething is very, very wrong. When a Senator has to subordinate his \nconscience and his dedication to the Constitution of the United States \nto any political party, then we have come to a very poor pass in this \nSenate and in this country. When Members of the Senate are subjected to \nhit-list tactics because of their position of conscience on an \nimportant constitutional amendment, somewhere, somebody's perception of \nthe word ``Honorable'' is seriously off track. And when losing a fair \nfight prompts the loud public ``chewing of rags'' which we have seen \nsince last Thursday evening, everybody loses, including the Nation.\n  I hope that the coming days will see a restoration of sanity and \ncomity in this body. What we need to do now is to get on with the \nbusiness of reducing the deficit, which is what the American people \nhave really asked us to do. This Senate which so distinguished itself \nonly last week with a wise and courageous decision on the balanced \nbudget amendment, must cease the self-destructive and embarrassing \nthreats and recriminations and once again distinguish itself by a \nserious attempt to do the people's business. That is what we are all \nelected and expected to do.\n  Mr. President, for the information of Senators, I ask unanimous \nconsent to include in the Record at this point rule XXIV of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate entitled ``Appointment of Committees.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Rule XXIV\n\n\n                       appointment of committees\n\n       1. In the appointment of the standing committees, or to \n     fill vacancies thereon, the Senate, unless otherwise ordered, \n     shall by resolution appoint the chairman of each such \n     committee and the other members thereof. On demand of any \n     Senator, a separate vote shall be had on the appointment of \n     the chairman of any such committee and on the appointment of \n     the other members thereof. Each such resolution shall be \n     subject to amendment and to division of the question.\n       2. On demand of one-fifth of the Senators present, a quorum \n     being present, any vote taken pursuant to paragraph 1 shall \n     be by ballot.\n       3. Except as otherwise provided or unless otherwise \n     ordered, all other committees, and the chairmen thereof, \n     shall be appointed in the same manner as standing committees.\n       4. When a chairman of a committee shall resign or cease to \n     serve on a committee, action by the Senate to fill the \n     vacancy in such committee, unless specially otherwise \n     ordered, shall be only to fill up the number of members of \n     the committee, and the election of a new chairman.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

``Supplemental Appropriations \n     and Rescissions Act, 1995''.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Senate now turns to consideration of \nH.R. 889, making fiscal year 1995 supplemental appropriations for the \nDepartment of Defense, and rescinding appropriations for defense and \nnondefense programs. The Committee on Appropriations met last Thursday \non this measure, and reported it with amendments by a unanimous vote of \n28-0.\n  The bill recommended by the committee contains two titles. The first \ntitle provides a total of $1,935,400,000 in supplemental appropriations \nfor the Department of Defense. These appropriations are recommended in \nresponse to a request from the President for $2,538,700,000 to \nreplenish accounts depleted by unbudgeted operations in and around \nHaiti, Cuba, Bosnia, Rwanda, Somalia, Iraq, and Korea. Guided by the \nrecommendations of our defense subcommittee, the committee proposes a \nreduction from the President's request for defense. We believe that we \nhave addressed the immediate concerns of the Department of Defense \nregarding operational readiness, and are prepared to consider the other \nreadiness issues raised by the Department in connection with the fiscal \nyear 1996 defense appropriations bill.\n  The committee has also recommended rescissions in prior \nappropriations for defense in order to offset the additional spending \nrecommended. The President requested appropriations with an emergency \ndesignation under the terms of the Budget Enforcement Act. With this \ndesignation, funds provided would have been in addition to those set by \nthe domestic discretionary caps. The committee believes it is \npreferable to offset spending wherever and whenever possible, so that \nthe deficit is not increased.\n  Senator Stevens, the chairman of our Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, and the ranking Member of that committee, former chairman \nDaniel Inouye, will discuss the specifics of the supplemental \nappropriations and rescissions in title I as we proceed with the debate \non this measure.\n  The second title of the bill as recommended would rescind a total of \n$1,535,966,450 in appropriations for nondefense programs. The other \nbody recommended rescissions of slightly more than $1.4 billion in \nnondefense programs in order to partially offset the costs of their \nrecommended supplementals for defense. Our committee fully offset \ndefense supplementals with rescissions in lower priority defense \nprograms. Our nondefense rescissions are solely intended to achieve \nreductions in Federal spending this fiscal year.\n  Mr. President, I believe, as we have researched this, that this is \nthe first time in the history of the Appropriations Committee where a \nrescission package was identified as an offset and as a deduction from \nthe current deficit. I think that is worthy to take note.\n  Mr. President, that summarizes the recommendations of the committee. \nThey are discussed in greater detail in our report which is Senate \nreport 104-12 which was received last Friday and available to all \nMembers.\n  I am now prepared to yield the floor for any opening remarks that the \nranking member, the former chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Byrd, wishes to make. Then we will seek to adopt the committee \namendments, and proceed with consideration of the bill and entertaining \nany amendments that Members may wish to offer at this time.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, Senator Hatfield, for \nhis statement which is complete and thorough enough in itself without \nany additional words on my part. But I do support the committee's \nrecommendations on H.R. 889, as reported by Senator Hatfield.\n  H.R. 889, as reported, contains recommendations totaling just over \n$1.9 billion to restore readiness funds to the Department of Defense. \nThese funds were used for unforeseen international operations such as \nin Haiti, in the Middle East, Rwanda, Somalia, and Bosnia.\n  It is my understanding that the Department of Defense needs these \nfunds by the end of March. The committee's recommended appropriations \nare approximately $600 million less than requested by the President and \n$1.2 billion below the House bill. Furthermore, and most importantly, \nthe committee's recommendations include sufficient Department of \nDefense rescissions to fully offset both the budget authority and the \noutlays of these defense appropriations.\n  I compliment the distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Mr. Stevens, and \n [[Page S3581]] the distinguished ranking member of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Inouye, for their able efforts in \nfinding these offsets.\n  In addition, title II of the bill contains rescissions from a number \nof nondefense appropriations totaling over $1.5 billion in additional \nspending cuts.\n  I compliment the chairman of the committee, Mr. Hatfield, who is a \nformer chairman of the committee, former ranking member, and again \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee for his expeditious handling \nof this important measure, and I urge Senators on both sides to support \nthe committee's recommendations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, as we now proceed, I would seek \nunanimous consent that the committee amendments be considered, and \nagreed to, en bloc; that the bill, as amended, be considered as \noriginal text for the purpose of further amendment; and, that no points \nof order be waived thereon by reason of this agreement.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I believe a unanimous-consent request is \npending. Is that the order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the first title to this supplemental \nappropriations bill addresses two components of our defense financing. \nFirst, it provides $1.96 billion to ensure military readiness through \nthe remainder of this year. Second, it proposes $1.96 billion in \nrescissions to fully offset the new budget authority and outlays for \n1995.\n  We received the administration's request and we scrubbed it a little \nbit, and we recommended that $600 million be deleted from the amounts \nproposed by the House in accordance with the request of the \nadministration.\n  These come in three categories. The request proposed advance funding \nof reimbursements from Kuwait and the United Nations. In two instances, \nwe spent defense money already appropriated for other purposes for the \npurpose of sending troops to Kuwait or to assist in support of the \nUnited Nations in peacekeeping activities. I believe we should rely on \nour allies and on the United Nations to fulfill their commitments, and \nthat we need not put up taxpayers' money in advance of the receipt of \nthe payment that they are already committed to pay to us.\n  The request proposed $70 million in military construction and \nfacility upgrades at Guantanamo Bay naval station to support Cuban \nrefugees now interned at that installation. Now, here again, Mr. \nPresident, together with some of our staff, I journeyed to Guantanamo \nBay to look at the situation and I am convinced that the amounts that \nhave been requested should await a total congressional assessment on \nthe policy of the refugee internment camp at Guantanamo Bay. I believe \nthat can be addressed in the 1996 defense and military construction \nbills. Those may not be decisions to be made in the appropriations \nprocess. They may be made by the Armed Services Committee in its \ndeliberations and recommendations to the Senate and to the Congress as \na whole.\n  Finally, several amounts were proposed that were not justified as \nemergencies or were unrelated to the contingency operations in Cuba, \nHaiti, Bosnia, and Kuwait. Many of those also can and should be \naddressed through the normal reprogramming process of the Department. \nWe, as a nation, face a crisis in military readiness because the \nadministration spent money on contingency operations in excess of \namounts provided by Congress.\n  The 1995 defense appropriations bill included many increases in the \nbudget for readiness, training, recruiting, and maintenance of \nfacilities in military housing. These are the very priorities that were \nput at risk by the President's decision to engage in operations in \nBosnia, Haiti, Kuwait, and Rwanda without approval and support of \nfunding for those activities by the Congress. The President did not \ncome to the Congress in advance of these deployments to seek funding or \nto propose offsets in existing authorizations.\n  Instead, money provided by the Congress for training, logistic \nsupport, and personnel, were diverted to these accounts. This practice \nis in stark contrast to how the Congress and the White House approached \nthe Persian Gulf war. As we proceed through our review of the \nDepartment's 1996 budget, I believe we must address the fiscal controls \nthat permitted the administration to delete vital readiness accounts \nearly in the year without the explicit consent of the Congress.\n  As I said before, it is my understanding that that may come from the \nArmed Services Committee. I know that some of my colleagues, including \nmy fellow Senator from Alaska and the distinguished chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee will offer amendments to tighten controls \non DOD consultation with the Congress. Members of the committee \ndiscussed at length the issue of offsetting the new spending in this \nbill and the precedent set for emergencies.\n  While the military requirements are urgent, they can be met by \nreductions to programs that Congress might have reduced if we had known \nthe cost of the contingency operations to begin with.\n  The current deficit crisis makes it necessary that the amounts in \nthis bill be fully offset. That is the judgment of our committee. That \npresents the committee with only hard choices, especially when the \nchoices have to be made this late in the year. That simply means that \nwe would have a lot more flexibility in the beginning of the fiscal \nyear to eliminate some accounts than we do now because many of the \naccounts have already been spent out to the point where it is not \npossible to include them in the readjustments made in this bill.\n  In general, the recommendations before the committee reflect cuts in \nprograms where spending can be controlled. Many of the programs we seek \nto reduce have merit, Mr. President, great merit. We have provided \nfunding for these programs in the past and even in this current fiscal \nyear.\n  I want to tell the Senate that I am confident that Congress will \nrevisit some of these in the 1996 bill. But at the present time we have \nno alternative to find some source to obtain the funds to put back into \nthe training accounts so training can be continued. There is a \ntimeframe involved. It must be done so the moneys are available no \nlater than the end of April. We hope that they will be available by \nApril 1.\n  We have made reductions to the TRP account, environmental and defense \nconversion accounts. These reflect the availability of funds, and they \nreflect to a certain extent a change of direction for the programs, but \nbasically it is because that is where the money is that has not been \nexpended in this fiscal year. To the extent that any funds remain \navailable for the TRP in the future, I believe they must be \nspecifically directed and identified military priorities.\n  The committee proposal strikes a fair balance to proceed to \nconference with the House, and I would urge Members of the Senate on \nboth sides of the aisle and particularly on both sides of the TRP \ndebate, to endorse the level that is in this bill because it is \ndifferent from that in the House.\n  I believe I was the originator of the Defense Environmental \nRestoration Program but I viewed with increasing alarm the steady \nincrease in spending in that program with little to show for it. \nDespite the progress in that fund, the Department of Defense still \nspends only about 50 percent of the amounts in the environmental \nrestoration account for cleanup activities. Almost 50 percent now goes \nfor studies, plans, and legal fees. In comparison, when we build new \nfacilities, the cost for those is about 6 to 7 percent. Only 6 to 7 \npercent of the funding goes for design, planning and litigation in the \nplanning and building of new facilities.\n  Now, our cut does not impact any funds provided to meet environmental \nhazards at bases identified for closure in the 1988, 1991, and 1993 \nBRAC rounds. \n [[Page S3582]] Those funds are appropriated separately in the military \nconstruction bill and were not addressed by this bill.\n  We do face another base closing round this year. I know that, \nrecognizing that two Alaska bases are on the list to be closed: Adak \nnaval station, and Fort Greely at Big Delta, AK. I am sensitive to the \ndefense conversion and transition issues.\n  Amounts provided in recent bills have gone well beyond the original \ngoals, however, of those programs as they were established when the \ndefense drawdown defense following the gulf wars.\n  In particular, the cuts proposed by the committees address areas \nwhere the Congress has significantly earmarked funds for specific \nprojects. While not canceling or terminating any one project, the \nSecretary will have to substantially scale back spending in this area. \nAgain, that will have to be done because that is where the money is. If \nwe have to find almost $2 billion in these accounts at this time, we \nhave to find accounts where the remaining balance will justify taking \nsome of the money out and still leaving the program operable for the \nremainder of the year. Spending to ease the impact of these defense \ncutbacks cannot come at the significant loss of immediate military \nreadiness. However, I assure all interested Members that we want to \nwork to ensure the highest priority programs continue to be adequately \nfunded.\n  Most of the program reductions proposed in the rescission package \nthat we present to the Senate reflect fact-of-life program changes. For \ninstance, the Department terminated the TSSAM missile leaving funds \nthat were appropriated for that project available for rescission. We \nintend to continue to work with the Air Force to determine what may be \nthe best estimate of amounts available to cut in this area in the \nconference.\n  I also want to commend the efforts of Lt. Gen. Dick Hawley and Ms. \nDarlene Druyun for their efforts to expedite the termination process on \nthe TSSAM missile system, and they are minimizing the cost of that \ntermination to the taxpayers.\n  Congress also funded six new AH-64 Apache helicopters for 1995 to \nassure no break in production as we move to the Longbow version of that \naircraft. However, new foreign sales have developed, and the Army has \nindicated that those funds we appropriated for 1995 are not required \nfor new aircraft procurement this year. In conference, we intend to \nlook at Army proposals to shift some of the funding in that account to \naccelerate the Longbow Program.\n  This committee also initiated the Arms Program to preserve the \nindustrial base for ammunition production. The cut we have made \nreflects the amount to expire at the end of this year. The Army has not \naccounted in the 1996 budget for funds necessary to meet the ammunition \nstockpile and training requirements, and we will want to move some \naccounts around to assure we have the necessary amounts for the 1996 \nbill.\n  Finally, the committee has strongly supported the Department of \nDefense's efforts to procure unmanned aerial vehicles for battlefield \nsurveillance and intelligence. The cut to this item reflects technical \ndelays only in the program. I am personally, and I believe our \ncommittee is totally, committed to providing adequate funding for the \nprogram based on its readiness for production. When it is ready, we \nwill provide a recommendation to the Senate that it be appropriately \nfunded.\n  In closing, I know some of the Senate will disagree with some of \nthese rescissions. The options for offsets at this stage are very \nlimited. I urged the Department of Defense to submit this supplemental \nas early as last December, but because of other considerations, the \nWhite House chose to withhold it until February. That delayed our \nability to respond to the needs, as I have said, because the spending \nof other accounts continued and we now have limited flexibility as to \nwhere to get moneys from commencing about the first of May. We are \ndealing with a period between May and September 30 now. We could have \nbeen dealing with the period January 1 to September 30 if we had the \nrequest early in the year.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is we must get these funds to the \nmilitary services as quickly as possible, as I said, by the end of this \nmonth if at all possible. That commitment must guide our work to \ncomplete this bill, I hope, today or early tomorrow at the latest.\n  There are a series of impacts. I asked the Chief of Naval Operations, \nAdmiral Boorda, to tell us what might happen to the Navy, for instance, \nif we do not get this money to the Navy in time. He has told me if he \ndoes not have the money in time, he faces the option of deferring all \nmaintenance on small naval craft and tugs for the Atlantic fleet.\n  He will have to reduce the maintenance on two aircraft carriers and \nwill have to delay one submarine overhaul.\n  He may have to delay maintenance on naval facilities worldwide.\n  He has to stop flight training for two carrier air wings that are \ncurrently preparing for deployment. That is very dangerous, Mr. \nPresident. These people stay at home, fly a very low number of hours, \nand just before deployment they always get back and get their readiness \nup to very top performance. We have two aircraft carriers ready to go \nto sea. I talked about them this morning with some people in the \nDepartment. It makes no sense for us to delay aircraft carriers and not \nhave our crews at the peak of their performance, as would be possible \nif these funds had not been diverted. They must be replaced as soon as \npossible.\n  In addition, there are some other things that are going to happen if \nthese funds are delayed even longer than we currently anticipate they \ncould be:\n  There are seven additional Atlantic fleet ship overhauls.\n  There is a proposal to stop Naval Reserve flying for C-9 and P-3 \naircraft;\n  To stop flight training for carrier squadrons returning from \ndeployment. There, again, after they come back, the long steam coming \nback, before they are allowed to take some time off they again go \nthrough and try to bring their readiness up to peak so, if they are \ncalled back, they can continue to be ready. They do not get the type of \ntraining on deployment that they can get here at home when we have the \nelectronic ranges that can be used and the kind of training that can be \nobtained as they prepare for deployment or return from deployment.\n  Last but not least, we are down to the point where there will be no \nspare parts for the last 40 days of this year if these moneys are not \nput into the accounts and the spare parts made available.\n  I remember the days, Mr. President, when we had vessels in Norfolk \nand other ports that could not leave port because they did not have \nspare parts. That just cannot happen at a time like this when we have \nreduced our forces and we are trying to maintain the readiness of the \nsmaller force that we have.\n  I certainly hope the Senate will listen to us and the Congress as a \nwhole will act as rapidly as possible on this request for supplemental \nfunds, to request those funds which were diverted from training \naccounts for the peacekeeping operations.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, may I begin by first commending my \ndistinguished colleague from Oregon, the chairman of the full \ncommittee, Mr. Hatfield, and my dear friend from Alaska, the chairman \nof the subcommittee, Senator Stevens, for coming forth with this bill. \nDifficult decisions had to be made, and they made them. Difficult \nrecommendations have to be made to the Senate, and these \nrecommendations are now being presented.\n  Together they have crafted a bill which balances the needs of the \nDepartment of Defense and our committee's desire not to increase the \ndeficit. As the Senator from Alaska indicated, this bill provides $1.9 \nbillion in new appropriations requested by the Department of Defense to \ncover emergency expenses. However, it is some $600 million less than \nDOD wanted, but it provides a reasonable amount, considering the \ncommittee's goal of offsetting new appropriations with rescissions.\n  But, Mr. President, I think I must inform my colleagues that I am \nconcerned with the guidelines that govern the committee's efforts with \nthis DOD supplemental, and I hope it will not be \n [[Page S3583]] viewed as a precedent for future emergency \nsupplementals.\n  The Budget Enforcement Act requires that, in general, discretionary \nspending must be constrained to stay within ceilings established in the \nbudget resolution. However, Mr. President, this agreement allows these \nceilings to be breached if the President and the Congress agree that \nthese funds are needed to meet emergency requirements. The President \nsubmitted his request for DOD funds as an emergency and the House \nagreed.\n  The House recommended rescissions of $3.2 billion to offset the \nbudget authority it added for DOD so as not to add to the long-term \ndeficit.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill has gone one step \nfurther. This bill that we are discussing this moment has dispensed \nwith the emergency designation for the DOD supplemental and, therefore, \nunder Senate rules, the committee must offset both budget authority and \noutlays recommended in this bill.\n  With this action, I hope that the Senate is not charting a new and \nhazardous course.\n  The Defense Department does not budget for emergency expenses. On \nseveral occasions, the Congress has denied past administrations' \nrequests to establish contingency accounts which could have been used \nfor emergencies and crisis response. The Congress has recommended \ninstead that DOD request supplementals to cover such emergency costs.\n  It has always been anticipated that for expenses necessary to cover \nemergencies, funds would be added to the current budget, not \nreallocated from existing resources. In this bill, we are requiring DOD \nto use its existing resources to cover costs of emergencies. This is \ncontrary to the intent of the budget agreement, and I hope that we are \nnot making a mistake.\n  I am told that the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff regard this recommendation with grave concern. I do not \ndisagree with the specific rescission recommendations by the committee, \nthough they were difficult to make, because I believe that under the \ncircumstances, they are reasonable and they represent the best options \nfor offsetting the budget authority and outlays contained in the \nsupplemental.\n  However, by rescinding these funds today, there will be few resources \navailable to cover the so-called must-pay bills which we know the \nPentagon will face later this year. The Defense Department has already \nidentified nearly $800 million in must-pay bills. It expects this total \nunfunded requirement to reach about $1 billion.\n  These must-pay bills are not considered emergencies under the terms \nof the budget agreement. Therefore, they will have to be paid from \nwithin available funding. And where is DOD to find these funds if \nCongress has already rescinded $1.9 billion?\n  Mr. President, I am of the impression that all of us in this body, \nDemocrats and Republicans, are supportive of the need to maintain the \nreadiness of our military forces. By requiring that these unforeseen \nemergency expenses must be offset, the committee is virtually \nguaranteeing that when shortfalls occur in other areas of DOD funding, \nthey will have to be made up by cutting readiness spending.\n  Mr. President, I hope I am wrong, but this is a very serious matter. \nI am greatly concerned that in the future, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs will object to the requests of our civilian leaders to use \nmilitary forces overseas for crisis response and for emergencies \nbecause they believe it will be damaging to the overall readiness of \nthe force. They may realize that if they must pay for these costs out \nof their own hide, they will have to cut readiness to do so.\n  So I hope that all of us will think hard and long about the decision \nwe are about to make today. I will be supporting this measure, and I do \nso with a clear conscience, and I will be very proud and happy to say \npublicly that I rely upon the judgment, the good judgment of my two \ndear friends from Oregon and Alaska.\n  Mr. President, the chairman of this committee has drafted a good bill \nunder the circumstances, and I look forward to working with him in \nconference on these issues.\n  Mr. President, the chairman of the subcommittee brought up a matter \nwhich is dear to the hearts of some of my colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle, the so-called TRP. It should be noted that the House by its \naction took out $500 million, and though there are many in this body \nwho support the House action, the chairman of the committee and the \nchairman of the subcommittee took a courageous stand to say we will cut \nonly $200 million.\n  I know this is not the full amount, but I think under the \ncircumstances it is an amount that we can live with, and so I hope that \nthose who are considering proposing an amendment to restore the funds \nwill think about this because I think the committee made the proper \nrecommendation under the circumstances.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, as we debate the Defense supplemental \nappropriations bill, I want to ensure that my colleagues and the \nmanagers of the bill are aware of some of the underlying problems with \nthe way this supplemental was crafted.\n  First let me say the supplemental is necessary, and I intend to \nsupport the bill. The bill is designed to replace critical readiness \nand training funds which the services had to spend in the first half of \nthis fiscal year for humanitarian and other so-called peace operations. \nIf we do not replace those funds, military readiness will continue to \ndecline. Combat readiness has declined too far already. The Nation \ncannot afford to let it erode further. It angers me that the \nadministration has allowed readiness to suffer at all. Under these \ncircumstances, it would be irresponsible to require the military \ndepartments to further curtail training and maintenance, and cause more \ndegradation in combat readiness.\n  While this supplemental is necessary, I was surprised to see that the \nAppropriations Committee chose to fully offset the costs of these peace \noperations, which were ill-conceived and not approved by the Congress, \nfrom within the fiscal year 1995 Defense budget. In others words, under \nthis bill the Department of Defense must fund those operations totally \nwithin its existing budget.\n  I have said over and over that the defense budget has been cut too \nmuch, too fast. I have strongly supported an increase to the \nPresident's budget request to bring fiscal year 1996 defense funding \nlevel with fiscal year 1995, adjusted for inflation. This supplemental, \nin effect, reduces funds available for defense in fiscal year 1995 by \nrequiring these externally imposed operations to be absorbed within the \ncurrent defense budget.\n  This is a very complex and difficult issue. Fortunately the \nAppropriations Committee has offset these extra costs with programs \nwhich, for the most part, can be called nondefense items; or programs \nwhich the Defense Department could not execute in this fiscal year. By \nfully offsetting the supplemental appropriations, the deficit is not \nincreased. In fact, title II actually reduces the deficit from domestic \naccounts.\n  I am a strong supporter of removing nondefense items from the defense \nbudget, and have long been a supporter of a balanced budget and \nreducing the deficit. However, I am concerned at the precedent we may \nbe setting by finding all the offsets in the current defense budget.\n  I do not support using our military forces as a global police force \nor social service agency, deploying them all over the world without the \nexpressed approval of the Congress. We have reduced our Armed Forces \nand defense resources to dangerously low levels. Now it is questionable \nwhether we can defend our vital interests in a conflict with one or \nmore major regional powers. Consequently, I do not want the \nadministration to regard approval of this supplemental appropriations \nbill as endorsement of their expanded peacekeeping activities abroad, \nnor of \n [[Page S3584]] their plan to pay for these excursions with current \ndefense funds.\n  In closing, I reiterate my support for this Defense supplemental, but \nurge my friends on the Appropriations Committee to consider the method \nused in preparing this bill as a one time event, and not as a model for \nfuture supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense.\n  I thank the Chair; I yield the floor.\n                           Amendment No. 321\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate affirming the importance \n of, and the need for, cost-shared partnerships between the Department \n  of Defense and the private sector to develop dual-use technologies)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, to the first amendment of the \ncommittee, I send a second-degree amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Nunn, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     321:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       Sec. 110. It is the sense of the Senate that (1) cost-\n     shared partnerships between the Department of Defense and the \n     private sector to develop dual-use technologies (technologies \n     that have applications both for defense and for commercial \n     markets, such as computers, electronics, advanced materials, \n     communications, and sensors) are increasingly important to \n     ensure efficient use of defense procurement resources, and \n     (2) such partnerships, including Sematech and the Technology \n     Reinvestment Project, need to become the norm for conducting \n     such applied research by the Department of Defense.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me very briefly describe the \namendment and yield to my colleague, Senator Nunn, who wants to make a \nbrief statement also. Then I will describe it in a little more depth \nfor my colleagues.\n  This amendment expresses the sense of the Senate--and that is all it \nis, a sense-of-the-Senate amendment--that cost-shared partnerships to \ndevelop dual-use technologies are important and increasingly important \nto ensure the efficient use of our defense resources. It specifies that \nthese partnerships, including the technology reinvestment project, need \nto become the norm for conducting much of our applied research in the \nPentagon.\n  This language came out of the work of two different task forces, the \nDemocratic task force back in 1992, which Senator Pryor chaired, and \nthe Republican task force which Senator Rudman chaired. Members of this \nbody who were part of that Rudman task force include, of course, \nSenator Stevens, Senator Lugar, Senator Cohen, Senator Hatch, Senator \nDomenici, Senator McCain, Senator Lott, Senator Warner, and there were \nothers as well. Out of the work of the two task force groups we \ndeveloped a bipartisan consensus which began during the Bush Presidency \nand has continued through the Clinton Presidency that this way of \nfunding for defense purposes was an important effort to pursue.\n  I believe this amendment helps to reaffirm that principle, and for \nthat reason I offer the amendment. As I pointed out, it is a sense of \nthe Senate. It does not try to change the dollar figures as they come \nout of the supplemental agreement.\n  I want to compliment the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from \nHawaii in the work they have done in the subcommittee to try to do what \nthey could to ensure that this important program, the technology \nreinvestment project, continue, and also to find the funds necessary to \nmeet the needs of our Department of Defense at this crucial time.\n  I will explain the amendment in some more detail in a moment. I would \nlike at this point to yield the floor and allow the Senator from \nGeorgia to go ahead and speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby my colleague from New Mexico. I appreciate the pressures on the \nAppropriations Committee. The Senator from Hawaii and the Senator from \nAlaska have done a commendable job in trying to handle this \nsupplemental under very difficult circumstances.\n  I share the sentiments expressed by the Senator from South Carolina \nabout the overall supplemental. I hope it is viewed as a one-shot \nproposition, because if we are sending a signal to the Department of \nDefense that any time there is an emergency that comes up and they come \nover and request supplemental funds that they are going to have to have \n100 percent offset, then we are going to change the nature of the \nresponsiveness of the Department of Defense itself to the missions that \nmay, indeed, be crucial to our Nation's security.\n  One mission comes to mind on a hopefully hypothetical basis, but it \ncould become a reality. We may get into a situation, even in the next \n30 or 45 days in Croatia, where the United Nations is ordered to get \nout of Croatia. There is no doubt that this evacuation could \nprecipitate more fighting in Bosnia, and could even require rescue \nmissions to get U.N. personnel who are in harm's way in Bosnia out of \nthat war-stricken area.\n  And if the Department of Defense is told that anything they do in \nthat kind of rescue mission with NATO and with the United Nations is \ngoing to have to be a 100 percent offset, and they are going to have to \nbasically kill or substantially alter crucial defense programs in order \nto absorb that, then that is going to be a very strong signal that the \nUnited States is not going to be as involved as we have been in world \naffairs, including commitments to our allies and commitments that we \nhave voted for at the U.N. Security Council.\n  So this complete offset sounds good in speeches but it has very \nserious implications for the Department of Defense. Make no mistake \nabout it, this complete offset policy means the long-term readiness of \nthe Department of Defense is going to go down. It does not mean that \nthe immediate readiness is going down because that can be protected. \nBut future readiness requires modernization, it requires research and \ndevelopment, and those are the programs being cut by this complete \noffset policy. So 5, 6, 7 years from now, people will have a very \nserious problem with readiness if we continue to declare there is no \nemergency even when our forces are responding to the unanticipated \nevents that we all know will take place in the world from time to time.\n  I hope this is not viewed as precedent. As my friend, the chairman of \nthe committee, the Senator from South Carolina, said: If this is a \nprecedent, we are going to have some serious problems.\n  I know the Department of Defense worked with the Senator from Alaska \nand the Senator from Hawaii in identifying offsets. I know they are \nstill concerned about certain programs, such as the program Senator \nBingaman is discussing, the technology reinvestment program, which is \none of the programs that is being severely impacted by this \nsupplemental.\n  Also, environmental cleanup is being impacted severely under this \nbill. And that environmental cleanup is not only something that has to \nbe done in base closures, but we have solemn commitments to Governors \nin a number of States that we are going to carry that out. And as we \ncut back on these environmental impact funds in the Department of \nDefense, make no mistake about it, there are going to be lawsuits \ninvolved, litigation involved, contractual obligations that are going \nto have to be breached. I do not say that all of that is going to flow \nfrom this bill. But it is going to flow if we continue to have to take \nthese kinds of actions.\n  So I understand the Senator from Alaska has worked very hard on this, \nas has the Senator from Hawaii, who has put up a warning light about \nthe direction that this bill takes us in. I hope that not only the \nAppropriations Committee--because they are carrying out, I have no \ndoubt, the will of the majority here--but I hope the majority itself \nwill think about the implications for defense. Because one of the \nthings in the Contract With America, and in other commitments made by \nthose on both sides in running for office, was a strong national \ndefense and protecting readiness. The problem is, Madam President, \nreadiness is being defined as just the next year or two, when readiness \nhas to be defined over the next 5 to 10 years. And readiness, by that \ndefinition, includes research and development and includes procurement. \nAnd \n [[Page S3585]] without the kind of long-term commitment to research \nand development and to procurement, we simply will not have modern and \nready forces 5 years from now or 10 years from now.\n  So I rise in support of the amendment offered by my colleague from \nNew Mexico. I support the TRP Program as one of those crucial programs \nfor future military readiness for several reasons. First, it is our \nbridge to the future for the technology needs of the Department of \nDefense. We all know how difficult it has become to fund the technology \nprograms we know we will need for the forces that will be in the field \n10 years from now and 15 years from now. We are having to depend more \nand more on research conducted by the civil sector of our economy.\n  For a long time the research and development flowed from defense to \nthe civil sector. That is still true in some cases, but increasingly a \nlarger and larger percent of our crucial defense technology is flowing \nfrom the civilian commercial sector to the Department of Defense. The \nDefense Department can no longer afford to be the leading edge of every \ntechnology. TRP gives us access to those dual-use research projects \nthat will benefit both the defense and the commercial sectors.\n  Second, because the research is dual-use, it is cost shared. Industry \nis paying the bulk of the cost in most of the TRP projects. This means \nthat for every dollar we put in the TRP program we get from $2 to $10 \nof research that helps our defense efforts from the private sector. So \nthis is leveraged money. We get a lot more back from the private sector \nthan the Federal dollars we put in.\n  Third, the TRP program is competitive. It is not in any way pork. It \nis based on merit and on competitive selection. The research goes to \nthose institutions that propose the most important research projects \nand who propose the best cost-sharing arrangements. This is how we \nassure ourselves that the work is important. Industry would not put \ntheir money or time on the line if they did not think the research \nwould pay off for them and for the Nation.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the Bingaman amendment, which does \nnot, as I understand it, shift funds but which expresses the strong \nsentiment of the Senate on these programs.\n  I urge my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens \nand Senator Inouye, to do the best they can in conference to hold the \nSenate mark and not to cut below the Senate mark, which is already \ngoing to take this program to a point of some jeopardy.\n  So I thank the Senator for his leadership. This has been a subject \nthat he has led in the Senate Armed Services Committee and in the \nSenate and in the Congress. In my view, the Senator from New Mexico has \ndone a great deal of meritorious work for our long-range national \nsecurity by taking the lead on this program. So I thank him for his \nleadership, and I thank him for yielding.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Nunn of Georgia, \nthe ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, who was the \nchairman of the committee at the time that we began these programs \nseveral years ago while President Bush was in the White House.\n  Let me just go through a few statements to indicate the broad range \nof support for the general principle that I am talking about here.\n  First, let me cite from the report of the task force that former \nSenator Rudman chaired, a Senate Republican Task Force on Adjusting the \nDefense Base. The report was published in June 1992. It was a report \nwhich was well received. Senator Pryor championed and chaired a similar \ngroup on the Democratic side. Let me just cite a few sentences from the \nreport of the Rudman committee.\n\n       The task force believes that increased funds should be \n     devoted to the development of so-called dual-use \n     technologies--that is, technologies that have application \n     both for defense and commercial markets--by entering into \n     partnerships with the private sector. Dual-use technologies \n     will be increasingly important to ensure efficient use of \n     defense procurement resources, and advances in this area will \n     have the added benefit of strengthening the U.S. commercial \n     sector. In order for these projects to be effective, there \n     should be a requirement that half of the funding be provided \n     by non-federal participants.\n\n  I also want to cite a statement issued by the White House in \nSeptember 1992. This was, of course, while President Bush was in the \nWhite House. This was, I believe, a statement that that administration \nand that President felt strongly that these were worthwhile activities. \nOn the 15th of September the statement was issued by the President's \nPress Office.\n\n       The President today transmitted to the Congress budget \n     amendments for the Department of Defense that would \n     reallocate $250 million of the Department's fiscal year 1993 \n     request to defense advanced technology programs. The \n     reallocated funds would be used in the areas of \n     communications, high performance computers, small satellites, \n     sensors to identify environmental contamination and \n     manufacturing technology. These areas are essential to \n     national security, and also have dual-use civilian \n     applications. The funds for these advanced technology \n     programs would be reallocated from lower priority defense \n     programs.\n\n  Madam President, the views that were expressed in 1992, both by the \ngroup of Senators who participated in the Rudman task force and by the \nWhite House under President Bush, were echoed very recently in a \nhearing we had before the Armed Services Committee where I asked, \nfirst, General Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nwhat his view was on the value of these types of programs and where \nthey fit in the priorities of the administration today.\n  He said, and let me quote his response to my question.\n\n       Senator Bingaman, I am first of all extraordinarily \n     enthused about the possibilities that exist out there for us \n     to take a major step forward and a major step forward in \n     comparison to all of our potential adversaries in this area \n     that you described, dominant battlefield awareness. Through \n     our advances in microelectronics, satellite technology and \n     what not, we have the ability to see and be aware of what is \n     going on on the battlefield to a degree that will literally, \n     I believe, revolutionize warfare. So this is not just making \n     sure that we have the next best tank or the next best \n     destroyer. This is an effort to really take a major step \n     forward.\n       Now, much of the technology for that, we believe, probably \n     already exists out there in the commercial world, and \n     certainly those companies like AT, and others that are \n     working on projects, where these same pieces are necessary \n     commercially, that we need to be aware of it, capture it, \n     integrate it into the work that we do so that we not only \n     capture the very best that is out there, but do not spend \n     taxpayers' money trying to reinvent the wheel in our own \n     laboratories.\n\n  Let me cite one other authority in this field, Madam President. This \ncomes from sometime further back in our history. The year is 1946. We \nhave a memo from the Chief of Staff of the Department of the War. He \nsays in that memo. This is, of course, following the Second World War.\n\n       The Armed Forces could not have won the war alone. \n     Scientists and businessmen contributed techniques and weapons \n     which enabled us to outwit and overwhelm the enemy. Their \n     understanding of the army's needs made possible the highest \n     degree of cooperation. This pattern of integration must be \n     translated into a peacetime counterpart which will not merely \n     familiarize the Army with the progress made in science and \n     industry but draw into our planning for national security all \n     the civilian resources which can contribute to the defense of \n     the country.\n\n  That is a statement, of course, from General Eisenhower shortly after \nthe Second World War. So the concept that we are arguing for here--\nintegration of our military and commercial technology bases--the \nimportance of this principle, I think has been recognized for a long \ntime.\n  The superpower, in a defense sense, the superpower in the 21st \ncentury will be that nation that best leverages its national technology \nand industrial base to achieve critical defense goals. Dominant \nbattlefield awareness is one of those recognized goals of our Defense \nDepartment today, and clearly emphasis on these dual-use technologies \nis important for us to achieve that dominant battlefield awareness. \nThat is the view of General Shalikashvili.\n  DOD-industry partnerships have been successful. Our $700 million \ninvestment in SEMATECH over the past 8 years, which has been matched by \nindustry, has been an enormously more productive investment than some \nof our earlier investments in defense-specific semiconductor research.\n  Secretary Perry also has come out very strongly in support of this. \nLet \n [[Page S3586]] me just cite a quotation from him before I conclude, \nMadam President, because he spoke well the other day about the \nimportance of these programs. I asked him where these stood in his list \nof priorities, and he said, and I quote:\n\n       I consider it [the Technology Reinvestment Project] one of \n     our highest priority programs. I hope I have the opportunity \n     with the Congress to defend--to vigorously defend--the \n     importance of this program. I think some of the moves to \n     rescind it and criticize it are made from some confusion as \n     to what the program is. It is being confused with some of the \n     technology earmark programs which have been added by Congress \n     in past years. I would remind all of this committee--\n\n  That was the Armed Services Committee.\n\n     that all TRP programs are competitive. Indeed, they are \n     highly competitive. There are many--indeed, sometimes dozens \n     of--companies submitting proposals on them. So we get the \n     best out of many different proposals. And secondly, all of \n     them are funded 50 percent by industry; at least 50 percent \n     by industry. So they are very highly leveraged. We get quite \n     a good benefit from this. We depend in the future on being \n     able to integrate our defense technology base into the \n     national technology base and this TRP program is an absolute \n     key to doing that, and any individual TRP program is a good \n     deal in and of itself.\n\n  Madam President, that sums up the case. I think the procedural \nsituation we find ourselves in has been alluded to before. Let me just \nreiterate it. We have a proposal from the House of Representatives \nwhich would rescind the $502 million in the TRP; the entire amount.\n  The appropriators here on the Senate side have concluded that they \nhave to, because of the other pressing needs of the Defense Department, \nrescind $200 million. Quite frankly, that is a very, very major cut in \nthis program which I think will undoubtedly do damage to the program. \nBut I am willing to defer to their judgment. I am willing to do as all \nof us will have to do in the coming months; that is, tighten our belts \nto deal with our budgetary problems. I am willing to take their \ncommitment that they will go to conference and fight as best they can \nto maintain the Senate position and keep this program alive and \nhealthy.\n  This is a very high priority for our Department of Defense. I believe \nit is a high bipartisan priority for many here in the Congress.\n  Madam President, before I conclude and sit down, let me just \nindicate, as cosponsors on the amendment that I have sent to the desk, \nI want to list Senators Nunn, Lieberman, Rockefeller, and Bob Kerrey \nfrom Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I wish to commend my distinguished \ncolleague from New Mexico for his extraordinary leadership in guiding \nthe TRP policy and program throughout all of these years.\n  I wish to, at this time, provide to my friend from New Mexico my \npersonal assurance that everything possible will be done to maintain \nthe Senate position on this matter. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I do not intend to oppose what the \nmanagers seek. This is a voice vote on this amendment, primarily \nbecause it is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  I will have a lot of remarks to make about the TRP program and about \nwhere it should be in the priority list of the needs of the American \ndefense establishment. My amendment that will be forthcoming will \naddress the TRP. I will save my remarks for that eventuality, which I \nhope will take place as soon as this amendment is disposed of.\n  Let me just say that there are a lot of nice-to-have things that we \nshould use our defense funds for. There are a lot of very necessary and \nvital things and missions and purposes that are not being fulfilled \nnow. I do not rank TRP as one of those that is vital. I view it as one \nthat is nice to have.\n  I have very serious question about the criteria that are used and, \nindeed, many of the funding of specific projects, which I will name \nwhen I get into my amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I want to set the stage for \nconsideration of this amendment. The House proposed rescission of $502 \nmillion in what is known as this Technology Reinvestment Program [TRP]. \nTRP will be in conference, in other words.\n  Our committee responded to the Department of Defense's appeals to the \nSenate to support the TRP program. To date, the Department has received \n3,000 proposals for TRP, and selected only 251 for funding. It is an \nextremely competitive process which has produced about an 8.5-percent \nsuccess rate. That is unfortunate.\n  The Senate recommendation allows the Advanced Research Projects \nAgency [ARPA], the agency of the Defense Department that has \njurisdiction over this program, to continue the ongoing TRP projects. \nWe have provided enough funds to begin new projects and to continue, as \nI said, the ongoing projects. The new projects will focus on areas \nselected by the military services themselves.\n  This is a mandate promoted by our committee and approved by Congress. \nThe Senate's proposed rescission will reinforce Congress' requirement \nthat we mean to assure that defense needs are the dominant element in \neach TRP project and will eliminate funds for projects that do not have \ndefense relevance.\n  Indeed, the Congress took specific legislative steps to ensure this \ngreater service role in the TRP effort.\n  First, Congress mandated that the Assistant Secretaries for Research, \nDevelopment, and Acquisition for each of the military services be made \nfull members of the council which approves all TRP projects.\n  Second, the Congress directed that $75 million in fiscal year 1995 \nTRP funds were to be available only for projects selected in areas of \ninterest designated exclusively by the military service acquisition \nexecutives.\n  Every TRP project includes at least 50 percent cost share from the \nteams performing the work. Thus, the Pentagon is able to get twice as \nmuch or more for each Federal dollar invested in these programs.\n  While a lower level of investment in TRP is in order as we search for \nfunds necessary to restore the readiness, as I mentioned before, we do \nnot believe we should terminate this program.\n  I also think it is noteworthy, Madam President, that the sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution here mentioned Sematech. Sematech is a consortium \nof major U.S. chip manufacturing firms. Sematech has achieved a number \nof things. However, the consortium has received substantial Federal \nfunding for 3 years more than was originally planned.\n  Sematech demonstrates that we must set firm, clear objectives for \nthese projects and limit the efforts to a definite, finite duration. \nThese efforts cannot become entitlements which annually drain the DOD's \nlimited budget dollars.\n  I do not want to leave the impression that these projects have not \nbeen successful. I have a list here of the projects which we feel do \ncontribute to Department of Defense needs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that list be printed in \nthe Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          A List of TRP Projects Which Contribute to DOD Needs\n\n       Affordable Composites for Propulsion (Value--$25.0 million, \n     Prime--Pratt & Whitney, West Palm Beach, Florida).\n       Precision Laser Machine (Value--$33.8 million, Prime--TRW, \n     Redondo Beach, California).\n       Uncooled Low Cost Infrared (IR) Sensors Technology \n     Reinvestment Alliance (ULTRA) (Value--$9.2 million, Prime--\n     Inframetrics Inc., North Billerica, Massachusetts).\n       Trauma Care Information Management System (Value--$15.1 \n     million, Prime--Rockwell International Corporation, \n     Richardson, Texas).\n       Digital X-Ray system for Trauma and Battlefield \n     Applications (Value--$6.1 million; Prime--General Electric \n     Corporate Research & Development, Schenectady, New York).\n       Next Generation High Resolution & Color Thin Film \n     Electroluminescence (TFEL) Displays (Value--$29.2 million, \n     Prime--Planar Systems, Inc., Beaverton, Oregon).\n       [[Page S3587]] Developing Speech Recognition for Future \n     DSP's in Hand Held Computers (Value--$3.0 million; Prime--\n     Dragon Systems, Inc., Newton, Massachusetts).\n       Development of Monolithic Motion-Detecting Components Made \n     with MEMS Technology (Value--$7.6 million; Prime--Analog \n     Devices, Inc., Wilmington, Massachusetts).\n       Wearable Computer Systems with Transparent, Headmounted \n     Displays for Manufacturing, Maintenance, and Training \n     Applications (Value--$5.1 million; Prime--Boeing Computer \n     Services, Bellevue, Washington).\n       Object Technology for Rapid Software Development and \n     Delivery (Value--$24.5 million; Prime--Anderson Consulting, \n     Chicago, Illinois).\n       Portable Shipbuilding Robotics (Value--$12.5 million; \n     Prime--CYBO Robots, Inc., Indianapolis, Indiana).\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \namendment offered by my colleague from New Mexico. I would also like to \ncommend my colleague for his strong leadership on this issue.\n  At a time when we must be very prudent in allocating our resources, \ndual use defense programs, like TRP and Sematech can prove to be a good \ninvestment. These programs enable the Department of Defense to \ncompetitively leverage Federal dollars with private sector matching \nfunds to better meet our defense--and domestic--needs.\n  If we are serious about balancing the budget and getting our fiscal \nhouse in order, then we are going to need to find additional savings in \nall areas of the Federal budget, including the defense budget. As the \ndefense budget declines, it will become cost prohibitive for the \nDepartment of Defense to sustain a separate defense industrial base, \nwhich in many cases might very well be duplicative. Programs like TRP \nand Sematech capitalize on presently available new commercial \ntechnologies to meet military needs. In an era of limited resources, \nthese programs enable us to make better use of the funds that are \navailable.\n  The TRP has come under some scrutiny for ineffective management of \nlate. And I would agree that, like most every other program in the \nFederal Government, TRP could be managed more efficiently. But that is \nnot a reason to cut funding for what is on the whole a good program.\n  Dual-use programs, like TRP and Sematech, allow the Department of \nDefense to maximize its research and development dollars. For its part, \nthe Department of Defense gets technologies which are critical to our \nNation's military needs. While the companies, on the other hand, get \ntechnology which will enable them to compete more effectively in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, if there is no further comment, I ask \nfor a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 321) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nKennedy be added as a cosponsor of the previous amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                        Privileges of the Floor\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Joseph \nFengler and Mr. Sujata Millick be permitted privileges of the floor \nduring consideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 322\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 322.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 21, line 9, strike out ``$300,000,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$150,000,000''.\n       On page 22, line 15, strike out ``$351,000,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$653,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, this amendment would restore half, $150 \nmillion, of the committee-recommended cut in defense environmental \nrestoration account, and the amendment would offset this spending with \nrecision of an additional $302 million in the Technology Reinvestment \nProgram known as TRP.\n  The net effect of the amendment is to reduce defense budget authority \nby $152 million and outlays by $110 million in fiscal year 1995, which \ncould be credited to deficit reduction.\n  Madam President, first of all, in the past several years, as we all \nknow, the Department of Defense has experienced significant increases \nin the cost of environmental cleanup, as have most public and private \nindustries. All we have to do is look at the Superfund and know of the \nenormous challenges that face this country in the area of environmental \ncleanup.\n  Because of these costs, I think the reduction of $300 million in \ndefense environmental restoration is too severe a reduction. In \naddition, my colleagues should be aware that the account which is being \ncut will be the source of funding to clean up at bases recommended for \nclosure in the 1995 round, at least until the 1996 appropriation of \nBRAC cleanup is approved. Cutting this account could therefore have an \neffect on the cleanup of bases that are being closed.\n  Finally, Madam President, State and local governments have the \nability under the law to enforce stricter standards for cleanup than \nFederal law requires. State and local governments also have the ability \nto levy fines and penalties against the Department of Defense if it \nfails to comply with these standards. If too much is cut from this \naccount, then the Department of Defense may find itself using \nenvironmental restoration funds to pay fines and litigate court cases \narising from noncompliance with State and local laws. That does not \nseem to be an efficient use of these limited dollars.\n  Madam President, the fact is that when we close a base or even if we \nhave an open base and there is an environmental problem on those bases, \nI think our obligation is clear. Our obligation is clear that we clean \nup that base. Clearly, it is a very expensive proposition. And there is \nno doubt that if we cut these funds, somewhere there will be military \ninstallations that are environmentally unsafe.\n  I do not see how we get around that obligation. I do not see how we \ncan just cut money for environmental cleanup and ignore the very severe \nsituations that exist today. There is a base in my own home State. It \nwill be many years before the environmental cleanup is completed. The \nestimate of the cost of that cleanup, by the way, has increased by a \nfactor of 10 since the base was recommended to be closed just 3 years \nago.\n  So, I do not really understand how we rationalize a reduction in \nenvironmental cleanup funds. I do not think my record indicates that I \nam some kind of a wild-eyed environmentalist, to say the least. But I \ndo not see how we cannot fulfill the obligation that we have to the \ntaxpayers of America, and that is to clean up defense installations \nwhich reside in their States and their communities that are in need of \nenvironmental cleanup.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the TRP, which is obviously a very \nattractive program to many. It is the Technology Reinvestment Program. \nFirst of all, the selection criteria which I quote from the ARPA \nprogram information package for the Technology Reinvestment Program for \nthe 1995 competition states that the criteria should be for technology \ndevelopment competition only incorporating all statutory selection \ncriteria for the three statutory programs under which the competition \nis being conducted. They should be defense relevant. Results of future \ncommercialization of product or of the process are as follows: critical \ndefense technology is preserved; a defense capability is more \naffordable; or--and I emphasize ``or''--a significant improvement in \nhouse safety or environment, especially in manufacturing, is \naccomplished.\n  Madam President, that ``or'' seems to be the operative clause here. \nOtherwise, I do not see how in the world we would approve of the San \nFrancisco \n [[Page S3588]] Bay Area Rapid Transit Authority receiving $39 million \nfor a 2-year effort to demonstrate a precision location system for \ntrains in tunnels. I do not see how that is a critical defense \ntechnology being preserved or a defense capability being more \naffordable.\n  And, $6.9 million was awarded to a consortium of businesses and \ngovernment entities based in the Southeastern United States to assist \nsmall businesses and in developing pollution prevention and \nenvironmentally safe industrial processes; $15.8 million was awarded to \ndemonstrate the feasibility of establishing online linkage of medical \ndata bases among medical centers in hospitals across the United States; \n$7.6 million was shelled out for a project designed to develop highly \nefficient power electronic building blocks to convert, control, and \ncondition electricity to meet U.S. commercial electrical requirements.\n  Madam President, in my view, it would take a great leap of the \nimagination to view those as a critical defense technology being \npreserved or defense capability being more affordable. It probably \nmeets a significant improvement in health safety or environment, or it \ncould be construed as such.\n  The fact is that the TRP is probably a very nice thing to have. Last \nyear, in the fiscal year 1995 National Defense Act, I sponsored \nlegislation to require the GAO to independently assess the TRP awards \nin the context of the objectives specified in law.\n  Although the review is not yet complete, GAO's tentative findings \nshow that TRP awards were generally not driven by the military \ncriteria. In fact, GAO found that the panel members who reviewed \nproposals submitted to DOD for TRP awards were not even briefed on the \nlegislative objectives of the program. Thus, a national security \ncriteria was generally accorded lesser rank weight in the \ndecisionmaking process. The final report of the GAO will be available \nin May.\n  We have already spent $1.4 billion for the TRP program in the past 3 \nyears, in my view, with little to show for it in the way of militarily \nuseful technologies. As a result, I think the action of the House \nAppropriations subcommittee recommended rescission of most of the 1995 \nfunds for this program, in my view, should be the same.\n  Let me talk about priorities a second. This is $302 million that \nwould be earmarked for this particular program, appropriated for this \nparticular program.\n  Today on the front page of the Washington Post:\n\n       Fort Bragg, NC--After decades of neglect, U.S. military \n     housing has so deteriorated that Pentagon leaders say it is \n     discouraging soldiers from reenlisting and thereby \n     handicapping the military's readiness.\n       Many barracks and family apartments, built soon after World \n     War II, are cramped and suffer from peeling lead-based paint, \n     hazardous asbestos, cracked foundations, corroded pipes or \n     faulty heating and cooling systems.\n       More than half the family housing is rated inadequate, and \n     Defense Secretary William J. Perry cites the poor condition \n     of military housing as the number one complaint he hears from \n     soldiers on visits to bases.\n       But at a time of shrinking budgets, Pentagon officials have \n     come up with only some token extra millions of dollars to \n     throw at a problem requiring billions--\n\n  I repeat--\n\n     requiring billions to fix.\n\n  Madam President, last year, the administration sent over a request \nthat did not include the pay raise for the men and women in the \nmilitary. There are hints we now have--the quaint phrase--\n``congressionally mandated pay raises.'' Congressionally mandated pay \nraises. That is interesting, because the fact is the pay raises for the \nmen and women in the military to keep up with the cost-of-living should \nnot be congressionally mandated. They should be requested by the \nadministration, which I am happy to see that they are doing with this \nyear's 1996 budget. But for 2 years, there was no request for pay \nraises for the military.\n  I do not know how we justify this kind of spending when we have \ninadequate housing, when we have men and women in the military who are \nspending incredible times away from home, when we are cutting back on \nflying hours, steaming hours and training hours, when any objective \nobserver has agreed that we need to improve the readiness, and that \nreadiness is beginning to suffer rather significantly, and yet we have \nalready spent $1.4 billion, and are now spending an additional $150 \nmillion.\n  I also want to return for a minute to the issue of environmental \ncleanup. Unless a base is environmentally clean, or substantially so, a \nbase cannot be turned over to the local authorities, or whoever is \ninvolved in the negotiations for the use of that base. We know what \nhappens to the costs of environmental cleanup. And now for us to cut \nthe funding for environmental cleanup, in my view, would be a very, \nvery serious mistake.\n  I want to say that Sematech is a successful endeavor. Sematech, I \nbelieve, has been a wise investment of America's tax dollars, and I \nalso think it is well to point out that 1996 will be the last year that \nSematech requires Government appropriations, which is exactly the way \nit was designed and is exactly the way that these things should be \naccomplished.\n  But I suggest that in this era of very tough priorities--in testimony \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee this morning from the \nSecretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations also making \nclear that their priorities, if there was any additional money, would \ngo to additional aircraft, additional ships, additional pay and \nbenefits for the men and women in the military. Nowhere--nowhere--do I \nhear any member of the uniformed military even knows what TRP is much \nless believe that it is a national priority.\n  So, Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, there is a great deal of what the \nSenator from Arizona said with which I agree, but I think that he has \noverlooked the task that we had. We had the task of finding almost $2 \nbillion, and we are five-twelfths through the year in terms of the \nmoneys with which we are dealing. As a practical matter, the largest \naccount that is unspent is, in fact, that which is entitled \n``environmental funding.''\n  It is a little bit more than $5.5 billion, and we are affecting by \nthe recommendations we have made here less than 6 percent of the total \nfunding for the environmental accounts. Other items that we are dealing \nwith, particularly in terms of the TRP funds, represent a great deal \nmore of the account.\n  Let me just say this: If I had a way now to put the money that is in \neither account into the military construction bill, I would do that. In \nthe last year, at my request, we added--and that was one of those \ninfamous congressional add-ons to the budget--$81 million for \nadditional military housing. I wish we could get a greater interest in \nupgrading this housing, and I think that the story on the front page of \nthe Post is very accurate.\n  But the problem really is that if we look at the environmental \naccount, which we did in great detail, we are looking at a project \nwhere they still plan to spend $810 million in this fiscal year on \nstudies of these environmental restoration sites. We have eliminated a \nsubstantial portion of those studies. That is what our cut does.\n  We have urged that the Department proceed now and not spend so much \nmoney studying these projects and instead do them. They are not that \nlarge and they mostly can be done without these enormous nationwide \nstudies. They just seem to be enveloped in studies.\n  We will have reduced the budget request by $700 million through this \nrescission, and it is primarily aimed at that study account. If we look \nat this account, as I have said, DOD has spent almost 60 percent of all \nof the cleanup funds we have made available so far on studies. We think \nthat at a time of emergencies such as this is, it is time to reallocate \nfunds. Again, we are not increasing funds for either the TRP, that is \nthe Technology Reinvestment Program, or the environmental restoration \naccount. We are decreasing both. So we are talking about where to cut \nmore.\n  If we look at the amount of money available, there is a great deal \nmore money available in the environmental \n [[Page S3589]] restoration account, mainly because it is reserved for \nstudies which can be conducted next year, if necessary. If they are \nnecessary, we can appropriate money for them in 1996. But right now, \nthere are other projects which are ongoing in the Technology \nReinvestment Program. I already put the list in the Record.\n  There is an affordable composites for propulsion project in Florida.\n  There is a precision laser machine project in California, Redondo \nBeach.\n  There is an uncooled low-cost infrared sensor technology reinvestment \nprogram in Massachusetts.\n  There is a trauma care information management system in Richardson, \nTX.\n  There is a digital x-ray system for trauma and battlefield \napplications in Schenectady, NY.\n  There is a next generation high resolution thin film \nelectroluminescent, what we call a TFEL display, again, with a military \nimpact, in Beaverton, OR.\n  There is a speech recognition by digital signal processors for hand-\nheld computers, again, defense impact in Newton, MA.\n  There is a monolithic motion detecting components technology with \nmicroelectrical mechanical systems, again it is in Massachusetts.\n  There is one in Bellevue, WA, wearable computer systems with a \ntransparent head mounted display for, basically, computer services in \naircraft.\n  They are all very high-tech and, as far as we can see, they ought to \nbe continued. We have provided enough money so that we do not have to \nreduce any of the ongoing projects.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment of the Senator from Arizona will do \nthat. It will reduce the funds that are available for ongoing projects. \nIt will increase the reduction in the program of the technology \nreinvestment area, that I just mentioned, by $302 million.\n  It restores a portion of the money to the environmental restoration \naccount, money that is really not needed this year. It is there. It is \navailable. It has been appropriated. As a matter of fact, in recent \nyears, there has been a substantial carryover in that account. I urge \nthe Senate to take the recommendation of the committee. It was reached \nafter substantial consultation with both the military services and the \ncivilian people in the Department of Defense. It is a level which no \none likes to see reached. The moneys are being reduced for both \naccounts. But I tell the Senate, if we are going to find $2 billion and \ndo the least harm to ongoing projects that have already been approved, \nwe should take from the money that is in this enormous account of \nalmost $6 billion and take it from the area of the planned studies. No \nongoing cleanup project should be harmed.\n  Incidentally, as I indicated in the beginning of my statement, the \nmoneys for base closure environmental studies are already there. We \nhave not touched them at all. The real emergency areas where we are \nhaving to do specific environmental projects, in the process of \ncarrying out the base closure process, have not been at all affected by \nthe recommendations that we have made from the committee.\n  I urge the Senate to realize that we had before us a rescission from \nthe Technology Reinvestment Program from the House. This will be a \nconference issue. Both the House and the Senate proposed to reduce that \nfund but not by the same amount.\n  When we look at the ongoing projects under the Technology \nReinvestment Program in which we have already invested some taxpayers' \nmoney, if we are going to use the money efficiently, we should provide \nenough to carry out those projects, and that is what we have done. That \nbasically is all we have done.\n  So I do hope that we can keep the TRP funding at the level we have \nindicated. I do believe the House may insist on changing it somewhat. \nAs a matter of fact, the House is probably going to insist on changing \nseveral of the items where we have made changes in their \nrecommendations. But we made an extensive study of this, and I \npersonally had several meetings with the Deputy Secretary of Defense, \nDr. Deutch, because of his personal interest in the subject matter and \nin the concept of technology. We have kept the cut but not at the level \nsuggested by the Senator from Arizona.\n  I urge the Senate to keep the recommendations of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. They were reached after, as I said, \nsubstantial consultation with those involved in the projects.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I wish to speak briefly to support the \nstatements the Senator from Alaska has made and the position the \nAppropriations Committee has come to the floor with in this area.\n  As I think the Senator from Arizona pointed out, his amendment would \ndo two things, two very different things. It would, first of all, cut \nand eliminate the technology reinvestment project by rescinding all of \nthe funds in that program, which I think would be a very misguided \naction by this Congress.\n  Second, it would restore some of those funds to the environmental \ncleanup activity. The Senator from Arizona pointed out that he himself \nhas not been known as a wild-eyed environmentalist. I think that was \nthe phrase he used. I certainly think there is some truth to that.\n  Earlier, after this last election, on December 5, 1994, he and \nSenator Warner sent a letter to President Clinton urging that much of \nthe funding be dropped in the defense budget and specific programs be \neliminated, and in that list of programs he sent to the President he \nhimself proposed that DOD and DOE defense environmental programs be \nreduced by $930 million in fiscal year 1995.\n  The proposal of the subcommittee is to reduce them by $400 million \ntotal, and I think that is a much more reasonable level of funding in \nthose areas.\n  Let me also talk a moment about the TRP. I think the Senator from \nAlaska did a good job of pointing out that there are many useful \ndefense-related programs going forward with TRP funding.\n  Let me just cite a couple of them. One of the programs is the \nmultichip module program. The breakthrough in the 1960's was the \nmicrochip where many, many transistors could be put on one small piece \nof silicon to dramatically reduce the size, weight, and cost of \nelectronics. The military was the first user of microelectronics and \nthis was the technology that made the ICBM and all later advanced \nweapons possible. Of course, now the commercial demand for this \ntechnology dwarfs the military market. But that does not diminish its \nimportance to the Defense Department.\n  The breakthrough of the 1990's is the multichip module technology \nwhere many, many chips are put on one common substrate to dramatically \nincrease once again military system performance and lower their costs. \nTRP is meeting this challenge by cost sharing an effort with the \nconsortium that brings together the emerging participants in this new \nindustry in an effort to lower equipment manufacturing costs by making \nall needed technology advances simultaneously. Members include GM \nHughes Electronics, IBM, Micromodule Systems, Motorola, nChip, Polycon, \nand Texas Instruments. Sandia National Laboratories will establish a \ntest bed to support the effort.\n  Madam President, there are a couple of items that I received from the \nDepartment of Defense to make the point. This is a printed circuit \nboard which shows the circuitry needed for an advanced weapons system \nand the multichip module which is being developed through TRP funding \nto replace it--this much smaller item. That is the kind of a \nbreakthrough we are trying to finance and accomplish and bring about \nthrough use of this dual-use technology.\n  Let me cite one other example, and this is the TRP precision laser \nmachining project.\n  Let me again show a very small, little item to my colleagues. This \nsample illustrates the initial results under this TRP project. Graphite \ncomposite material similar to that used in stealth aircraft has 1,600 \nlaser-drilled holes which were accomplished in only 10 minutes.\n  The TRP will develop further this technology to be able to achieve a \nmuch faster hole drilling rate, up to 10,000 holes per second, without \nsacrificing the unprecedented hole quality already achieved and \nillustrated here. \n [[Page S3590]] At that point it will be feasible to process entire \nairframes in about 1 day, enabling laminar flow control by these holes \nin critical airflow surfaces. This performance-enhancing flow control \nis impractical to manufacture with current technology, and the laser \nhole drilling provides not only the speed but the quality required to \nmake the process practical and cost effective.\n  The Department of Defense points out that the result will be \nsubstantial from their perspective of enhanced military aircraft \ncomponent performance and improved fuel efficiency by more than 3 \npercent, saving about $400 million per year. This technology will also \nreduce life cycle costs by about $100,000 per engine by using these \nprecise laser beams to drill holes with the highly increased precision \nand reproducibility shown in this sample.\n  Madam President, let me just conclude by pointing out again the \nstatement by Secretary Perry before the Armed Services Committee, which \nmy colleague from Arizona serves on with me, where, when asked about \nthe TRP, he said, ``I hope I have the opportunity with the Congress to \ndefend, to vigorously defend the importance of this program.''\n  Madam President, if we adopt the amendment by the Senator from \nArizona we are not giving the Secretary of Defense that opportunity. \nThere has been no hearing that can be cited by the Senator from Arizona \nhere. He is proposing or suggesting that the Senate, in our ultimate \nwisdom, should substitute our judgment for that of the Secretary of \nDefense, for that of the Under Secretary of Defense, for that of the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In my view this would not be \nwise. We need to keep funding in the TRP, keep this a program that \ncontinues to go forward in these very important areas.\n  As the Senator from Alaska pointed out, the additional funding that \nis being transferred to environmental activities is just not needed \nthis year.\n  Madam President, I hope very much this amendment will not be agreed \nto and that we can support the position of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, let me thank the Senator from New Mexico \nfor reading the letters I sent to the President. I appreciate it. I \nwill try to make sure that he is made aware of the correspondence I \nhave between myself and the President and the Secretary of Defense. I \npoint out to my friend from New Mexico, he did not get several of my \ncorrespondences, nor the gist nor intent of the recommendations I made.\n  First of all, I made the recommendations and I stated in the letter, \n``reduce overemphasis on environmental cleanup and reduce funding to \naccount for management savings, use of more effective technologies and \nless stringent standards.'' That is out of a $6 billion overall \nauthorization, and is in keeping with the CBO recommendations.\n  For the edification of my friend and colleague from New Mexico, I \nwrote a letter on January 23 of this year where I\n stated:\n\n       As you know, I wrote to the President on December 5, 1994, \n     asking that he defer the obligation of funding for certain \n     defense programs, including the environmental accounts of the \n     Departments of Defense and Energy. I would like to clarify my \n     intent in including $930 million in DOD and DOE environmental \n     accounts in the listing of programs characterized as lower \n     priority funding.\n       First, let me assure you that I understand the importance \n     of environmental cleanup and fully support the need to \n     provide adequate funding to accomplish this daunting task. \n     Therefore, I believe it is incumbent upon the Department of \n     Defense to bear its fair share of the burden of remediating \n     any problems resulting from the conduct of necessary military \n     activities. However, I also feel strongly that costs such as \n     research and education, as well as other costs not directly \n     related to actual cleanup activities, should be borne equally \n     by all entities, whether governmental or private, rather than \n     one or two federal agencies.\n       It is in this context that I suggested that a portion of \n     the DOD and DOE budgets for environmental programs be \n     reviewed and reconsidered in the context of more fairly and \n     appropriately allocating the fiscal burden of federal \n     environmental programming across all government agencies.\n\n  So I want to assure my friend from New Mexico, to clear up any \nmisconception as my intent in the letter I sent to the President on \nDecember 5 and January 23. I would be glad to provide him with a copy \nof those.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                 January 23, 1995.\n     Hon. William Perry,\n     Secretary of Defense,\n     The Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: As you know, I wrote to the President \n     on December 5, 1994, asking that he defer the obligation of \n     funding for certain defense programs, including the \n     environmental accounts of the Departments of Defense and \n     Energy. I would like to clarify my intent in including $930 \n     million in DOD and DOE environmental accounts in the listing \n     of programs characterized as lower priority funding.\n       First, let me assure you that I understand the importance \n     of environmental cleanup and fully support the need to \n     provide adequate funding to accomplish this daunting task. \n     Therefore, I believe it is incumbent upon the Department of \n     Defense to bear its fair share of the burden of remediating \n     any problems resulting from the conduct of necessary military \n     activities. However, I also feel strongly that costs such as \n     research and education, as well as other costs not directly \n     related to actual cleanup activities, should be borne equally \n     by all entities, whether governmental or private, rather than \n     one or two federal agencies.\n       It is in this context that I suggested that a portion of \n     the DOD and DOE budgets for environmental programs be \n     reviewed and reconsidered in the context of more fairly and \n     appropriately allocating the fiscal burden of federal \n     environmental programming across all government agencies.\n       You and I are both aware of the growing scarcity of defense \n     dollars to carry out our national security priorities. \n     Therefore, we must work together now to ensure that we put \n     the immediate needs of our common defense as our first \n     priority.\n       As Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Armed \n     Services Committee, which has jurisdiction over the \n     environmental restoration program of the Department of \n     Defense, I intend to look into these issues very closely \n     during the FY 1996 budget review. I would like to request \n     your assistance in identifying specific areas of the \n     Department's environmental restoration accounts which you \n     believe should be distributed outside of the Department. In \n     this review, I would ask that you look closely at research \n     and education funding, as well as the standards and \n     remediation techniques to ensure that cleanup funding is \n     being used efficiently and in the most cost-effective way to \n     protect human health.\n       As always, I appreciate your assistance in this matter. I \n     will be sending a copy of this letter to the Secretary of \n     Energy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John McCain,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, in closing this debate, and I do not \nknow whether it will or not, but let me just make my final remarks.\n  I want to emphasize to the Senate the difficult task we have had to \nfind money to offset the funds necessary to restore the training, \noperation, and maintenance accounts for the Department of Defense. We \nhave done that by taking funds from accounts, some of which we may \nreplace in 1996. But we are taking them from accounts where we know \nthey cannot be spent this year. There is no way the department is going \nto spend all of the remaining $800 million that is available for \nstudies in this environmental restoration account.\n  The account does not need more money now. There is no showing at all \nthat it needs more money. As a matter of fact, in the Technology \nReinvestment Program, all we have funded is the money for the ongoing \nprojects that have already been approved and additional efforts that \nhave defense relevance. That means we are going to continue those \nongoing projects which were determined to have defense relevance for \nthis year.\n  We are talking still about this year. We still have to review the TRP \nprogram for 1996 and we have to review the environmental restoration \naccount for 1996, but I plead with the Senate to look at the problem we \nhad to find money to offset the emergency request. We have taken the \nemergency off. We have taken the emergency off because we found, dollar \nfor dollar, outlay for outlay. Both outlays and budget authority are \nreduced sufficiently to offset the moneys that are necessary to be \nrestored in the operating accounts of the military services, plus there \nis some money for the Coast Guard.\n  Our task was to reduce spending accounts for the balance of 1995 and \ntake \n [[Page S3591]] money where it would do the least harm to the \ndepartment. I plead with the Senate to realize that, of the $5.5 \nbillion appropriated for the Department of Defense environmental \nfunding account, we have dealt with about $700 million in study money. \nThere is still plenty of money there in the whole environmental \naccount. It does not need the restoration moneys that are suggested by \nthe Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will vote against the McCain amendment \nto cut funding from the technology reinvestment project. I find this an \nunpleasant task because I am strongly in favor of full funding for \nenvironmental cleanup and restoration at closed DOD bases. I am also a \nproponent of the technology reinvestment project.\n  The McCain amendment would cut twice the amount of funding from TRP \nthan it would restore to DERA. That tells me that the purpose of this \namendment is to kill the technology reinvestment project, which I \nbelieve is wrong. As the previous amendment offered by Senator Bingaman \nshowed, it is the sense of the Senate that the TRP is important to our \nnational security, and ought to be the norm for the way the Pentagon \ndoes business.\n  I believe that the TRP is a good example of a new way of doing \nbusiness between the Federal Government and the private sector, one \nthat is cooperative, cost-shared, competitive, and mutually beneficial.\n  Mr. ROBB. Madam President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Bingaman and of U.S. dual-use technology efforts in \ngeneral.\n  The U.S. military will be challenged repeatedly as a deterrent and \nfighting force in the decades to come. We face the potential of a \nresurgent Russia, a new economic power that decides to pursue military \ndominance in its region, or a rogue regime with a nuclear weapon at its \ndisposal.\n  Although the United States will retain its preeminent position as the \nonly military superpower for decades to come, our relative military \nadvantage inevitably will wane. Identifying the next great military \npowers is obviously very difficult, but we can rest assured that not \nall will share U.S. values and interests. The question today is whether \nwe will be able to respond rapidly and adequately to emerging threats.\n  Of particular concern are those nations that will attempt to couple \nrapid economic growth with tight political control. Fortunately for \ndemocracies, this marriage of tyranny and a free economy usually leads \nto divorce. But even a short-lived marriage of this sort is a \nreasonable prospect for several of today's nondemocratic nations. \nWidely available and rapidly advancing military technologies will allow \nthese nations to arm relatively quickly and, conceivably, to leapfrog \nsome U.S. military capabilities through innovative technologies.\n  It is this possibility for a rapid, technologically based emergence \nof a major threat that dictates we support our technology base as \neffectively as possible, and focus our energies on highly advanced, \nlong-term technologies.\n  We cannot, of course, continue to pay for the enormous research and \ndevelopment base of the cold war. We must now turn to the commercial \nsector, which leads the Department of Defense in many key technologies, \nto help sustain U.S. technological leadership. Dual-use technology \ndevelopment efforts, like the Technology Reinvestment Program, \nrepresent one of the best conceivable approaches to meeting this long-\nterm national security need. TRP is an especially effective program:\n  TRP is supporting a vast range of defense technology developments in \nareas such as low-cost night vision, high-density data storage, \nbattlefield casualty treatment, and composite aircraft structures.\n  TRP awards are matched by the program participants, effectively \nleveraging taxpayer dollars.\n  TRP awards are competed and represent a much more efficient approach \nthan saddling DOD research programs with earmarks that often duplicate \nor misdirect existing efforts.\n  Finally, TRP allows DOD to drive down costs by leveraging commercial \nlarge-scale production.\n  TRP is truly a cents-on-the-dollar program that will secure U.S. \nlong-term security interests well into the next century. While I \napplaud and strongly support readiness today, let's not compromise our \nfuture--a future that will require much foresight and technological \nexcellence to deter and, if necessary, defeat advanced military \nthreats.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the proposed \namendment. First, let me say that I am concerned that among our early \nacts in this 104th Congress we are about to cut $1.9 billion dollars \nout of our defense budget. Among the cuts proposed, are cuts to our \ncritical technology development programs. Since technological \nsuperiority will win the battles of tommorow, we are stealing funds \nthat will determine the readiness of future generations, to pay for \ndefense emergencies today. I believe these actions are a clear and \npresent danger to our defense capability. In our zeal to increase \ndefense readiness and fund operations while we control spending, \ncontrol Government proliferation, control the deficit we may be laying \nthe groundwork for inevitable future inferiority in critical defense \ntechnologies. This amendment only increases the damage that is being \ndone to this critical technology development effort.\n  Military readiness is at the forefront of the defense agenda for both \nthe administration and many of my colleagues here in Congress. I share \ntheir concern that our military must be fully prepared to insure \nnational security. This is not an option, this is our responsibility. \nAt the same time, some of my colleagues are proposing and voting for \ncuts in defense technology development programs that are critical to \nthe defense readiness of tomorrow.\n\n\n                           ARPA and Dual Use\n\n  Our current technological superiority has not evolved overnight. \nDOD's secretive Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), the \npreeminent technology development entity in the world, has been \nsuccessfully researching and evolving new technology for military \napplications, in close alliance with the services, for the 37 years \nsince President Eisenhower set it up. In retrospect, it was a truly \nvisionary Presidential accomplishment.\n  What has ARPA done? Most of its efforts are classified, and it has \npurposely never recorded its history. Let's just look at a list of \ntechnologies that we can talk about that ARPA helped evolve: \nSupercomputing; desktop computers; the internet (formerly ARPAnet); \nstealth; the entire field of materials science and composites; GPS--the \nglobal positioning system run by atomic clocks; laser technology \nincluding laser machining; high resolution digital imaging; advanced \nacoustics; smart weapons; and even the ubiquitous computer mouse.\n  This is only a partial list, but this list alone has revolutionized \nnot only the U.S. warfare machine, but U.S. civilian society.\n\n\n                 The Technology Programs at Issue: TRP\n\n  The Technology Reinvestment Project [TRP] has been the first victim \nof the technology attack. It is designed to be a dual use effort in a \nprogram concept first developed by President Bush's Director of ARPA. \nTRP projects are cost-shared at least 50/50 with industry, \ncompetitively selected, industry-led and aimed at civilian and military \nneeds.\n  What are ARPA's TRP teams working on?\n  Item: Head mounted displays. Infantrymen can't walk around with \ndesktop computers. With light-weight, head-mounted displays they can \nretain full mobility but have a full computer display of the \nbattlefield and real-time intelligence and targeting data before their \neyes.\n  Item: Advanced information flow. Military command and control must \nprocess an exploding amount of intelligence data immediately to the \nbattlefield for response. But limited communications capacity now clogs \nour ability to transmit, process, and act on that data. A TRP team is \ndeveloping digital communications command and control equipment to \nburst massive new amounts of data through the interpretation and \nresponse pipeline at 10 gigabits per second, a 400 percent improvement \nover today's best equipment. This will be the building block \n [[Page S3592]] for a new integrated command and control network.\n  Item: Single chip motion detectors. By reducing motion detection to a \nsingle chip accelerometer which can withstand accelerations up to \n30,000 times the force of gravity, weapons guidance and navigation \nsystems can be made significantly lighter and more sensitive. This will \nbe critical to the next generation of smart weapons.\n  Item: Uncooled infrared sensors. Desert Storm was launched as a night \nattack using infrared sensors as the basis for high speed attack \noperations. Our military needs to own the night and a new generation of \ncheaper, much more portable uncooled infrared sensors are a crucial \nenabling technology being developed by a TRP team.\n  Item: Autonomous all-weather aircraft landing. The efficiency of \nmilitary aircraft is still limited by night and weather conditions. \nOperations at secondary fields are curtailed in these conditions if a \nfull ground control system is absent, or if these facilities are \ndisrupted or damaged at a primary site. Basing aircraft at a small \nnumber of primary bases, is not a good alternative, because our command \nof the air becomes more vulnerable. A TRP team is working on placing \nall-weather air traffic and landing control systems into every cockpit, \nmaking aircraft independent of ground control availability and weather \nconditions.\n  Item: Turboalternator. Army gas-guzzling battle vehicles require a \nvast and vulnerable logistics chain and limit battlefield operations. \nThe next war may not be fought next to Saudi oil refineries. A TRP team \nis developing a turboalternator so main engines can be switched off, \nbut all equipment and sensors can continue to operate, during silent \nwatch modes. This multiplies fuel efficiency and also makes detection \nthrough infrared emissions and engine noise much more difficult.\n  Item: Composite bridging. Military operations continue to be \ncontrolled by terrain: every stream or ravine that must be crossed \ncreates a potential strong point for enemy defenders and disrupts the \nmobility that gives U.S. forces much of their edge. Every time our \nengineer forces have to bring up cumbersome, heavy bridging equipment \nfor a crossing, enemy defenders can rally and our mobility is \ndisrupted. A TRP team is developing superlight, superstrong composites \nfor superportable bridges to multiply the mobility of our battlefield \nforces.\n  Item: Precision laser manufacturing. Precision laser machining \ntechnology, by making aircraft parts microscopically precise, can make \naircraft engines much more efficient. A TRP team, working with higher \npower density, more focused laser beams and variable pulse formats, aim \nto double the life of military aircraft engines and sharply improve \nfuel efficiency and therefore range. Other beneficiaries include \nshipbuilders, airframe makers, engine makers, and a wide rang of other \nmanufacturing technologies.\n  These examples are the kinds of new technologies we need for future \nbattlefield dominance. ARPA's TRP selection criteria emphasizes nine \nareas of established military need, from battlefield sensors, to \nmobility, to prompt casualty treatment, to command and control \ncapability to advanced materials. TRP technology projects also must \nhave civilian application to help cut military costs and link into \nemerging civilian technologies. TRP is a brand-new effort and many of \nits investments are high risk. There are no doubt fixes that will need \nto be applied to the program, and some of its military priorities may \nrequire clarification, as with any new program. But to decimate it \nwithout even holding a hearing about the cornucopia of technology \nadvances it is spawning is rash, and dangerous to our military \ntechnology future.\n  Given some of the other program cuts now on the table, the assault on \nTRP appears to be the beginning of a larger assault on technology R, \nin general. Given the dangers of the future battlefield, this assault \ncan only provide comfort to future enemies.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  At a time when we need to renew our commitment to defense technology, \nwith an eye toward the necessary control of defense spending, we are \ncutting back on the very programs poised to solve the problem. We must \ntake advantage of civilian-led technologies. We must control defense \nspending. We must remain sufficiently superior to our competitors to \ndeter any threats to our national security. We have no choice. If we \ndon't capture the power of technological innovations, we can be sure \nthat our opponents will.\n  This amendment restores $100 million of TRP money to insure that we \nwill be the technological world leaders of tomorrow that we are today. \nI urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I wish to go on record in opposition to \nthe McCain amendment and express my strong support for the Department \nof Defense Technology Reinvestment Program [TRP] which provides \nessential public-private funding for dual-use research and development.\n  The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war have not \nbrought an end to the need for a strong United States military. We find \nourselves facing challenges that are different but no less complex: the \nspread of nuclear weapons and major regional, ethnic and religious \nconflicts, to name a few. These new threats increase the need for fast, \nflexible, mobile forces equipped with the most advanced weapon systems. \nThe Technology Reinvestment Program will allow our troops to defend \nthemselves with the most current, technologically advanced equipment \nand enhance our ability to respond effectively to any threat our troops \nmay face.\n  The Defense Department's TRP is an innovative program that maximizes \nthe use of taxpayer funds to exploit promising technologies by working \ncooperatively with the private sector to ensure both our military and \ncommercial sectors seize and exploit these cutting edge technologies. \nThis cooperative endeavor enhances our national security and economic \nwell-being and moves us toward a single, cutting-edge national \ntechnology and industrial base. The TRP program enables the Pentagon to \nexploit the rapid rate of innovation and market-driven efficiencies \nevident in the commercial industry to meet defense needs. By drawing on \ncommercial technology and capabilities wherever possible--along with \nthe superior systems design and integration skills of U.S. businesses--\nthe military can do its job more effectively and at a far lower cost to \nthe taxpayer.\n  While I agree with the objective of the McCain amendment to restore \nfunding to the Defense Environmental Restoration Act accounts to \nprovide for environmental cleanups on defense bases, I cannot support \nthe transfer to DERA from the TRP program. The $150 million reduction \nin the DERA program, while regrettable, is a small portion of the \noverall DERA program. In addition, DERA is not the only program in the \nDefense budget that provides environment cleanup funding. On the other \nhand, the proposed cuts in the McCain amendment coupled with the TRP \nreductions already contained in the committee-reported Senate \nrescission bill, would virtually eliminate the TRP program.\n  As we all know, we won the cold war, in no small way because of our \ntechnological expertise. We won the cold war because there was a \nnational commitment to win it. We dedicated the resources to the \nresearch and development and to the manufacturing that were required to \nwin. We must continue in that tradition and I urge my colleagues to \nreject the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I oppose this amendment. It seeks to \nachieve a laudable goal, mitigating the cuts imposed by the \nSupplemental Appropriations Act on the environmental cleanup of \nDepartment of Defense facilities. It would do so, however, by \neliminating the Department's premier dual-use technology program, the \ntechnology reinvestment project. I support this vital program to \nmaintain our military's technological edge into the next century. \nTherefore, I oppose the McCain amendment.\n  Through its environmental restoration effort, the Defense Department \nis fulfilling its obligation to the communities of America where \nmilitary facilities have contaminated the land, water, or air. The \nPresident, the Secretary of Defense, and the leaders of the service \nbranches have a solemn commitment to protecting our citizens \n [[Page S3593]] from environmental threats caused by Department \nactivities.\n  Some have criticized the Department's environmental restoration \nprogram as being a nondefense activity, since the funding for the \ncleanup does not go directly into the modernization or maintenance of \nour forces, and is therefore beyond the scope of the Department's \nresponsibility. Nothing could be further from the truth. Keeping its \nlands free of contamination is a clear obligation of any private or \npublic entity, including the Department of Defense.\n  An example of the urgency of addressing this problem can be found in \nmy home State of Massachusetts. Over the decades of the cold war, \nactivities at Otis Air Force Base and Camp Edwards on Cape Cod have \nresulted in drastic contamination. Roughly 65 million gallons of ground \nwater have been contaminated, threatening public water supplies and \nrecreational ponds. Last year, the Department of Defense settled on a \nplan for cleaning up the contamination. This cleanup will take years to \nimplement. Reductions in the environmental fund will delay these vital \ncleanup programs.\n  Under the leadership of Secretary of Defense Perry and Sherri \nGoodman, the Deputy Under Secretary for Environmental Security, the \nClinton administration has laid out a plan for addressing the huge \ncleanup problem facing the Department. The $1.78 billion we voted in \nlast year's budget is a downpayment on a cleanup program that will be \nimplemented well into the next century.\n  Although this amendment would add funds for the clean-up, a goal I \nsupport, it would do so by taking funds from the technology \nreinvestment project. The TRP combines the best of national technology, \nnational security planning, and acquisition reform. It seeks to ensure \nthat the Nation's high-technology industries, as they readjust to the \nshrinking defense budget, will still carry out research and development \nto meet national defense needs.\n  Deputy Secretary of Defense John Deutch has said that the Defense \nDepartment can no longer afford the luxury of having its own private \nindustry. The Department must devise ways to use the commercial sector \nto meet its future industrial needs. The TRP spearheads the effort to \nachieve that goal.\n  It uses less than 2 percent of the Defense Department's research and \ndevelopment budget to get high-technology American businesses to begin \nmeeting our defense needs in an economical fashion. The TRP leverages \nGovernment money by providing up to half the cost of financing dual-use \nresearch and development projects.\n  These projects, carried out by consortia of private corporations, \nuniversities, and scientific laboratories, meet real defense needs. The \ncategories of military need in which project funding is awarded include \nmilitary mobility and deployment; battlefield sensors; command, \ncontrol, communications, computers, and intelligence--so-called C\\4\\I; \nand electronics design and manufacturing. As Secretary Perry has \ntestified, there can be no doubt that the program is funding projects \nthat fulfill direct defense requirements.\n  In some areas, such as command and control software, commercial \ntechnology is more advanced than the corresponding military \ntechnologies now in use. In these instances, the TRP seeks to apply \nexisting commercial technologies to military applications. In other \ncases, such as battlefield sensors, military technologies are more \nadvanced, but the Department seeks to take advantage of the lower cost \nproduction processes that commercial manufacturing the marketing may \nprovide.\n  The House bill rescinds $500 million in fiscal year 1994 and fiscal \nyear 1995 funds for the TRP. This amount would effectively eliminate \nthe program. The committee's bill rescinds $200 million in fiscal year \n1994 and fiscal year 1995 funding for the TRP, far superior to the \nHouse bill, but still a major cut to the program. By further cutting \nthe TRP by $302 million, the McCain amendment would repeat the House \naction of eliminating the program.\n  I was pleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment offered earlier by \nSenator Bingaman, expressing the sense of the Senate in support of the \nTRP. That amendment was passed by a voice vote. To pass the McCain \namendment now would wipe out our approval of that earlier amendment.\n  I support greater funding for the Defense Department's environmental \nrestoration program. I urge the conferees on this legislation to \nachieve the highest level of funding possible for it. But we should not \nundermine the future of the Nation's defense industry to achieve this \ngoal. I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nArizona to the committee amendment on page 1, line 3. On this question, \nthe yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Madam President, I want to speak briefly about the foreign \noperations part of this supplemental appropriations and rescissions \nbill.\n  First, let me say that I believe strongly that supplemental funds for \nthe Department of Defense should be offset with defense rescissions. \nDomestic and foreign affairs funds should not be used to cover defense \ncosts. I do understand, however, that these rescissions were made in \nanticipation of a difficult conference with the House.\n  The $172 million in foreign operations rescissions that were \npresented to the Appropriations Committee would have come entirely from \nsub-Saharan Africa. I was very concerned about the impact this would \nhave on the world's neediest people, and discussed my concerns with \nSenator McConnell. I want to thank him for working with me to modify \nthe rescissions in a way that protects our bilateral aid programs in \nAfrica.\n  I do support the $62 million rescission from the African Development \nFund. Those funds were appropriated last year with the explicit caveat \nthat the fund make significant management reforms. It has not done so. \nPerhaps this rescission will get their attention.\n  That leaves $110 million. All of it would have been taken from the \nAgency for International Development's programs in Africa. Those funds \nare used to support basic health and nutrition, AIDS prevention, child \nsurvival, basic education, agriculture research, and programs to \npromote free markets and free elections. These are programs that \nRepublicans and Democrats strongly support, as do the American\n people, because they often make the difference between life and death \nfor people facing starvation, political violence, or deadly diseases we \ncan cure.\n\n  The rescission, as initially proposed, would have meant that our aid \nto Africa, which already amounts to only about $1 per person, would \nbear the total burden of these cuts. That I could not accept.\n  Senator McConnell and I have worked together to modify the foreign \noperations rescissions to protect AID's programs in Africa. I \nappreciate his willingness to find a compromise.\n  Rather than take the money from the Development Fund for Africa, the \namendment we have coauthored, which is also cosponsored by Senator \nLautenberg, would rescind $70 million from the International \nDevelopment Association; $13 million from the Development Assistance \nFund; $18 million from the former Soviet Republics, of which at least \n$12 million must come from Russia; and $9 million from Eastern Europe.\n  Let me say that I wish we did not have to rescind any of this money. \nThese are all programs I support, and I hope we can reduce some of \nthese cuts in conference. I especially hope that we can find \nalternatives to cutting so much from IDA, since these are commitments \nmade by the U.S. Government and this cut will only add to our arrears.\n  But faced with this difficult choice, I wanted to be sure that the \ncuts did not fall on the backs of the poorest people. That is the \nreason for this amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am joined today by Senators Leahy, \nLautenberg, and Jeffords, in amending the foreign operations \nrescissions package. When the committee decided to move forward with \nrescissions I requested a listing of the unobligated balances in our \ninternational affairs accounts. I learned that the three largest \naccounts which have been slow to spend their resources are those \ncommitted to the Middle East, the New Independent States, and the \nDevelopment Fund for Africa.\n  It is my view that contributing to the economic and political \nstability in the NIS is a vital interest of the United States in the \npost-cold-war world. Although many of the specific programs for the NIS \nhave been plagued by difficulties, I am reluctant to send the signal \nthat Congress is abandoning its commitment to the region. The House \nrescission which reflected a 10 percent cut to the region's unobligated \nbalances might send just such a message.\n  The troop housing project is obviously troubled. We have held a \nnumber of hearings to review whether it is, in any way, meeting the \ndefined objectives. We had expected the program to offer incentive to \nremove troops from the Baltics, build housing where there was an acute \nshortage, generate jobs in the construction sector, and expand private \nhome ownership--I think there is consensus that it has failed on \nvirtually all accounts. Nevertheless, I would prefer to see the funds \nfor the project reprogrammed rather than cut out altogether.\n  As an alternative to the House provisions, Senator Leahy and I are \noffering a modest reduction in the NIS account with a requirement that \ntwo-thirds of the resources are drawn from the Russia projects.\n  This was a direct and determined response to the situation in \nChechnya. A few weeks ago when the administration decided to offer $20 \nmillion in relief to Chechnya, we learned that they planned to draw \nsome of the funding from Armenia, Georgia, and other regional emergency \naccounts. I see no purpose in punishing those countries to compensate \nfor Russian outrages in Chechnya. The requirement that two-thirds of \nthe rescissions from\n the NIS account be drawn from Russian programs is intended to \nreinforce that message.\n\n  The second large account with unobligated balances had a direct \naffect on the Middle East peace process. Again, I think our interests \ndictated that we not take any action that could disrupt our commitment \nto stability and the peace process. Consequently, I was unwilling to \ndraw down this account to support rescissions.\n  I relied on the third account, the Africa Development Fund for two \nreasons--the slow spending rate and the fact that the fund is \ncomplemented by an array of other accounts that contribute to Africa \ndevelopment. In addition to the DFA, we contribute to the Africa \nDevelopment Foundation, the Africa Development Fund, the Africa \nDevelopment Bank, and the International Development Association.\n  After discussions with my colleagues, I have agreed to shift the \nburden of rescissions from the bilateral Africa program where we have \nmore confidence and opportunity to assure United States interests are \naddressed to the International Development Association which I view as \nless responsive to United States goals.\n  [[Page S3595]] The rescissions Senator Leahy and I are offering, \ncontinue our support for vital American interests while addressing our \ncommon concerns about reducing our deficit. With this Congress we have \nnew responsibilities to reduce the deficit. I plan to make sure that \nour foreign aid program contributes to the process of downsizing the \nGovernment and our debt.\n  This rescissions proposal is the first step in a series of difficult \nchoices which lie ahead. Foreign aid can and should serve U.S. national \neconomic and political interests. When and where it fails to meet that \ntest, I guarantee my colleagues that the funds will be rescinded, \nreprogrammed, or reduced.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I am pleased to cosponsor this \namendment because it would ensure that the foreign aid spending \nreductions in this bill do not come entirely out of programs for \nAfrica.\n  Under the bill reported by Senate Appropriations Committee, $172 \nmillion in assistance for Africa was cut. No other region of the world \nwas affected. Senator Leahy and I expressed concern about the \nreductions in assistance to Africa during the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee consideration of this bill because we thought it was unwise \nto target all the cuts at one region. During the full committee markup, \nthe chairman of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee \nagreed to address our concern during full Senate consideration.\n  The amendment before the Senate today would do just that. It would \nspread the burden of the rescissions in the foreign aid program across \nmore regions of the world. It would still rescind $62 million for the \nAfrican Development Fund. But instead of rescinding $110 million for \nthe Development Fund for Africa--which funds child survival, basic \neducation, health, and environmental programs--the amendment would \nrescind $110 million from a multitude of programs. It would reduce \nfunding for the soft loan window of the World Bank by $70 million. It \nwould reduce funding for the former Soviet Union--mostly from Russia--\nby $18 million. It would reduce $13 million in development assistance. \nAnd it would reduce $9 million in aid to the countries of Eastern \nEurope.\n  While all cuts are painful, the reductions proposed in this amendment \nare a sound alternative to rescinding $172 million from one of the \npoorest, most vulnerable regions of the world. Through our foreign aid \nprogram, the United States currently spends approximately $1 per person \nin Africa, far less than we spend on other regions of the world. That \nis a small investment in the future of democracy and regional \nstability. It is small amount of assistance to support fast growing \nexport markets. It is small amount to spend to reduce disease, end \npoverty and human misery, and help create opportunities for the people \nof Africa.\n  Madam President, it would be unwise to reduce aid only to Africa, and \nI am glad we have reached an agreement with the chairman of the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Subcommittee to ensure that the 172 million \nrescissions in foreign aid spending do not target Africa exclusively. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, this amendment embodies an agreement \nbetween the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee regarding the recisions recommended in chapter \n3 of title II. It has been cleared on both sides. I ask for its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on this amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 323) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 324\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senators Gramm and Hollings, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending committee \namendments will be laid aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], for Mr. Gramm, (for \n     himself and Mr. Hollings) proposes an amendment numbered 324.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25 of the Committee bill, strike line 14 through \n     line 12 on page 26, and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n                         DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n\n                 IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE\n\n                       Immigration Emergency Fund\n\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the amounts made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-317, $10,000,000 are rescinded.\n\n                         DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE\n\n             NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY\n\n                     Industrial Technology Services\n\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the amounts made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-317 for the Advanced Technology Program, $32,000,000 \n     are rescinded.\n\n            NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION\n\n                  Operations, Research and Facilities\n\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-317, $2,500,000 are rescinded.\n\n       NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION\n\n                   Information Infrastructure Grants\n\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the amounts made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-317, $34,000,000 are rescinded.\n\n                  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION\n\n                Economic Development Assistance Programs\n\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the amounts made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-317, $40,000,000 are rescinded.\n\n                            RELATED AGENCIES\n\n                     SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION\n\n                         Salaries and Expenses\n\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-317 for tree-planting grants pursuant to section 24 \n     of the Small Business Act, as amended, $15,000,000 are \n     rescinded.\n\n                       LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION\n\n               Payment to the Legal Services Corporation\n\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 103-317 for payment to the Legal Services Corporation to \n     carry out the purposes of the Legal Services Corporation Act \n     of 1974, as amended, $15,000,000 are rescinded.\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND RELATED AGENCIES\n\n                          DEPARTMENT OF STATE\n\n                   ADMINISTRATION OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\n\n            Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad\n\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of unobligated balances available under this heading, \n     $28,500,000 are rescinded.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, at last week's markup of the defense \nsupplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 889, Subcommittee Chairman \nSenator Gramm and I found ourselves both opposed to specific domestic \nrescissions that were included in the House-passed bill. Since that \ncommittee meeting, we have been working on a substitute amendment to \nthe Commerce, Justice, and State chapter that we can both support, with \nthe ground rules that we must propose a rescission in place of any \nrescission currently in the bill that is deleted.\n  Our amendment restores all but $10 million of the Immigration \nEmergency Fund appropriation and most of the appropriation in the \nCommerce Department's Advanced Technology Program. The House had \nproposed cutting $70 million from the Justice Fund and $107 million \nfrom the Commerce Department's ATP Program. All of the alternative \noffsets that this amendment proposes are from accounts within our \nsubcommittee's jurisdiction, and we have retained the $177 million in \ndeficit reduction proposed in both the House bill and the committee \nrecommended bill.\n  This amendment, which I will describe, represents a bipartisan \nresponse to the reductions in Justice and technology programs proposed \nby the House.\n               [[Page S3596]] immigration emergency fund\n\n  The amendment restores all but $10 million of the Department of \nJustice, Immigration and Naturalization Service's Immigration Emergency \nFund to the level provided in last year's CJS appropriation bill.\n  This fund was established for possible immigration emergencies, and \nwe provided a $75 million appropriation last summer to deal with the \nCuban and Haitian immigration crisis. Use of the fund, which has \ncurrent balances of $111 million, requires a Presidential declaration \nof an emergency and congressional notification. Given the current state \nof affairs along our Southern border, it is prudent that the account \nbalances be maintained at a level of at least $100 million.\n\n\n                      advanced technology program\n\n  The amendment restores $75 million to the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology's Advanced Technology Program [ATP]. The \ncommittee amendment would retain a rescission of $32 million from this \naccount, instead of the $107 million proposed in the committee reported \nbill.\n  The ATP is an important investment in American economic \ncompetitiveness. It supports American industry's own efforts to develop \nnew cutting-edge, next-generation technologies--technologies that will \ncreate the new industries and jobs of the 21st century. The ATP does \nnot fund the development of commercial products. Instead, it provides \nmatching funds to both individual companies and joint ventures for pre-\nproduct research on these high-risk, potentially high-payoff \ntechnologies. These technologies include promising new ideas in \nmanufacturing, advanced electronics, and new materials.\n  Why do we need the ATP? The answer is simple: to keep America \ncompetitive and create jobs. Long-term technology has become the key to \nfuture U.S. prosperity at precisely the time that global competition, \ndownsizing, and shareholder pressures now force American companies to \nfocus scarce research dollars on short-term projects. The Commerce \nDepartment estimates that these market pressures now push companies to \nspend up to 90 percent of their research funding on projects that will \npay off in 1 to 5 years. As a result, U.S. companies, small and large, \nnow have serious trouble funding long-term, next-generation \ntechnologies that will build new industries but will not pay for 10 to \n15 years. Moreover, historically the U.S. Government has supported \nlong-term research in only a few key sectors--an approach very \ndifferent from our foreign competitors.\n  The ATP's sole aim is to develop new basic technologies that would \nnot be pursued or pursued soon because of technical risks and other \nobstacles that discourage private-sector investment. The ATP does not \nsupport product development, and is modeled on similar Federal research \nprograms which have long helped a few sectors such as agriculture, the \naircraft industry, and the energy technology. The program particularly \nhelps small technology companies. To date, the ATP has made 177 awards, \ninvolving 480 companies and research partners in 38 States.\n  The ATP is new, but already has begun to make a real difference. \nDiamond Semiconductor Group's story is not atypical. It had a new idea \nfor reliably producing larger, more-cost effective semiconductor \nwafer--about the size of an LP record as opposed to today's small \nwafers. But the company did not have the resources to fully test out \nits idea. ``Winning the ATP award was absolutely critical to us,'' says \nPresident Manny Sieradzki. The ATP award helped the company provide the \nproof needed for varian associates, as major semiconductor equipment \nmanufacturer, to provide development funding.\n  I want to mention three other points about the ATP. First, the ATP is \npart of a long American tradition of supporting industry efforts to \ndevelop new technologies. To date, most of those efforts have been in \ndefense or a few key civilian areas. But those older U.S. investments \nhave been substantial and effective. USDA helped create modern \nagriculture, the Government has supported aeronautical research since \n1915, and the NIH helped create biotechnology. The ATP simply extends \nthis proven model of long-term investments in technology to the rest of \nU.S. industry. And, while the ATP assists a wide range of American \nindustries, it costs less than comparable programs which serve specific \nsectors. In fiscal year 1995, the ATP and NIST's manufacturing \nextension program cost a total of $522 million--compared with $1.675 \nbillion at USDA for research and extension, $882 million at NASA for \naeronautics, and $3.757 billion at the Department of Energy for \ncivilian energy technology.\n  Second, this is not interfering with the marketplace or having the \nGovernment pick winners and losers. The ATP is without doubt the most \nmarket-driven technology program supported by the Government. Industry, \nnot government, proposes both specific projects and key areas of \ntechnology to focus on. Industry, not Government, runs the projects and \ncontributes the majority of the funds. As mentioned, the ATP supports \nonly long-term pre-product research, never product development. And \nawards are made by peer-review panels of technical experts and retired \nbusiness executives--not by the White House, not by the Secretary of \nCommerce, and not by Congress.\n  Third, the ATP has enjoyed strong bipartisan support. The Bush \nadministration wrote the regulations for the ATP, and in his fiscal \nyear 1993 budget President Bush requested substantial increases for the \nprogram. In addition, on June 25, 1992, Senate Republicans--through the \nSenate Republican Task Force on Adjusting the Defense Base Chaired by \nSenator Warren Rudman--endorsed both the ATP and the NIST Manufacturing \nExtension Program. This program has had strong bipartisan support in \nthe past, and deserves strong bipartisan support now.\n\n\n                        noaa procurement savings\n\n  The amendment proposes a rescission of $2.5 million of funds \nappropriated in fiscal year 1995 to the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration [NOAA] for modifications and procurement of \naircraft radar. NOAA has procured and is installing the radar, but has \ninformed the subcommittee that $2.5 million is excess to requirements. \nThe agency recently proposed to reprogram these funds for \nadministrative overhead. The subcommittee recommends applying these \nresources instead for deficit reduction and restoring the ATP program.\n                   information infrastructure grants\n\n  The subcommittee recommends a rescission of $34 million for \nDepartment of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration, Information Infrastructure Grants. This program was \ncreated in fiscal year 1994, and the first grant awards recently were \nmade. Funding for this program increased from $26 million in fiscal \nyear 1994 to $64 million in fiscal year 1995. It has yet to be \nauthorized, and we have continued to oppose rescissions from the Public \nBroadcasting Facilities Program in NTIA that the administration keeps \nproposing. Accounting for departmental transfers and reprogrammings, \nthis rescission restores the program to its fiscal year 1994 level.\n\n\n                economic development assistance programs\n\n  The amendment would rescind $40 million for the Economic Development \nAdministration [EDA]. This is $20 million more than the committee \nreported bill. I reluctantly agreed to this rescission. Following our \nfiscal year 1995 appropriation bill, the EDA proposed a reprogramming \nof $40 million from Defense economic adjustment/conversion and regular \ntitle IX programs to initiate a new Competitive Communities Program. As \nI understand it, this new program would provide grants to \nintermediaries to provide loans to industries locating or expanding in \nimpacted communities. THe subcommittee was unable to reach agreement in \norder to approve the reprogramming request--and under our guidelines \nboth the majority and minority must agree for a reprogramming to go \nforward. In light of that, we have agreed to use these resources in \nlieu of House rescissions.\n\n\n              small business administration tree-planting\n\n  The amendment proposes to rescind $15 million from the Small Business \nAdministration's [SBA] salaries and expenses account. This rescission \nis proposed in the President's budget.\n  This action would terminate the SBA tree planting program. This is a \nnice \n [[Page S3597]] program that provides grants to States and local \ngovernments to plant seedlings and small trees. But, it has little to \ndo with the mission or purpose of the SBA, and we have never supported \nfunding in a Senate appropriations bill. In fact, it has never been \nauthorized by the Small Business Committees. It has been an annual \nHouse Appropriations Committee add-on-the budget.\n\n\n                       legal services corporation\n\n  The amendment proposes to rescind $15 million of the $415 million \nappropriated in last year's CJS appropriations bill for the Legal \nServices Corporation [LSC]. This amendment would reduce the payment to \nthe LSC to the level recommended by the Senate last year. We fought \nhard in conference last year to contain the growth of the Legal \nServices Corporation, which had grown each year due to pressure from \nthe House. With the political see change in the House, I'm sure that \nthey should be willing to return to the lower Senate-passed funding \nlevel.\n                 state department unobligated balances\n\n  The amendment proposes to rescind $28.5 million from unobligated \nbalances in the Department of State's foreign buildings account. Again, \nit is with great reluctance that I recommend this rescission. This is \nan area in which the Senate-passed CJS appropriations bill exceeded the \nHouse last year, and we got them to come up to our level. Each year the \nDepartment of State's program changes due to delays, scope and priority \nchanges, and contract savings. Normally, we would support retaining \nthese balances to further the overseas construction program. But, in \nthe current environment, these balances are being proposed for \nrescission to offset restoring House rescissions.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  This is unpleasant business. I think everyone should realize that the \nHouse is driving this game. These rescissions are not going to offset \nDepartment of Defense readiness spending; instead, they will be used, \nat least for the time being, for deficit reduction. The ground rules, \nas laid out by chairman Hatfield and the leadership, are that we must \nmeet or exceed the amount of rescissions that the House has proposed. \nAnd, I should note that our House counterparts recently approved a \nsecond, much larger rescission bill.\n  Both chairman Gramm and I agree that this amendment provides for a \nvastly improved package than what the House sent to the Senate. I urge \nadoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, this amendment embodies an agreement \nbetween the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Commerce, \nJustice Subcommittee regarding the rescissions recommended in chapter \n1, title II.\n  It has been cleared by both sides. I recommend its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 324) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 325\n\n(Purpose: To provide that the Endangered Species Act of 1973 shall not \n                 apply with respect to Fort Bragg, NC)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nthat it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], for himself \n     and Mr. Faircloth, proposes an amendment numbered 325.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1.  FORT BRAGG, NORTH CAROLINA.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other law, for fiscal year 1995 and \n     each fiscal year thereafter, the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) shall not apply with respect to \n     land under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Army at \n     Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, may I inquire if my distinguished \ncolleague from North Carolina, Mr. Faircloth, has been added as a \ncosponsor of this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, as we always say around this place, this amendment \nis simple and straightforward. I have never heard of an amendment being \noffered that was not simple and straightforward.\n  This amendment proposes to stop the Federal Government and its \nbureaucrats from, first, preventing the Department of the Army from \ncarrying out its national security mission and, second, wasting \ntaxpayer dollars in the process.\n  The amendment addresses a problem the Army is having at Fort Bragg, \nNC. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has listed a red-cockaded \nwoodpecker as a threatened and endangered species and has designated \nFort Bragg as a major recovery area for the red-cockaded woodpecker.\n  The bureaucrats at the Fish and Wildlife Service have forced the \nDepartment of the Army to go to great length and great expense to set \naside land, create tank trails, create nesting areas, and restrict \nconstruction--all to meet an arbitrary plan to protect woodpecker \nnests.\n  The Department of the Army has been required, first, to set aside \n12,000 acres of land just to protect the woodpecker; second, to prepare \na 44-page report that limits training activities of the Army; third, \nsince fiscal year 1989, the Army has spent more than $5 million as a \nresult of the efforts to protect the woodpecker; fourth, to halt eight \nconstruction projects at the base.\n  Madam President, it is my understanding that four species are being \nprotected at Fort Bragg and another one is going to be added soon--a \nbutterfly--to make that five species. There are 70 more State and \nFederal species in line to be added. If four species require almost \n13,000 acres of protection, what is going to happen 5 or 10 years down \nthe road when there will be 70 species? Will there be any land at Fort \nBragg left on which to train our troops?\n  The last time I checked the function of the Army is to defend the \nnational security interests of the United States and not birds in \ntrees. To carry out its national security function, the Army must have \nthe ability to train its troops in battlefield situations. But as any \nmilitary expert will tell you, training exercises are impeded when \nplanners must work around protected woodpecker nests. This is in fact \nthe case at Fort Bragg.\n  Madam President, there is another point: The Army is currently \nattempting to purchase an 11,000 acre parcel of land--known as the \nOverhills tract. This purchase has aroused some controversy inasmuch as \nit will take a significant amount of valuable land off the tax rolls in \nHarnett County, NC.\n  Part of the reason the Army must acquire this parcel, is to protect \nthe red cockcaded woodpecker. Let me quote from a letter I recently \nreceived from the Department of Army:\n\n       Purchasing this land would bring us much closer to \n     attaining the number of active RCW (red cockaded woodpecker) \n     colonies established by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. \n     Once the RCW population has been recovered, Fort Bragg will \n     have much greater freedom in training and siting construction \n     to support our mission.\n\n  The Army is being forced to buy more land, using taxpayers dollars, \nto protect woodpecker colonies.\n  Gen. Robert E. Lee wrote these words to his wife on December 25, \n1862:\n\n       What a cruel thing is war: to separate and destroy families \n     and friends, and mar the purest joys and happiness God has \n     granted to us in this world; to fill our hearts with hatred \n     instead of love for our neighbors, and to devastate the fair \n     face of this beautiful world!\n\n  There will always be threats to our national security. The cold war \nmay be over, but there still remain threats to our national security. \nWe owe our soldiers the best possible training.\n  [[Page S3598]] It is outrageous to sacrifice the training of our \ntroops on the altar of environmentalism.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate on this amendment?\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, first of all, this is legislation on an \nappropriations bill, and I think that is improper to start with. But \nmore than that, it is absolutely clear that in the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee we are going to deal with the Endangered Species \nAct this year. That act is coming up for reauthorization and, indeed, \nit has not been reauthorized in several years, but we are going to \nreauthorize it. We are going to review it in connection with all the \nproblems that have been cited so frequently.\n  I just think it is a mistake for us to be going at this piecemeal \nwith every State which has a particular problem with the Endangered \nSpecies Act, to bring it forward in this piecemeal fashion. We are \ngoing to go at it in a very thoughtful way with hearings, with the \nadministration testifying, with those Senators who wish to testify to \ncome forward and, indeed, just today, we considered a measure by the \nSenator from Texas that would apply a 6-month moratorium on further \nlistings under the Endangered Species Act. It deals solely with section \n4, which is the listing section, and it does not deal with section 7, \nwhich is the conciliation section. That is quite proper.\n  In our committee, we had the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary \nBruce Babbitt, testify. We had representatives from industry, and we \nhad representatives from the affected areas and that is a very \nthoughtful way to proceed on this.\n  But I do deplore the procedure that is occurring tonight, which is to \ntake a particular section and a particular area and say you cannot \napply the Endangered Species Act to that.\n  Now, maybe there should not be colonies of woodpeckers provided for, \nbut who knows what else might be encompassed under this procedure?\n  So, Madam President, I think it is very unfortunate that we are \nproceeding in this fashion, and I hope that the amendment will not be \naccepted.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. GRAMS). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I really hope in this particular case the \nSenate will follow the leadership of John Chafee, the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. I think it is not the right way \nto go about amending the Endangered Species Act, to attack it on every \ntype of bill that comes before us. It is not the right way to govern.\n  I wish to read what the amendment says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other law, for fiscal year 1995 and \n     each fiscal year thereafter, the Endangered Species Act shall \n     not apply with respect to land under the jurisdiction of the \n     Department of the Army at Fort Bragg, NC.\n\n  Well, if everybody carved out their territory, we would not be doing \nmuch to preserve the species that we really have an obligation to \npreserve.\n  Today, in the hearing of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nwe spent about 4 hours debating the Endangered Species Act. Many people \ndo not realize that the drug taxol, which is the hope for those with \novarian cancer and breast cancer, came from a plant called the yew \ntree. Many people do not realize that the hope of finding cures for all \nkinds of dreaded diseases lies with these plants, these exotic plants, \nsometimes very simple weeds.\n  There is a company which grew up in the Silicon Valley of California \ncalled Shaman Pharmaceutical. It is a very interesting story. A shaman \nin the old culture is actually a doctor, and Shaman Pharmaceutical was \nfounded here in the United States of America by a very bright young \nwoman, business woman who realized the value that lies in these plants \nin the South American rain forests, and they have come forward with at \nleast three drugs from these exotic plants which hold tremendous \npromise to treat lung disease and very, very difficult diseases to \ncure.\n  So I would say we do not know what endangered species lie in this \nparticular area of Fort Bragg. We do not know what particular plants \nare there, what species are there, if they hold hope for the future. \nBut simply to attach this amendment to a bill that deals with paying \nfor military operations is certainly the wrong way to go about it.\n  So I certainly do hope that our colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwill follow the leadership of Senator Chafee, the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. Let us show our faith in his \nleadership of this committee. It is going to be difficult to \nreauthorize the Endangered Species Act. We know we have to make it \nbetter. But we also know that if we pick it apart piece by piece, area \nby area, it seems to me we are robbing this country of some very \nimportant, potentially lifesaving endangered species. A lot of people \nsay, when you point out that a specie is in danger, what does that have \nto do with me, this little bird over here? They make fun of some of the \nendangered species.\n  Well, the fact is we have an ecological chain, and everyone supports \nsaving the bald eagle. The Endangered Species Act saved the bald eagle. \nEveryone supported saving the California condor. And I will tell you, \nwe lost in California the grizzly bear because we were not on top of \npreserving it. We lost that opportunity forever. It is gone. Our \ngrandchildren will never know what a California grizzly bear really \nwas. So this is not the way to go about the debate on the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  We had Secretary of the Interior Babbitt in front of the committee \ntoday. He clearly stated he has gotten the message. He is going to work \nwith communities. He is talking about exempting private properties, \nsmall parcels, from the Act so that we do not overburden small property \nowners. I think we are making terrific progress.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is working with the Senator from Texas, \nand I think the bill she now has is moving in the right direction. I \npersonally do not support a moratorium on this because you might lose a \nspecies in the process, which I think is the wrong way to go. But we \nare working together in the committee, Democrats and Republicans alike.\n  So, again, I am very surprised to see this amendment. I had no idea \nit was coming to the floor. I am pleased I was here so I could \nparticipate in the debate. I hope we will at the proper time vote \nagainst this amendment. It simply does not make any sense to have an \namendment such as this on a bill which deals with paying for military \noperations.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as one of the managers of this measure, I \nfind this amendment to be most unfortunate. We have not had the \nopportunity of listening to all of the facts. I have listened very \ncarefully to the distinguished chairman of the committee, the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, and I believe all of us should take his sage advice. \nThe committee is about to take up the whole measure of endangered \nspecies. This is an appropriations bill, and to have legislation of \nthis sort placed upon it would place the whole measure in jeopardy. I \nhope we would do something to resolve this matter.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The other Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the amendment \nof my fellow Senator from North Carolina in regard to the red-cockaded \nwoodpecker and the problem it has presented to Fort Bragg. The EPW has \nbeen completely out of reason in what we should be doing there, and \nthey set \n [[Page S3599]] a quota of 300 colonies of red-cockaded woodpeckers \nthat had to be established on the Fort Bragg military reservation. Some \n25,000 acres have already been contributed to raising woodpeckers, and \nnow we are talking about buying roughly 12,000 more acres at $15 \nmillion of taxpayers' money to meet the quota of 300 colonies of red-\ncockaded woodpeckers.\n  I think the amendment that Senator Helms has proposed is a good one. \nBut I also agree with Senator Chafee that we need to bring it up before \nthe EPW Committee, of which Senator Chafee is chairman, and of which I \nam a member. I would like the opportunity to work with Senator Chafee \nin the EPW Committee, and I will personally commit to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina that it will be done expeditiously and we will bring it \nup and act on it in the EPW Committee if he would see fit to withdraw \nhis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from North Carolina \nand I want to say this to them. We have not had an opportunity to have \na hearing on this. We will rapidly. I do not want to say tomorrow or \nthe day after, but all I can say is we will get to it as rapidly as we \ncan. We will listen to the testimony, we will have the folks from the \nArmy up, we will have folks from the Fish and Wildlife--I presume they \nare the people who are dealing with this--and possibly the EPA people. \nWe will do the best we can to resolve this.\n  Obviously, if we cannot resolve it I will so inform the Senators from \nNorth Carolina and they will have opportunities to bring this up again. \nBut it will be our earnest attempt to get this thing settled in a \nfashion that recognizes the problems that have been set forth by both \nthe distinguished Senators.\n  So that is my commitment to attend to it very soon. I hope they will \ngive me a little time to get to this because we have to get witnesses \nand, again, I cannot say it is going to be tomorrow, I cannot say it is \ngoing to be next week. But I can just say we will get right to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, needless to say I thank the Senator from \nRhode Island. His proposition is fair. Every piece of legislation ought \nto stand on its own merits. Even though I think this is a ridiculous \nsituation extant at Fort Bragg, NC, it is the same kind of ridiculous \nsituation that is confronting businessmen all over this country. I am \nglad the Senator is working on that proposition.\n  In view of what has been said here, Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the yeas and nays be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator now has that right.\n  The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 325) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom North Carolina and the junior Senator. The junior Senator is a \nvery esteemed member of our committee. I know he will pay close \nattention to this whole matter.\n  Second, I thank the senior Senator from Hawaii for his support in \nthis matter. When he spoke, it got everybody's attention. Likewise, the \ndistinguished Senator from California, who so ably spoke on this \npreviously. Now it is up to us. We will get to it in the Environment \nand Public Works Committee.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 326\n\n       (Purpose: To strengthen international sanctions against the \n     Castro government in Cuba, to develop a plan to support a \n     transition government leading to a democratically elected \n     government in Cuba, and for other purposes.)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a printed amendment and \nI ask the sponsors be identified by the clerk in the preface to the \nbill. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. HELMS] for himself, \n     Mr. Dole, Mr. Mack, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Graham, Mr. D'Amato, \n     Mr. Hatch, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Gregg, \n     Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Hollings, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \n     Smith, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Warner, Mr. Nickles, and Mr. Robb \n     proposes an amendment numbered 326.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notifies the Senator from North \nCarolina that there is a pending first-degree amendment at this time.\n  Mr. HELMS. I was not aware of that. I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe temporarily laid aside so I can discuss my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I was astonished to learn this morning that \nPresident Clinton's advisers have recommended that he ease up on the \nembargo against Fidel Castro's Communist Dictatorship in Cuba. If these \nadvisers are parading under the flag of expertise, it's a false flag, \nand they are doing great harm to the President with such advice.\n  This is no time to be reducing U.S. pressure on Castro. It is \nprecisely the wrong way to go. Backing off on Castro will help the \nCastro Communist dictatorship and do great harm to the Cuban people--\nwho already have suffered too much for 36 years.\n  I have made it clear that, as chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, doing everything possible to bring freedom and \ndemocracy to Cuba is at the top of my priority list.\n  That is why I introduced the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity \n[Libertad] Act as my first piece of legislation as chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  Fidel Castro's brutal and cruel Communist dictatorship has persecuted \nthe Cuban people for 36 years. He is the world's longest reigning \ntyrant.\n  Let me be clear: Whether Castro leaves Cuba in a vertical or \nhorizontal position is up to him and the Cuban people. But he must--and \nwill--leave Cuba.\n  I categorically reject suggestions to lift or soften the embargo. For \n36 years, both Republican and Democratic Presidents have maintained a \nconsistent, bipartisan policy of isolating Castor's dictatorship.\n  There must be no retreat in that policy today. If anything, with the \ncollapse of the U.S.S.R. and the end of Soviet subsidies to Cuba, the \nembargo is finally having the effect on Castro that has been intended \nall along. Why should the United States let up the pressure how? It is \ntime to tighten the screws--not loosen them. We have an obligation--to \nour principles and to the Cuban people--to elevate the pressure on \nCastro until the Cuban people are free.\n  The bipartisan Cuba policy has led the American people to stand \ntogether in support of restoring freedom to Cuba. As for my \nlegislation, it incorporates and builds upon the significant work of \nthe two distinguished Senators from Florida, Connie Mack and Bob \nGraham, and of a number of our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The message we should be sending to both Castro and those who want to \ndo business with him are contained in the Cuban Liberty and Democratic \nSolidarity Act now at the desk. The message is: Isolate Castro until \nthe Cuban people are free.\n  We can achieve this by strengthening international sanctions against \nthe Castro regime by prohibiting sugar imports from countries that \npurchase sugar from Cuba and then sell that sugar to us; and \ninstructing our representatives to the International Financial \nInstitutions to vote against loans to Cuba and to require the United \n [[Page S3600]] States to withhold our contribution to those same \ninstitutions if they ignore our objections and aid the Castro regime.\n  We can accomplish this objective by urging the President to seek an \ninternational embargo against Cuba at the United Nations, and by \nprohibiting loans or other financing by a United States person to a \nforeign person or entity who purchases an American property confiscated \nby the Cuban regime.\n  My legislation reaffirms the 1992 Cuban Democracy Act, revitalizes \nour broadcasting programs to Cuba, and cuts off foreign aid to any \nindependent state of the former Soviet Union that aids Castro, \nspecifically if that aid goes for the operation of military and \nintelligence facilities in Cuba which threaten the United States.\n  This bill encourages free and fair elections in Cuba after Mr. Castro \nis gone and authorizes programs to promote free market and private \nenterprise in Cuba.\n  The bill also helps U.S. citizens and U.S. companies whose property \nwas confiscated by the Castro regime by denying entry into the United \nStates to anyone who confiscates or benefits from such property and by \nallowing a U.S. citizen with a confiscated property claim to go into a \nU.S. court to seek compensation from a person or entity which is being \nunjustly enriched by the use of that confiscated property.\n  Mr. President, the Cuban people are industrious and innovative. In \ncountries where people are allowed to live and work in freedom, they \nhave prospered. My hope and the hope of the cosponsors of this bill, is \nthat this bill will hasten an end to the brutal Castro dictatorship and \nmake Cuba free and prosperous once more.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Carolina. I understand he has laid the amendment down and we \nwill continue the debate tomorrow morning.\n  I think when the administration talks about easing sanctions on Cuba \nthey have made a big, big mistake. They have misread the American \npeople, not just in the State of Florida where many Cuban-Americans \nreside. They have misread the public opinion all across America.\n  I hope that we have a good discussion of this amendment tomorrow \nmorning. I thank the Senator from North Carolina. I am a cosponsor of \nthe amendment. I thank him for laying down the amendment this time.\n  I hope my colleagues will have an opportunity to study the amendment \novernight and to also review the remarks of the Senator from North \nCarolina so that they might also participate in the debate.\n  We are back on the bill at 10:30 or 11 tomorrow. I am not certain. We \nhave not made that determination yet.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. This amendment is to an \nexcepted committee amendment. Is that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the understanding of the chair that the \nSenator from North Carolina has an amendment set aside to propose this \nto the bill itself. The Senator, however, has the right to change it.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Modification of Amendment No. 326\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may modify, \nat the bottom of page 1 of the amendment, so as to read, ``At the end \nof the first excepted committee amendment, add the following:''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The modification reads as follows:\n\n       At the end of the first excepted committee amendment, add \n     the following:\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

PAUL W. LAVIN\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, last week, we had the distinct honor of \nsharing the floor with a credentialed and principled brother, guest \nChaplain, Rev. Paul W. Lavin. I have been fortunate to have shared a \nfriendship with Father Lavin that has enriched me in many ways. This \nfriendship has developed, as Father Lavin has graciously opened his \nparish to me in the morning, so I can begin my day with prayer and \nworship. These times have been invaluable as I wrestle with the \ndifficult and complex issues that we regularly face in the Senate.\n  Father Lavin visited us with many accomplishments and distinctions. \nFather Lavin did his undergraduate work at King's College and then \nlater attended seminary at Seminary of Our Lady of Angels. After \nreceiving his master degree from seminary, he was ordained a year later \nby Patrick Cardinal O'Boyle at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, \nDC. This marked the beginning of his official religious ministry. He \naccepted his first pastorate, at Mount Calvary Parish where he \nministered for 5 years. During his tenure, he established the ECHO \nretreat program for high school seniors and young adults in the \nArchdiocese of Washington. This program remains the primary youth \nretreat in the Archdiocese.\n  Father Lavin continued his commitment to young people in his next \nposition as the director of Youth Retreats for the Catholic Youth \nOrganization of the Archdiocese of Washington. Under his direction the \nCatholic Youth Organization created a retreat center in Silver Spring, \nMD which he administered until 1979. For the next 10 years, he served \nas the chaplain of American University. In his capacity, he established \nthe Hannan Series, which brought those involved in significant public \nservice together with American students to discuss how their faith has \ninfluenced their public lives. He then returned to the pastorate \nbecoming the pastor of Mother Seton Parish which is a parish of 1,800 \nCatholic families in suburban Montgomery county. His present position \nas the pastor of St. Joseph's on Capitol Hill, is what has caused our \npaths to meet.\n  Father Lavin also is distinguished by many appointments which \ninclude: national chaplain of the Junior Catholic Daughters of America, \nmember of board of directors of the Bishop McNamara High School, and \npresident of Germantown HELP which is an ecumenical crisis helping \norganization.\n  I have been blessed by my relationship with Father Lavin. While I \nhave no plans to forsake my Baptist commitments, I have always felt \nwelcome at St. Joseph's. So much so, that when my daughter was engaged \nto a Catholic, I suggested that she hold her wedding at St. Joseph's, a \nsuggestion that she eagerly complied with. Later my granddaughter was \nbaptized at St. Joseph's.\n  It is encouraging when people can come together in fellowship made \npossible by their common bond in Christ. I have experienced this \nfellowship with Father Lavin, and I look forward to continued \ninteraction with him in the future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/07/senate-section/article/S3600-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3600-S3601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 GUEST CHAPLAIN, REV. ERNEST R. GIBSON\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is my distinct honor to reflect on \nthe accomplishments of our guest Chaplain, Rev. Ernest R. Gibson. \nReverend Gibson is a product of Howard University \n [[Page S3601]] where he studied sociology and religion. He has been \nputting his studies to work in his capacity as the pastor of the First \nRising Mount Zion Baptist Church. He began pastoring this church in \n1952, and he continues as head of this congregation today. Under his \nleadership, his church has grown from 65 members to its current \nattendance of 1,700 active members.\n  The history and development of Gibson's congregation serves as a \ntribute to his life accomplishments. Four years after Gibson started as \npastor of First Rising Mount Zion Baptist Church, in 1956, they bought \ntheir first building in Northwest Washington, DC. Later in 1973, they \noversaw the construction of the Gibson Plaza which was a 10-story, 217-\nunit apartment building for low and moderate income families. In 1985, \nthey completed construction of their education building, and recently \nin 1990, they completed construction of a new church building.\n  Reverend Gibson's congregation serves as a positive force in its \nsurrounding community working proactively to address the needs of those \nless fortunate. They offer many programs including, a college guarantee \noffering tuition assistance up to full tuition, an outpatient drug \ntreatment facility, a weekly food distribution which reaches an average \nof 300 individuals, and a meal program for homeless families.\n  Reverend Gibson's commitment to his community extends greater than \nhis responsibilities as the pastor of First Rising Mount Zion Baptist \nChurch. He was also the chairman of glass recycling program in \ncooperation with the Glass Packaging Institute and Mid-Atlantic Glass \nRecycling Program. Under his leadership they saw a total of 10 \ndifferent churches and agencies participate.\n  As well as being active in his surrounding community, Reverend Gibson \nwas involved with other persons of faith, in his role as the executive \ndirector of the Council of Churches of Greater Washington. In this \necumenical work, the reverend urged churches to be more concerned about \nsocial issues, coordinated a voter registration drive which placed \nregistrars in more than 30 churches, and directed the Interfaith \nConference. He also was the co-chair of the Greater Washington Billy \nGraham Crusade in 1986, coordinating the efforts of local churches in \ntheir support of this endeavor.\n  I am proud to share the floor with Reverend Gibson because he is a \nman whose religious convictions make an impact on the treatment of \nothers. He has clearly taken to heart Christ's recommendation to feed \nhis sheep. Gibson's commitment to the service of others is undeniable \nand his faithful devotion to his congregation is obvious. We need more \npastors like Gibson who are devoted not just to their congregation, but \nalso to the surrounding community. His body of believers can act as an \nexample to the church in America of what it means to serve the \ncommunity.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/07/senate-section/article/S3600-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO THE REVEREND NEAL JONES\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to use this opportunity to \nprovide a statement of appreciation for Rev. Neal Jones, who has \nvolunteered this week to open our Senate sessions with prayer.\n  Mr. President, Reverend Jones has faithfully served for the last 26 \nyears as the pastor of Columbia Baptist Church in Falls Church, VA. \nDuring this time of esteemed service, Reverend Jones has displayed the \npersonal, professional and spiritual characteristics that distinguish \nhim for the important role of opening the Senate's day with prayer.\n  Reverend Jones has a heart devoted to God, as evidenced by his love \nof people and concern for others. Of special note relating to his \nduties in the Senate, Reverend Jones has a broad doctrinal \nunderstanding of various religious traditions, and, while firm in his \nconvictions, he has maintained an attitude of grace toward differences \nof opinion.\n  Pastor Jones has a warm and winsome manner allowing him to pastor to \nall types of persons without regard to their status. He has a truly \nspecial gift for pastoral ministry and encouragement.\n  Mr. President, these personal, professional and spiritual traits are \nrevealed through Reverend Jones' dedicated work in the community. Under \nthe leadership of Pastor Jones, Columbia Baptist has grown into a \ndynamic church ministering to a changing community in extraordinary \nways. The church has a vibrant Korean and Hispanic ministry, a model \nchild-care program of low-income families and single mothers, a major \nfood, clothing, and medical program for a sister church in Moscow, and \nmany other community outreach programs.\n  In addition to providing leadership and guidance for these ministry \nactivities, Reverend Jones serves on the Executive Board of Prison \nFellowship; he is a member of the Baylor University Board of Regents; \nand he has served on the Foreign Mission Board and is past president of \nthe Baptist General Association of Virginia. Reverend Jones also has \nshared his ministry in Japan, Africa, and Russia.\n  Mr. President, as I am sure my colleagues have noticed this week, the \nReverend Jones has an extraordinary gift of prayer. One prominent \nnational Christian leader told me, ``Neal's prayers would rank with \nthose of Peter Marshall,'' who is, perhaps, the best known of all past \nSenate chaplains.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Senate has been truly blessed by the efforts \nof Rev. Neal Jones, and I am honored to have this opportunity to \nrecognize and commend him for his service to us this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/07/senate-section/article/S3601-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            HOWARD W. HUNTER\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life and \ncontributions of a singular individual. Howard W. Hunter, president of \nthe world's nearly 9 million members of the Church of Jesus Christ of \nLatter-Day Saints, better known as the Mormons, completed his earthly \nsojourn last Friday, March 3, 1995.\n  Although his tenure as head of the church was relatively brief, he \nhas left an indelible impression for good, forged through many years of \nservice to his church and to humankind in a variety of capacities.\n  Those of us who have heard him speak, both in large assembly and in \npersonal setting, were inspired, moved, and edified by his counsel. His \nphysical frailty, as he battled cancer, stood in direct contrast to the \nforce of his spirit, conviction, and care for those he loved and \nserved.\n  President Hunter brought his own special gifts to his last calling. \nHe bore his witness to the redeeming power of the atonement and the \ngospel of Christ that he loved with an invitation that included all of \nGod's children. Like his exemplar, Jesus Christ, he included the \nfaithful and the fallen in his spiritual embrace.\n  Despite an impressive personal resume, President Hunter downplayed \nhis own accomplishments and reached out to others to encourage and to \naid. In many respects, his life can be described as a fulfillment of \nthe Savior's observation:\n\n       And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant \n     of all.\n       For even the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but \n     to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.--Mark \n     10:44, 45.\n\n  Howard William Hunter was born November 14, 1907, in Boise, ID. As a \nyoung man, he excelled scholastically and developed a lifelong love for \nmusic and scouting. He enjoyed a successful career as a corporate \nlawyer in California. He was called to be a member of the council of \nthe Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints \nin October 1959. The following three decades saw him travel worldwide \nin his fulltime church service.\n  At the age of 86, President Hunter succeeded President Ezra Taft \nBenson, who died May 30, 1994. He became the 14th president of the \nchurch.\n  President Hunter was married to Clara May Jeffs. She died October 9, \n1983. He later married Inis Bernice Egan on April 20, 1990.\n  He was the father of 3 sons, eighteen grandchildren, and 16 great-\ngrandchildren.\n  His legacy lives on not only in his posterity, but in his example and \nstrong witness of his beliefs to the world.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/07/senate-section/article/S3601-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3602]]\n     REGARDING THE PASSING OF LDS CHURCH PRESIDENT HOWARD W. HUNTER\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto note the passing of one of this Nation's great citizens and \nreligious leaders. On March 3, 1995, the Church of Jesus Christ of \nLatter-day Saints, on behalf of his family, announced the death of \nPresident Howard W. Hunter.\n  President Hunter, an Idaho native, was named the 14th president of \nthe LDS Church in June of 1994. His message, throughout his service to \nthe LDS Church, was a prayer for compassion and tolerance. In his first \nstatement as president he said, ``To the membership of the Church in \nevery country of the world and to people everywhere I extend my love. . \n. . I pray we might treat each other with more kindness, more courtesy, \nmore humility and patience and forgiveness.''\n  President Hunter was born in Boise, ID, on November 14, 1907, to John \nWilliam and Nellie Marie Rasmussen Hunter. At an early age, President \nHunter showed a quick mind and dedication as he attained the rank of \nEagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. In addition, he exhibited a \ngift for music and learned to play the saxophone, clarinet, violin, and \ndrums. His love of music was so great that he even organized his own \norchestra, Hunter's Croonaders. The Croonaders were a popular fixture \nin Boise for many years.\n  President Hunter briefly attended the University of Washington, and \nlater, in 1939, graduated cum laude from Southwestern University Law \nSchool with a Juris Doctor degree. He did this studying nights while \nholding a full-time job.\n  During his professional career, President Hunter practiced corporate \nlaw in Los Angeles where he was eventually named to the boards of 24 \ncorporations. He also served as assistant district commissioner for the \nBoy Scouts of America for the Metropolitan Los Angeles area, as well as \nserving his church in a variety of positions ranging from bishop to \npresident of the Pasadena California Stake.\n  On October 10, 1959, President Hunter was called to serve as a member \nof his church's Council of the Twelve Apostles. He served as acting \npresident of this quorum from 1985 to 1988, and was president from June \n1988 to June 1994.\n  After 52 years of marriage, President Hunter's first wife, Clara May \nJeffs, passed away in 1983. Later, in April 1990, he married his second \nwife, the former Inis Bernice Egan. President Hunter is survived by his \nsecond wife; 2 sons, John J. Hunter of Ojai, CA, and Richard A. Hunter \nof San Jose, CA; 18 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, we are saddened by the death of such a great and \ntalented man.

Mr. President, as you know, I have spoken at length in this \nChamber about the need to review United States policy toward Cuba. \nTherefore, I was very pleased to see reported in the Washington Post \nthis morning that President Clinton is considering taking some modest \nsteps toward altering the existing sanctions policy, in favor of more \ncommunication and contact between the Cuban and American people.\n  As I understand it, what is under consideration is the rolling back \nof last August's sanctions that were imposed during the Cuban migrant \ncrisis--sanctions that have prohibited Cuban-Americans from sending \nmoney to family members in Cuba or visiting them, except in cases of \ndire emergency.\n  I believe that the President will find that there is a great deal of \nsupport for taking these steps within the Cuban-American community--\nmany of whom have been forced to sit back and do nothing to cushion the \nsevere economic hardships they see their loved ones on the island \nenduring. I would urge the President to move forward with these \nmeasures, if for no other reason than on humanitarian grounds.\n  In addition to rolling back the August sanctions, the President \nappears to be considering whether to set forth a list of steps that the \nCuban Government might take to elicit the calibrated easing of United \nStates sanctions policy. This technique was contemplated a number of \nyears ago when relations with Castro had temporarily thawed, but was \novertaken by events before it was ever implemented. It is clearly worth \nexploring.\n  After more than 30 years of mistrust, confidence building measures on \nboth sides will be needed in order to lay the groundwork for productive \nnegotiations on issues of mutual concern to both countries. Someone \nmust make the first gesture. I believe that if President Clinton acts \naffirmatively on the policy changes currently before him, he will be \ntaking that very important first step. I would urge that he do so.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that an article entitled ``Clinton May \nEase Sanctions on Cuba'' that appeared in the Washington Post on March \n7, 1995 be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [The Washington Post, Tuesday, March 7, 1995]\n\n                   Clinton May Ease Sanctions on Cuba\n\n                  (By Daniel Williams and Ann Devroy)\n\n       President Clinton's foreign policy advisers are \n     recommending he take steps toward easing relations with Cuba \n     by revoking some economic sanctions adopted against the \n     nation in August, administration officials said yesterday.\n       The proposal, which has not yet been accepted by Clinton, \n     would lift the ban that blocks Cuban exiles from sending cash \n     to relatives on the island and would ease severe limits on \n     travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens.\n       In addition, the advisers recommend issuing a list of steps \n     that Cuban President Fidel Castro could take to qualify for a \n     ``calibrated response'' by the United States. That could lead \n     to talks on issues that have separated the two countries for \n     more than 30 years, the officials said.\n       Any easing of restrictions would put Clinton into a \n     confrontation with Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), chairman of the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has drawn up \n     legislation designed to tighten economic sanctions on Cuba.\n       Helms, other conservative Republicans, some anti-Castro \n     Democratic legislators and the Cuban exile communities in \n     Florida and New Jersey have long favored tougher treatment of \n     Castro.\n       Senior foreign policy advisers have prepared a memo for \n     Clinton to make the case that the August sanctions, which \n     formed part of the U.S. effort to persuade Castro to stop the \n     flow of Cuban boat people to America, succeeded and should \n     now be removed.\n       During the summer, a relaxing of coastal surveillance by \n     Castro ignited a massive exodus of raft people, 30,000 of \n     whom took to the seas for Florida.\n       The outpouring caused Clinton to reverse longstanding U.S. \n     policy and bar their landing on U.S. soil.\n       Since 1963, Cubans who arrived on U.S. shores had been all \n     but guaranteed automatic political asylum.\n       But Clinton feared an immigration crisis at a time of a \n     nationwide political backlash against newcomers.\n       So most of the Cubans were sent to the U.S. Naval Base at \n     Guantanamo Bay on Cuba's southeastern tip.\n       The decision not to admit the Cubans angered many in the \n     Cuban-American community.\n       So, to mollify them as well as punish Castro, Clinton \n     agreed to tighten the three-decade-old ban on trade with \n     Cuba. The new sanctions included a bar on the sending of cash \n     to relatives by Cuban Americans.\n       In addition, travel to this island was sharply restricted, \n     as visits by relatives were curtailed and a Treasury \n     Department permit was required for trips by educational \n     researchers and other groups.\n       [[Page S3603]] At the time, the Clinton administration \n     estimated that the ban on cash remittances and reduced travel \n     would cost the Cuban economy an estimated $150 million per \n     year. The new actions under consideration would not affect \n     the rest of the trade ban.\n       Soon after imposing the tougher sanctions, the United \n     States entered talks with Cuba aimed at easing the \n     immigration crisis. The two sides reached a deal in which \n     Cuba, in return for again blocking the outflow of raft \n     people, received a guarantee of 20,000 visas a year for its \n     citizens to go to the United States. The administration \n     rejected a bid by Cuba to revoke the new sanctions as part of \n     the immigration deal.\n       The time has come, some U.S. officials believe, to test \n     whether Castro is willing to make deep economic and political \n     reforms, a senior administration official said. The \n     administration has engaged in a low-level debate over most of \n     the past two years on whether to try to encourage political \n     liberalization in Cuba by engaging Castro and loosening the \n     overall trade embargo against the island nation.\n       Some mid-level State Department officials and others had \n     proposed for months that Washington engage Castro either to \n     help avert chaos surrounding a future succession or, in case \n     of chaos, to establish a relationship that could avoid more \n     refugee waves.\n       But the White House saw no political gain for easing \n     relations. Last fall, Secretary of State Warren Christopher \n     said Castro would have to make political reforms before the \n     United States could engage on such issues as the embargo, \n     eased travel relations and diplomatic relations.\n       The administration, before making a ``calibrated \n     response,'' will be looking for wider economic reforms to \n     establish a free market on the island as well as political \n     reforms, including the stationing of human rights monitors on \n     the island, the senior official said.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/07/senate-section/article/S3602-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill; in which it reuqests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 925.

A bill to amend the general mining laws to provide a \nreasonable royalty from mineral activities on Federal lands, to specify \nreclamation requirements for mineral activities on Federal lands, to \ncreate a State program for the reclamation of abandoned hard rock \nmining sites on Federal lands, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                         mining law reform act\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in the last Congress, Members in the Senate \nand our colleagues in the other Chamber worked hard to reform the laws \nunder which the U.S. mining industry operate on the vast Federal lands \nof the west. Members on both sides of the aisle, from all regions of \nthe country, acknowledged that the mining law of 1872 needed change. \nWhile I was disappointed we did not pass legislation in the last \nCongress to reform mining law, I would have been more disappointed if \nCongress had accepted some of the reform proposals that were put \nforward at that time. The reason for my concern was the proposals \noffered at that time did not meet my primary test of fair legislation. \nThat test is this country's mining industry that annually contributes \napproximately $53 billion to our economy will not be driven to economic \nruin nor to operate only in other countries.\n  Today, I am introducing, a bipartisan bill in conjunction with \nChairman Murkowski, Senator Reid and 10 other of my colleagues. The \nMining Law Reform Act of 1995, is a bill which will ensure continued \nmineral production in the United States. It provides for a fair \neconomic return from minerals extracted on public lands, and will link \nmining practices on Federal lands to State and Federal environmental \nlaws and land-use plans. This bill provides a balanced and equitable \nsolution to concerns raised over the existing mining law.\n  Mining in the United States is an important part of our Nation's \neconomy. It serves the national interest by maintaining a steady and \nreliable supply of the materials that drive our industries. Revenue \nfrom mining fuels local economies by providing family income and \npreserving community tax bases. Mining has become an American success \nstory. Fifteen years ago, U.S. manufacturers were forced to rely on \nforeign producers for 75 percent of the gold they needed. Today, the \nUnited States is more than self-sufficient. The domestic mining \nindustry not only meets the demand, but produces a gold surplus of 36 \npercent, worth $1.5 billion in export balance of payments.\n  Mining, however, is a business associated with enormous up-front \ncosts and marginal profits. Excessive royalties discourage, and in \nother countries have discouraged, mineral exploration. Too large a \nroyalty would undermine the competitiveness of the mining industry. The \nend result of excessive Government involvement would be the movement of \nmining operations overseas and the loss of American jobs. The \nlegislation I am introducing today will keep U.S. mines competitive and \nprevent the movement of U.S. jobs to other countries.\n  The general mining law is the cornerstone of U.S. mining practices. \nIt establishes a useful relationship between industry and Government to \npromote the extraction of minerals from mineral rich Federal lands. \nAlthough the cornerstone of this law was originally enacted in 1872, it \nremains to function effectively today. The law has\n been amended and revised many times since its original passage. The \nlegislation I am introducing today preserves the solid foundation \nprovided by this law and makes some important revisions that address \nthe concerns that have been paramount in this debate that I have been \ninvolved in for nearly a decade.\n\n  Specifically, the Mining Law Reform Act of 1995 will insure revenue \nto the Federal Government by imposing fair and equitable net royalties. \nIt requires payment of fair market value for lands to be mined. It \nassures lands will return to the public sector it they are not \ndeveloped for mineral production, as is intended in this legislation. \nFurthermore, to prevent mining interests from using patented land for \npurposes other than mining, the bill limits residential occupancy to \nthat which is only necessary to carry out mining activities.\n  To ensure mining activities do not unnecessarily degrade Federal \nlands, the Mining Law Reform Act mandates compliance with all Federal \nState and local environmental laws with regard to land use and \nreclamation. To enforce these provisions, the bill includes civil \npenalties and the authority for compliance orders.\n  Finally, this bill creates a program to address the environmental \nproblems associated with abandoned mines. Working directly with the \nStates, the Mining Law Reform Act directs one-third of the royalty \nreceipts to abandoned mine cleanup programs; another one-third of those \nreceipts could be used by States if they so decided.\n  The legislation I am proposing today is in the best interest of the \nAmerican people because it provides revenue from public resources, \nassures mines will be developed in an environmentally sensitive manner \nand that abandoned mines from earlier eras will be reclaimed. It is \nfair to mining interests because it imposes reasonable fees and \nroyalties. It is good for the environment because it assures land use \nand reclamation activities. I ask my colleagues to join me in support \nof this legislation and look forward to hearings and Senate legislative \naction.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today \nin introducing legislation to reform the mining law of 1872. I \ncongratulate my distinguished friend, Senator Larry Craig, for all of \nhis hard work on this very important issue.\n  As a Senator from a State with significant mining activity, reform of \nthe obsolete mining law of 1872 is imperative. There are currently 95 \nmining companies operating in the State of South Dakota, bringing in \nmore than $321 million in gross State revenues. Many of these are small \nbusinesses. \n [[Page S3605]] The mining industry employs almost 2,500 South \nDakotans.\n  I therefore represent many dedicated individuals who are an integral \npart of South Dakota's economy. I also represent a number of citizens \nwho believe all mining activity should be stopped. In South Dakota, as \nin a number of States, citizens are deeply divided on issues related to \nmining.\n  However, my constituents are all in agreement on one basic point: the \nmining law of 1872 is outdated. It needs to be revised. I believe the \nlegislation we are introducing today is a fair approach to reforming \nthis antiquated law.\n  Mr. President, in my State of South Dakota, five major gold mining \ncompanies conduct large scale surface mining for gold on roughly 2,400 \nacres of land in the Black Hills. Current expansion proposals cover at \nleast another 1,300 acres, including 800 acres of U.S. Forest Service \nland. Additionally, there are numerous exploratory drilling operations \non Forest Service lands in the Black Hills.\n  Over the past few years, I have held many public meetings in South \nDakota in which South Dakota mining operations were discussed. The \nproblems inherent in the mining law of 1872 come up again and again at \nthese meetings.\n  Many South Dakotans are particularly concerned about the existing \nland patent provisions and the extremely low fees required to purchase \nFederal land. Current law allows Federal land to be offered at a base \nprice of $2.50 or $5.00 per acre. This is a virtual giveaway. Anyone \nwho has visited the beautiful Black Hills National Forest in western \nSouth Dakota would certainly agree that those lands are worth far more. \nIt is important that responsible mining activity be permitted. However, \nin this time of huge Federal deficit spending, it is time these fees \nwere reformed to reflect good fiscal common sense.\n  This legislation takes care of that. It brings much needed revenue \nback to the Federal Government. This legislation mandates that the fair \nmarket value be charged for ownership of Federal lands. In addition, it \nimposes claim holding fees of $100 per year, per claim.\n  This legislation also would ensure that the Government gets paid for \nsome of the value of what is in the land. It would impose a net royalty \nof 3 percent on proceeds from mining activity. This provision is based \non the State-imposed net proceeds tax, which is working quite \nsuccessfully in Nevada. It makes good economic sense.\n  Another issue South Dakotans always raise is reclamation. It is \ncertainly important that we encourage responsible caretaking of South \nDakota's Federal lands--both to maintain the health of the Black Hills \nNational Forest, and to preserve its natural beauty. Who knows best how \nto take care of South Dakota's Federal lands than South Dakotans? \nThat's why I support the provision of this bill which places the \nresponsibility for developing reclamation standards in the hands of the \nStates. Those of us here in Washington, from Members of Congress to \nGovernment bureaucrats, don't always know what is best for the Federal \nlands in South Dakota--or even Wyoming or Colorado. Each State is in a \nbetter position to judge for itself what is best for its own \nenvironmental well-being.\n  Last year, we spent a great deal of time working to develop a \ncompromise on mining law reform. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in \npassing a final bill. I believe that this year's legislation \nincorporates many elements of last year's compromise. This bill has \nwidespread support from the mining industry. It is sound legislation, \nand we should not delay in moving it forward.\n  On behalf of many South Dakotans, I urge my colleagues in the Senate \nto give this matter serious consideration. Many provisions of the 1872 \nmining law need to be revised. The dedicated miners of South Dakota and \nthe rest of the country should no longer be asked to shoulder the \nburdens imposed by this antiquated law. I look forward to working with \nmembers of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as they \nstrive to make this bill into a fair and equitable mining reform law.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER:\n  S. 507. A bill to amend title 18 of the United States Code regarding \nfalse identification documents, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                        false identification act\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to reintroduce \nlegislation designed to attack a growing problem: the use of false \nidentification documents [ID's] by young people under 21 years of age. \nI introduced a similar bill late last year.\n  Several years ago, Congress conditioned Federal highway funding on \nthe requirement that States have a minimum drinking age of at least 21 \nyears. Since then, all 50 States have come into compliance. One \nconsequence has been a dramatic increase in the use of false ID's by \nyoung people to illegally purchase alcoholic beverages. An illegal, \nunderground black market has emerged, supplying cheap documents to \nsatisfy this demand. The prevalence of counterfeit ID's poses a growing \nmenace to the licensed beverage industry, and promotes alcohol abuse \namong young Americans.\n  With modern computer graphic programs, counterfeiting a driver's \nlicense is child's play for sophisticated computer users. On October 3, \n1994, the Washington Times published a front-page article entitled \n``Fake IDs surmount high-tech obstacles: Underage drinkers flock to buy \nthem.'' The article describes how easily falsified identification \ndocuments can be created by computers and the steps various States are \ntaking in response.\n  Several State driver's licenses, including Maryland and California, \nnow include a hologram, two separate pictures, and a magnetic strip in \nan effort to make counterfeiting more difficult. However, even these \nmeasures are being duplicated with relative ease. It is time for \nCongress to take action.\n  The bill I am introducing today attacks this problem in two ways. \nFirst, it reduces, from five to three, the number of false \nidentification documents that must be in an individual's possession \nbefore a prison sentence, a fine, or both, can be imposed under Federal \nlaw. Second, it requires a prison sentence, a fine, or both, for anyone \nconvicted of using the mail to send a false ID to someone under 21 \nyears of age.\n  Mr. President, let me explain both of these provisions in more \ndetail. The first provision tightens current Federal law which provides \npenalties for knowingly possessing or transferring unlawfully five or \nmore false identification documents. The number of false ID's necessary \nto trigger this law would be reduced from five to three. Someone \nconvicted under this provision would face a fine of up to $15,000, \nimprisonment of up to 3 years, or both.\n  These days, it is far too easy and cheap to buy a fake ID. therefore, \nbuying alcohol is not difficult for someone under 21. A recent report \nby the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stated that \n``minors can get state driver's license in Times Square in New York \nCity for $10 to $15 each.'' Young people always have attempted to buy \nalcohol at an early age. Nothing Congress does will suppress the urge \nfor alcohol in young people.\n  However, this bill is not directed at someone under 21 years of age \nwho possesses one or two false ID's. We can do little to address the \ndemand, but we can do something to reduce the supply. The Federal \nGovernment needs to crack down on those in the business of illegally \nproducing and transferring false ID's. By stiffening Federal penalties \nfor the production and distribution of false ID's, this bill will \npunish those who profit from teenage alcohol abuse and make obtaining \nfalse documents more difficult.\n  The second provision of this bill creates a new penalty for using the \nmails to distribute false ID's. Under this provision, anyone who \nknowingly sends an identification document showing an individuals to be \n21 years old or older through the mails--without first verifying the \nindividual's actual age--can be imprisoned for up to 1 year, be fined, \nor both. Verification can be satisfied by viewing a certification or \nother written communication confirming the age of the individual being \nidentified.\n  This provision attempts to stem the interstate distribution of false \nID's. Forty-six States currently have laws prohibiting youths from \nmisrepresenting their age in order to purchase alcohol. But nothing \nprohibits minors from obtaining false ID's from other States \n [[Page S3606]] through the mail. Tough Federal action is necessary. \nThis provision will affect businesses specializing in mail-order false \nID's.\n  To conclude, let me say this legislation has the support of the \nNational Licensed Beverage Association and the South Dakota Retail \nLiquor Dealers Association. I urge my colleagues to join them in \nsupporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record at this point. I also ask consent that several newspaper \narticles be included in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 507\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

The problem surfaced again after Friday's \n     announcement that three of the four Walt Whitman High School \n     girls involved in the Sept. 6 double-fatal car crash in \n     Potomac were carrying fake IDs.\n       The girls did not use their IDs that night, Montgomery \n     County police said, but relied instead on another way in \n     which teens procure alcohol: They had an adult buy 2\\1/2\\ \n     cases of beer for them from a liquor store in Georgetown the \n     night of the crash.\n       One mother of a boy who knew the girls later found four \n     different phony IDs in her own son's wallet, she told \n     friends.\n       Even as states take dozens of precautions in preparing \n     high-technology licenses designed to be difficult to copy, \n     technology-savvy students and underground counterfeiters \n     match the authorities' steps in meticulous and frustrating \n     ways.\n       ``It continues to be a problem, because, as police say, no \n     matter how tough they get, kids are smart and they always \n     find a way to get them,'' said Tim Kime, a spokesman for the \n     Washington Regional Alcohol Program, a private advocacy \n     group.\n       ``We live in the age of computers, and you can do wonderful \n     things with a computer. You get the right background [cloth], \n     the picture, the laminator, and you've got a pretty good \n     ID,'' said Sgt. David Dennison, who heads the Prince George's \n     County police collision analysis and reconstruction unit. The \n     unit's responsibilities include drunken driving and underage \n     drinking.\n       ``You bet there's some computer geniuses out there at these \n     colleges who find it very easy to do,'' Sgt. Dennison said. \n     ``If they can print money with computers, driver's licenses \n     aren't that hard.''\n       In the Potomac crash, driver Elizabeth Clark, 16, and a \n     front-seat passenger, Katherine Zirkle, 16, were killed with \n     Elizabeth's 1987 BMW hit a tree along River Road at 12:55 \n     a.m.\n       Two friends riding in the back seat, Elinor ``Nori'' \n     Andrews, 15, and Gretchen Sparrow, 16, were hospitalized with \n     serious injuries but were released last week.\n       Police said Elizabeth had a blood-alcohol level of .17 \n     percent, nearly double the .10 percent level that state law \n     defines as driving while intoxicated. Katherine's blood-\n     alcohol level was .03 percent police said.\n       In Maryland, minors with a blood-alcohol level of .02 \n     percent can have their licenses taken on the spot.\n       Detecting homegrown phony IDs isn't always easy, \n     authorities say.\n       ``In fact some police officers on the street couldn't tell \n     the difference unless they thoroughly examine them. You can \n     be fooled,'' said Sgt. John Daly of the Metropolitan Police \n     check and fraud division.\n       Earlier this year, Maryland introduced driver's licenses \n     with holograms, two separate pictures and a magnetic strip in \n     an effort to counter the counterfeiters.\n       ``But the kids are duplicating those,'' said Ms. Leonard, \n     the Montgomery council aide. ``A police officer told me that \n     [soon] after those came out, a kid took electrical tape and \n     put it on a fake ID.''\n       Although many high school students have fake IDs, police \n     find that most of them are manufactured, distributed and used \n     by college students. The IDs are bought, sold and distributed \n     through an underground black market spread by word of mouth.\n       Area students often make or procure fake IDs in the form of \n     licenses from far-away states such as Iowa or Kansas, \n     thinking local businesses won't know the difference. A widely \n     known legal guidebook available to businesses shows up-to-\n     date pictures of licenses from every state, but police say \n     that many merchants are too lazy to consult it.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                     Three Charged in Fake-ID Scam\n\n       Charlottesville.--Three former University of Virginia \n     students have been charged in what police said was a scheme \n     to pass stolen student identification cards and fraudulent \n     checks.\n       Police at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \n     said the ring operated in two states. Based in \n     Charlottesville, it included several former members of Alpha \n     Phi Alpha, a service fraternity at the University of Virginia \n     that was suspended in 1992 after a hazing incident.\n       Investigators believe the students stole about 400 UNC-\n     Chapel Hill ID cards in January to pass stolen or \n     counterfeited checks and to get state ID cards in North \n     Carolina and Virginia.\n       North Carolina authorities last week charged Canu C. \n     DiBona, 21, of Durham, N.C. with one count of felony \n     financial transaction card theft. Marcus A. Tucker, 23, of \n     Charlottesville was arrested Sept. 15 on several charges, \n     including felony financial transaction card theft and two \n     counts of forgery.\n       Authorities said Phillipe Zamore, 21, also of \n     Charlottesville also was implicated in the scheme. He was \n     arrested in April and charged with felony larceny after \n     attempting to use an illegally obtained credit card at a \n     University of Virginia bookstore.\n       Authorities said more arrests are expected.\n       Investigators said the cards reportedly have turned up as \n     far away as New York and Florida. Near the UNC-Chapel Hill \n     campus alone, the ring has used up to $20,000 in bad checks, \n     Lt. Clay Williams of the campus police said.\n       Police said members of the alleged ring used sophisticated \n     equipment to read information on magnetic tape on the backs \n     of the IDs, and even printed their own checks with a laser \n     printer.\n       ``All these kids are smart--that's what's striking about \n     this.'' Lt. Williams said. ``We have very intelligent young \n     men--extremely computer literate, highly articulate--that \n     could be upstanding professionals in the community, but \n     instead they chose the lure of fast money.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n       [From the St. Joseph's University (PA) Hawk, Mar. 15 1994]\n           Busted!--2 SJU Students Arrested in Fake I.D. Ring\n\n                         (By Maureen O'Connell)\n\n       The population of the state of New Jersey recently \n     fluctuated by an estimated 100 to 200 citizens as students \n     under the age of 21 obtained fraudulent drivers' licenses for \n     that \n      [[Page S3607]] state through an operation based on the \n     ground floor of Sourin Residence Hall and the Adam's Mark \n     Hotel last weekend.\n       St. Joseph's University Security and the Pennsylvania State \n     Police stepped in to curb this rapid population boom and \n     arrested six students and two juveniles directly connected \n     with the scheme. Two of the six students, identified by The \n     Philadelphia Inquirer as Salvatore Carollo and Carl Lynn, \n     attend St. Joseph's and are residents of Sourin room 15. \n     According to the Inquirer both were arraigned on Sunday \n     evening on charges of forgery and manufacturing false \n     identification.\n       The fake ID factory, which turned out near-authentic \n     licenses with the help of advanced computer programming and \n     other electronic devices at the cost of $100 a pop, was not a \n     well kept secret and was quickly leaked to St. Joseph's \n     University Security and the Pennsylvania State Police.\n       According to director of public safety and security Albert \n     Hall, a ``top security'' officer discovered the operation \n     during a shift on Friday evening.\n       ``He notified me at home and had some very good information \n     that this was happening,'' said Hall.\n       ``By the sign-in logs it is pretty evident that it started \n     on Thursday evening,'' said Hall.\n       ``I decided we had a felony being committed and I knew we \n     had to bring it to law enforcement's attention or we would be \n     obstructing justice. I then called the Pennsylvania State \n     Police and left a message. Later that evening, [an officer in \n     the] Fraudulent Document Unit called\n      and he was very interested in what was going on.''\n       Hall said that shortly after he made his call, the State \n     Police received a call from an informed parent.\n       According to Hall, University security met with State \n     Police the next morning, Saturday, at 8 a.m. to determine a \n     strategy.\n       ``A plan was devised to introduce a state trooper as a \n     student and to have the Pennsylvania state trooper be sent \n     through the process,'' said Hall.\n       The trooper joined students in the assembly line--he \n     entered Sourin, gave the necessary personal information which \n     was logged into a computer, trekked to the Adams Mark Hotel, \n     was photographed, and received his ``bogus ID.''\n       Almost immediately, Security and the State Police entered \n     Sourin while the State Police alone entered the Adam's Mark.\n       ``We went through the room (in Sourin) and found the \n     outside person who we believe to be responsible for typing \n     information into the computer,'' said Hall. He also mentioned \n     that the Police also found ``more electronic equipment.''\n       According to Hall, four St. Joseph's students were present \n     in the room in Sourin. One was completely unconnected with \n     the operation and consequently released. Two others were \n     given non-traffic citations for summary offenses and the \n     fourth was arrested for misdemeanors of fraud and \n     manufacturing false documents.\n       Hall mentioned that three visiting students were also in \n     the room, one of whom was released. The remaining two \n     visitors were charged with felonies for fraud and \n     manufacturing false documents.\n       ``I have very good information that they have worked other \n     schools in the Maryland area and I have put them in touch \n     with the State Police,'' said Hall.\n       He also claimed that State Police seized ``what appeared to \n     be back-up discs for information saved on computers.''\n       ``Another group of St. Joseph's students who went to the \n     Adam's Mark Hotel with the trooper were issued non-traffic \n     citations,'' added Hall.\n       ``Several other participants were charged with felonies at \n     the Adam's Mark Hotel,'' he said.\n       According to Pennsylvania State Trooper Gant who has been \n     involved in subsequent investigations, an additional 5 to 7 \n     students were given non-traffic citations in the hotel.\n       Gant explained that these citations involve ``sliding \n     fines'' up to $500 dollars, depending upon judicial decision.\n       ``The people arrested were held at Eighth and Race awaiting \n     arraignment until Sunday,'' said Hall. ``For the parties \n     involved charged with felonies and misdemeanors there is a \n     range of penalties from fines to jail sentences.''\n       Regardless of Commonwealth penalties, the University will \n     subject the two arrested students to the traditional \n     disciplinary system.\n       ``Two St. Joseph's undergraduates arrested over the weekend \n     in a counterfeit I.D. scheme have been suspended by the \n     University pending further investigation and review,'' said \n     director of external relations Joseph Lundardi in a press \n     release on Monday. ``An internal disciplinary hearing will be \n     conducted later this week, with findings and/or sanctions \n     referred to the Vice President for Student Life and \n     Provost.''\n       According to the Student Handbook both students committed \n     the following major violations: 1) Misrepresentation of \n     identity or age; forging or altering records\n      including University identification card: 2.)

Several St. Joe's students \n     purchased ID's and some of them were understandably worried.\n       One student, who did not purchase an ID, was present in the \n     room when the police arrived.\n       ``The door gets kicked in (and they shout) `Hit the floor! \n     F.B.I., State Police! Everybody down, down!' just like a \n     scene out of `Cops','' said the student. ``They handcuffed me \n     to one of the guys whose room it was, who I felt bad for \n     because he didn't know the full impact of what was going \n     on,'' he added.\n       Police spent some time in the room trying to sort out who \n     was in charge. ``They recognized one of the girls as the \n     person who takes the people from Sourin to the Adam's Mark. \n     Her and the kid at the computer, those two played it cool and \n     calm. Everybody else was flipping out. One kid was crying, \n     bawling and he didn't even do anything. He was in there \n     looking for one of his friends,'' said the student.\n       ``Eventually they took three of us out, me, the other one \n     and this girl. They didn't take us out in handcuffs or \n     anything, they just took us in the police car, and took us \n     down,'' explained the student. ``The cop was trying to get \n     something out of the kids that would incriminate the other \n     kids,'' he said.\n       ``When they took us down to the station, at one point there \n     was this St. Joe's official and he saw the one kid was crying \n     and he went up to him and said, `You better tell him \n     everything you know if you want to stay in this school,''' \n     the student reported.\n       The student said he was held\n        for two and a half hours and then released. He claims that \n     some of the agents looked very familiar to him.\n       ``I recognized three undercover agents as people who I \n     thought were St. Joe's students,'' he said.\n       He also claimed that this is not the only location this \n     group has hit.\n       ``I knew a guy whose sister came up for the weekend and she \n     got the same exact ID from the same people at a different \n     school,'' he said.\n       Some students who did purchase an ID at St. Joseph's, but \n     were not present when the police arrived, are worried because \n     of rumors of a computer disk containing all of the names of \n     students who purchased the fake NJ licenses.\n       ``I'm very nervous,'' said one student who purchased an ID \n     on Friday. She reported that she paid $100 for the fake \n     license.\n       ``I went over to Sourin and went in the room. I filled out \n     a sheet with all the information and someone entered it into \n     a computer.

They ran it through these \n     machines and five minutes later I had the ID,'' she \n     explained.\n       The student had been signed into Sourin by a friend who \n     lives in the building. She said it was obvious that not \n     everyone could have been signed into the same room since it \n     was fairly crowded.\n       ``There were twelve people there when I was there,'' she \n     noted.\n       One student reported that he had to sign a disclaimer \n     stating that the license was not endorsed by the government \n     or the New Jersey Department of Motor Vehicles.

She intends to use the \n     ID, but not around here.\n       Students who were not involved in the incident in any way \n     were also affected.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \ncertain provisions relating to the treatment of forestry activities; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                         reforestation tax act\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nBreaux, Gorton, Stevens, Cochran, and Campbell in introducing the \nReforestation Tax Act of 1995. This legislation will encourage \ninvestment in and sound management of privately owned forest land.\n  Mr. President, our forests serve as the foundation of a multibillion \ndollar forest products industry. From lumber and construction materials \nto pulp and paper, timber provides a wide range of products that are \nessential to modern living. At the same time, our forests provide \nwildlife habitat, maintain watershed, and are used for a broad range of \nrecreational activities, including fishing, hunting, hiking, and \ncamping.\n  One of the challenges facing this country is ensuring that we have \nenough forests to meet our wildlife habitat and watershed needs as well \nas sustaining a reliable supply of timber for forest products. As \nharvest levels on public lands decline, we need to encourage private \nforesters to invest in and properly maintain their stock of trees.\n  Yet there is strong evidence that private and public tree replanting \nis declining. According to the U.S. Forest Service tree replanting and \ndirect seeding has been steadily declining. Between 1980 and 1988, \nannual private tree planting increased from 1.76 million acres per year \nto 2.96 million acres per year. However, in every year since 1988, \nprivate tree replantings have continuously declined, reaching barely \n2.04 million acres in 1993--one-third lower than in 1988.\n  The decline in private reforestation reflects the reality that this \nis a very long-term, high-risk business. Trees can take anywhere from \n25 to 75 years to grow to maturity, depending on the type of tree and \nregional weather and soil conditions. The key to success is good \nmanagement which is costly. And fire and disease can wipe out acres of \ntrees at any time during the long growing period.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will boost private \ninvestment in forests and aid in the cost of maintaining these forests. \nOur legislation has four components:\n  Partial elimination of the tax on inflationary gains. The gain from \nthe sale of private timber would be reduced by 3 percent for each year \nthe timber is owned, up to a maximum reduction of 50 percent of the \ngain. This should protect long-term investors in forest land from being \ntaxed on inflationary gains.\n  Doubling the reforestation tax credit. The current reforestation tax \ncredit has been significantly eroded by inflation because it has not \nbeen increased in 15 years. Our bill doubles the amount of \nreforestation expenditures eligible for the credit--from $10,000 to \n$20,000--and indexes this amount for future inflation.\n  Amortization of reforestation expenses. The current law special 7-\nyear amortization for up to $10,000 of forestation expenses also has \nnot kept up with inflation since it was enacted in 1980. Our \nlegislation increases this amount to $20,000 and indexes it for future \ninflation. In addition, it reduces the amortization period to 5 years.\n  Passive loss rules. Treasury regulations seriously discourage private \nforester from employing sound forest management practices. Our bill \nrevises the regulations by providing that private foresters, like most \nother business entrepreneurs, can prove that they are materially \nparticipating in the forestry business.\n  Mr. President, there can be no doubt that passage of this legislation \nis a key to the preservation and expansion of investment in this vital \nnatural resources. It has been endorsed by conservation, environmental \nand forestry organizations including the American Forest and Paper \nAssociation, the National Association of State Foresters, the \nWilderness Society and the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort to encourage long-term \ninvestment in private forest land and cosponsor this important \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a list of the \norganizations supporting this legislation be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 508\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter \ninto an appropriate form of agreement with, the town of Grand Lake, \nCO., authorizing the town to maintain permanently a cemetery in the \nRocky Mountain National Park; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n          rocky mountain national park grand lake cemetery act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, On January 26, 1915, Congress passed \nlegislation creating a 265,726-acre Rocky Mountain National Park. In \n1892, long before the park was created, the town of grand lake \nestablished a small, less than 5-acre community cemetery that lies \nbarely 1,000 feet inside the western edge of the park. Apparently, in \nthe early 1950's, the National Park Service took notice of the cemetery \nand issued the town a formal special use permit, which has been renewed \nover the years. In 1991, Rocky Mountain National Part apparently \ninformed the town of grand lake that it would issue one final 5-year \nspecial use permit.\n  This 103-year-old cemetery has become part of the community's \nheritage. Grand Lake residents have very strong emotional and personal \nattachments to it and need to be assured of its continued use and \ndesignation as a cemetery. The current permit is due to expire in 1996. \nAll parties have agreed that a more permanent solution was needed to \nmeet the needs of the community and the resource preservation and \nprotection intended by the establishment of the park.\n  Existing measures available to the National Park Service, including \nspecial use permit authority, do not provide for a permanent solution \nthat satisfies both the park and the community. In addition, special \nuses apparently can only be permitted for a maximum period of 5 years. \nGiven that the town and park agree that the small cemetery is a \npermanent use, continued renewal of a 5-year permit is not a realistic \nsolution.\n  In an effort to avoid future difficulties, park and town \nrepresentatives have agreed that this legislation would offer the best \nsolution to this problem. Authorizing the continued existence of the \ncemetery with specific size and boundaries within the park also \nprotects park resources. The community has expressed a strong \nwillingness and desire to assume responsibility for permanent \nmanagement of the cemetery. This legislation would authorize the \ndevelopment of an agreement to turn maintenance responsibilities for \nthe cemetery and road over to the town, resulting in a financial \nsavings to the park. It also recognizes the cultural significance of \nthe cemetery and its strong ties with the history of the Grand Lake \narea, which includes the story of Rocky Mountain National Park.\n  This legislation would negate the need for repeated negotiations \nbetween the community and the National Park Service, and the chance for \nmisunderstandings. The National Park Service and Grand Lake \nrepresentatives have worked long and hard on developing this proposal. \nEnactment of this legislation would go a long way in maintaining and \nenhancing the spirit of cooperation and good will between park and \ncommunity that has been achieved during the development of this \nresolution.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 510. A bill to extend the authorization for certain programs under \nthe Native American Programs Act of 1974, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                NATIVE AMERICAN PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the vice chairman of \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Inouye, join me today in \nintroducing a bill to extend the authorization for certain programs \nunder the Native American Programs Act of 1974. This program is \nadministered by the Administration for Native Americans, or ANA, within \nthe Department of Health and Human Services.\n  Each year ANA awards several hundred grants to Indian and Alaska \nNative tribes and other native communities and organizations for \ngovernance, social and economic development, and environmental \nmitigation projects. While modest in size, ANA grants have proven to be \nextremely valuable tools for tribes and other native community groups \nseeking to further their self-sufficiency. ANA and its grants are vital \nto many Indian and native communities. ANA has earned \n [[Page S3610]] strong support from Indian and Alaska Native tribes.\n  The authority for most of the grants distributed by ANA expires at \nthe end of fiscal year 1995. Although the administration has requested \nfunding for fiscal year 1996 at fiscal year 1995 levels, it has yet to \nforward a bill to Congress to reauthorize the act.\n  This important but small program should not be placed in jeopardy by \nthe administration's distraction-of-the-month. Therefore, I am \nintroducing this reauthorization bill without the benefit of the \nadministration's request. The bill would simply extend by 4 years the \ngeneral authority for ANA appropriations and by 3 years the authority \nfor ANA tribal environmental quality grant appropriations. In both \ncases, the reauthorization would extend to fiscal year 1999 and the \namounts authorized would remain unchanged.

A bill to require the periodic review and automatic \ntermination of Federal regulations; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n                    regulatory sunset and review act\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Regulatory \nSunset and Review Act of 1995, a bill that requires all existing \nFederal regulations to terminate in 7 years and new regulations to \nterminate in 5 years unless the appropriate agency, after soliciting \npublic input and with the direction and guidance from Congress and the \nOffice of Management and Budget, determines the regulations are still \nrelevant and necessary.\n  The purpose of this bill is to address the staggering volume of \nregulations promulgated each year and the enormous costs associated \nwith these regulations that place such a financial and management \nburden on all Americans.\n  This bill could be termed a ``consumers'' bill. As regulations are \npromulgated by various Government agencies, the cost of complying with \nthese regulations is estimated to be between $250 and $500 billion \nannually. As noted in the March 4, 1995, Washington Post article, ``The \nMyths That Rule us:''\n\n       . . . economists are nearly unanimous in believing at least \n     half the cost (of regulations) is passed on to consumers in \n     the form of higher prices. Most of the rest is passed on to \n     employees in the form of lower wages. . . . Put another way, \n     regulation is a form of taxation that amounts to about $2,000 \n     per year for the average U.S. household . . .\n\n  It is time we review these regulations to determine if they are \nnecessary--if their benefits outweigh the costs, if they are \nduplicative, out-of-date, and if they are written in the most clear and \nunambiguous way possible.\n  Americans from all walks of life are affected by these regulations: \nsmall to large businesses, hospitals and schools, farmers and ranchers, \nand local, State, and tribal governments, to name but just a few. In \nthe last two months of 1994 alone, 615 proposed and final regulations \nwere published in the Federal Register. In all, the Federal Register \ntotaled 68,107 pages in length in 1994. It is time to get a handle on \nthese regulations to determine if they should be modified or \neliminated, and this bill will respond to this need by establishing a \nmandatory review process by the agencies.\n  The importance of examining the thousands of existing regulations has \nbeen enunciated clearly by my constituents in New Mexico. In 1994, I \ncreated a Small Business Advocacy Council to advise me about the \nproblems of small businesses and how Congress could address some of \ntheir concerns. The council held 7 meetings in 6 locations throughout \nthe State of New Mexico, and more than 400 businesses participated in \nthese meetings. The consistent theme at all of these meetings was the \nappearance of an adversarial relationship between the Federal \nGovernment and business, as well as the lack of accountability of \nregulatory agencies in their dealings with business.\n  A few weeks ago in Albuquerque, the Senate Small Business Committee \nkicked off a series of field hearings entitled ``Entrepreneurship in \nAmerica.'' Many members of the Small Business Advocacy Council \ntestified at this hearing and explained to Chairman Christopher Bond \nhow difficult it is to not only understand the regulations, but to \ncomply with them.\n  As an example, one witness said that the EEOC performs audits to \nensure that an employer is in compliance with title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. The EEOC asks for a roster of employees to identify \nminority group, sex, and disabilities. The witness said, however, that \nwhile the information may be useful, an employer is unable to ask these \nquestions of applicants or employees.\n  This is only one example, but over the past year, I can assure you \nthat I have heard countless similar examples that point out the \ninconsistencies, duplications, and burdensome nature of these \nGovernment regulations. And, an important emphasis must be made: all \nthe witnesses understood and supported the positive aspects of \nregulations--that they were developed with the best intentions for good \npurposes. The witnesses simply believe that there must be a better way \nthan the present system.\n  I would like to mention briefly a report by the General Accounting \nOffice [GAO], completed in June 1994, entitled ``Workplace Regulation--\nInformation on Selected Employer and Union Experience.'' While I intend \nto devote more detail to this report at a later time, let me just \nmention that the GAO's finding were strikingly similar to the findings \nof the New Mexico Business Advocacy Council: Those interviewed called \nfor the adoption of a more service-oriented approach to workplace \nregulation; an improvement to information access and educational \nassistance to employers, workers, and unions; and more input into \nagency standard setting and enforcement efforts. The report discussed \nthe constantly changing and complex nature of regulations and that they \nare often ambiguous with an increased potential for lawsuits.\n  It is obvious the time has come to review these regulations in a \nconcise and systematic way. The process needs an overhaul, and this \nbill is designed to help facilitate this restructuring.\n  I am pleased my distinguished colleague, Senator Spencer Abraham, is \njoining me in introduction of this timely measure, and I hope others \nwill soon join us in this endeavor. This bill is almost identical to a \nmeasure introduced in the House last week by Representatives Chapman, \nMica, and DeLay, H.R. 994. As regulatory reform measures are considered \nin both Chambers, I believe the Regulatory Sunset and Review Act of \n1995 will be an important component of these efforts.\n   [[Page S3611]] I ask unanimous consent that a statement by Senator \nAbraham be included as a part of the Record and that the text of the \nbill be printed following these remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 511\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I strongly support the legislation \nsponsored by my good friend from New Mexico, Senator Pete Domenici.\n  Not long ago we passed legislation that finally subjects Congress to \nmost work place and other laws that affect the American people. I \nenthusiastically supported this legislation out of a sense of \nfundamental fairness: it seemed to me that the body that legislates \nrules for the rest of society at the very least ought to be obliged to \nfollow those rules itself.\n  But I had another reason for supporting the accountability act. You \nsee, it seemed to me that when Members of Congress actually had to \nconfront and deal with some of the onerous regulations they have been \nimposing on the people of America they might decide that it was time to \neliminate some of the overregulation that is strangling our economy.\n  For too long Congress has acted as if regulation is cost free, even \nthough at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's estimate, they cost our \neconomy $510 billion a year--9 percent of our gross domestic product. \nFor too long Congress has acted as if the burden of paperwork these \nregulations impose is either light or nonexistent when, according to \nthe chamber of commerce, Federal regulations alone require 6.8 billion \nhours of paperwork to our businesses and entrepreneurs.\n  But the accountability act alone will not be enough because the sheer \ninertia of Government regulation continues to push our businesses, and \nsmall businesses in particular, into bankruptcy. We must cull the code \nbooks of regulations that are redundant, obsolete, unnecessarily costly \nand just plain unnecessary.\n  This Regulatory Sunset and Review Act will go a long way toward \nfighting the inertia of Government regulation by putting in place a \nmandatory review procedure for all regulations our bureaucrats want to \nsee continued. It would place in each agency a review officer who would \nreview all regulations, new and old, with the aid of Congress and the \nOffice of Management and Budget.\n  All existing regulations would terminate within 7 years unless they \npass a rigorous review process. For new regulations the initial sunset \nperiod would be 5 years. The goal would not be to eliminate all \nregulations, after all some regulations are needed to enforce statutes \nwe have passed to protect Americans' health and safety as well as their \nrights. But we do not need regulations, and should not have them, \nunless as required by this act they are shown to be: necessary; more \nbeneficial than costly; reasonable in their cost and other impact on \nconsumers; clear and unambiguous; unlikely to cause unnecessary \nlitigation; and reasonable in their burden on local, State and National \neconomies.\n  Only by subjecting our regulations to rigorous, repeated review can \nwe finally bring the spread of over-regulation under control. Only by \nsetting up a standardized review procedure can we ensure that \nbureaucratic inertia and discretion no longer stifle our economy and \nour liberties.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of endorsement for the \nDomenici-Abraham regulatory sunset bill from the National Federation of \nIndependent Business be entered into the Record:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         NFIB,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Spence Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the more than 600,000 \n     members of the National Federation of Independent Business, I \n     am writing to support your legislation, the Regulatory Sunset \n     and Review Act.\n       Government regulations constitute an enormous burden for \n     small businesses. Even beneficial regulations are so complex \n     that small business owners find it increasingly difficult to \n     comply.\n       The Domenici-Abraham legislation will help curb the cost of \n     federal regulations on small business by sunsetting them. \n     Requiring a periodic justification for existing and future \n     regulations is essential if small businesses are going to \n     start-up, grow and expand while creating jobs all along the \n     way.\n       With regulatory sunsetting regulations and the federal \n     agencies responsible for them must justify their existence \n     through a review process in order to keep them on the books. \n     Necessary regulations would continue while others would be \n     modified and the unnecessary would disappear.\n       The Domenici-Abraham regulatory sunset legislation is a \n     concept NFIB members have been supporting for years. Seventy-\n     seven percent of our members voted overwhelmingly to support \n     reevaluating regulations on a frequent basis. We think the \n     Domenici-Abraham approach is a balanced and fair approach to \n     weeding out what works with what is unnecessary in the \n     current regulatory system.\n       NFIB strongly supports your Regulatory Sunset and Review \n     legislation. We look forward to working with you to pass this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           John J. Morley III,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n                                   Federal Governmental Relations.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 512. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a 5-year extension of the Medicare-dependent, small, rural \nhospital payment provisions, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n           medicare dependent hospitals program extension act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill which would \nextend the Medicare-dependent Hospital Program.\n  This program expired in October 1994. As its title implied, the \nhospitals it helped were those which were very dependent on Medicare \nreimbursement. These were small--100 beds or less--rural, hospitals \nwith not less than 60 percent of total discharges or with 60 percent of \ntotal inpatient days attributable to Medicare beneficiaries. The \nprogram enabled the hospitals in question to choose the most favorable \nof three reimbursement methods.\n  This program was extended, and phased out down to October 1994, in \nthe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. That act retained the \nchoice of the three original reimbursement methods. But it reduced the \nreimbursement available from those original computation methods by 50 \npercent.\n  My legislation would not extend the program as it was originally \nenacted by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. Rather, it \nwould extend for 5 years the provisions contained in the Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1993. My bill would also extend those provisions \nretroactively. That is, as though the program had not expired in \nOctober 1994.\n  As I noted above, the hospitals which benefited from this program are \nsmall, rural, hospitals providing an essential point of access to \nhospital or hospital-based services in rural areas and small towns.\n  Obviously, as those of my colleagues who have followed, and \nparticipated in, our debates about the health care needs of rural areas \nknow only too well, if we lose these hospitals, we will also have a \nhard time keeping physicians in those communities.\n  [[Page S3613]] Mr. President, 44, or 36 percent, of Iowa's 122 \ncommunity hospitals qualified to participate in this program, and 29, \nor 24 percent, chose to participate in 1994. I believe that this was \nthe largest number of such hospitals of any State.\n  The percentage of all inpatient days attributable to Medicare \npatients is 77.4 percent for these hospitals, and Medicare discharges \nrepresent 65.5 percent of total discharges.\n  These Iowa hospitals will lose about $3 million dollars as a \nconsequence of the expiration of this program, according to estimates \nmade by the Iowa Hospital Association. The annual losses will vary from \na low of $3,635 to a high of $248,016. Fourteen of these hospitals will \nlose $100,000 or more. Fourteen of these hospitals had negative \noperating margins in 1994. Those negative operating margins varied from \nminus $30,970 to minus $1,065,105. It is highly likely that the \nfinancial situation of these hospitals will be even worse in the coming \nyears. Two of the hospitals with positive operating margins will \nprobably begin to have negative margins with the expiration of the \nprogram.\n  The bottom line is that many of these hospitals are going to have a \nvery difficult time continuing to exist when this program expires.\n  Mr. President, I am also going to work toward extension of the each/\nrpch program--the Essential Access Community Hospital and Rural Primary \nCare Hospital Program. If this program is extended to all the States, \nand if the Medicare-Dependent Hospital Program is extended, the smaller \nhospitals in Iowa would be able to modify their missions in a \ndeliberate and nondisruptive way and continue to provide essential \nhealth care services in their communities.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HEFLIN:\n  S. 513. A bill to amend chapter 23 of title 28, United States Code, \nto authorize voluntary alternative dispute resolution programs in \nFederal courts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n              voluntary alternative dispute resolution act\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation that \nwould authorize our Nation's Federal district courts to adopt and \nutilize voluntary alternative dispute resolution programs.\n  The time has come for Congress and the Federal courts to realize that \nthere must be alternative ways of settling disputes other than the \ntraditional methods utilizing a Federal judge and jury. With criminal \ncases crowding the dockets, many litigants in civil cases, especially \nsmall businesses, simply cannot get their cases heard in a timely \nmanner.\n  Recent statistics from the Administrative Office of the United States \nCourts indicate that a majority of cases in the Federal courts are \ncivil cases and that the number of filings since 1990 has increased 9 \npercent. With criminal cases being put on a fast track, the time has \ncome for Congress to assist the Federal courts in processing civil \ncases for the benefit of the American people.\n  Our Federal court system is one of the best in the world, and our \njudges work long hours to hear cases which come before them. I believe \nthe approach that my legislation takes will bring the Federal courts \ninto the 21st century ahead of schedule by expressing Congress' intent \nthat if parties want to voluntarily settle their civil disputes by such \nmethods as court annexed arbitration, meditation, early neutral \nevaluation, minitrials, or summary trials, then they should be allowed \nto do so.\n  I am introducing this legislation as a result of a hearing which the \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Courts and Administrative Practice held \nseveral months ago. I was privileged to Chair this subcommittee hearing \nwhich heard testimony from a number of distinguished witnesses \nincluding Judge Anne Williams, on behalf of the U.S. Judicial \nConference; Judge Bill Wilson, U.S. District Court (E.D. Arkansas); \nJudge William Schwarzer on behalf of the Federal Judicial Center; U.S. \nMagistrate Judge Wayne Brazil (N.D. California); Judge Raymond \nBroderick (E.D. Pennsylvania); Stuart Grossman, on behalf of the \nAmerican Board of Trial Advocates; Jack Watson, on behalf of the \nAmerican Bar Association; and Dianne Nast, a practicing attorney in \nPhiladelphia.\n  The focus of the hearing was to consider H.R. 1102, introduced by \nCongressman Bill Hughes of New Jersey, which would have required, not \nmerely authorized, each of the 94 Federal district courts to adopt \neither a mandatory or a voluntary court-annexed arbitration program \nwhich would operate under the existing authority of Chapter 44, \nSections 651-658 of Title 28 of the United States Code. H.R. 1102 would \nhave increased the maximum amount in controversy for cases referred \nunder the mandatory programs from $100,000 to $150,000.\n  In 1988, Congress enacted legislation to authorize the continuation \nof 10 pilot programs of mandatory court-annexed arbitration that were \nin operation in the Federal courts, and this legislation also \nauthorized 10 additional pilot programs that would be of a voluntary \nnature.\n  This authorization was to terminate toward the end of 1993, and H.R. \n1102 would have made that authorization permanent and would have \nrequired each district court to adopt either a mandatory or a voluntary \nprogram of court-annexed arbitration. Because of strong concerns raised \nat the hearing regarding the mandatory nature of court-annexed \narbitration, our subcommittee was unwilling to immediately go forward \nwith H.R. 1102. Instead, S. 1732, which became Public Law 103-192, was \nintroduced toward the end of 1993, which simply extended the existing \nauthority for one year with regard to the 20 pilot districts utilizing \ncourt-annexed arbitration.\n  In early August last year, I, along with my colleagues Senators \nBiden, Hatch, Grassley, and Specter, introduced S. 2407, the Judicial \nAmendments Act of 1994, to extend this authority for an additional 3 \nyears until the end of 1997. S. 2407 was introduced and passed by the \nSenate on August 19, and sent to the House of Representatives which \nalso passed it at the close of session. It was signed by the President \non October 25, 1994, and became Public Law 103-420.\n  Let me return now to the hearing which the subcommittee held in \nOctober 1993 and which focused primarily on arbitration which is one of \nthe programs of ADR as alternative dispute resolution is popularly \ncalled. Judge Ann Claire Williams of the U.S. District Court for the \nNorthern District of Illinois appeared on behalf of the U.S. Judicial \nConference which is the policymaking body of the Federal judiciary. The \nJudicial Conference has recommended that Congress should authorize all \nFederal district courts to have the discretion to utilize voluntary \nnonbinding court-annexed arbitration. Thus, the judicial Conference did \nnot recommend the expansion of mandatory court-annexed arbitration for \nthe remainder of the Federal district courts.\n  The legislation which I am introducing today builds on the \nrecommendation of the Judicial Conference by authorizing each of the 94 \nFederal district courts to adopt not only voluntary court-annexed \narbitration but also other ADR programs, including but not limited to \nmediation, early neutral evaluation, minitrials, summary jury or bench \ntrials.\n  My legislation also contains a provision that clearly states that \n``[a]n alternative dispute resolution program shall not in any way \ninfringe on a litigant's right to trial de novo and shall impose no \npenalty on participating litigants.''\n  Over the last year, I have talked with many people from both the bar \nand the business community, and I believe that it is an undeniable fact \nthat civil litigation in the Federal courts has become more \ncomplicated, time-consuming, and expensive. Further, the Speedy Trial \nAct, requiring criminal cases to proceed on a fast track, has resulted \nin delays in civil cases being considered by the Federal courts.\n  I want to make certain that the Congress clearly intends for our \nFederal courts to consider alternative means of dispute resolution, so \nthat litigants can have a speedy and less expensive alternative to \nformal civil adjudication, consistent with the requirements of the \nseventh amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Where parties are willing \n [[Page S3614]] to mutually participate in such alternatives, I believe \nthere are merits that justify our support for such programs.\n  I hope that this legislation will be carefully considered by my \ncolleagues, and I look forward to further discussion on its merits in \nthe days ahead.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 514. A bill for the relief of the heirs, successors, or assigns of \nSadae Tamabayashi; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               relief for the family of sadae tamabayashi\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill for the relief \nof the family of Sadae Tamabayashi.\n  In 1941, Mrs. Tamabayashi was the owner of Paradise Clothes Cleaning \nShop in Honolulu, HI. On the fateful morning of December 7, she and her \nfamily lost everything that they owned. The attack on Pearl Harbor not \nonly had national repercussions, it affected the lives of many \nindividuals as well, especially those who lived in Hawaii at the time. \nFor Sadae Tamabayashi and her family, the bombing was devastating to \ntheir livelihood.\n  On the morning of December 7, Paradise Clothes Cleaning Shop was \ndestroyed by fire which started as a result of the attack on Pearl \nHarbor and the subsequent retaliatory shots by U.S. Armed Forces. The \nentire building and its contents, which included the Tamabayashi's \nfamily quarters, were destroyed.\n  The Tamabayashi family attempted to seek compensation through the War \nDamage Corporation Claims Service Office in 1942. Their efforts were to \nno avail. Their claim for reparations was denied by the corporation \nbecause Mrs. Tamabayashi was a Japanese national. However, Mrs. \nTamabayashi was prohibited from becoming a citizen under the \nImmigration Act of 1924, which excluded persons of Japanese descent. It \nwas not until 1952, 7 years after the end of World War II, that the \n1924 Immigration Act was repealed, and Asians were finally given equal \ncitizenship status in this country.\n  The family of Sadae Tamabayashi seeks fair treatment of their \nmother's losses. I hope that my colleagues will support this effort to \nbring to a close this sad chapter in the lives of the Tamabayashi \nfamily.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BRADLEY:\n  S. 515. A bill to amend the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the \nPoultry Products Inspection Act to provide for improved public health \nand food safety through the reduction of harmful substances in meat and \npoultry that present a threat to public health, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                       family food protection act\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, let me tell you about Katie O'Connell. \nKatie's picture ended up on postcards that thousands of Americans have \nsent and will be sending to Washington. Neither her parents nor I are \nglad that this is the case. You see, Katie was a beautiful, happy, 2-\nyear-old girl from my home State of New Jersey. Yet, she died from \neating a hamburger served at a fast food restaurant. Unknown to anyone, \nher meal was contaminated with a deadly pathogen called E coli. Sadly, \nthe meat that Katie ate had been declared safe by inspectors from the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  Katie died from a disease that should have been detected through our \nFederal meat inspection system. Katie is no longer alive because that \nsystem failed her and her family, and has failed thousands of others \nacross the country. The legislation I am introducing today, the Family \nFood Protection Act, is designed to ensure a Federal system that \nprotects the public and not just meat processors and slaughterhouses.\n  Diseases cause by foodborne illness often strike those most \nvulnerable in our society: our children. Last summer, health officials \nin New Jersey battled another outbreak of the disease that killed Katie \nO'Connell. One family the McCormick's of Newton, NJ, had two of their \nchildren--ages 2 and 3--hospitalized. Their lives were in danger \nbecause they too ate meat that had been declared safe by Federal \ninspectors in the Department of Agriculture.\n  These cases in New Jersey are far from isolated: The Centers for \nDisease Control estimates that over 9,000 people die, and another 6.5 \nmillion become sick, from foodborne illness every year.\n  That the current system represents a false promise to the public is \nnot news. Many studies, including work by the GAO and the National \nAcademy of Science, make this point.\n  About 1 month ago, the USDA proposed a series of new regulations for \nfood inspection. These rules would require a daily testing for \nsalmonella at meat/poultry processing plants. Additionally, each of the \nNation's 6,000 slaughterhouses and processing plants would have to \ndevelop operating plans designed to minimize the possible sources of \ncontamination.\n  This proposal represents a significant improvement over the current \nsystem--which has remained remarkably unchanged for 90 years. However, \nthe proposal leaves some significant holes. The Family Food Protection \nAct fills the holes:\n  First, the Family Food Protection Act is comprehensive--we need to \nrecognize the scope of the problem. It's not just salmonella. We need \nUSDA to consider the whole range of human pathogens--bacteria--and \nother harmful substances--for example animal drugs, pollutants--that \ncan threaten health. My bill calls on the Secretary to enact standards \nand regulations designed to control and reduce any of these dangerous \nsubstances that is likely to cause foodborne illness.\n  Second, the Family Food Protection Act gives the Secretary the \nenforcement tools he needs--the bill allows the Secretary: to order a \nrecall of contaminated food; to demand the identification of the whole \nchain of companies that may have handled a contaminated food--\n``traceback''; to withdraw Federal inspection, and the USDA seal of \napproval from plants that are repeated violators of regulations; to \nissue civil fines, which makes it more likely that the processors will \nfollow through with their improved operating procedures.\n  Third, the Family Food Protection Act helps protect the conscientious \nworker--the new USDA regulations depend on changes in the daily \noperations of thousands of plants to protect the public. In order to \nprovide the most protection to the public, we need the cooperation of \nworkers as well as managers. This bill provides explicit whistleblower \nprotection to food processing employees who step forward with public \nhealth concerns.\n  Fourth, the Family Food Protection Act keeps the public involved and \ninformed--this bill would: provide for public access to food safety \ninspection records; create a public advisory board of food safety.\n  Last Congress, Congressman Torricelli and I introduced the Katie \nO'Connell Safe Food Act. Like most legislation, that bill didn't make \nit into law. But that fact does not mean that we haven't changed policy \nas a result. This bill exposed the inadequacies of the status quo and \nshook up the bureaucrats at USDA.\n  I'm pleased that the USDA is trying to respond to the challenge of \nfood safety. But the USDA has much more to do before the public can \nreally believe their program means a guarantee of healthy food. This \nnew bill is the blueprint for the work yet to be done.\n  The Family Food Protection Act is supported by a wide range of \nconsumer and food safety advocacy groups. I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to consider this legislation carefully and support its \nenactment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a bill summary and the \nlegislation be printed following these remarks.\n  There being no objection, the materials was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 515\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) bacterial foodborne illness exacts a terrible toll on \n     United States citizens, taking approximately 9,000 lives each \n     year and causing between 6,500,000 and 80,000,000 illnesses;\n       (2) meat and meat food products, and poultry and poultry \n     products, contaminated with pathogenic bacteria are a leading \n     cause of foodborne illness;\n       (3) foodborne illness related to meat and poultry cost \n     Americans between $2,000,000,000 and $4,000,000,000 each year \n     in medical expenses and lost wages;\n       (4) the number of illnesses and deaths associated with \n     adulterated meat and poultry undermines public confidence in \n     the food supply of the United States and tends to destroy \n     both domestic and foreign markets for wholesome meat and \n     poultry;\n       (5) the meat and poultry inspection system costs United \n     States taxpayers approximately $600,000,000 per year but does \n     not provide adequate protection against foodborne illness \n     because the system does not test for and limit the presence \n     of disease-causing bacteria;\n       (6) the Federal Government must--\n       (A) set levels of disease-causing bacteria above which meat \n     and meat food products and poultry and poultry products are \n     determined to be unsafe for human consumption and \n     adulterated; and\n       (B) remove the products from commerce unless and until the \n     products are made safe;\n       (7) beginning with the National Academy of Sciences report \n     entitled ``Meat and Poultry: The Scientific Basis for the \n     Nation's Program'', the United States Department of \n     Agriculture has been urged to shift from organoleptic \n     inspection to inspection based on the detection and \n     limitation of disease-causing bacteria;\n       (8) to sustain the confidence of the people of the United \n     States and justify the expenditure of tax dollars, the \n     inspection system must--\n       (A) be based on sound application of modern science;\n       (B) effectively protect human health;\n       (C) be open to public scrutiny;\n       (D) create incentives for high standards;\n       (E) provide for fines for failure to meet standards; and\n       (F) assess severe penalties for intentional violation of \n     the law;\n       (9) a modern system of meat and poultry inspection should \n     extend from farm to table and require livestock and poultry \n     producers, handlers, processors, distributors, transporters, \n     and retailers to assume responsibility for handling \n     livestock, meat, meat food products, poultry, and poultry \n     products in such a way as to limit contamination to a level \n     that will not endanger human health;\n       (10) to effectively protect human health, there must be an \n     orderly transition from the system of inspection in effect on \n     the date of enactment of this Act to a new system based on \n     preventive controls that are designed to limit the presence \n     of disease-causing bacteria on meat, meat food products, \n     poultry, and poultry products, and the efficacy of the new \n     system must be demonstrated by pilot projects;\n       (11)(A) consumer confidence is further undermined by the \n     ``USDA Inspected and Passed'' seal that appears on every \n     package of meat or a meat food product and the ``USDA \n     Inspected for Wholesomeness'' seal that appears on every \n     package of poultry and poultry products, a seal that misleads \n     consumers into believing the products are safe when the \n     products often are contaminated with disease-causing \n     bacteria; and\n       (B) the Federal Government should not affix a seal that \n     misleads consumers and may increase the incidence of \n     foodborne illness and death; and\n       (12)(A) all articles and other animals that are subject to \n     the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and \n     the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.) \n     are in interstate or foreign commerce or substantially affect \n     commerce; and\n       (B) regulation by the Secretary of Agriculture and \n     cooperation by the States, consistent with this Act and the \n     amendments made by this Act, are necessary to prevent or \n     eliminate burdens on commerce and to protect the health and \n     welfare of consumers of the United States.\n                        TITLE I--MEAT INSPECTION\n\n     SEC. 101.

Unless otherwise noted, ``the \n     Secretary'' refers to the Secretary of Agriculture.\n\n\n           reducing adulteration of meat and poultry products\n\n       Under this section, the Secretary would be required to \n     control and reduce the presence and growth of human pathogens \n     and other harmful substances in meat and poultry products. \n     Modern microbial testing for such contaminants would be \n     required within two years of enactment of the Act. Results of \n     the tests would be reported to the USDA.\n       Interim limits would be established by the Secretary for \n     human pathogens and other harmful substances until regulatory \n     limits, tolerances or other standards are set by the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary would \n     conduct or support appropriate research. Meat or poultry that \n     exceeds the limits would be prohibited from sale or \n     transportation. Regulatory limits set by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services would protect all consumers \n     including \n      [[Page S3622]] children, the elderly and the immune \n     compromised.\n       The Secretary, in conjunction with the Centers of Disease \n     Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, \n     would administer an active surveillance system for foodborne \n     illnesses and a sampling system to analyze the nature and \n     frequency of human pathogens and other harmful substances in \n     meat and poultry products. The Secretary shall review all \n     regulations every two years and consult with relevant federal \n     and state public health agencies as appropriate.\n\n\n                            hazard controls\n\n       The Secretary shall require slaughter and processing plants \n     to adopt processing controls adequate to protect public \n     health and to limit the presence and growth of human \n     pathogens and other harmful substances in meat and poultry. \n     The regulations will include standards for sanitation; \n     interim limits for biological, chemical and physical hazards; \n     process controls to assure the limits are met; record keeping \n     requirements; sampling requirements; and agency access to \n     records. Public access to records is assured through the \n     Freedom of Information Act. The Secretary may require other \n     processing controls as deemed necessary to assure the \n     protection of public health.\n       Once processing controls are required, an advisory board \n     shall be appointed, consisting of consumer and victim \n     representatives, processors, producers, retail outlets, \n     inspectors, plant workers, and public health officials, to \n     recommend other changes to the existing inspection programs, \n     including improvements in and alternatives to the current \n     programs.\n       The Secretary is directed to discontinue use of the \n     existing inspection seals if, at any time, the Secretary \n     discontinues the carcass-by-carcass inspection of meat. The \n     seal for meat and meat food products says ``Inspected and \n     passed.'' The seal for poultry and poultry products says \n     ``Inspected for wholesomeness by U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture.''\n\n\n             voluntary guidelines for retail establishments\n\n       The Secretary is directed to develop minimum standards for \n     the handling, processing and storage of meat and poultry \n     products by retail stores, restaurants, and similar \n     establishments to assure that food sold by such \n     establishments is safe for human consumption. Following \n     notice and comment, guidelines are established within 18 \n     months after enactment of the Act. So long as there is \n     substantial compliance by retailers, the guidelines remain \n     voluntary. If substantial compliance is not achieved, the \n     guidelines may become regulations. States may bring actions \n     against retailers to restrain violation of any final \n     regulations under the Act.\n\n\n                          livestock traceback\n\n       Traceback of animal and animal carcasses is allowed for the \n     purpose of understanding the nature of foodborne illness and \n     minimizing the risks of such illness. The Secretary shall \n     prescribe methods that permit animal identification \n     sufficient to accomplish traceback to the farm or other \n     places where livestock or poultry are held.\n       If animals are presented for slaughter that contain human \n     pathogens or other harmful substances sufficient to pose a \n     threat to health, the Secretary may take action to determine \n     the source of the human pathogen or other harmful substance. \n     The Secretary may prohibit or restrict the movement of \n     animals, carcasses, meat or meat food products containing the \n     human pathogen or other harmful substance.\n\n\n           notification and recall of nonconforming articles\n\n       Under this section, any person, firm or corporation \n     preparing meat or poultry products for distribution with a \n     reasonable basis for believing that the products are unsafe \n     for human consumption, adulterated or misbranded shall \n     immediately notify the Secretary of the identity and location \n     of such products.\n       If the Secretary finds the products are unsafe for human \n     consumption, adulterated or misbranded, the Secretary shall \n     order the recall of such products and all further \n     distribution shall be halted, unless the products are subject \n     to a voluntary recall that the Secretary deems adequate. The \n     person, firm or corporation subject to the order has the \n     opportunity for a hearing within 5 days after the date of the \n     order.\n       Any district court may order any person, firm or \n     corporation to recall any meat or poultry product if the \n     court finds that there is a reasonable probability that the \n     product is unsafe for human consumption, adulterated or \n     misbranded.\n                  refusal or withdrawal of inspection\n\n       The Secretary may refuse to provide or withdraw inspection \n     services if the Secretary determines, after providing the \n     opportunity for a hearing, that the recipient of the service \n     has repeatedly failed to comply with the requirements of the \n     Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection \n     Act or corresponding regulations.\n       Inspection can be withdrawn prior to a hearing if such \n     action is necessary in order to protect the health and \n     welfare of consumers or to assure the safe and effective \n     performance of official duties.\n       Judical review of these orders shall be in the United \n     States Court of Appeals.\n\n\n                            Civil penalties\n\n       Civil penalties may be assessed against persons, firms or \n     corporations that violate provisions of the Federal Meat \n     Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act or \n     relevant orders. Civil penalties are limited to $100,000 per \n     day of violation. The amount of the penalty shall be assessed \n     by written order following consideration of the gravity of \n     the violation, degree of culpability, and the history of \n     prior offenses.\n       Judicial review of these orders shall be in the United \n     States Court of Appeals. Penalties collected under this \n     section shall be paid into the United States Treasury.\n\n\n                   Corporate whistleblower protection\n\n       Employees are protected against harassment, discrimination, \n     prosecution and liability by employers because the employee \n     is assisting in achieving compliance with federal or state \n     laws, rules or regulations; refusing to violate federal or \n     state laws, rules or regulations; or otherwise attempting to \n     carry out the functions of or responsibilities of the USDA. \n     This section is governed by the Surface Transportation Act \n     and the Whistleblower Protection Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HEFLIN (for himself and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 516. A bill to transfer responsibility for the aquaculture \nresearch program under Public Law 85-342 from the Secretary of the \nInterior to the Secretary of Agriculture, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                national aquaculture research center act\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the National \nAquaculture Research Center Act of 1995.\n  The first major provision within my legislation transfers \nresponsibility for the aquaculture research program from the Secretary \nof the Interior to the Secretary of Agriculture. This transfer simply \nrecognizes the reality that the vast majority of aquaculture research \nand funding comes through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This is a \nlong-overdue streamlining measure that will greatly improve the overall \nefficiency and timeliness of aquaculture research.\n  The second provision stipulates that the Southeastern Fish Culture \nLaboratory in Marion, AL be named and designated as the ``Claude Harris \nNational Aquaculture Research Center.'' Many of my colleagues remember \nformer Congressman Claude Harris, who passed away last fall after a \nbattle with lung cancer. He spent 6 years in the House of \nRepresentatives from the Seventh District of Alabama, and was an \noutstanding Member of Congress. At the time of his death, he was \nserving as the U.S. attorney for the northern district of Alabama. He \nwas honest and amiable and never took his political accomplishments for \ngranted.\n  During his time in Congress, Claude Harris was a strong supporter of \naquaculture research, and was instrumental in promoting it through his \nhard work on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The fish culture \nlaboratory in Marion is located in Claude's former district.\n  This designation will serve as a proper and fitting tribute to the \nmemory of Congressman Claude Harris, whose drive, determination, and \nenergy did so much to advance the important science of aquaculture in \nthis country.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Cuban Liberty and \n     Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The economy of Cuba has experienced a decline of \n     approximately 60 percent in the last 5 years as a result of--\n       (A) the reduction in its subsidization by the former Soviet \n     Union;\n       (B) 36 years of Communist tyranny and economic \n     mismanagement by the Castro government;\n       (C) the precipitous decline in trade between Cuba and the \n     countries of the former Soviet bloc; and\n       (D) the policy of the Russian Government and the countries \n     of the former Soviet bloc to conduct economic relations with \n     Cuba predominantly on commercial terms.\n       (2) At the same time, the welfare and health of the Cuban \n     people have substantially deteriorated as a result of Cuba's \n     economic decline and the refusal of the Castro regime to \n     permit free and fair democratic elections in Cuba or to adopt \n     any economic or political reforms that would lead to \n     democracy, a market economy, or an economic recovery.\n       (3) The repression of the Cuban people, including a ban on \n     free and fair democratic elections and the continuing \n     violation of fundamental human rights, has isolated the Cuban \n     regime as the only nondemocratic government in the Western \n     Hemisphere.\n       (4) As long as no such economic or political reforms are \n     adopted by the Cuban government, the economic condition of \n     the country and the welfare of the Cuban people will not \n     improve in any significant way.\n       (5) Fidel Castro has defined democratic pluralism as \n     ``pluralistic garbage'' and has made clear that he has no \n     intention of permitting free and fair democratic elections in \n     Cuba or otherwise tolerating the democratization of Cuban \n     society.\n       (6) The Castro government, in an attempt to retain absolute \n     political power, continues to utilize, as it has from its \n     inception, torture in various forms (including psychiatric \n     abuse), execution, exile, confiscation, political \n     imprisonment, and other forms of terror and repression as \n     most recently demonstrated by the massacre of more than 70 \n     Cuban men, women, and children attempting to flee Cuba.\n       (7) The Castro government holds hostage in Cuba innocent \n     Cubans whose relatives have escaped the country.\n       (8) The Castro government has threatened international \n     peace and security by engaging in acts of armed subversion \n     and terrorism, such as the training and arming of groups \n     dedicated to international violence.\n       (9) The Government of Cuba engages in illegal international \n     narcotics trade and harbors fugitives from justice in the \n     United States.\n       (10) The totalitarian nature of the Castro regime has \n     deprived the Cuban people of any peaceful means to improve \n     their condition and has led thousands of Cuban citizens to \n     risk or lose their lives in dangerous attempts to escape from \n     Cuba to freedom.\n       (11) Attempts to escape from Cuba and courageous acts of \n     defiance of the Castro regime by Cuban pro-democracy and \n     human rights groups have ensured the international \n     community's continued awareness of, and concern for, the \n     plight of Cuba.\n       (12) The Cuban people deserve to be assisted in a decisive \n     manner in order to end the tyranny that has oppressed them \n     for 36 years.\n       (13) Radio Marti and Television Marti have both been \n     effective vehicles for providing the people of Cuba with news \n     and information and have helped to bolster the morale of the \n     Cubans living under tyranny.\n       (14) The consistent policy of the United States towards \n     Cuba since the beginning of the Castro regime, carried out by \n     both Democratic and Republican administrations, has sought to \n     keep faith with the people of Cuba, and has been effective in \n     isolating the totalitarian Castro regime.\n\n     SEC. __03. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to strengthen international sanctions against the \n     Castro government;\n       (2) to encourage the holding of free and fair democratic \n     elections in Cuba, conducted under the supervision of \n     internationally recognized observers;\n       (3) to provide a policy framework for United States support \n     to the Cuban people in response to the formation of a \n     transition government or a democratically elected government \n     in Cuba; and\n       (4) to protect the rights of United States persons who own \n     claims to confiscated property abroad.\n\n     SEC. __04.

Mr. President, there was of a variety of comment \nbefore the vote on the balanced budget amendment, one of the more \nsensible appearing in the Buffalo News, written by Douglas Turner.\n  I ask that the column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                 [From the Buffalo News, Feb. 27, 1995]\n\n Budget Amendment's Time Has Come; The Democrats Are Mortgaging Their \n                         Future by Opposing It\n\n                          (By Douglas Turner)\n\n       Washington.--Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan predicted on \n     Friday that the Senate will defeat a proposed amendment to \n     the Constitution calling for a balanced federal budget.\n       If he's right, and the learned New York Democrat quite \n     often is, that Senate action will squelch the bill that \n     easily passed the House last month.\n       The crucial Senate vote will probably come Wednesday or \n     Thursday.\n       Loss of the amendment will not be good for the country. \n     Fighting this idea whose time has come will also be a \n     calamitous loser for the Democrats. They won't get the Senate \n     back in 1996 or 1998 if they win on this week's roll call.\n       It guarantees returning the Republicans to control of the \n     House after next year's elections.\n       House GOP Campaign chairman Bill Paxon will say a bigger \n     Republican majority is needed to offer up this amendment \n     again.\n       If the amendment fails, the states will be denied their \n     opportunity to vote on the measure. This will insult our \n     embattled federal system. Belief in our national system is \n     already under heavy attack from junkyard dog conservatives.\n       Defeat will be the same as Washington Democrats saying to \n     the nation: ``We know you have a legal right to consider this \n     popular idea, but we don't trust you, not even your \n     sophisticated state legislatures, enough for you to consider \n     it.'' Dumb.\n       ``Popular'' doesn't describe the momentum behind the \n     balanced budget idea. Eighty percent of the nation wants this\n      amendment. Even in liberal New York State, support is \n     overwhelming.\n       Moynihan is one of the Democrats who does believe voters \n     are smart enough to understand. He has spent days, weeks, \n     honing and delivering his arguments against the amendment. \n     He's published a small booklet about it, and gave a lengthy \n     floor address last week. He talked about it on ``Meet the \n     Press'' again yesterday.\n       Central to their arguments, and Moynihan's, is their \n     concern for loss of flexibility. The amendment, they say, \n     will deprive Congress of the ability to infuse a sinking \n     economy with enough federal money to restore its vigor.\n       We'd be inviting a sustained economic Depression, they say. \n     Moynihan devised a chart that shows the big spikes in the \n     national economy before 1940. These show crippling variations \n     in gross national product, up and down by as much as 15 \n     percent in the span of a couple of years.\n       Post-1940 variations are mild, and generally positive, on \n     this chart. These came after the massive New Deal expansion \n     of the government bureaucracy and the practice of ``counter-\n     cyclical'' federal spending.\n       The chart is an icon to a generation of politicians and \n     professors steeped in the Keynesian tradition of demand \n     economics.\n       The chart looks good until you think about it. First, it \n     credits special surges in federal spending for the relative \n     stability of the post-war economy. But it ignores the role of \n     such income support programs as Social Security, and the \n     importance of the labor movement as post-war stabilizers.\n       It also ignores the fact that the most celebrated \n     ``counter-cyclical'' spending (not \n      [[Page S3637]] counting defense) was during the New Deal. It \n     did build many fine projects, and it helped hundreds of \n     thousands of individuals. It had little if any lasting effect \n     on the economy as a whole.\n       The last counter-cyclical experience occurred during the \n     recession of 1982-83. To help the unemployed and help \n     stimulate a flat economy Congress threw a few billion into \n     public works and expanded unemployment benefits.\n       There is nothing in this proposed amendment that would bar \n     Congress from taking such modest steps again. If a crisis \n     like the Depression occurred again, a three-fifths majority \n     in each house could bypass the amendment's spending \n     restrictions.\n       If there were a crisis, the people would respond just as \n     they did in the 1930s. They threw out a catatonic GOP and \n     installed Democrats, giving them a three-to-one margin.\n       The Democrats are on the wrong side of this one. Balancing \n     the budget is a liberal concept, in the classic sense of the \n     word, liberating.\n       Interest on the debt nearly equals all the government \n     spends on discretionary programs, such as disease control, \n     transit, research, aid to cities, education and foster care.\n       Interest payments are crowding out aid to the \n     underprivileged just as much as entitlements. Interest \n     payments go to people rich enough to buy government \n     securities in $10,000 and $100,000 lots--not exactly the guy \n     in your neighborhood Legion hall.\n       It is a loser for the Democrats on demographic lines. It is \n     the young voter--not the aging one--that is going to pay and \n     pay and pay to get this debt off his back.\n       For every sophisticated argument against it, there is an \n     even stronger common sense argument for balancing the \n     budget--sooner than later.\n       The people aren't dumb.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/07/senate-section/article/S3636-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 HOMICIDES BY GUNSHOT IN NEW YORK CITY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Mr. President, last Sunday, the New York Times \npublished a front-page story alleging that geologic disposal of spent \nnuclear fuel in Yucca Mountain could result in an ``atomic explosion of \nburied waste.'' The story is based on a hypothesis proposed several \nmonths ago by two scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Dr. \nCharles D. Bowman and Dr. Francisco Venneri. Drs. Bowman and Venneri, \nneither of whom is a geologist, performed some crude calculations on \nwhat might happen to plutonium in a geologic repository. They assumed \nthat 50 to 100 kilograms of pure plutonium-239 would slowly diffuse \nthrough nonabsorbing silicon dioxide--not any type of rock actually \nfound under Yucca Mountain--and then gradually reach criticality as \nvarious neutron-absorbing elements in the nuclear waste diffused away \nover the millennia.\n  We have been told by the New York Times and by both Senators from \nNevada yesterday that three teams of scientists at Los Alamos ``have \nbeen unable to rebut the assertion'' of Drs. Bowman and Venneri. This \nis simply not true.\n  The Los Alamos National Laboratory, in fact, did respond to these \nallegations. It formed three review teams. A ``Red Team'' was set up to \nserve in the role of skeptic. A ``Blue Team'' was set up to take the \nrole of defenders of the Bowman-Venneri hypothesis. A ``White Team'' \nwas set up to serve as a neutral judge of the work of the other two \nteams, and to render an overall judgment as to which was more credible.\n  What was the conclusion of the White Team? I ask that a two-page \n``Summary Critique of Bowman-Venneri Paper by Internal Review Groups at \nLos Alamos,'' which was publicly released yesterday by the Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory, as well as the complete text of the White Team \nreport, entitled ``Comments on `Nuclear Excursions' and `Criticality \nIssues''' be printed in the Record at the end of this statement.\n  The White Team report is a devastating critique of the hypothesis of \nDrs. Bowman and Venneri. It states that:\n\n       The geological situations in the Bowman paper are too \n     idealized to validate the proposed scenario.\n       The assumption of significant plutonium dispersion into the \n     surrounding medium is without justification.\n       The amount of water is overestimated by a factor of 1000. . \n     . . There is no steam explosion.\n       The assumptions about the behavior of the fissile mixture \n     near criticality are not credible.\n       There is no credible mechanism for releasing energy on a \n     time scale short enough for even a steam explosion.\n\n  Even when the White Team started assuming that the impossible would \nhappen, it still could not find the Bowman-Venneri hypothesis credible. \nFor example, the White Team concluded:\n\n       Even if dispersion and criticality are assumed (which is \n     strongly objected to), the conclusion that an explosion would \n     occur is incorrect.\n       Even if dispersion, criticality, and energy release are \n     assumed, there would be no serious consequences elsewhere in \n     the repository or on the surface.\n\n  The florid story in the New York Times and the comments made on the \nfloor yesterday by my distinguished colleagues from Nevada illustrate \nvividly how to misuse science in public policy debates.\n  Step No. 1. Ignore peer review. The New York Times clearly knew that \nan internal laboratory review of the Bowman-Venneri hypothesis had \ntaken place, but got the story of that review completely wrong. Is \nthere any way to characterize the above statements as being ``unable to \nlay [the Bowman-Venneri hypothesis] to rest,'' as the New York Times \nreported? I don't see how. And, of course, no external review by a \nscientific journal of this paper has taken place--it isn't even clear \nwhether Drs. Bowman and Venneri have submitted their calculations to \nany journal, other than the New York Times, for consideration.\n  Step No. 2. Do not even bother to get your facts straight. The true \nstory of the internal Los Alamos review of this paper was readily \navailable yesterday to any Member of this body who would have taken the \ntime to call anyone at the laboratory whose name was mentioned in the \nNew York Times story.\n  Step No. 3. Just jump on any news story that seems to support your \npreconceived view. Blow up the headline into a big chart, and head \ndirectly to the Senate floor.\n  Unfortunately, this is not the first time that we have seen bad \nscience injected into the debate over a permanent geologic repository \nfor spent nuclear fuel. In 1989, another DOE scientist named Jerry \nSzymanski interpreted some mineral deposits adjacent to the Yucca \nMountain site as evidence that ground water repeatedly had risen well \nabove the level proposed for the repository in the geologically recent \npast. If such an event were to occur in the lifetime of the repository, \nit would flood the waste packages and could result in a release of \nradioactive material to the environment. But before this hypothesis \ncould be properly reviewed by other scientists, Szymanski's report \nbecame a media sensation fueled by, among others, the New York Times. \nEventually, a distinguished group of scientists from the National \nAcademy of Sciences was asked to evaluate Szymanski's interpretations \nand the data upon which he had based those interpretations. This panel \nconcluded what the vast majority of DOE and U.S. Geological Survey \nscientists had concluded already: that the mineral deposits were \nproduced by rainwater at the surface and had nothing to do with \nfluctuations in the ground water table at all. That was in 1992. \nNotwithstanding the NAS conclusion, the State of Nevada continues to \npay large sums of money to Szymanski, now an independent consultant, to \ncontinue beating a dead horse.\n  So let me respond in detail to the specific charges made yesterday by \nmy distinguished colleagues from Nevada.\n  The distinguished junior Senator from Nevada charged that a \n``discussion has been going on for months and months and months'' \ninvolving ``three teams comprised of 10 scientists--that is 30 \nscientists [that] have been unable to rebut the assertion that there is \na genuine fear that an explosion can occur in a geologic repository.'' \nIn fact, the scientists at Los Alamos were able to rebut the assertion, \nand did.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Nevada complained that the \nBowman-Venneri hypothesis had not been \n [[Page S3638]] mentioned in public hearings or debates. Well, that's \nhow scientific review works. Scientific results ought to get careful \npeer review within the scientific community before they are served up \nin the Sunday New York times. If a scientific result can withstand \nneutral scrutiny--which is what Los Alamos was in the process of \ndoing--then it should be published in the open scientific literature \nand we can start the debate as to what its relevance to policy might \nbe. None of us is served by fragmentary and distorted accounts of \nscientific research in the public media.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Nevada characterized the \nBowman-Venneri calculations as ``evidence by a scientific community \nthat says an explosion could occur.'' Do my colleagues really believe \nthat a crude, theoretical calculation, predicated on all sorts of \ninaccurate assumptions for example, that the rock under Yucca Mountain \nis pure silicon dioxide, constitutes evidence? Evidence usually means \nsomething real. You can make up any theoretical calculations you like, \nand if you are not going to be constrained by reality, you can come up \nwith some pretty interesting answers. But you will not get any evidence \nthat way.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Nevada stated that ``it is not \nas if it has not happened before. In the former Soviet Union, they had \nan explosion from nuclear waste.'' He would have us believe that the \nSoviet explosion is somehow relevant to geologic disposal of spent \nnuclear fuel. Not so. The Soviet explosion occurred in a nuclear waste \ntank at Tomsk, not in a geological repository. The explosion was caused \nby red oil--a byproduct of reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. The whole \nidea behind the current DOE waste program, and geologic storage in a \nlocation such as Yucca Mountain, is not to reprocess.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Nevada says that his \ninformation is ``not sensationalism'' and that it ``comes from the \nscientific community.'' Well, publication in the New York Times hardly \nconstitutes peer review. It is sensationalism, pure and simple.\n  Finally the distinguished senior Senator from Nevada said that these \nresults came ``from one of the finest scientific labs in the world.'' \nNow that we can see what Los Alamos actually has to say about the \nBowman-Venneri hypothesis, will the Senators from Nevada accept what \nthe Los Alamos review team had to say?\n  In summary, it is not true that, as both Senators from Nevada tried \nto tell us yesterday: ``Thirty scientists * * * have tried to prove it \nwrong for 10 months. They cannot.'' As it turns out, they can shoot \nthis hypothesis full of holes, and they did.\n  Before we call a halt to all attempts to find a solution to our \nnuclear waste problems, or before we set up mini-repositories for spent \nnuclear fuel at every nuclear plant in the Nation, let's see the \nBowman-Venneri hypothesis for what it is--a preliminary calculation \nwith a highly questionable connection to the real world. If scientists \nat Los Alamos want to pursue such calculations, that is their right. \nBut we should not let ourselves be swayed by sensational reports based \non sketchy theories. Good policy can and should only be based on good, \npeer-reviewed science.\n  The material follows:\n\n       [The attached paper is a summary of the work of the three \n     review teams that have examined the paper on possible \n     criticality at the planned Yucca Mountain Repository. It was \n     compiled by the senior manager at Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory who supervises the author of the original paper.]\n  Summary Points of Bowman-Venneri Paper--``Underground Autocatalytic \n         Criticality of Plutonium and Other Fissile Material''\n\n               (By Charles Bowman and Francesco Venneri)\n\n       1. Underground storage as presently recommended could lead \n     to autocatalytic criticality and uncontrolled dispersal of \n     thermally fissile material with significant nuclear energy \n     release and possibly nuclear explosions in the 100-ton range.\n       2. Fissile material when emplaced underground is \n     subcritical. However, once containment is breached, the \n     fissile material is free to disperse in the underground \n     matrix either through natural (diffusion, earthquakes, water \n     flow) or unnatural means (human intervention).\n       3. The underground matrix contains good moderators such as \n     water and rock (silicon dioxide) in various proportions. \n     Under certain conditions of fissile material density, radius, \n     water and rock composition, the fissile material can reach \n     criticality due to neutrons moderated in the rock/water \n     mixture. The criticality can have either positive or negative \n     feedback. Negative feedback would mean that the nuclear \n     reactions would decrease as the mixture heated up and \n     expanded and hence go subcritical. Positive feedback means \n     that the nuclear fission is self-enhancing (autocatalytic). \n     Hence the nuclear reactions continue to grow to \n     supercriticality and possibly explosive conditions.\n       4. Neutron poisons, such as boron, that are added to the \n     spent fuel when emplaced underground to prevent criticality \n     have different solubilities than fissile materials and thus \n     would be leached out from the fissile material area.\n       5. Without water, 50-100 kg of fissile material is required \n     to reach autocriticality. As small an amount as 1 kg of \n     fissile material can reach autocriticality with water \n     present.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Summary Critique of Bowman-Venneri Paper by Internal Review Groups at \n                               Los Alamos\n\n\n                          geologic emplacement\n\n       1. The geological situation in the Bowman paper are too \n     idealized to validate the proposed scenario. Pure silicon \n     dioxide, a weak neutron absorber, is not a common geological \n     material and has not been proposed as a repository material. \n     Other elements present in all proposed geological formations \n     absorb neutrons much more strongly than pure silicon dioxide, \n     which reduces the reactivity of the mixture.\n       2. For periods less than 10,000 years, the presence of \n     Plutonium 240 (half-life of 6,500 years) would also reduce \n     reactivity strongly.\n\n\n                    material dispersion underground\n\n       1. The assumption of significant dispersion of plutonium \n     into the surrounding geologic medium is without \n     justification. Geologic processes take millions of years by \n     which time the plutonium-239 (half-life of 24,000 years) \n     would have decayed to 235 U which is less reactive.\n       2. The Bowman paper argues that water flowing down through \n     the repository would dissolve glass logs in about 1,000 years \n     and leave a fragile powder of plutonium that could disperse \n     through steam ``explosions'' caused by criticality heating of \n     the water in the vicinity of the Pu log. However, the amount \n     of water is overestimated by a factor of 1,000 so that the \n     correct time scale is on the order of a million years. Also \n     the temperature gradient is over estimated by a factor of ten \n     so that there is no steam ``explosion.'' Also the leaching \n     process could leave a residue as strong as the original log.\n       3. Material is not likely to be dispersed into symmetric \n     shapes by rather along fractures which would provide more \n     difficult geometries for criticality.\n\n\n                              criticality\n\n       1. The assumptions about the behavior of the fissile \n     mixture near criticality are not credible.\n       2. As the fissile/rock/water mixture approached \n     criticality, it would slowly heat and expand which would drop \n     its reactivity below critical and mixture would cool. Thus \n     the mixture would have a negative temperature coefficient.\n\n\n                       explosions/energy release\n\n       1. Even if dispersion and criticality are assumed (which is \n     strongly objected to), the conclusion that an explosion would \n     occur is incorrect.\n       2. There is no credible mechanism for releasing energy on a \n     time scale short enough for even a steam explosion. A nuclear \n     explosion must make the transition from critical to highly \n     supercritical in a fraction of a second. A credible means to \n     force this transition in a repository has not been found.\n       3. Even if dispersion, criticality and energy release are \n     assumed, there would be no serious consequences elsewhere in \n     the repository or on the surface.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       [The attached paper is the preliminary work of a team of \n     scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The team was \n     asked to review the papers that have been generated dealing \n     with the issue of possible criticality at the planned Yucca \n     Mountain Repository. Further analysis may be conducted, and \n     possible further modifications of the estimates contained in \n     this paper may occur, in the normal process of scientific \n     investigation. The paper of the review team as it stands now \n     does contain considerable work by the team.]\n     Comments on ``Nuclear Excursions'' and ``Criticality Issues''\n\n       The Laboratory provided a technical review of a paper by \n     Drs. Bowman and Venneri on the ``Nuclear Excursions and \n     Eruptions from Plutonium and Other Fissile Material Stored \n     Underground,'' which argued that the dispersal of plutonium \n     (Pu) stored underground could increase its reactivity to the \n     point where critically, auto-catalytic reaction, and \n     explosive energy release could occur.\n       The review concluded that the probability of each of these \n     steps is vanishingly small and that the probability of the \n     occurrence of all three is essentially zero. Moreover, even \n     if these steps could occur, any energy release would be too \n     small and slow to produce any significant consequences either \n     in the repository or on the surface.\n       [[Page S3639]] The authors of ``Nuclear Excursions'' \n     provided responses to the issues raised in that review in the \n     form of a paper entitled ``Criticality Issues for Thermally \n     Fissile Material in Geologic Storage.'' The white team and \n     the leaders of the blue and red teams reviewed the responses \n     in ``Criticality Issues,'' met to discuss them, determined \n     that they are flawed for essentially the same reasons as the \n     original paper, and concluded that they do not significantly \n     impact the conclusion of the review that the probability of \n     the chain of events postulated in ``Nuclear Excursions'' and \n     ``Criticality Issues is essentially zero and that even if \n     they could occur, any energy release would be too small and \n     slow to produce significant consequences.\n\n\n                              Emplacement\n\n       The geological situations discussed in ``Nuclear \n     Excursions'' were too idealized to provide a useful framework \n     for analysis or to validate the proposed scenario. That was \n     pointed out in the review, but those situations were still \n     used in ``Criticality Issues.'' ``Nuclear Excursions'' \n     postulates the emplacement of fissile materials in geologic \n     formations of pure silicon dioxide. Pure silicon dioxide is a \n     weak neutron absorber, is not a common geologic material, and \n     has not been proposed as a repository material. Other \n     elements present in all geologic formations that have been \n     proposed absorb neutrons much more strongly than pure silicon \n     dioxide, which reduces the reactivity of the mixture.\n       Furthermore, ``Nuclear Excursions'' performs most of its \n     yield calculation for pure Pu-239; so does ``Criticality \n     Issues.'' The weapons plutonium of interest has a significant \n     fraction of Pu-240, which is a strong absorber that further \n     reduces reactivity. Even for the maximum loading postulated \n     in ``Nuclear Excursions,'' weapons plutonium could never \n     disperse to a condition of criticality in real, dry \n     repository materials. It is argued that the Pu-240 would \n     decay, leaving the more reactive Pu-239, but that would \n     happen over several times the 6,500 year half life of Pu-240. \n     Even then the Pu-240 would be replaced by its daughter U-236, \n     which is also a strong absorber. Moreover, as noted above, \n     the calculations in both papers ignore minor soil \n     constituents with very large absorption cross sections. When \n     they are properly included, it may not be possible to achieve \n     criticality for the assumed conditions even without the Pu-\n     240.\n       The assumption of significant dispersion of plutonium into \n     the surrounding geologic medium in ``Nuclear Excursions'' is \n     without justification. Geological processes would take \n     millions of years, by which time plutonium would have decayed \n     to uranium-235, which is less reactive than Pu-239. We have \n     not discovered a credible process that would produce more \n     rapid dispersal. Anthropogenic measures are unlikely and are \n     routinely accounted for in repository analyses. ``Criticality \n     Issues'' argues that water flowing down through the \n     repository would dissolve the glass log in 1,000 years and \n     leave a fragile powder, but its calculation overestimates the \n     amount of rainfall on and water in the repository by factors \n     of 1,000, so the correct time scale for dispersal is again \n     about a million years.\n       It has also been noted that the temperature gradient \n     driving the process is overestimated by an order of magnitude \n     and that the leaching process could leave a residue as strong \n     as the original log.\n\n\n                              Criticality\n\n       The assumptions about the behavior of the fissile mixture \n     near criticality are not credible. ``Nuclear Excursions'' \n     assumed that the rock in which the fissile material is placed \n     is rigid and would prevent the expansion of the material and \n     permit the achievement of super criticality. That was based \n     on an improper interpretation of the published equation of \n     state. In reality, rock is compressible, and even at depths \n     of several kilometers, lithostatic stresses are small and \n     anisotropic, so that confining stresses are small. Even if it \n     fractured the rock, it would not do so in a spherically \n     symmetric manner. Even if the mixed material became critical, \n     it would slowly heat and\n      expand, which would drop its reactivity below critical, \n     after which its neutron flux would drop, and the mixture \n     would cool. That is, the mixture has the negative \n     temperature coefficient of many fissile assemblies. This \n     was pointed out in detail in the review.\n       Nevertheless, ``Criticality Issues'' again argued that \n     fissile material could diffuse through criticality, although \n     it shifted its argument to soils with very high amounts of \n     water, which have higher reactivity. However, the essential \n     physics is the same as for dry rock. The mixed material would \n     slowly heat and expand, which would drop its reactivity, \n     which would cause it to cool. Hydrated mixtures also \n     generally have negative temperature coefficients. Moreover, \n     the first time the mixture underwent this cycle, it would \n     drive off the water, after which it would be left far below \n     critical, dry, and with no mechanism for the reinsertion of \n     water. Thus, there is nothing new in ``Criticality Issues,'' \n     it simply repeats the stability errors made in ``Nuclear \n     Excursions.''\n       There are some interesting tradeoffs between the negative \n     temperature coefficient of such mixtures from expansion and \n     the potentially small positive coefficient from absorption \n     and Pu-239 resonance broadening, but those effects are \n     delicate and comparable even at high hydration. \n     Unfortunately, they cannot be evaluated from the calculations \n     in ``Criticality Issues,'' which were apparently all \n     performed for cold soil, pure SiO2, and pure Pu-239. All \n     three of those restrictions would have to be removed to \n     provide an assessment beyond that in ``The Myth of Nuclear \n     Explosions at Waste Disposal Sites.'' Given the simplicity \n     and ease of monitoring for the development of the conditions \n     postulated, that is readily addressed.\n\n\n                             energy release\n\n       Even if dispersion and criticality are assumed, the \n     conclusion that an explosion would occur is incorrect. \n     ``Nuclear Excursions'' postulates ``auto-catalytic'' behavior \n     in which the release of energy leads to greater criticality, \n     but the discussion above shows that in dry repository \n     material, the release of energy instead reduces criticality \n     and shuts the reaction off. ``Criticality Issues'' postulates \n     autocatalytic behavior in hydrated mixtures, but the \n     discussion of the previous section shows that to the extent \n     that the phenomena has been quantified by earlier work, the \n     release of energy reduces criticality there, too.\n       The postulated mechanisms for explosion are not credible; \n     the most that appears possible is heating and evaporation of \n     some water before a smooth shut down. There is no credible \n     mechanism for releasing energy on a time scale short enough \n     for even a steam explosion. A nuclear explosion must make the \n     transition from critical to highly supercritical in a \n     fraction of a second. A credible means to force the \n     transition in a repository has not been found. Thus, the \n     assertion that an explosion would occur is incorrect.\n       Even if dispersion, criticality, and energy release are \n     assumed, which appear virtually impossible on the basis of \n     the arguments above, there would be no serious consequences \n     elsewhere in the repository or on the surface. Calculations \n     indicate containment volumes very small compared to the \n     nominal spacing between storage elements; thus, there could \n     not be any coupling between storage elements or any \n     possibility of greater energy releases through synergisms.\n\n\n                        relation with other work\n\n       That the critical mass may be reduced by dilution by \n     moderating material discussed in the paper is well understood \n     by the nuclear community. Fermi used it to full advantage \n     when he assembled the first pile under the grandstand at \n     Stagg Stadium.\n       Fermi also used the advantages of heterogeneity in \n     minimizing resonance losses in natural uranium, although that \n     is irrelevant to the discussions of Pu reactivity here.\n       The National Academy of Science report does not suggest \n     emplacement of weapons plutonium in the manner discussed by \n     ``Nuclear Excursions,'' although it did comment on the \n     advantages of higher fissile loading. The Academy was alert \n     to the potential for criticality and qualified its \n     recommendations by stating that further analysis and \n     discussion were needed before deciding on the best and safest \n     geologic disposition of weapons and reactor spent fuel.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       We should always be alert to unintended consequences and \n     open to discussions that illuminate potential dangers in \n     nuclear waste storage. ``Nuclear Excursions'' argued that \n     there were serious dangers in proposed repository concepts. \n     We disagreed with the paper's major assumptions and found its \n     major conclusions to be incorrect for fundamental, technical \n     reasons, which were stated in detail and in writing. \n     ``Criticality Issues'' did not respond to those reasons, but \n     introduced a new scenario, in which it made the same \n     technical errors in a new context. We have pointed those \n     errors out above. At this point we find no technical merit in \n     either paper. However, the papers treat technical matters and \n     apparently contain no classified material; thus, in accord \n     with the laboratory's policy of open and unrestricted \n     research and discussion on unclassified matters, the authors \n     should be free to submit their paper for publication in a \n     peer reviewed journal.\n       That said, we do not find any value in these two papers \n     that would justify publication in their current form, and we \n     do not see how to produce such a paper from them. They \n     contain fundamental errors in concept and execution. They \n     show no grasp of such elementary concepts as the time scale \n     for the approach to criticality and energy release and the \n     crucial role of the negative temperature coefficient of the \n     mixtures treated. Worse, they show no appreciation of these \n     points even after they were pointed out forcefully in the \n     review. That is compounded by the constantly shifting \n     scenarios in the papers and the alarmist estimates of \n     potential effects, which have become less credible and more \n     shrill throughout this process.\n       The authors apparently show little interest in technical \n     suggestions or inclination to respond to it. Thus, it would \n     not appear to be useful to continue this one-sided \n     discussion, which we take to be concluded. If this program is \n     continued, and these individuals remain associated with it, \n     the laboratory would be well served by establishing a \n     permanent red team, funded by this program and composed of \n     independent members from the cognizant technical divisions, \n     and giving them the responsibility of checking each \n     calculation done by them.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.
