I am not going to take too long because I know many of \nmy colleagues want to speak on the issues affecting welfare and \nMedicaid. But I do want to express my disappointment with the \nDemocratic leadership and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwho have effectively killed a major and important park and conservation \nmeasure. As a matter of fact, the parks bill that we debated for some 7 \nhours the day before yesterday now can no longer be discussed, there is \nno additional time for debate because the measure now has, out of \nnecessity, been set aside.\n  Let us look realistically at what this action is costing the general \npublic relative to its parks and specific areas of importance, \nincluding the Presidio, which was in this parks package. The package \nincluded the ability to provide\n\n[[Page S2908]]\n\n2 million acres of wilderness to the people of the United States in the \nState of Utah, and to provide an important watershed to both New York \nand New Jersey known as Sterling Forest.\n  We had this measure before us. It had been put together as a \nconsequence of a great deal of effort and a great deal of compromise. \nSome 23 States were affected, with some 53 individual titles or lands \naffected in those States. It was a package that had been negotiated \nwith the House as well, and it was apparent to all that in order for \nthe package to pass we had to keep all its aspects, including those \nthat were of a controversial nature. One of those, of course, was Utah \nwilderness. The issue was all or nothing with some of the opponents. \nThey felt that 2 million acres added to the wilderness designation in \nUtah was inadequate; it should be 5 or 6 million acres. The citizens of \nUtah--the legislature, the Governor, the entire Utah delegation--felt \nthat 2 million acres was adequate. In any event, this body would have \nmade that determination on a clear and unrestricted vote had not some \nMembers saw fit yesterday to attach the minimum wage amendment to this \npackage--the minimum wage is an important issue, but it simply does not \nbelong on this parks package--and as a consequence the parks package \nhas been set aside.\n  It will come up another day, but I wish to express my disappointment, \nand I thank my colleagues who have worked so hard to try to bring the \npackage together.\n  I am disappointed also in the media because they failed to recognize \nthe importance of this package. But I wish to at least have the Record \nreflect why we had that package before us.\n  The Senator from California and the Senator from New Jersey, both \nhave indicated that somehow it was the fault of the majority that the \npackage was before the Senate and that it was unfair, some suggested \nawful, that they were forced to vote on Utah wilderness and other \nmeasures if they wanted to see their measures enacted. In other words, \nthey wanted Utah wilderness out of it. Yet they knew that the House \nwould simply not accept the package unless Utah wilderness was in it.\n  Let the Record reflect that it was the objections on the other side \nof the aisle that have held each and every one of these measures up for \nsome year or thereabouts. This was the right of the individual Senator, \nbut I think it is disingenuous for him and other Senators on the \nDemocratic side to suggest we were holding these measures. We simply \nrecognized the reality and pleaded with the various Senators on holding \ntogether because there was something in this for everyone; every State \nwas affected in some manner or form, and we would either all gain \nsomething meaningful or we would simply lose the effort.\n  I do not think any of us at that time anticipated that the effort \nwould be lost by attaching a minimum wage amendment to the parks \npackage. I repeatedly tried to get time to break the threatened \nfilibuster but there was no support on the other side of the aisle. \nUtah wilderness is a recent addition to the Senate Calendar, as is the \nPresidio. All the other measures have been effectively held up by the \nDemocratic leadership because obviously they did not want to take on \nthe holds from one Senator.\n  The situation was simple. If the Senator from New Jersey had not \nprevailed in both the House and Senate, then he was going to prevent \nany public land bills from being enacted. There were a few exceptions \nto that for which the Senator from Alaska is thankful, but it did not \nmatter how important or critical to the National Park System they may \nbe; in his opinion his measure was more important. That was his right. \nI respect him for his determination. But I want the Record also to \nreflect that I have tried my best to accommodate the interests of the \nSenator from New Jersey on Sterling Forest, but I am certainly not a \nmagician. There are Members of the House who not only do not like the \nmeasure of the Senator from New Jersey, but they also have measures \nthat they want. I hoped we could all get together to do something \nuseful, or we could continue the stalemate. That appears to be where we \nare today.\n\n  So, there are two sides to every issue. I think we have all tried to \nwork within our respective areas to accommodate the various Senators \nand to recognize this for what it was, and that was a giant compromise. \nWhile working with my friend from New Jersey and the Senators from \nCalifornia on their measures, as well as colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, I appreciate the fact that the other side has decided, \nevidently, for the political opportunism associated with the \nrealization that we have the AFL-CIO come out and publicly endorse the \nClinton administration and indicated its willingness to raise some $35 \nmillion to defeat Members on this side of the aisle who are running. \nEvidently, that was the momentum to put the minimum wage on the parks \nbill.\n  I also appreciate the fact that the people of Utah are the real \nvictims in this, in a sense, because it is their State that is in \njeopardy with regard to the amount of wilderness. I commend those \nSenators here for speaking on behalf of their State in the interests of \nthe majority of the residents of that State.\n  We can either reestablish some sense of comity, or history is going \nto reflect this very important package of measures for the park system \nwas killed, and the environment is the sufferer. Unfortunately, I do \nnot think the media are going to pick up on the accuracy of this, but \nsomeday history will.\n  I guess my unhappiness grew even greater when the two Senators from \nMassachusetts saw fit to basically drive a stake into the heart of this \nmeasure. I, again, went out of my way to include measures dealing with \nthe Boston National Historical Park, Blackstone River Valley, which \nwere items of great interest to the Senators from Massachusetts. I told \nthe House there was no deal on this unless they were prepared to deal \nwith those measures--not the measures just of the Senator from New \nJersey, but the measures proposed by the Senators from Massachusetts.\n  Apparently, they care more about the politicized potential of \ncampaign contributions from organized labor than they do about the \nmeasures from their own State or other measures included in this \npackage for the benefit of others. It is a political stunt, and it is \nan expensive political stunt, at the expense of the environment.\n  So we are into it, and the consequences of that lead us to a vote \nthat is going to take place in about 45 minutes on cloture. I, \nnaturally, urge my colleagues to support cloture, but I am realistic \nenough to recognize this vote is going to be seen as a politically \nsymbolic vote. It is going to have a reference to the minimum wage, \nwhich it certainly should not. This is a vote that should be on the \nmerits associated with the parks package.\n  What is the answer? Sterling Forest is going to lose, Presidio is \ngoing to lose, Utah wilderness is going to lose, and 47 other special \npark bills will not move. This is the problem with hostage taking: \nEither they all get freed or they all will die. I think it is time to \nget off the plastic pedestal and get down to the business of the \nPresidio and other measures. I will vote for Sterling Forest, I will \nvote for Presidio, I will vote for Utah wilderness, I will vote for the \nother measures in the package because of its overall good for the \nenvironment, good for the National Park System, and the good for the \nNation. I think it is time my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwake up and join me on what is good for the U.S. Senate, and that is to \npass this package of compromise legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee for the statement he just made and for \nthe effort he has brought to the Senate floor to get this important \nlegislation through. I join him in regretting it has not been possible. \nI, too, hope in the future it will be possible.\n\n\n       the walnut canyon national monument boundary modification\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the omnibus lands \nbill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 1296. This \nbipartisan legislative package includes the Presidio bill and more than \n50 other park and public lands bills, most of which have already been \nreported by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The vast \nmajority of these bills are\n\n[[Page S2909]]\n\nnot controversial and deserve to be passed as part of this package.\n  I realize a few of the provisions in this legislation are \ncontroversial. Most notable is the title addressing Utah wilderness. \nThe groups involved have worked for many years to strike a compromise. \nI support the Utah delegation in its effort to bring some finality to \nthis situation. I believe Senators Hatch and Bennett have made \nsignificant concessions, particularly in increasing acreage, and \nmodifying the controversial hard release language. The people of Utah \nhave wrestled with wilderness for over 20 years at a cost of $10 \nmillion. This issue needs to come to closure.\n  I also want to speak about an issue closer to home: Walnut Canyon. On \nNovember 9, 1995, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a \nhearing on this legislation and on December 6, the committee voted \nunanimously in favor of reporting the legislation to the full Senate. \nThroughout the legislative process, this issue has had the full support \nof the House, the Senate, and the affected communities in Arizona.\n  This legislation, introduced by Senator McCain and me, is based on a \nconsensus reached last year among interested parties, including the \ncity of Flagstaff, the Coconino County Board of Supervisors, the Grand \nCanyon Trust, the National Parks and Conservation Association, the Hopi \nTribe, the Navajo Nation, the National Park Service, the Forest \nService, and numerous private individuals. I read this list only \nbecause I am proud that such diverse parties in Arizona could come \ntogether to support this important endeavor.\n\n  S. 231 is similar to the original legislation drafted last session by \nRepresentatives Karan English and Bob Stump, who deserve a great deal \nof the credit for bringing the parties together. This session, \nRepresentative J.D. Hayworth introduced a House companion bill, H.R. \n562, which was approved by the House by an overwhelming vote of 371 to \n49. I hope that we are able to match that here in the Senate.\n  Walnut Canyon National Monument is an Arizona treasure that we must \nprotect. This legislation will expand the boundaries by exchanging Park \nService land for Forest Service land, adding approximately 1,200 acres \nto the monument. Currently, the monument encompasses numerous Sinaguan \ncliff dwellings and associated sites. Walnut Canyon includes five areas \nwhere archaeological sites are concentrated around natural promontories \nextending into the canyon, areas that early archaeologists referred to \nas forts. Three of the five forts are within the current boundaries of \nthe monument, but the two others are located on adjacent lands \nadministered by the Forest Service. By exchanging Park Service land for \nthis Forest Service land, the two outside forts will be within the \nmonument and receive the protection that those resources need and \ndeserve. It is a simple and commonsense way to make the monument whole.\n  Mr. President, again, I urge my colleagues to put partisan \ndifferences aside and pass the omnibus parks bill.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I support the omnibus lands bill before \nthe Senate today. I speak as one of the few Senators without a single \nitem in this large package. Let me focus for a moment on the most \ncontroversial component of the package--title XX, the Utah Public Lands \nManagement Act.\n  As a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I have \nfollowed the divisive political debate that has raged for decades over \nthe question of how much land in the State of Utah should be designated \nas wilderness. This debate has now spilled outside the boundaries of \nthe Utah delegation and the State they represent. It is now a national \ndebate in many ways outside their complete control. As a Senator who \nhas seen this same thing happen in his own State, I can appreciate the \ndifficulties of my colleagues from Utah.\n  I have also followed the Bureau of Land Management [BLM] over the \nlast 15 years as it has spent in excess of $10 million analyzing vast \ntracks of land in Utah to more precisely determine their suitability \nfor wilderness designation. In 1991, Interior Secretary Lujan \nidentified 1.9 million acres as suitable for wilderness designation. \nThe bill before us, which recommends 2 million acres for designation, \nreflects the technical information gathered by BLM as well as input \nfrom over 75 formal public meetings and thousands of letters.\n  Over the past two decades, our thinking about natural resource \nmanagement has evolved, resulting in a more flexible and cooperative \nrole for government at all levels--Federal, State, local, and tribal. \nAs one who has looked for ways for the Federal Government to provide \nmore flexibility in regulated activities, I am pleased that this \nevolution is taking place.\n  Mr. President, during the consideration of this bill in the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, I raised a number of concerns about \nvarious aspects of this legislation. I compliment my colleagues from \nUtah for their willingness to work with me to address my concerns. The \nlegislation now allows for more balance and predictability, two \ncomponents that are vital in public land management and decisionmaking. \nTheir revisions include the following:\n  The release language, previously characterized as too hard, has been \nsoftened. The bill now clarifies BLM's role in administering the 1.2 \nmillion acres under study that were not designated as wilderness;\n  Another 200,000 acres have been added, making the total wilderness \ndesignation slightly greater than BLM's 1991 final recommendation;\n  The land exchanges allowed for in the legislation are now equal value \nexchanges; and,\n  Provisions allowing the construction of dams, pipelines, or \ncommunication sites within the wilderness area have been deleted.\n  There are those who are still not satisfied. They would like more \nacreage to be designated and tighter restrictions to be put on any \nexisting uses of those lands proposed for inclusion. Some would even \nlike to totally eliminate all existing uses.\n  These goals are self-defeating. They run counter to the 1964 \nWilderness Act, which called for designating lands untrammeled by man, \nfor the purposes of retaining its primeval character. The goal was not \nto find lands that have been encroached upon and require they revert to \ntheir primeval character.\n  The seemingly endless Utah wilderness debate demonstrates what can \nhappen when either side takes an all or nothing approach. We must all \nrecognize that wilderness is not the only protective designation \navailable to us. There are other, more appropriate ways to protect our \npublic lands while recognizing and allowing for prior uses. My \ncolleagues from Utah have been fair and objective in their designations \nand in their release language.\n  This proposal relies upon BLM's planning process for the \nnondesignated public lands. This provides the flexibility and \ncooperative spirit necessary for sound management. It is important to \nnote that their approach does not prevent a future Congress from \nreconsidering these lands' wilderness potential. Nothing is set in \nstone. Nothing would prevent a future Congress from passing legislation \nto add land to or withdraw land from this plan.\n  Those who depict this wilderness designation process as though we are \nfaced with an irrevocable choice between wilderness or the bulldozer do \nus all a disservice.\n  Even for those lands never designated as wilderness, all is not lost \nfor preservationists. There are a host of BLM land classifications \ndesigned to protect the natural and cultural attributes of our public \nlands without eliminating existing uses. Releasing the 1.2 million \nacres not selected for wilderness designation provides BLM's land \nmanagers, working together with local communities, greater management \nflexibility while insuring continued resource protection. These other \nprotective designations include the following:\n  Areas of critical environmental concern;\n  Outstanding natural areas;\n  National landmarks;\n  Research natural areas;\n  Primitive areas; and\n  Visual resource management class I areas.\n  Mr. President, I have seen a fair number of wilderness bills become \nlaw during my three decades on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. Since 1964, Congress has enacted 88 laws designating new \nwilderness areas or adding acreage to existing ones. We now have a \nsystem that includes 630 wilderness areas encompassing 104 million \nacres in 44 States.\n\n[[Page S2910]]\n\n  I support passage of the Utah wilderness bill. This legislation \nbrings to a close a 15-year-long battle and addresses more than its \nshare of difficult issues. It does so fairly and objectively. Failure \nto pass this bill would put us into a third decade of debate and would \nseriously undermine the wilderness study process.\n  While I continue to view this legislation as pushing the edge of what \nis acceptable under the 1964 Wilderness Act, I take particular note of \nthe longstanding and divisive debate this provision would allow us to \nmove forward from. I look forward to following this debate in the \ncoming days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the omnibus \nnational parks bill. There are so many problems with the Utah lands \nprovisions that I hardly know where to begin in urging other Senators \nto vote against this package.\n  The Utah lands provision is simply unacceptable. It does not protect \nenough land, the American public opposes it, it includes hard release \nlanguage, it sets bad precedents for wilderness designation, it opens \nunique and beautiful lands to powerlines, dams, pipelines, mining, and \nother uses, it compromises the heritage of our children, and it \nachieves all this only by ransoming every other national park project \nin the Senate.\n  The proponents of Utah lands language cannot buy public approval at \nany price. I wrote to Majority Leader Dole last week to make this point \nperfectly clear. Senators, including this Senator who wants very much \nto see some of the associated measures pass, will not stoop to pass a \nso-called wilderness bill that leverages politics against the priceless \nbeauty of remote Utah canyon lands.\n  I am frustrated by the high-stakes games being forced upon the \nSenate. One week we have our backs to the wall to finish a late farm \nbill so that farmers can begin planting. Another week we have our backs \nto the wall to finish a late appropriations bill so that the Federal \nGovernment can stay open. Last summer we were forced to adopt a salvage \nrider in order to get peace in the Middle East, relief to Oklahoma City \nbombing victims, and help for flood-damaged communities. In another \noccasion we have our backs to the wall to simply get veterans' benefits \ninto the mail. Recently, the Senate has not been the deliberative body \nthat Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton, and others envisioned for the \ngreatest Nation in the world. The Senate should consider legislation on \nits merits. If a bill fails Senate approval, it fails. If it fails a \nveto override, it fails. Our Constitution sets the rules, and they have \nserved us well for 200 years.\n  It is time to bring the political parties back together for \nreasonable debates on reasonable environmental policy. Conservation is \nas Republican as Richard Nixon and as Democrat as Jimmy Carter. \nEnvironmental protection is supported by Americans of all political \nstripes. I have worked with former Senator Bob Stafford in Vermont to \nrestore the tradition of bipartisanship on environmental issues. Just \nrecently I received a letter from the organization Republicans for \nEnvironmental Protection asking Senator Dole to strip the Utah \nprovisions from the bill. It is wrong for any party to charge down a \npath of exploitation and environmental abuse, and I urge the Senate to \ncorrect its course.\n  My children, and many of the children of my colleagues, will live \nmost of their lives in the next century. We are in a position to decide \nwhat the next century will look like. Yes, we got here first. Just as \nthe first explorers made resource decisions centuries ago, we now face \nsimilar decisions about the fate of our natural resources. Just as the \nnative Americans and first European settlers decided to protect public \nlands as commons, we have an obligation to those who will follow. This \nbill gives the Senate a clear opportunity to decide whether we protect \nour heritage, or say ``me first'' to the treasures of southern Utah.\n  The political pressure to support the Utah giveaway is enormous for \nsome of my colleagues. Nonetheless, the responsibility to do the right \nthing is far more valuable and far more important. I urge the Senate to \nreject the Utah lands provision.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those \nrequesting that S. 884, title XX of the pending substitute amendment, \nbe removed from the Presidio bill and be considered as freestanding \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, on Monday the Senate began consideration of H.R. 1296, \nlegislation developed with the assistance of the California delegation \ncreating a Presidio trust to manage property at the Presidio in San \nFrancisco. The Presidio, a former Army post overlooking San Francisco \nBay, was recognized by the Congress in 1972 as a national treasure and \nwas slated for inclusion in the National Park System upon its cessation \nfrom military use.\n  The substitute amendment before us, the omnibus parks and recreation \nbill, contains--in addition to the Presidio bill--approximately 32 \npublic lands titles, many of which have been reported out of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee with bipartisan support. However, one \ntitle of this amendment, title XX, the Utah Public Land Management Act, \ndoes not enjoy the same bipartisan support, and is preventing the \nSenate from completing action on the underlying Presidio legislation in \na timely manner.\n  The Utah Public Land Management Act contains a number of provisions \nwhich would have a profound impact on all existing and future \nwilderness designations, seriously undermining standards of public \nlands management established by the Wilderness Act of 1964. The \nWilderness Act of 1964 defined a wilderness as land where, ``in \ncontrast to those areas where man and his own works dominate the \nlandscape, is hereby recognized as an area where the earth and the \ncommunity of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a \nvisitor who does not remain.''\n  Under this definition of wilderness, commercial activities, motorized \naccess, and the construction of roads, structures, and facilities are \nprohibited in designated wilderness areas. I have serious concerns \nabout provisions of the Utah land bill which would clearly undermine \nthis definition of wilderness. This legislation would allow \nunprecedented uses incompatible with wilderness including motorized \nvehicle access within protected areas, construction of communication \ntowers, and continued grazing rights.\n  In addition, I am concerned that the Utah lands bill designates only \nabout 2 million of the Federal Government's 32 million acres in Utah as \nwilderness. Currently, the Federal Government manages 3.2 million acres \nof its holdings as wilderness study areas, allowing the Federal agency \ncharged with managing the land the opportunity to conduct a thorough \nstudy to determine its suitability for inclusion in the Wilderness \nPreservation System. The legislation before us would direct those \nFederal agencies to make all land not selected for wilderness available \nfor multiple uses, such as mining, grazing, and development. Hard \nrelease language included in the bill would preclude those agencies \nfrom managing this land in a way which would protect its wilderness \ncharacteristics for the future.\n  Mr. President, the wild and beautiful Utah public lands which are \nunder discussion today are a national treasure belonging to all \nAmericans. In my view, it is critical that we, as a nation, do not \nallow the destruction of our precious natural resources. Wilderness \nareas constitute only 2 percent of all land in the United States. We \nmust not fail in our obligation to protect the beauty and integrity of \nthese lands for future generations.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the substitute \namendment to H.R. 1296, the Presidio bill.\n  Mr. President, as we all know by now, this is not a noncontroversial \npublic lands bill. There are many provisions in the bill that truly are \nnoncontroversial, and that have been considered and voted on in \ncommittee with little if any opposition.\n  And I would note that the bill includes the Sterling Forest \nPreservation Act, which Senator Bradley and I strongly support.\n  Unfortunately, the real goal of the pending substitute amendment is \nto slip through the highly controversial Utah wilderness provisions, \nbased on Senate bill 884. Those provisions would permanently release \nmillions of acres from wilderness study, and, in turn,\n\n[[Page S2911]]\n\nallow uses on these lands that will destroy lands with significant \necological and scientific value.\n  Mr. President, I oppose including S. 884 in this omnibus lands bill, \nand will support an effort to remove that title in its entirety. We \nneed to act on many of the provisions in the underlying legislation, \nwhich are truly noncontroversial. But we ought to have a separate, \nopen, and honest debate on those provisions that are controversial.\n  Mr. President, I have heard from more people--both in New Jersey and \nfrom out West--about the Utah wilderness bill than perhaps any other \npublic lands issue. By an overwhelming margin, people have urged me to \nsupport Utah wilderness, and to oppose S. 884 as written.\n  Who are these people who visit my office, write me letters, stop me \nin the halls? They are people from New Jersey who understand what it \nmeans to live in the most densely populated State in the Nation. People \nwho understand what it means to live in a State still reeling from the \nlegacy of pollution from the industry, and who value open space, \nbeautiful natural resources, and clean fresh air.\n  These New Jerseyans know that once land is destroyed by extensive \ndevelopment, it may never return as it was. At best, it takes a very \nlong time to recover.\n  I've heard it said on the floor of this Senate that the only people \nwho oppose S. 884 are the Eastern elites. Well, Mr. President, these \nso-called elites from New Jersey are really ordinary people who care \nabout their environment and their Nation's natural resources. They care \nbecause they know what it's like to be without.\n  But, Mr. President, not everybody opposed to S. 884 is from New \nJersey. Take the mayor of Springdale, UT. He visited me a year ago to \nexplain how his community benefits more from preserving the wilderness \nthan from activities that would alter or destroy it. As the mayor \nexplained, recreation and its associated businesses provide for a \nsustainable and growing economy. By contrast, he said, resource \nextraction does not.\n  I've also heard from a fourth generation Utah native, the past \npresident of the Salt Lake City Rotary Club, a Mormon, and father of \nfour children who urged me to get involved in this issue.\n  He told me that recreational and other commercial enterprises depend \non the wilderness. And that these businesses are critical to the \neconomic vitality of the State of Utah and to Utahn's quality of life. \nHe also told me that preservation is crucial to his peace of mind.\n  Mr. President, it is true that these lands are all in Utah. But they \nare also national lands that contribute to the entire country. They \nhave great ecological significance, and they provide scientific and \neducational treasures, as well as a growing recreation business. That \nis why I care.\n  I also care very much about title XVI of the bill, the Sterling \nForest Preservation Act. Let me talk a little about Sterling Forest and \nwhy its preservation is so important.\n  This bill designates the Sterling Forest Reserve and authorizes up to \n$17.5 million to acquire land in the Sterling Forest area of the New \nYork/New Jersey Highlands region.\n  This would preserve the largest pristine private land area in the \nmost densely populated metropolitan region in the United States. It \nalso would protect the source of drinking water for 2 million New \nJerseyans.\n  Mr. President, the Highlands region is a 1.1 million acre area of \nmountain ridges and valleys. The region stretches from the Hudson to \nthe Delaware Rivers and consists primarily of forests and farmlands. \nThe Forest Service, in a 1992 study, called the Highlands, ``a \nlandscape of national significance, rich in natural resources and \nrecreational opportunities.''\n  Unfortunately, the Highlands region faces an increasing threat of \nunprecedented urbanization. Perhaps the most immediately threatened \narea is Sterling Forest.\n  Located within a 2-hour drive for more than 20 million people, the \n17,500-acre tract of land on the New York side is owned by a private \ncompany that has mapped out an ambitious plan for development.\n  The community that this corporation plans to develop will have a \nnegative impact on drinking water for one-quarter of New Jersey \nresidents. It also threatens the local ecosystem and wildlife, the \nnationally designated Appalachian Trail, and the quality of life of \nresidents of the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area.\n  I will not describe this proposed project in detail.\n  But suffice it to say that one cannot build more than 14,000 housing \nunits and 8 million square feet of commercial and light industrial \nspace, and release 5 million gallons of treated wastewater into a pure \nenvironment, without a significant impact.\n  My concern about the project's effect on New Jerseyans' drinking \nwater is not new. We have known for some time that this development \nwill destroy valuable wetlands, which filter and purify the water \nsupply, and watersheds, which drain into reservoirs--reservoirs which \nsupply one quarter of New Jersey's residents with drinking water.\n  The proposal calls for three new sewage treatment plants to \naccommodate the development. These plants will discharge 5.5 million \ngallons of treated wastewater each day into the watersheds.\n  Compounding matters will be nonpoint source pollution generated by \nrunoff from roads, parking lots, golf courses, and lawns. This runoff \ncarries pollutants such as fertilizers, salt, and petroleum products, \namong others. Together these pollutants pose a serious threat to \ndrinking water, which is why there is so much concern in New Jersey.\n  I am not alone in my opposition to the proposed development. \nResidents from the nearby communities also oppose it. Based on \ntestimony delivered during local public hearings, the development plan \nwill impose $21 million in additional tax burdens on surrounding \ncommunities. On the other hand, under the management scenario proposed \nby this bill, a park would generate revenue.\n  The only viable management option for this important ecosystem is \npreservation. And that is what is proposed in this legislation.\n  The bill would provide critical protection for the forest. But it \ndoes not impose the heavy hand of the Federal Government on the local \ncommunity or on the owner of the property. The funds authorized in this \nbill represent a fraction of the total funding needed to purchase the \nforest. The rest would come from other public entities, such as the \nStates of New Jersey and New York, and private parties.\n  I also would note that the legislation specifically requires a \nwilling buyer-willing seller transaction--if the company determines \nthat it is not in its best interest to sell, it doesn't have to.\n  Furthermore, the Federal Government would be relieved of the \nsignificant costs associated with forest management, law enforcement, \nfire protection, and maintenance of the roads and parking areas under \nan agreement with a respected bi-State authority.\n  These provisions have the support of the local communities, the two \nStates, and regional interests. They are cost effective and reasonable. \nAnd they are environmentally responsible.\n  Senator Bradley and I have worked on this bill for years now, and we \nare pleased to note that last June, the bill passed as part of H.R. \n400, now pending in the House. We have heard many expressions of \nsupport from the Speaker of the House for preserving Sterling Forest, \nand we anxiously await passage of H.R. 400.\n  Unfortunately, including Sterling Forest in this bill only serves to, \nin the words of the Sterling Forest Coalition, ``hold Sterling Forest \nhostage to S. 884.'' The people of New Jersey do not support this \nomnibus lands bill as written, and I share their view.\n  Let me quote from a letter I received yesterday from the Highlands \nCoalition, a leading organization with membership in Connecticut, New \nYork, and New Jersey:\n\n       The Title XX of this bill, the Utah Public Lands Management \n     Act . . . is anathema to environmental principles and must \n     not be connected to Sterling Forest funding . . . The amount \n     of acreage it would set aside as Wilderness in southern Utah \n     is meager compared to what the majority of citizens in Utah \n     and surrounding States would like to see. The preservation of \n     Sterling Forest must not be at the cost of environmental \n     degradation elsewhere in the United States. The Omnibus Parks \n     bill must be amended to delete in its entirety the S.\n\n[[Page S2912]]\n\n     884 Utah Public Lands Management provisions. If this bill is \n     not so amended, we ask you to vote against the entire Omnibus \n     Parks package.\n\n  Mr. President, letters like this help show how our Nation's \nwilderness areas meet national interests. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the letter from the Highlands Coalition be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The Highlands Coalition,\n\n                                   Morristown, NJ, March 21, 1996.\n     Re National Parks omnibus package.\n\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: The Highlands Coalition, with \n     membership organizations representing more than 300,000 \n     people in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, has been \n     working for over 5 years for the preservation of the Sterling \n     Forest in New York as public lands. New York, New Jersey and \n     a private foundation have committed between $20 and $30 \n     million for this purpose, but we need the federal funding \n     component. Over the past three years various bills have been \n     introduced in both the House and the Senate that would \n     provide federal funding, but none of these has yet been \n     signed into law. Now, another bill containing provisions for \n     Sterling Forest funding, the Omnibus National Parks bill, has \n     been introduced in the Senate.\n       The Title XX of this bill, the Utah Public Lands Management \n     Act introduced by the Utah Senators as S. 884, is anathema to \n     environmental principles and must not be connected to \n     Sterling Forest funding. The amount of acreage it would set \n     aside as Wilderness in southern Utah is meager compared to \n     what the majority of citizens in Utah and surrounding states \n     would like to see. Further, key provisions would allow \n     development in designated federal Wilderness areas in Utah, \n     thus threatening the integrity of the entire National \n     Wilderness Preservation system.\n       The preservation of Sterling Forest must not be at the cost \n     of environmental degradation elsewhere in the United States. \n     The Omnibus Parks bill must be amended to delete in its \n     entirety the S. 884 Utah Public Lands Management provisions. \n     If this bill is not so amended, we ask you to vote against \n     the entire Omnibus Parks package.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Wilma E. Frey,\n                                                      Coordinator.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an editorial from a newspaper in New Jersey, the Bergen Record, \nwho editorialized, ``Sterling Forest is too important to this region's \nwell-being to become a hostage of partisan politicking.''\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Promises, Promises--Utah Land Grab Would Hurt Sterling Forest\n\n       Is this crazy or what? At a time when many congressional \n     Republicans are trying to project a more moderate approach on \n     environmental issues, some of their brethren are pressing for \n     an omnibus public-lands bill that is an anathema to \n     conservationists--and a stumbling block to saving Sterling \n     Forest.\n       It's time for the GOP leadership, House Speaker Newt \n     Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole to get on the \n     same page and push for legislation that saves important \n     resources without sacrificing others.\n       The omnibus environmental bill, which is expected to come \n     to a Senate vote as early as later this week, includes $17.5 \n     million toward the purchase of Sterling Forest. But it also \n     includes a provision that would open 20 million acres of \n     wilderness in southern Utah to forestry, mining, and other \n     commercial interests. That's unacceptable.\n       Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has said, rightly, that he \n     would recommend that President Clinton veto any bill that \n     includes the Utah land giveaway. That would sink years upon \n     years of effort to obtain federal funding to save Sterling \n     Forest--a 17,500-acre watershed that provides the drinking \n     water for 2 million New Jerseyans.\n       At a time when the owners of the land are moving ahead with \n     their plans to build 13,000 housing units and 8 million acres \n     of commercial development on the mountainous tract, such a \n     setback at the federal level would be disastrous.\n       Just last month, Mr. Gingrich stood in a clearing near \n     Sterling Forest and pledged that Congress would soon pass a \n     bill to save the land without sacrificing any environmentally \n     sensitive land in the process. The only sure way to do that \n     is for Mr. Gingrich to push forward with an existing Sterling \n     Forest bill, HR-400.\n       This bill has already passed the Senate. And Mr. Clinton \n     has indicated he would sign it. Now it's a question of Mr. \n     Gingrich keeping his word. Sterling Forest is too important \n     to this region's well-being to become a hostage of partisan \n     politicking.\n       As for the other public-lands legislation, the Republicans \n     would be wise to jettison the Utah land grab and to press \n     forward with an omnibus bill that has the nation's best \n     interests at heart.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I also care about title XXVI, which \nrecognizes the historic significance and natural beauty of the Great \nFalls area of Paterson, NJ. Paterson is my home town. The history of \nthe region was part of my childhood.\n  In 1778, Alexander Hamilton came to the area and decided that the \nGreat Falls could serve as a power source for the Nation's first \nindustrialized community. Working with Pierre L'Enfant and then \nGovernor William Paterson, Hamilton began to develop the resources as a \nmeans to free the Nation from England through business and \nmanufacturing.\n  Over the years, Paterson became known as the Silk City, and as the \ncenter of the textile industry.\n  During the past decades, however, the Great Falls historic preserve \nhas borne the brunt of industrial flight and the treasures at the Great \nFalls are threatened. This bill would allow for the partnership of the \nNational Park Service to assist in restoring the treasures and history \nof the area. The Senate passed this bill last Congress. The bill \ndeserves to be passed on its own, rather than as part of an omnibus \npark land bill that will be vetoed.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will understand \nwhat is happening here. Most of the bills included in this package are \nnoncontroversial. But some are not.\n  We should move forward and strike those bills that will attract a \nveto from the President and allow the rest of the bills to be \nconsidered and passed on their own merit.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my concerns with the \ncurrent language of the Utah wilderness bill. First of all, I am \nopposed to this controversial bill being attached to a large group of \nlargely noncontroversial bills that are very important.\n  I do support passage of a Utah wilderness bill. However, I cannot \nsupport this bill. This bill largely precludes future designations of \nBLM wilderness in Utah; substantially alters the definition of \nwilderness; and may result in an unfair land exchange value between the \nUnited States and the State of Utah.\n  I am opposed to the hard release language the bill contains. If this \nbill were to become law, it would be the first of over 100 wilderness \nlaws to contain hard release language. I agree that lands not included \nin this bill should generally be released to standard multiple use \nprovisions, but I do not agree that BLM should be precluded from ever \nconsidering future wilderness designations on any of the other 20 \nmillion acres of public land in Utah. I believe the soft release \nlanguage that the Bush administration supported is the appropriate \nroute.\n  Even if these issues were resolved, I still have grave concerns \nstemming from the unique management and land exchange provisions. If \nthis Utah wilderness bill were to become law, the Nation would \neffectively have two wilderness systems, Utah and the rest of the \nNation. It would in effect result in a brand of wilderness that would \nbe so different, that current BLM regulations, which are appropriate \nfor all other BLM wilderness areas, would have to be substantially \naltered just to accommodate the unique provisions of this bill.\n  Most startling is the fact that it appears that the Secretary of the \nInterior would in Utah have less authority to control access in and \naround wilderness areas than nonwilderness areas. I repeat, it appears \nthe Secretary would have less authority to control access in and around \nwilderness areas than nonwilderness areas. How can this be wilderness \nif it is less protected than other multiple-use lands?\n  One small example of nonconformity is the bill's special provisions \nfor facilities within wilderness areas. Section 2003(d) provides:\n\n       Nothing in this title shall affect the capacity, operation, \n     maintenance, repair, modification or replacement of \n     municipal, agricultural, livestock, or water facilities in \n     existence of the date of the enactment of this Act\n\n  There is no qualification to this paragraph. Conceivably, projects \ncould be expanded without any regard to impacts to wilderness values. \nThis is only one small example of the special provisions included in \nthe language of this bill.\n  In the past, wilderness laws have generally deferred to the access \nprovisions\n\n[[Page S2913]]\n\nof the Wilderness Act of 1964. This practice provides a measure of \nconsistency throughout the wilderness system. The proponents of this \nUtah wilderness bill have strayed so far from the vision of the \noriginal framers of the Wilderness Act that an althernative type of \nwilderness would, in effect, be established. I do not support this \nestablishment of an alternative version of wilderness.\n  Even if this bill did not contain these nonconforming provisions, I \nwould still have concerns with the land exchange provisions that would \nprovide a unique means to establish the value of Federal lands to be \nexchanged to the State of Utah. These provisions would give a \nsignificant advantage to the State of Utah that no other State has \nenjoyed in its wilderness bills.\n  I support passage of a Utah wilderness bill. However, I believe the \nbill must not preclude future designations of wilderness; substantially \nalter the definition of wilderness; nor result in unfair exchange \nvalues between the United States and the State of Utah.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concerns \nabout the inclusion of S. 884, the Utah Public Lands Management Act, \ninto the omnibus parks package now before the Senate.\n  I believe that it is critically important to make my colleagues aware \nthat this omnibus package is not simply a means to clear small measures \non the docket of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Among its \nprovisions is a measure which decides the fate of 22 million Federally \nowned acres of land in southern Utah. It designates a portion of the \nacres as wilderness and leaves vast areas free for development. This is \none of the few times this session that the Senate will have the \nopportunity to engage in a dialog over what should happen to these and \nother Federal lands.\n  The Utah provisions contained in the measure currently before the \nSenate are controversial provisions. Both Utah and national newspapers \nhave been a hotbed of debate over the question of how much wilderness \nto protect and the process used to develop the bill. I also know that \nmany citizens in my State are deeply concerned about aspects of this \nbill which would fundamentally changes the way the Federal Government \nwill manage lands which all Americans own. Wisconsinites who care \ndeeply about the Federal lands in Utah as well as Federal land policy \nin general have written to me and urge significant changes in this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. President, a major concern about the measure currently before the \nSenate relates to the hard release language in the Utah provision which \naffects the future ability of the BLM to designate additional acres in \nUtah which may need protection in as wilderness. BLM is currently \nmanaging 3.2 million of the 22 million acres it holds in Utah as \nwilderness. The provisions of the substitute amendment relating to Utah \nwould designate approximately 2 million acres as wilderness. They \nfurther require that any lands not explicitly designated by the bill as \nwilderness will be managed for multiple-use. Therefore, even if BLM \nfinds in the future that these lands are sensitive and in need of \nprotection, no additional lands could be designated as wilderness. The \nSenate has never passed a bill containing such language before, and \nsuch language is a significant departure from the tenets of the 1964 \nWilderness Act.\n  The key protection wilderness designation offers the lands in \nsouthern Utah is protection from certain kinds of development--but not \nfrom the use of the lands. Activities allowed in wilderness areas are: \nfoot and horse travel; hunting and fishing; backcountry camping; float \nboating and canoeing; guiding and outfitting; scientific study; \neducational programs; livestock grazing if it has already been \nestablished; control of wildfires and insect and disease outbreaks; and \nmining on preexisting mining claims.\n  Prohibited activities, according to the 1964 Wilderness Act include: \nuse of mechanized transport except in emergencies, or such vehicles as \nwheelchairs; roadbuilding, logging, and similar commercial uses; \nstaking new mining claims or mineral leases; and new reservoirs or \npowerlines, except where authorized by the President as being in the \nnational interest.\n  The magnificence of the wildlands that are at stake in this debate \ncannot really be done justice in words, Mr. President. As my colleague \nfrom New Jersey, Mr. Bradley, has already shown the Senate, they \ninclude starkly beautiful mountain ranges rising from the desert floor \nin western Utah with ancient bristlecone pine and flowered meadows. \nSome areas are arid and austere, with massive cliff faces and leathery \nslopes speckled with pinyon pine and juniper trees. Other areas support \nhabitat for deer, elk, cougars, bobcats, bighorn sheep, coyotes, birds, \nreptiles, and other wildlife. These regions hold great appeal to \nhikers, hunters, sightseers, and those who find solace in the desert's \ncolossal silence.\n  These BLM lands are truly remarkable American resources of soaring \ncliff walls, forested plateaus, and deep narrow gorges. This region \nencompasses the sculpted canyon country of the Colorado Plateau, the \nMojave Desert, and portions of the Great Basin.\n  Some in this body may think it strange that a Senator from Wisconsin \nwould speak on behalf of wilderness in Utah. The issue of and debate \nover Utah wilderness protection, Mr. President, has been one of which I \nhave been aware since the time I joined the U.S. Senate. Many of my \nconstituents believe that the lands of southern Utah are the last major \nunprotected vestige of spectacular landforms in the lower 48 States--of \nthe caliber of lands so many nationwide already hold dear, such as \nYellowstone, the Grand Canyon, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \nI have received more constituent mail--over 600 pieces in all--from \nWisconsin citizens concerned about wilderness lands in Utah, than I \nhave on any other environmental issue in this Congress--including many \ncritically important issues to my state such as clean water, safe \ndrinking water, the protection of endangered species, and Superfund \nreform. A man from Menominee Falls, WI, writes about the lands of Utah:\n\n       These resources are national treasures that make our \n     country great, and once they are gone they are lost forever.\n\n  A woman from Beloit added in her letter:\n\n       I live in Wisconsin but my real home is the natural world . \n     . . most voters do not concur with the irrevocable \n     destruction that would result from (this measure) becoming \n     law. Please: do all you can to be a voice for wilderness--not \n     only in Wisconsin but in the fragile and gorgeous West.\n\n  One of the most poignant testimonials came from an Eau Claire \nresident:\n\n       I have not had a lot of experience writing letters to my \n     elected representatives. However, it appears that the current \n     priorities in Washington are shifting away from conservation \n     towards a destructive, greed oriented approach, under the \n     guise of economic growth and development of public lands. \n     Given this climate, I feel I must write to express my \n     opinion. I have had the opportunity to visit much of the West \n     over the past 30 odd years on annual family vacations. This \n     is truly a unique land without rival anywhere else in the \n     world. My family and I have learned to love and respect this \n     region and we feel that it must be protected in its natural \n     form. I strongly urge you to oppose any compromise Utah lands \n     bill that does not include a strong vision of conservation \n     for future generations.\n\n  Mr. President, I read from some letters from Wisconsin residents \nbecause I think it is critical to understand that the importance of \nprotecting these lands in Utah extends beyond the borders of that \nState. Many Americans enjoy and treasure this area, just as they do \nother great American wilderness areas and it is the responsibility of \nall members of the Senate to be concerned about the fate of this \nnational treasure.\n  I have been personally touched by these appeals from residents of my \nState. In recognition of the importance of this issue to my \nconstituents, on October 11, 1995 I circulated a small paperback book \ncontaining essays and poems by 20 western naturalist writers reflecting \ntheir thoughts on the protection of wilderness in Utah to all members \nof the Senate. The book, entitled ``Testimony,'' was released on \nSeptember 27, 1995. It is modeled after the late author Wallace \nStegner's 1960 Wilderness Letter to the Kennedy administration, which \nwas a critical benchmark document in the development and eventual \npassage of the 1964 Wilderness Act. In his 1960 Wilderness Letter, \nWallace Stegner said ``something will have\n\n[[Page S2914]]\n\ngone out of us as a people if we let the remaining wilderness be \ndestroyed.'' Mr. President, those words are echoed and reverberated by \nthese western writers as they describe the legislation now before the \nSenate and its affect on Utah.\n  The paperback was compiled during August 1995. The selections \nrepresent the opinions of the authors, written in direct response to \nthe measure currently before Senate which would affect public lands \nmanagement in Utah. The book includes writings by individuals such as: \nTerry Tempest Williams, Utah native and author of five books; T.H. \nWatkins, editor of Wilderness magazine; N. Scott Momaday, winner of the \n1969 Pulitzer Prize for ``House Made of Dawn''; and Mark Strand, former \nPoet Laureate of the United States. 1,000 copies of the book were \nprinted for distribution on the Hill, and I now understand that the \nwriters intend to release this work through Milkweed Press in Minnesota \nfor the general public. The writers donated their work to produce this \nsmall booklet and the printing costs were covered by a donation from a \nnonprofit foundation.\n  I distributed this book because I felt that it was important for all \nmembers of the Senate to have a copy of this book to review in making a \ndecision that so profoundly affects future of such a spectacular area.\n  One of the pieces in the Testimony book that most caught my \nattention, Mr. President, was a selection by Stephen Trimbell. Steve \nTrimbell is a writer and photographer who lives in Salt Lake City, and \nwho was instrumental in working with Terry Tempest Williams to \nfacilitate putting the Testimony book together. Those Senators who have \nbeen following the debate over the Utah Wilderness Act are already very \nfamiliar with Mr. Trimbell's handiwork. For several months, every \nFriday, photographs of the areas excluded from wilderness designation \nunder the measure before us were dropped off in every Senator's office. \nMany of those ``Friday pictures,'' as they have come to be known around \nmy office, were taken by Trimbell. I wanted to share Steve Trimbell's \nwords on this matter with the Senate. He writes:\n\n       My place of refuge is a wilderness canyon in southern Utah.\n       Its scale is exactly right. Smooth curves of sandstone \n     embrace and cradle me. From the road, I cross a mile of \n     slickrock to reach the stream. This creek runs year-round, \n     banked by orchids and ferns. Entering the tangle of greenery, \n     I rediscover paradise. The canyon is a secret, a power spot, \n     a place of pilgrimage.\n       I found this canyon in my youth, twenty years ago. I came \n     here again and again. I brought special friends and lovers. \n     When my wife and I met, and I discovered that she knew this \n     place, I felt certain that she knew a place deep within me, \n     as well. My children are within a year of walking into the \n     canyon on their own. I thrill to think of that first visit \n     with them.\n       On those early trips, I rarely saw other people. Once, in \n     the velvet light before dawn, I awoke, sat boldly upright. \n     and looked past my sleeping bag into a lone ponderosa pine--a \n     tree that brought the spicy scent of mountain forest to this \n     desert canyon. A few seconds later, a great horned owl \n     noiselessly landed on a branch and looked back at me with \n     fierce eyes. The owl flew down canyon, searching for \n     unwary mice. I lay back, fell asleep, and awoke again when \n     the sun warmed me.\n       I bathed in plunge pools and waded along the stream, \n     learning to pay attention, looking for reflections and leaf \n     patterns and rock forms to photograph--details that I would \n     not see if the canyon had not taught me how to look. Never \n     before had I spent so much time alone on the land, Here, I \n     matured, as a naturalist and photographer and human being.\n       This wilderness canyon made me whole. It can still restore \n     me to wholeness when the stress of life pulls me thin. It \n     bestows peace of mind that lasts for months.\n       People smile when they remember such particular places on \n     Earth where the seasons and textures and colors belong to \n     them. Where they know, with assurance and precision, the \n     place and their relationship to it.\n       ``This is my garden.''\n       ``This is our family beach.''\n       ``I know this grove like the back of my hand.''\n       ``I can tell you where every fish in this stream hides.''\n       ``I remember this view; it takes me back to my childhood.''\n       These landscapes nourish and teach and heal. They help keep \n     us sane, they give us strength, they connect us to our roots \n     in the earth, they remind us that we share in the flow of \n     life and death. We encounter animals in their native place \n     and they look into our eyes with the amalgam of indifference \n     and companionship that separates and unites us with other \n     creatures. A garden can connect us with wildness. Wilderness \n     connects us with our ancestral freedoms even more powerfully.\n       Recently, we visited a canyon new to us in the southern \n     Utah wilderness, this time with urban cousins--two girls, \n     seven and eleven. The younger girl spotted a whipsnake, a \n     nesting Cooper's hawk, beetles, Indian paintbrush. We painted \n     ourselves with golden cattail pollen and launched boats we \n     wove from rushes and milkweed leaves. Taught never to walk \n     alone in their city, here the girls forged ahead out-of-\n     sight, exploring, appropriating power, gathering the \n     dependable certainties of the wilderness, building emotional \n     bedrock, new layers of confidence and self-esteem. Perhaps \n     this canyon will become their canyon.\n       We need to preserve every chance to have such experiences, \n     for ourselves, our children, and the grandchildren of our \n     grandchildren.\n       For we have reached the end of the gold rush. This wild \n     country is our home, not simply one more stop on the way to \n     the next boomtown. Respect for our home, thinking as natives, \n     begins in our backyards, with our children. We move outward \n     from there to local parks, to preservation of greenbelts, and \n     from there to big wilderness.\n       The wilderness canyons of Utah belong not to an elite cadre \n     of backpackers, not to the cattle raising families of \n     Escalante and Kanab, not to the Utah state legislature, not \n     to the Bureau of Land Management. They belong to all citizens \n     of the United States. In truth, they belong to no one. They \n     are a magnificent expression of the powers of Earth, and we \n     Americans hold Utah wilderness in trust for all humans and \n     all life on our planet.\n       The truly conservative action becomes clear: to preserve as \n     many wildlands as possible for future generations rather than \n     to fritter them away in casual development without even \n     noticing. A Utah wilderness bill with too little land \n     preserved and too many exceptions for development is \n     unacceptable, destroying irreplaceable wild places for the \n     short-term wealth of the few.\n       Every year our wildlands shrink. We must act now, \n     decisively, boldly. To save my canyon. Their canyon. Your \n     canyon.\n       We must preserve the wholeness of wild places that belong \n     to everyone and to no one. In doing so, we demonstrate our \n     trustworthiness--our capacity to take a stand on behalf of \n     the land. On behalf of the canyons.\n       Our canyons.\n\n  That short piece of writing is so powerful, Mr. President, because it \nis a timeless statement about how people feel about natural places. For \nmyself, I personally know the value of wild areas. For the last 9 \nyears, I have spent my summer vacations on Madeline Island, immediately \nadjacent to the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore in northern \nWisconsin. I have always found the quiet beauty of the Apostle Islands \nrefreshing and invigorating. The Apostle Islands are not a place the \npeople in Wisconsin go for high-tech hubbub; it is a place where people \ngo to experience nature's beauty.\n  I want to recount a story, one perhaps several of members of the \nSenate may remember, from 1967, when the Senate Subcommittee on Parks \nand Recreation held hearings on Senator Gaylord Nelson's plan to create \nthe Apostle Islands National Lakeshore.\n  A man named John Chapple, a newspaperman from Ashland, WI, testified \nat those hearings. Mr. Chapple, who spent much of his life around the \nApostle Islands, related the story of a time when he and his 10-year-\nold son were out in a 14-foot motorboat on the waters around the \nApostle Islands:\n\n       On one occasion, the water was very rough, and I pulled our \n     little boat onto a sand beach so I could put some more gas in \n     the motor.\n       Three men came walking out. 'Don't you know this is a \n     private beach?' they said. 'You are not supposed to land \n     here.'\n       That stung, and it still stings.\n       Twenty-five men with fortunes could tie the Apostle Islands \n     up in a knot and post `keep out' signs all over the place.\n       The beauty that God created for mankind would not be \n     available to mankind anymore.\n       These islands, with their primeval power to truly recreate, \n     to reinvigorate, to inspire mankind with a love of peace and \n     beauty . . . must be preserved for all the people for all the \n     time and not allowed to fall into the hands of a few.\n\n  When the Senate acted to protect this area of northern Wisconsin, \nthey heard the voices of Wisconsinites like Mr. Chapple who knew the \nvalue of peace and beauty and of preserving our natural heritage. \nThough those words were spoken by man nearly 20 years ago, about an \nentirely different landscape, they almost sound like an addendum to \nSteve Tribell's story about southern Utah canyons, which is included in \na new testimony.\n  In places like the Apostle Islands and southern Utah, Wisconsinites \nhave found opportunities to develop a consciously sympathetic \nrelationship to the rest of the world, so that we may\n\n[[Page S2915]]\n\nbetter live in it. These natural places are a confluence for the things \nwe value in Wisconsin.\n  The parallels between the Apostle Islands in my State and southern \nUtah, interestingly go even further than the emotions that these \nlandscapes evoke among the people of my State. Along the Apostle Island \nNational Lakeshore's shoreline there are the wonderful rust colored \nsandstone cliffs. These sandscapes serve as staging areas for birds \nfollowing their ancient paths of migration in the spring and fall. Of \nsimilar appearance and construct to the landscapes of southern Utah, \nthese cliffs are particularly impressive this time of year now that \nthey are covered with ice. The February 28, 1996, edition of the \nMinneapolis Star-Tribune ran a wonderful article about these red cliffs \ncovered in ice that states:\n\n       Frozen waterfalls hide a labyrinth of nooks and crannies \n     that kids climb through and slide down like some frozen \n     playland. ``Awesome'' is the word muttered by many visitors \n     to the sea caves sculpted by centuries of wind and water at \n     Apostle Island National Lakeshore near Bayfield.\n\n  In the case of the Apostle Islands, how did the Senate respond, Mr. \nPresident? And what does it tell us about the stewardship and attention \nwe should pay here in the Senate to southern Utah. In 1967, Senator \nNelson was leading the effort that led to President Nixon's signing, on \nSeptember 26, 1970, of the legislation that established the Apostle \nIslands National Lakeshore--only a few months after the first Earth \nDay.\n  Many of my constituents are concerned that perhaps there isn't that \nkind of momentum in this body any more. As their letters reflect, they \nbelieve that there is a concerted campaign to undermine landmark \nenvironmental legislation, such as the Clean Water Act, and to curtail \nor end the Federal role in protection of endangered species and their \nhabitats. They express frustration that the Senate is responding to \nefforts to persuade Americans they cannot afford further environmental \nprotection, that the idea of protecting our natural heritage is somehow \nan affront to the American ideal of rugged individualism.\n  As we consider this measure we must be mindful of Wallace Stegner's \nwords I quoted earlier, of the need to act carefully on these issues in \ncommunity and with sympathy and responsibility for our place in the \ngreat scheme of things.\n  I feel that it is exceedingly important to be actively engaged in \ndiscussing alternatives for the management of significant resources \nsuch as these. I urge my colleagues to be committed to do so in Utah, \nand I urge them to oppose the inclusion of the Utah measure in this \nOmnibus package.\n  The Utah wilderness provisions in the legislation now before the \nSenate has several major weaknesses.\n  The first major concern is the ``under protection'' of areas that are \nsuitable for wilderness designation. The bill would protect only 2 \nmillion acres in contrast to the 5.7 million protected in a competing \nbill, H.R. 1500, introduced in the House of Representatives and the 3.2 \nmillion acres currently being managed by BLM as wilderness pending \ncongressional designation.\n  Mr. President, as other Senators have discussed, the review of public \nlands in Utah to determine their wilderness potential has had a long \nand contentious history. The BLM's initial inventory of this area to \nimplement the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act, known as \nFLPMA, identified 5.5 million acres of land as having potential \nwilderness values. Subsequent stages of that process resulted in 2.6 \nmillion acres of land being designated as wilderness study areas \n[WSA's] a designation which is a precursor to wilderness designation. \nUtah environmental interests challenged the 2.6 million designation, \nurging that about 700,000 acres be reinventoried. That additional study \nby BLM ultimately provided WSA status to 3.2 million acres--the \nmanagement situation under which BLM is currently operating.\n\n  Controversies over the inventory have resulted in disagreement over \nhow much wilderness to designate in Utah. Concerns over BLM's survey \nlead citizen groups to continue to conduct field based research to \ndetermine the wilderness values of other sensitive areas. These citizen \ngroup surveys lead to the development of alternative legislation to the \nproposal included in the omnibus package, which has been introduced in \nthe other body by a Representative from New York, [Mr. Hinchey]. That \nlegislation, H.R. 1500, America's Red Rock Wilderness Protection Act, \nwould set aside 5.7 million acres of land as wilderness--even more than \nthe BLM is currently protecting as WSA's.\n  In addition to current congressional proposals, there have been \nprevious administrative attempts to resolve the wilderness question in \nUtah. In 1991, the Bush administration recommended to Congress that 1.9 \nmillion acres be protected as wilderness. The proposal before us today \nhas a similar acreage figure, only it recommends designation for \ndifferent areas. However, the Interior Department now believes that \nmore areas deserve wilderness designation.\n  In her testimony on behalf of the Department before the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee this past December, Silvia Baca, Deputy \nAssistant Secretary, Land and Minerals Management for the Department of \nthe Interior stated:\n\n       We are sure other areas, both inside and outside existing \n     WSAs, deserve such (wilderness) status.\n\n  I would remind Members of the Senate of the position taken by the \nBush administration does not bind us as we consider the fate of this \narea, particularly given, as Ms. Baca also stated in her testimony, \nthat:\n\n       1.9 million acres is inadequate to protect Utah's great \n     wilderness.\n\n  The second area of concern is the fact that the lands in Utah \ndesignated as wilderness in this amendment would be required to be \nmanaged in a manner inconsistent with the Wilderness Act. In short, the \nmeaning of ``wilderness'' designation would be significantly altered in \nthis bill for these lands. The legislation is full of these exceptions \nto standard wilderness management protocol.\n  For example, under section 2002 of the amendment, roads would have to \nbe maintained to a much greater extent than is provided for in the \nWilderness Act. Access by cars, motorcycles, trucks, sport utility \nvehicles, and heavy equipment is guaranteed at any time of the year for \nwater diversion, irrigation facilities, communication sites, \nagricultural facilities, or any other structures located within the \ndesignated wilderness areas. This type of unrestricted vehicular use is \ncurrently not allowed on lands now managed by BLM, or on many other \nparcels of Federal land, regardless of whether or not they are \ndesignated as wilderness. Creating an exemption to allow such \nactivities within wilderness areas raises the question, Mr. President, \nwhat is the purpose of extending a special designation such as \n``wilderness'' if we do so with so many holes that the designation is \nessentially meaningless or that the lack of such a designation would \nactually be more protective. As I said before, this bill would allow \nactivities in a federally designated wilderness that would not be \npermitted on other nonwilderness Federal lands.\n  Another example of the way this legislation would undermine the \nmanagement of wilderness areas is included in section 2006 on military \noverflights. This section includes special language preempting the \nWilderness Act and permitting low level military flights and the \nestablishment of new special use airspace over wilderness areas. This \nlanguage sets a precedent for allowing such activities, precedent which \nis of great concern to the citizens of my State. I have been involved, \nalong with concerned Wisconsin citizens, in monitoring the recently \nproposed expansion of low level flights by the Air National Guard in \nWisconsin. The path of these low level flights would cross extremely \necologically sensitive areas in my State, and the existence of those \nareas has been instrumental in forcing the National Guard to take a \nmore careful look at the planning of any such flights.\n  The third area of concern, which I highlighted earlier in my remarks, \nis the hard release language. This language, if enacted, would set an \nunacceptable precedent for the National Wilderness system. None of the \nmore than 100 wilderness bills already enacted into law contains such \nlanguage. In the past, moreover, hard release has been proposed only \nfor lands formally studied by a Federal agency for designation as \nwilderness but released\n\n[[Page S2916]]\n\nfrom the WSA study status by Congress. The language in this amendment \ngoes even further, Mr. President, it applies to all the 22 million \nacres of BLM lands in Utah not just the 3.2 million WSA acres.\n  The final area of concern is the land exchange embodied in the Utah \nwilderness portion of this bill. This legislation mandates that State \nlands within or immediately adjacent to designated wilderness areas be \nexchanged for certain areas now owned by BLM. Some lands to be \nexchanged are explicitly designated in this legislation, such as the \n3,520 acres that would be given to the Water Conservancy District of \nWashington County, Utah for the construction of a reservoir. Other \nareas are not explicitly designated. The State is allowed under this \nmeasure to choose from a pool of Federal lands in different areas. As \nothers have discussed, the Dutch-owned mining company, Andalex \nResources is currently moving through the Federal permitting process to \ndevelop a coal mine on lands which the State is interested in \nacquiring. This exchange has significant fiscal consequences.\n\n  First, the Interior Department believes the lands not to be of \napproximately equal value. More importantly, should the lands have been \npermitted for mining under Federal ownership, the taxpayers would \nreceive the return for all such mining activities. CBO determined that \nthe net income to the Federal Government of the lands being transferred \nto the State of Utah would amount to an average of almost $500,000 \nannually over the next 5 years, or approximately $2.5 million in \nFederal receipts. In contrast, the Federal receipts anticipated from \nthe lands being traded to the Federal Government in exchange would \namount to about $33,000 per year or a mere $165,000 over the same \nperiod. In comparative terms, Mr. President, for every $1 that the \nFederal Government gives in the lands it exchanges with Utah it only \ngets back 7 cents.\n  All of these concerns, Mr. President, have led the Secretary of the \nInterior, Mr. Babbitt to announce on March 15, 1996 that he would \nrecommend that the President veto this omnibus package unless the Utah \nprovisions were removed. That is a step that the Senate should take. If \nthe Utah provisions remain in this bill as currently drafted, the bill \ndeserves not only a Presidential veto, but a condemnation from every \nAmerican who cares about protecting our natural resources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S2907-6", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2916-S2917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WELFARE AND MEDICAID\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to comment briefly this morning on \nwelfare and Medicaid, because the majority leader has indicated that \nthese are going to be two of his priorities after the recess. We are \ngoing to bring these bills to the floor in an effort to get them passed \nyet again and to get them signed by the President.\n  It seems we are in a campaign mode now. Everyone is focused on the \nPresidential election. It does not seem like it was just 4 years ago \nthat President--candidate then--Bill Clinton was going around the \ncountry saying we need to end welfare as we know it. People might ask \nwhat has happened in the last 4 years? The President seemed to be \ncommitting himself to ending welfare as we know it. Yet, during the \nfirst 2 years of his administration, when the Democrat Party controlled \nthe House and Senate, nothing was done. When Republicans finally came \nin and it was part of the Contract With America, however, something did \nget done. We passed bills for welfare reform, and they not only \nreformed the essence of the welfare program to put more focus on people \nworking, on providing incentives to families, and to reducing the costs \nof welfare, but also returned much of the decisionmaking to the States \nunder the theory that the States and local governments would have more \nconnection with the specific people on welfare and would know better \nhow to run the programs for the benefit of the people in their \nindividual States.\n  We, therefore, passed a Balanced Budget Act that included significant \nwelfare reform and sent that bill to the President on November 17. He \nvetoed the bill on December 6 and said that he wanted a different \nwelfare bill. So we sent him another welfare bill. This time the Senate \nvoted on a separate welfare bill, and the vote was 87 to 12. That is \nabout as bipartisan as you can ever get in the U.S. Senate. Yet the \nPresident rejected that as well. In fact, in his State of the Union \nspeech he said, ``I will sign a bipartisan welfare bill if you will \nsend it to me.'' We have already done that by a vote of 87 to 12. \nDemocrats and Republicans alike understood the need for real welfare \nreform, and we sent that to him. But it still was not good enough.\n  So, the Nation's Governors got together, Democrats and Republicans, \nand unanimously agreed on welfare reform and on Medicaid reform, which \nI will speak to in just a moment. Initially, it seemed like we had an \nopportunity, not only to get the legislation passed through the House \nand Senate--that would be fairly easy--but to get the President to sign \nit, which is required in order for it to become law. But now, once \nagain, it appears the President will not take yes for an answer, or he \ngot cold feet or something, because now Secretary Shalala, for example, \nis saying she does not really like the idea of a block grant.\n\n  As everybody knows, the block grant is fundamental, it is essential, \nit is the central point here of our Medicaid and welfare reform. In \nother words, instead of having Washington decide what to do, we send \nthe money directly back to the States for them to make the decision how \nbest to operate the program in their State with a few general national \nguidelines, the rest of the decisions being made at the State level. \nSo, once again, we proposed a specific idea, this time with all of the \nNation's Governors in support. The administration is still saying no. \nIt makes you wonder whether this President is really committed to \nwelfare and Medicaid reform. Will we, in this Presidential campaign, \nonce again be debating an issue that was debated 4 years ago, about \nwhich we all thought we were in agreement?\n  Let me quickly turn to Medicaid because the majority leader also \nindicated that he thinks, and I agree, that we need to have these two \nissues both sent to the President for reform because they both involve \nthe same general element of return of control to the State. Medicaid is \ngrowing at roughly 10 percent annually. This is the program of health \ncare for our indigent citizens. Obviously, without reform, that program \nis going to be in trouble. As a matter of fact, the Federal Government \nwill spend over $1 trillion between 1995 and the year 2002 on Medicaid. \nWithout reform, the States will spend $688 billion of their own money \non Medicaid between 1996 and the year 2002. This represents 8 percent \nof the States' non-Federal revenue and an increase of 225 percent \nbetween 1990 and the year 2002. Obviously, this system must be \nreformed.\n  The legislation that we put together recognizes that there is a need \nfor Federal support, there is a need for Federal standards, but the \nStates can run these programs. My own State of Arizona was the first to \nget a waiver and, from the very beginning, it ran a program it calls \nACCESS, which provides medical services to the poor and has done so at \na cost that the State of Arizona could afford.\n  The bottom line of the reform that we have put together on Medicaid--\nand here, again, the Governors have been in agreement on this--is that \nthe program will continue to grow, but just not as fast as it has in \nthe past, because the States would be given more latitude to run the \nprograms on their own.\n  Total Federal and State spending of Medicaid under these programs we \nhave designed would, over the next 7 years, be at least $1.36 trillion. \nThe Federal portion of this amount would exceed $780 billion. Federal \nspending for Medicaid would increase at an average annual rate of 5 \npercent, between 1996 and the year 2002. It would grow from just over \n$157 billion in 1995 to at least $220 billion in the year 2002, which \nrepresents an increase in spending of more than 40 percent, Mr. \nPresident. That is not a cut, lest anybody suggest that it is.\n  The key, as I said, is to allow the States greater flexibility to \nrestructure the benefits of Medicaid to suit their own State's \nbeneficiaries. Again, the National Governors Association has reached an \nagreement on Medicaid as well as on welfare.\n  The point of our comments this morning is to try to stress the fact \nthat the Congress has been willing, the\n\n[[Page S2917]]\n\nNation's Governors and legislatures have been willing, but there is \nonly one person who stands in the way of Medicaid and welfare reform. \nHis name is Bill Clinton. He is the President of the United States. He \nsaid he was for reforming these two programs when he ran for President \n4 years ago. But it has been 4 years and nothing has happened and \nnothing did happen until Republicans gained control of the House and \nSenate.\n  It should be very clear to our colleagues and the American people, \nthis Republican Senate and the Republican House, the Nation's \nGovernors, and many of our Democratic friends in the House and Senate \nare in agreement on what needs to be done. Will the President of the \nUnited States get that message before this next Presidential campaign? \nIf he does not, my suggestion is that the American people will send \nthat message loud and clear, because we should not have to wait until \n1997 to reform welfare and Medicaid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S2916-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 1296\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I want to echo and underscore the \nremarks of my good colleague from Arizona. I do not know of any issue \nin the country for which there is more unanimity or agreement than the \ncurrent status of our welfare programs. You can go to any community, \nany State, any region, any city, and, as I said, there is a unanimity \nthat this program has failed.\n  Sometimes in the discussions, we fail to acknowledge what that means. \nWhat that means is that hundreds of thousands of Americans have been \ncondemned to stunted futures with no hope, no real education, no real \nprospect for opportunity in a life as we have come to know to be \nsynonymous with being an American.\n  You can do anything as long as it is different and it would be \nbetter. Every statistic that we have endeavored to improve with these \nmassive welfare programs, with the exception of one piece of data, is \nworse today and not just a little worse, but dramatically so. Every \ncondition of the target of the welfare programs is worse, not better. \nWe have higher teenage pregnancies, we have more single-member \nhouseholds, we have less scores in our education programs. It is all \nworse.\n  What makes it even more difficult to comprehend is that we have spent \nmore of the Treasury of America on the War on Poverty than we spent on \nthe Second World War, the First World War, Vietnam, Korea, and the \nPersian Gulf combined. We, essentially, prevailed on those battles, but \nwe have lost the war on poverty. That means that there are millions of \nAmericans today for whom the future is bleak, and we owe our fellow \ncitizens more than this condemnation that we have created in our own \ncountry.\n  To put in context a response, a contemporary response, the President \nof the United States went to the American people in 1992 and, in his \nsuccessful bid for the Presidency, said, ``This condition must stop. \nThis condition must come to an end. Welfare as we know it will not \ncontinue.''\n  He was elected President. He had a majority in the House and the \nSenate, and in the 103d Congress, the Clinton Congress, nothing \nhappened. Welfare, as we know it, is as it is--unchanged.\n  Then we come to the 104th Congress and this new majority, and an \nextensive Welfare Reform Act was passed in the House and in the Senate \nand sent to the President, the President who had promised the American \npeople that he would end welfare as we know it. Instead, what he ended \nwas welfare reform in the dark of the evening when he vetoed the \nWelfare Reform Act, which he has now done twice.\n\n  So you have to begin to get the picture that if you did not do \nanything when you were in charge of the Congress and then you vetoed \nwelfare reform twice subsequently, there may be a lack of interest in \ntrue welfare reform.\n  He is running political advertising as we speak today in the Nation's \ncapital, and that advertising says that he is for welfare reform. I \nonly suggest to the American people, at least to this point, there is a \nmassive difference between the rhetoric and the words of the campaign \nand the actions and the deeds of governments, because we are today \ngoing into the final year of this administration, and there is no \nwelfare reform, there is only a record of blocking and stopping.\n  The bill that went out of the Senate had over 80 votes, Republican \nand Democrat. He claimed it should be bipartisan. It was, but still \nvetoed, stopped.\n  At the end of the day--and I am going to yield in a moment to the \nChair--at the end of the day, this is all about American citizens. I do \nnot think history is going to look very kindly on America for what it \ndid to these people across our land, mostly in our large cities. They \nare virtual ghettos, prisons from which escape is almost impossible, \nand that should guide our actions. These programs should be changed if \nwe care about our fellow citizens.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I will be able to take your post \nfor a moment.

Mr. President, a few weeks ago, the freshman class of the \nU.S. Senate made a trip around the United States to talk to different \ngroups, different gatherings. We went all the way from Philadelphia to \nKnoxville, to Minneapolis, to Cheyenne, WY. One of the things we talked \nabout, probably more than anything else, was welfare reform, changing \nthe system as we have come to know it since the 1960's.\n  The Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, was with us during this. \nHe came up with some evidence from the State of Missouri that I thought \nwas quite remarkable. He was talking about the administration of the \nMedicaid program, how they have been able to file and get out from \nunder the red-tape of the Federal Government. The year prior to their \nbeing able to administer the Medicaid Program with the amount of money \nthat they had, they reached some 600,000 families throughout the State \nof Missouri. The next year, or the year following the year that they \nwere able to take over the total jurisdiction and control and \nadministration and come out from under the redtape of the Federal \nGovernment--and this was done, I might add, under a Democrat \nadministration, a Democrat director of the department of human services \nfor the State of Missouri--they were able to use that same amount of \nmoney and reach 900,000 families. In other words, 50 percent more \nservices were given to families just by eliminating the unnecessary \ntrip and expense and redtape of the Federal Government.\n  I believe it has been our policy to get as many of these things back \nto the local level. Having served myself in the State legislature, \nhaving served as a mayor of a major city, Tulsa, OK, for three terms, I \ncan tell you that the closer you can get to the people at home, the \nbetter a program will be administered.\n  On welfare, we spent some time looking at the welfare system. The \nPresident of the United States, when he ran for President, when Bill \nClinton ran for President of the United States, he had a pretty good \nwelfare reform system. In fact, the welfare reform system that\n\n[[Page S2918]]\n\nhe advocated during the time that he ran for President of the United \nStates had work requirements, had elements in it that were precisely \nthe elements of the welfare reform package that passed the House of \nRepresentatives and then passed the Senate by a vote of 87 to 12. It \nwas a shock to everyone, even on his own side of the aisle where 60 \npercent of the Democrats voted to support this, when he came out \nand vetoed it. I would like to think that America woke up during the \ndemagogy of the Medicare reform. I know that many----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notifies the Senator that his time \nhas expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. One minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me just comment that many editorial \nwriters around the country that normally are more of a liberal \npersuasion came out and editorialized in favor of the Republicans and \nthe fact that we recognized that we have a system that was going into \nbankruptcy. I ask unanimous consent that these be printed in the \nRecord, the two editorials from the Washington Post that made this very \nclear. The names of the editorials are ``Medagogues'' and ``Medagogues, \nCont'd.''\n  The last sentence of the second editorial reads, ``The Democrats have \nfabricated the Medicare-tax cut connection because it is useful \npolitically. It allows them to attack and duck responsibility, both at \nthe same time. We think it's wrong.'' And America thinks it is wrong.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 18, 1995]\n\n                               Medagogues\n\n       Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole accused the Democrats and their \n     allies yesterday of conducting a campaign based on distortion \n     and fear to block the cuts in projected Medicare spending \n     that are the core of the Republican effort to balance the \n     budget in the next seven years. They're right; that's \n     precisely what the Democrats are doing--it's pretty much all \n     they're doing--and it's crummy stuff.\n       There's plenty to be said about the proposals the \n     Republicans are making; there's a legitimate debate to be had \n     about what ought to be the future of Medicare and federal aid \n     to the elderly generally. But that's not what the Democrats \n     are engaged in. They're engaged in demagoguery, big time. And \n     it's wrong--as wrong on their part now as it was a year ago \n     when other people did it to them on some of the same health \n     care issues. Then, they were the ones who indignantly \n     complained.\n       Medicare and Medicaid costs have got to be controlled, as \n     do health care costs in the economy generally. The federal \n     programs represent a double whammy, because they, more than \n     any other factor, account for the budget deficits projected \n     for the years ahead. They are therefore driving up interest \n     costs even as they continue to rise powerfully themselves. \n     But figuring out how to contain them is enormously difficult. \n     More than a fourth of the population depends on the programs \n     for health care; hospitals and other health care institutions \n     depend on them for income; and you cut their costs with care. \n     Politically, Medicare is especially hard to deal with because \n     the elderly--and their children who must help care for them \n     to the extent the government doesn't--are so potent a voting \n     bloc.\n       The congressional Republicans have confounded the skeptics \n     who said they would never attack a program benefiting the \n     broad middle class. They have come up with a plan to cut \n     projected Medicare costs by (depending on whose estimates you \n     believe) anywhere from $190 billion to $270 billion over the \n     seven-year period. It's true that they're also proposing a \n     large and indiscriminate tax cut that is a bad idea and that \n     the Medicare cuts would indirectly help to finance. And it's \n     true that their cost-cutting plan would do--in our judgment--\n     some harm as well as good.\n       But they have a plan. Enough is known about it to say it's \n     credible; it's gusty and in some respects inventive--and it \n     addresses a genuine problem that is only going to get worse. \n     What the Democrats have instead is a lot of expostulation, TV \n     ads and scare talk. The fight is about ``what's going to \n     happen to the senior citizens in the country,'' Dick Gephardt \n     said yesterday. ``The rural hospitals. The community health \n     centers. The teaching hospitals. . . .'' The Republicans \n     ``are going to decimate [Medicare] for a tax break for the \n     wealthiest people, take it right out of the pockets of senior \n     citizens. . . .'' The American people ``don't want to lose \n     their Medicare. They don't want Medicare costs to be \n     increased by $1,000 a person. They don't want to lose the \n     choice of their doctor.''\n       But there isn't any evidence that they would ``lose their \n     Medicare'' or lose their choice of doctor under the \n     Republican plan. If the program isn't to become less generous \n     over time, how do the Democrats propose to finance it and \n     continue as well to finance the rest of the federal \n     activities they espouse? That's the question. You listen in \n     vain for a real response. It's irresponsible.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 25, 1995]\n\n                           Medagogues, Cont'd\n\n       We print today a letter from House minority leader Richard \n     Gephardt, taking exception to an editorial that accused the \n     Democrats of demagoguing on Medicare. The letter itself seems \n     to us to be more of the same. It tells you just about \n     everything the Democrats think about Medicare except how to \n     cut the cost. That aspect of the subject it puts largely out \n     of bounds, on grounds that Medicare is ``an insurance \n     program, not a welfare program,'' and ``to slash the program \n     to balance the budget'' or presumably for any purpose other \n     than to shore up the trust fund is ``not just a threat to . . \n     . seniors, families, hospitals'' etc. but ``a violation of a \n     sacred trust.''\n       That's bullfeathers, and Mr. Gephardt knows it. Congress \n     has been sticking the budget knife to Medicare on a regular \n     basis for years. Billions of dollars have been cut from the \n     program; both parties have voted for the cutting. Most years \n     the cuts have had nothing to do with the trust funds, which, \n     despite all the rhetoric, both parties understand to be \n     little more than accounting devices and possible warning \n     lights as to program costs. Rather, the goal has been to \n     reduce the deficit. It made sense to turn to Medicare because \n     Medicare is a major part of the problem. It and Medicaid \n     together are now a sixth of the budget and a fourth of all \n     spending for other than interest and defense. If nothing is \n     done those shares are going to rise, particularly as the \n     baby-boomers begin to retire early in the next century.\n       There are only four choices, none of them pleasant. \n     Congress can let the health care programs continue to drive \n     up the deficit, or it can let them continue to crowd out \n     other programs or it can pay for them with higher taxes. \n     Or it can cut them back.\n       The Republicans want to cut Medicare. It is a gutsy step. \n     This is not just a middle-class entitlement; the entire \n     society looks to the program, and earlier in the year a lot \n     of the smart money said the Republicans would never take it \n     on. They have. Mr. Gephardt is right that a lot of their plan \n     is still gauzy. It is not yet clear how tough it will finally \n     be; on alternate days you hear it criticized on grounds that \n     it seeks to cut too much from the program and on grounds that \n     it won't cut all it seeks. Maybe both will turn out to be \n     true; we have no doubt the plan will turn out to have our \n     other flaws as well.\n       They have nonetheless--in our judgment--stepped up to the \n     issue. They have taken a huge political risk just in calling \n     for the cuts they have. What the Democrats have done in turn \n     is confirm the risk. The Republicans are going to take away \n     your Medicine. That's their only message. They have no plan. \n     Mr. Gephardt says they can't offer one because the \n     Republicans would simply pocket the money to finance their \n     tax cut. It's the perfect defense; the Democrats can't do the \n     right thing because the Republicans would then do the wrong \n     one. It's absolutely the case that there ought not to be a \n     tax cut, and certainly not the indiscriminate cut the \n     Republicans propose. But that has nothing to do with \n     Medicare. The Democrats have fabricated the Medicare-tax cut \n     connection because it is useful politically. It allows them \n     to attack and to duck responsibility, both at the same time. \n     We think it's wrong.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S2917-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2918-S2925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRESIDIO PROPERTIES ADMINISTRATION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I would like to, if I could, get a few \nhousekeeping measures out of the way. First, so that the Record can \nclearly reflect who is doing what to the bills that are before us at \nthis moment, this is a bill that contains 33 titles. Every Senator \nshould know that the Senator from New Jersey would not oppose moving 30 \nof those titles now, pass them by voice vote. I do not oppose them. I \ndo not have holds on them. They can be moved now. If they are not moved \nnow, someone does have a hold on them. It is not me.\n  I also make the other point that the distinguished chairman alluded \nto saying that these bills in this package have been on the calendar \nfor over a year. Well, maybe some of them have been, not all of them. \nIndeed, there are some bills in this package that have not even been \nreported from the Energy Committee. There was no vote in\n\n[[Page S2919]]\n\nthe Energy Committee on at least 6 or 7 or 8 of these bills. They were \nadded on the floor into this big package without them ever being \nreported out of the Energy Committee or having a hearing in this \nCongress. Some had a hearing in the last Congress, so that is not a big \ndeal. They should be reported out of the committee, but they were not.\n  The other point is, the Senator from New Jersey has indeed not held \nall bills. The distinguished Senator from Alaska alluded to the fact \nthat a bill that he was very interested in moved without any problem. \nSo let us get that housekeeping matter out of the way first. We could \nmove almost 30 titles by voice vote.\n  Let us get to the real issue here, which is the Utah wilderness bill, \nwhich is one of the titles, which is the title that I strongly oppose. \nWhy do I oppose this? This is the most important public lands bill \nsince the Alaska land bill of 1980. This is the most important public \nland bill since the Alaska bill over 15 years ago.\n\n  What are we talking about here? We are talking about declaring a part \nof Utah wilderness. There are two areas in question. One is the basin \nand range area. That is that vast area west of Salt Lake City, an area \nof salt flats and small mountain ranges. The writer John McPhee says \nthat ``Each range here'' in the basin range ``is like a warship \nstanding on its own, and the Great Basin is an ocean of loose sediment \nwith these mountain ranges standing in it as if they were members of a \nfleet without precedent.'' So one of the areas we are talking about is \nthis unique area, basin and range.\n  The other area we are talking about is the great Colorado Plateau in \nsouthern Utah. The part of Utah that Harold Ickes, the first Secretary \nof the Interior during the administration of Franklin Roosevelt, said \nalmost the whole part of Utah should be a national park, that almost \nthe whole part of that southern part of Utah should be a national park.\n  It is a vast plateau and canyonlands of incredible beauty, vast \nplateaus like the Kaiparowits Plateau or the Dirty Devil Wilderness, \nsome of the most remote and rugged landscapes in the West. Yet some of \nthe most interesting records of those who inhabited this land before \nAmerica--before Europeans ever came to the United States--are also \nlocated in this section of Utah, and the remains of the great Anasazi, \nwho were here long before the first European set foot on this \ncontinent. All of this vast beauty is in southern Utah.\n  It is a genuine wilderness: Remote, rugged, deep-cut canyons that are \nsandstone cut, with deep rivers. It is the place of Zion and Bryce and \nCanyonlands. It is unique. It deserves wilderness designation.\n  We now have before the Senate the Utah wilderness bill. What is the \nproblem with the Utah wilderness bill? Well, too little land is \nprotected as wilderness; and too few protections are given to that \nland. In addition, the inventory process, the process by which the \nBureau of Land Management determined which areas should qualify as \nwilderness, was flawed from the beginning.\n  In the State of Utah, there are 22 million acres under the control of \nthe Bureau of Land Management. Under the bill before the Senate, 2 \nmillion of these acres--2 million of those acres--will be set aside as \nwilderness. That is all, 2 million acres.\n  Now, there are too few protections, as well. Just take the vast \nKaiparowits Plateau, a plateau of juniper forests, trees that have been \nthere long before the first European set his foot forth on the United \nStates. It is a vast wilderness, one of the most vast wildernesses in \nthe lower 48 States. Under this bill, about 50,000 acres of that \nplateau will be transferred to the State of Utah, an area for which a \nDutch company is already negotiating to put a gigantic coal mine--a \ngigantic coal mine--in the heart of that wilderness.\n  What about Dirty Devil? There, of course, the area that is excluded \nwill be set aside for tar sands development. The legislation also would \nallow new dams, called reservoirs, new dams. One thought that in the \nColorado Plateau this issue was settled in the 1960's when the dams \nthat were proposed at Dinosaur Monument were defeated because the \npeople of this country realized that this incredible beauty, silence \nand time standing still needed to be protected, should not be blocked \nby a dam with another lake going up the Canyonlands and destroying both \nthe record of human habitation and the possibility of walking in the \nCanyonlands.\n  What else? Well, roads and motor vehicles are allowed to an \nunprecedented extent in areas which are wilderness. Also, you give the \nState the right to designate which areas it wants without regard to \nenvironmental sensitivity, and with great concern that the lands that \nthe Federal Government would exchange with the State will not be of \nequal value. In fact, in the Interior Department's comment on this \nbill, as embodied in the report, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for \nLand and Minerals Management, Sylvia Baca, says the following:\n\n       ``The tracts proposed to be obligated by the State have \n     high economic value for mineral, residential, and \n     industrial development. The fair market value of these \n     lands may be 5 to 10 times more than the value of the \n     lands that would be transferred to the Federal Government. \n     Despite the imbalance in favor of State, the bill provides \n     for increased compensation to the State if encumbrances on \n     Federal lands being transferred result in an imbalance, \n     but not the other way around. This would only add to the \n     inequality of values in this proposed exchange.\n\n  Mr. President, if the coal mining development is not enough, if the \ntar sands development is not enough, if the oil exploration is not \nenough, the new dams are not enough, if the roads and motor vehicles \nare not enough, if the kind of unequal value trade between State and \nFederal Government is not enough, what about this provision in the bill \nthat sets aside the 2 million acres for wilderness, but attaches no \nwater right to this wilderness land? These are areas that get 10 to 12 \ninches of rain a year--not much. What happens if that water is \ndiverted, is used in another way, and does not get to the wilderness? \nWhatever fragile life is there dies, and it is over.\n  In Nevada, a State not totally dissimilar, not nearly as dramatic in \nsome of its beauty as southern Utah, but still a remarkably beautiful \nState with a very similar topography, when the Nevada wilderness bill \npassed, the authors of that bill made sure that there was water \nattached to that wilderness so that you would not have a wilderness, \nessentially, destroyed.\n  Finally, in terms of objections to the bill, there is a so-called \nhard release language. Now, the release language, which basically means \nwhen you do a wilderness bill you release lands, lands that are not \nwilderness, but you do not release them forever and ever, because at \nsome other point you might want to consider whether they are \nwilderness. The bill as originally drafted said that the land should be \nmanaged for nonwilderness multiple uses only--that was dropped--and a \nsubstitute was offered that said ``the full range of uses.''\n  However, the existing amendment, the existing section of the bill, \nalso says that ``lands released shall not be managed for the purpose of \nprotecting their suitability for wilderness designation.'' This is a \nkind of belt and suspenders approach. The previous version of the bill \nas reported out had both belt and suspenders, two protections against \nfurther wilderness designation. The current version got rid of the \nsuspenders but leaves the belt. It is still unprecedented in wilderness \nbills.\n  Mr. President, these are all serious flaws with this bill that need \nto be addressed that might be able to be addressed. The flawed process \nis what makes me doubtful.\n  Just a brief recapitulation: in 1964 the wilderness bill passed. What \nwas the definition of wilderness in a 1964 bill? ``A wilderness, in \ncontrast with areas where man in his own works dominate the landscape, \nis hereby recognized as an area where the earth and the community of \nlife are untrammeled by man and where man himself is a visitor who does \nnot remain.'' That was the definition of wilderness.\n  In 1976, that was applied to Bureau of Land Management lands about \n280 million acres nationwide. And in 1976, 1977, the Bureau of Land \nManagement was given 15 years to identify which areas under its control \nwould qualify for wilderness, possibly, to inventory possible \nwilderness areas. But do you know what happened in Utah? In Utah, they \ncompleted it in 1 year. They inventoried all 22 million acres \ncontrolled by the Bureau of Land Management. At the end of that year, \nthey\n\n[[Page S2920]]\n\neliminated 20 million acres for consideration as wilderness.\n\n  What was the basis upon which they eliminated these 20 million acres? \nIt was that they lacked outstanding opportunities for solitude or \nprimitive recreation. That is why they were eliminated. In the fall of \n1980, a representative of the Sierra Club toured a section of the \nKaiparowits Plateau with the Utah BLM Director, Gary Wicks. Their \nhelicopter touched down on the southern tip of Four-Mile Bench, which \nis part of the plateau. She says:\n\n       We stood on the edge of as far as the eye can see. \n     Incredibly beautiful, utterly wild land. And I would say, \n     ``Gary, why are you eliminating this from wilderness?'' And \n     he would say, ``Because there are no outstanding \n     opportunities for primitive recreation.'' And I would say, \n     ``And there are no outstanding opportunities for solitude \n     either?'' And Gary would say, ``You are right. You can have \n     solitude here, but it is not outstanding solitude.' And the \n     man kept a straight face while he said that.\n\n  She concludes by saying, ``If the helicopter left us there, we would \nhave known what outstanding solitude was all about,'' because she would \nhave been left in this vast wilderness, one of the most rugged areas of \nAmerica. But it was on the basis that these lands did not provide \nsufficient solitude that they were eliminated from wilderness \ndesignation. That flies in the face of virtually everything.\n  Well, when only 2.6 million acres were set aside out of the 22.5 \nmillion acres, under the control of BLM, and only 2.6 were set aside, a \nlot of Utah people got very upset. They filed petitions and they filed \nbriefs; they had 30 days in which to do that. And because of their \nefforts, it included 3.2 acres for wilderness. And since then, that is \nthe amount of land in Utah today that had been managed as wilderness; \n3.2 million acres are now being protected as if they were wilderness.\n  In 1991, BLM came up with its final suggestion--1.9 million acres. \nThe Utah congressional delegation introduced its bill, which was 1.8 \nmillion. Two days ago on the floor, they modified it to 2 million \nacres. Well, there was another group of Utah residents that said this \nwas kind of a hurried process, with helicopter flyovers, and only \ncutting out 2.6 million. So they said, ``Let us do this \nscientifically,'' and they did that and came up with 5.7 million acres \nof Utah that should be wilderness. I do not know if it is 5.7. I am \nsure that there is some number lower than that which could preserve the \nwilderness areas. But I certainly know that 2 million is not enough \nand, particularly, with the language that is in this bill.\n\n  The real irony is that this is an attempt, while the protections for \nmining, coal, tar sands, oil exploration, dams, et cetera, in a State \nwhere only eight-tenths of 1 percent of the jobs are in mining, in a \nState where only 2 percent of the State economic product is in mining. \nThe future is not there. The future is in this beauty that is self-\nevident to anybody that comes to southern Utah or to the basin and \nrange. The real irony is the Senator from New Jersey, who comes from a \nState that is 89 percent urban, is making this argument in a State that \nis 87 percent urban--one of the best kept secrets of the West, the most \nurbanized area of America. People from this country are coming into the \ncities.\n  So I believe that this would even be in the long-term interest of the \nState. But that is not what this is about. The Utah economy is really \nnot my province. It is my observation, as somebody who has looked at \nthese issues. But what I want to preserve is the possibility for \nsilence and the possibility for time that exists only in a wilderness.\n  I would like to read, in closing, just two things from a book \nprepared by several writers about the Utah wilderness. One is by John \nMcPhee, who wrote in ``Basin and Range'' the following, talking about \nthat basin and range area west of Salt Lake City, that geologic \nformation that has been stretching for several million years. Reno and \nSalt Lake City, 7 million years ago, were 60 miles closer together. \nThey are 60 miles further apart today because the geological structure \nis moving. When it moves, the crust cracks, and up pops mountain \nranges. These are the mountain ranges that we are trying to protect in \nthe broader wilderness bill.\n  McPhee writes:\n\n       Supreme over all is silence. Discounting the cry of the \n     occasional bird, the wailing of a pack of coyotes, silence--a \n     great spatial silence--is pure in the Basin and Range . . . \n     ``No rustling of leaves in the wind, no rumbling of distant \n     traffic, no chatter of birds or insects or children. You are \n     alone with God in that silence. There in the white flat \n     silence, I began for the first time to feel a slight sense of \n     shame for what we were proposing to do. Did we really intend \n     to invade this silence with our trucks and bulldozers and \n     after a few years leave it a radioactive junkyard?\n\n  Another writer--this will be the final one, and I quoted him the \nother day--is Charles Wilkinson. He was talking about taking his son \ninto the Colorado Plateau. He says:\n\n       One long hike took us down into a narrow canyon branching \n     off the Escalante River. The sandstone walls, smoldering red, \n     thrust straight up. Scattered pinyon and juniper, and ferns \n     and grasses around the springs, accented the color embedded \n     in the canyon sides.\n       The Wingate Sandstone had been the rock of surrounding \n     mountain ranges. During the Triassic, some 200 million years \n     ago, water worked the mountains, wearing them into sand. \n     Winds lifted the grains and piled them up as dunes on the \n     desert floor. The sands hardened back into rock. Then the \n     whole Colorado Plateau rose. . . The creek in this now canyon \n     would have none of it, resolutely holding its ground against \n     the upthrusting Wingate and younger formations on top of it, \n     cutting down 1,000 feet into rock and time. Much of the day \n     we walked up to our calves in the creek.\n       Not long ago we scorned this land as remote, desolate. That \n     thinking led to the postwar Big Build-up and the coal plants, \n     dams, and uranium mines.\n       But today we know southern Utah, in the heart of the \n     Colorado Plateau, for what it really is. The geologic events \n     were so cataclysmic and so recent, and the frail soils so \n     erodible, that the Colorado Plateau holds more graphic \n     displays of exposed formation than anywhere on earth. The dry \n     air has preserved the ancient people's durable and magical \n     rock art, villages, kivas, pots, and baskets to a degree \n     found nowhere else.\n       Yet our society seems to lack the will to care for the \n     Canyon Country. The Utah congressional delegation . . . wants \n     to declare some fragments of the backcountry wilderness and \n     then throw the rest open to development.\n       That would be so short-sighted, so contemptuous of time. \n     The old images on the walls were made so long ago, the walls \n     themselves even longer. Time runs out to the future, too: \n     give our grandchildren, and those far down the line from \n     them, the blessing of taking a daughter or son into the \n     weaving, rosy side canyons, of finding their own Dream \n     Panels, and of being instructed by the young person on how to \n     scramble out.\n       Time, oh, time . . . May we not forsake you now.\n\n  Mr. President, this is about time and silence, and the chance for \nfuture generations to explore and understand this vast and beautiful \nwilderness.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, during the debate, the Senator from New \nJersey provided us with his viewpoint on many subjects related to the \nproper management of our Nation's public lands. I respect him for his \npositions, for his contribution to ensuring that one of this country's \nmany natural resources--our public lands--are properly and efficiently \nmanaged in an environmentally sensitive manner.\n  However, to be perfectly frank about it, he is just plain wrong when \nit comes to our bill to designate wilderness in Utah. I do not believe \nhe has a full appreciation for the difficulty these small communities \nin my State have with maintaining all of this land as wilderness.\n  The longer Congress postpones action on the Utah Public Lands \nManagement Act, the more economically strapped our small towns become. \nIt stands to reason that you cannot take a primary resource out of \ncirculation within an economy and expect that economy to flourish. The \nland resources in rural Utah are of the utmost importance to an economy \nwhose major industries include mining, farming, and ranching.\n  My friend from New Jersey says our rural Utah counties can live off \ntourism dollars. Certainly, the tourism industry is vital to our State \nand important to the general welfare of our economy. But, it is not a \npanacea for the ills that plagued small town U.S.A. as the Senator \npointed out yesterday. To give two examples, since nearly one-half \nmillion acres of land have been designated wilderness study areas \n[WSA's] by the BLM in San Juan County, UT--in Utah's southwestern \ncorner--tourism has only increased from 2\n\n[[Page S2921]]\n\npercent in 1985 to 5 percent in 1995. In Millard County, on the western \nhalf of Utah, BLM designated acres as WSA's. Guess what the impact to \ntheir tourism industry was? Good guess--zero.\n  In my opinion, these kinds of numbers are not going to save the local \neconomy of any community no matter how much acreage is designated \nwilderness.\n  I do appreciate his sensitivity to the manner in which Utah's public \nlands are managed--I really do. But, I would like to set his mind at \nease. We must be doing a fairly decent job; for, after all, we have \nplaced every single acre in BLM's inventory in a position, at least as \nfar as the Senator from New Jersey is concerned, that each of them meet \nthe wilderness criteria. That is a pretty decent record.\n  However, Senator Bradley should worry about one matter, which was not \ndiscussed in any great detail yesterday, and that is the presence of \nState school trust lands now captured within these wilderness study \nareas. They are owned by the State of Utah on behalf of and for the \nbenefit of Utah's school children--not New Jersey's school children, \nUtah's children.\n  These lands were endowed by the Federal Government to Utah's schools \nat the time Utah became a State--100 years ago. The Utah School Lands \nTrust is not a recent development.\n  But, given the selection of the WSA's, these trust lands have been \nunavailable for any major revenue producing activity since the WSA's \nwere established due to the restrictions informally imposed on them by \ntheir neighboring lands.\n  The Utah State Legislature has made a commitment to improving the \nmanagement of the trust lands. These trust lands must produce more \nrevenue if the State of Utah is going to meet its challenges in \neducation. Utah currently ranks 49th in the Nation in terms of per \npupil education spending. While I happen to believe that Utah stretches \nits education dollar further than just about any State and does an \nexemplary job of educating our kids, there is just no question that \neducation financing continues to be our major concern.\n  Two years ago, the legislature organized a new State body whose \nspecific reason for being is to gain the greatest benefit from the \nschool trust lands. This body, composed of private citizens, is serious \nabout meeting the purpose for which they have been created, namely, to \nsee that the trust lands produce. I remind my colleagues that wise \ninvestments are also part of good stewardship.\n  I'm sure my friend from New Jersey knows that the State has every \nlegal right to access these lands and to utilize them for whatever \npurpose they can, consistent with Federal and State laws. But, as I \nstand here today, I am convinced that, at some point down the road, the \nState is going to become so frustrated with Congress and this process \nthat it will either sell a trust land section to a commercial entity or \ntake steps to develop the land.\n\n  The fact that no one wants a disturbance of that kind in or around a \nwilderness area is precisely why the trust lands have not been fully \ndeveloped to date.\n  Yet, the State cannot wait forever to develop the trust lands. The \nrevenue from these lands is becoming increasingly important to our \neducational system. And, I am certain that these lands will be \ndeveloped to benefit our schools if we don't pass this bill.\n  This is why our bill provides for an exchange of these lands. We want \nto get the trust lands out of the wilderness areas. We want to \nestablish a unity of title so there is no commingling of management \nstyles. We want to erase this threat forever. That can only happen with \npassage of our proposal.\n  By the way, the proposal my friend from New Jersey was championing \nyesterday that has been introduced in the House does not contain any \nreference at all to the school trust lands contained within the areas \ndesignated by that bill. It does not indicate how trust lands in H.R. \n1500 will be dealt with under this measure. Are they just going to \nremain as enclaves within designated areas? Given his concern for \npristine wilderness, he should worry about what could happen in the \nabsence of a land exchange.\n  But, let me discuss several points the Senator from New Jersey raised \nin his opening comments yesterday that need to be addressed. They are \nout in the public forum and deserve a brief response.\n  First of all, he said that our release language, while an improvement \nover the original language, was ``a backdoor attempt to do what the \noriginal bill had intended to do but do it in a slicker way.''\n  Mr. President, I went into detail yesterday as to what the intent of \nour release is and is not. There is no funny business here, no tricks, \nno backdoor attempt. We are stating the full intent behind our language \nin the light of day.\n  It is simple and straightforward. Nondesignated lands will slip back \ninto the pool of normal BLM lands for continued management under BLM's \nexisting authorizes, special designations, and the host of Federal \nlegislative authorities which apply to public land management. \nSubsequently, they will be managed by the local BLM consistent with \nmultiple uses defined in section 103(c) of the Federal Land Policy and \nManagement Act and consistent with land use plans developed through \nsection 202 of the same act. This language will allow the local BLM \nland managers, the ``on-the-ground professionals,'' to manage \nnondesignated lands for their wilderness values and characters \nutilizing existing BLM authorities. I trust they will do so.\n  Our language asks the Federal manager to do his job, which is to \nmanage the Federal lands in the best way possible. It is not up to that \nmanager to decide if an acre of land should be deposited in the \nNational Wilderness Preservation System--it is up to us. The land \nmanager can use an existing authority to protect and preserve the \nwilderness--small ``w''--character of the land. That is expected when \nit's appropriate. But, he is not authorized, nor should he be, to use \nan existing authority to protect and preserve that pristine character \nto become future wilderness--big ``W'', or part of the wilderness \nsystem, at a future date.\n  And, if that concept bothers the Senator from New Jersey then he \nshould go back and change FLPMA or introduce a bill that requires \nanother round of studies and review by the BLM--that is, if he wants to \nspend another 17 years and another $10 million of taxpayer funds.\n  The release language was suggested by the ranking minority member of \nthe Energy Committee. He said himself that he found the practice of \nmanaging land for a future designation as offensive as the prohibition \non the practice of not managing it for its characteristics.\n  If we go along with the Senator from New Jersey, then we should \nsimply designate all 22 million acres in Utah as wilderness study areas \nand never derive any benefit from Utah's public lands. I do not \nunderstand why our language bothers the Senator from New Jersey so \nmuch. It is completely consistent with the scope and intent behind \nFLPMA.\n  Besides which, the BLM wilderness inventory had a beginning. It \nshould also have an end, like this issue, and hopefully before Utah \ncelebrates its 200-year birthday in 2096.\n\n  Second, the Senator indicated that ``four million acres of Utah's red \nrock wilderness will be left open for development.'' He then went on to \nlist several areas that fall into this category.\n  Several times yesterday it was asserted that the passage of our bill \nwill lead to a massive immediate destruction of nondesignated lands. I \ndo not know how many times I need to say this, but that statement is \nsimply not true. In fact, it is offensive to me not only as one of the \nprincipal authors of this bill but as a Senator from Utah.\n  Our critics continues to conjure up images of bulldozers lined up to \nadvance on these BLM lands. Those who rely upon such images to advance \ntheir cause purposely ignore our sincere desire--not to mention our \nentire State government--to protect these lands from inappropriate and \ndestructive activities.\n  In addition, I mentioned the plethora of environmental laws and \nconservation regulations passed since 1964 that provide layer upon \nlayer upon layer of protection for these lands. I will not go through \nthe list again, but they are listed on the displayed chart.\n  This argument should not even be a part of this debate. Yet, it \ncontinues to be used in the propaganda and rhetoric of the elite \nspecial interest groups.\n\n[[Page S2922]]\n\n  Unlike some, we have confidence in BLM's professional land managers \nto continue making objective decisions on the future uses of these \nlands in accordance with the law.\n  By the way, I would would like to remind the Senator from New Jersey \nthat we include in our proposal more than 16,000 acres in Fish and Owl \nCreek Canyon, more than 220,000 acres of the Kaiparowits Plateau, and \nmore than 75,000 acres of the Dirty Devil area.\n  Also, it might surprise the Senator to know that more than 80 percent \nof the acreage in our proposal is located near or below Interstate 70, \nthe highway that divides Utah in half. John Sieberling, the former \nrepresentative, once said that if he had it his way, he would make a \nnational park of all the land south of Interstate 70, and if the \nSenator from New Jersey had his way he make the entire area wilderness. \nLet us be clear about this: our proposal protects Utah's red rock \nwilderness.\n  Third, Senator Bradley referenced the possible development of coal \nleases within the Kaiparowits Plateau by the State of Utah.\n  Yes, it is true that the State of Utah has identified these BLM \nlands--which are not contained in a wilderness study area--let us be \nclear about that: they are not being managed as wilderness--as one of \n25 tracts of land it desires to exchange with the Federal Government.\n  But, what the Senator did not say is that these leases are currently \nunder suspension by the Department of Interior pending completion of an \nenvironmental impact statement that will determine if mining is ever \ngoing to be allowed in that area,\n  Once again, as he did yesterday, the Senator is second guessing the \nactivities of BLM's own personnel, only this time it deals with this \nEIS. He also accuses the State of Utah for mismanaging this acreage \nwhen there has been no determination that mining will ever occur there. \nWhile the coal is there, the ability to access it is still \nquestionable.\n  If mining ever occurs in the manner described yesterday by Senator \nBennett, the leases will be subject to every pertinent Federal \nenvironmental law, whether the leases become State or not. No matter \nwhat happens to the ownership of the land, the Federal permitting \nprocess will continue.\n  And, since the lease holder will need to construct an access road to \nthe site, build a power line to the site, and construct certain \nfacilities all on BLM land, Federal permits for each of these items \nwill be required. So, the big environmental special interest groups \nwill have plenty of opportunities to appeal this project every step of \nthe way.\n  Also, it is important to note that the site where the mine is \nprojected to be located was rejected by the BLM during its initial \nstatewide review process. The area was rejected because it did not meet \nwilderness criteria. Let me tell the Senator from New Jersey why.\n\n  Because located within a 2-mile radius of the proposed site are 80 \ndrill sites, 36 miles of roads, an airstrip, and several other surface \ndisturbances symbolic of mining activity. Do not forget--this same site \nwas initially mined in the late 1970's. Of the 40 acres required for \nthe mine site within the lease holders total leased area, half of it--\nmore than 20 acres--has already been disturbed by mining activity. This \nsite does not meet wilderness quality, but after seeing what is in some \nof the areas recommended by the special interest groups, I can see why \nthey were confused with this site.\n  This is not an issue about protecting wilderness value; this is an \nissue about preventing the responsible development of Utah's largest \ncoal reserves. But, nevertheless, this bill has nothing to do with \nwhether or not this area will ever be mined.\n  Fourth, the Senator indicated our bill ``denies a Federal water right \nto wilderness areas designated by this bill.''\n  The Senator from New Jersey has evidently not read the language \ncarefully. It is true that our bill does not create a Federal reserved \nwater right for areas designated by this act. That is because we do not \nwant to preempt State water law or to go around the State water \nappropriation system. But, it does not mean that the Federal Government \ncannot acquire a water right for designated wilderness areas.\n  Utah water law follows the concept of the prior appropriation \ndoctrine. It has been the basis for more than 90 years of State \nadministration of surface waters. All major rivers and stream systems \nin Utah have water rights established under this principle. The result \nis a fine tuned system relying on diversions, return flow, \nrediversions, mingled with some storage reservoirs. Any new filing or \nalteration of the existing pattern of water use literally sends ripples \nthroughout the total system.\n  Unlike my colleague, we do not want to follow the typical Washington \nattitude that says we should preempt State law every time the Federal \nGovernment wants something from our States. Why can't we have the \nFederal Government abide by State laws once in a while when performing \na Federal task? The Federal Government can obtain a water right in the \nState of Utah, and here is how it is done.\n  Under Utah State water law, one must put a water right to \n``beneficial'' use. That is, it must be applied to the land, to home \nuse, or to other consumptive uses in order to maintain the right.\n  However, there is an exception to the ``beneficial'' use requirement.\n  Two divisions within the Utah Department of Natural Resources--the \nDivision of State Parks and the Division of Wildlife Resources--can \nlegally acquire a water right and leave a determined quantity of water \nin a stream--an ``instream'' flow, as it were--that then becomes that \nparticular water right's ``beneficial'' use.\n  Under our bill, the BLM is provided the ability to work cooperatively \nwith these two State divisions to create an ``instream'' flow to avoid \nthe potential dewatering of a wilderness area, in the unlikely event \nthis occurs.\n  The process would be:\n  First, BLM acquires a water right from an upstream owner anywhere in \nthe State--a rancher, an old mine site, a municipality, a private \ncompany, etc.\n  Second, the right is assigned or deeded--transferred--to one of the \ntwo State divisions previously mentioned.\n  Third, an instream flow is created.\n  In the fall of 1994, this occurred. The Division of Wildlife \nResources acquired a water right from a private corporation and created \nan instream flow for wildlife purposes on 82 miles of the San Rafael \nRiver in central Utah.\n  The alternative to this language--an unqualified Federal reserve \nwater right--would leave an ominous cloud over every existing water \nright in the State of Utah.\n  There is no expressed or implied Federal reserve water right in \nour language, but that does not in any way prevent the Federal \nGovernment from acquiring a water right following the proper State \nprocedures.\n\n  Fifth, our language ``permits the State of Utah to exchange State \nlands for Federal lands of approximate equal value.'' The Senator from \nNew Jersey then indicated that the value of the Federal lands involved \nmay be greater in value than the State lands.\n  Last December, the committee adopted our proposal to establish an \nexchange process whereby the value of the lands involved in the \nexchange would be determined based on national appraisal standards. \nWhile the BLM thinks the Federal lands are 5 to 10 times greater in \nvalue than the State lands, the State of Utah thinks the State lands, \nagain captured within wilderness areas, are greater in value than the \nFederal lands. That is why the notion of a value, determined by \nrecognized appraisers, and negotiated between the two parties, appears \nthe soundest methodology to reconcile these differences. It does not \nmatter, really, what either side is saying right now on the value \nquestion--it will be determined at a later time.\n  The universe of lands to be exchanged has been determined. Since the \nState of Utah has no choice at all to determine which lands it would \ntrade to the Federal Government, it only makes sense to allow the State \nto determine which Federal lands it desires. It has identified 25 \ndifferent parcels, ranging form speculative coal deposits to \nspeculative natural gas to potential real estate development, and all \nin the name of benefiting Utah's school children.\n  The Senator is not correct. The Federal Government does not have to \napprove the transaction. Once the State makes an offer of lands to be \nexchanged, the two parties will sit down\n\n[[Page S2923]]\n\nand conduct ``good faith'' negotiations on the various aspects of the \ntrade. If a mutual decision is not reached, then the matter can be \npursued in the courts.\n  Concern was expressed regarding our earlier language about the lack \nof involvement by the Secretary in crafting each exchange. I believe \nthe language we have included in the substitute amendment remedies that \nsituation and makes the Secretary a full player in this exchange should \nhe desire to be involved.\n  And finally, the Senator indicated that our proposal contains ``broad \nexceptions to the Wilderness Act of 1964,'' meaning he believes we are \nrewriting the definition of wilderness by allowing certain activities \nand facilities to be undertaken within designated wilderness areas.\n  This criticism goes to the so-called special management directives \ncontained in our proposal.\n  These special provisions really are not that special after all. There \nare plenty of examples of previous public lands legislation containing \nsuch provisions.\n  A Congressional Research Service report, completed last July, \nconcluded that the directives in S. 884 are comparable or related to \nsimilar language in 20 existing public laws and over 40 separate \nstatutes adopted by Congress since 1978.\n  What do these special management directives do? They allow those \nactivities, based on valid existing rights and consistent with the \nWilderness Act of 1964, to continue in areas designated as wilderness. \nThey are included to address the potential ``on-the-ground'' conflicts \nthat are unique to Utah's BLM lands, such as livestock grazing, the \ngathering of wood by Native Americans, and the presence of water \nfacilities used for agricultural, municipal, and wildlife purposes, to \nname a few.\n  The critical point here is that these rights predate the designation \nof land as wilderness.\n  We are not rewriting the definition of wilderness. On the contrary, \nwe are merely adhering to the principles of the 1964 Wilderness Act and \nthe history of wilderness legislation in the past two decades. The \nWilderness Act of 1964 does not abandon or ignore rights that predate \nwilderness designation, and practically every wilderness bill passed \nsince the late 1970's contains special language to protect these rights \nand to address any site specific conflicts that might arise in the \nexercise of these rights.\n  This language enables us to designate certain lands as wilderness \nthat might be otherwise excluded under the 1964 act due to the conflict \nwith valid existing rights.\n  But I would ask the Senator the following questions regarding his \nconcerns for our special management directives.\n  Where was he when we passed the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge \nWilderness Act, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act, and the \nFlorida Wilderness Act of 1984 that provided for the continued use of \nmotorized boats or other watercraft in designated areas?\n  Where was he when we passed the already mentioned Boundary Waters \nCanoe Area Wilderness Act that provided for the continuation of \nsnowmobile use in designated areas?\n  Where was he when we passed the Central Idaho Wilderness Act of 1980 \nthat allowed the continued landing of aircraft and the future \nconstruction and maintenance of small hydroelectric generators, \ndomestic water facilities, and related facilities in designated areas?\n  Where was he when we passed the Endangered American Wilderness Act of \n1978 and our own Utah Wilderness Act of 1984 providing for sanitary \nfacilities in designated areas?\n  Where was he when we passed the Colorado Wilderness Act of 1980 \nallowing motorized access for periodic maintenance and repair of a \ntransmission line ditch in a designated area?\n  And, where was he when we passed the Colorado Wilderness Act of 1993 \nproviding for the use, operation, maintenance, repair, modification, or \nreplacement of existing water resources facilities located in \ndesignated areas?\n  The point is not to single out any of these laws for they did or did \nnot do, but to merely demonstrate that special management directives \nare designed to address the on-the-ground conflicts unique to the areas \ndesignated by these laws. That is what we are providing for in our \nbill--those situations that are unique to Utah's lands. It is, as my \ncolleagues will note, typical of the way we have developed public land \npolicy in this body.\n  I would also state for the record two other items.\n  One, the Senator continues to mention the provision in our bill that \nprovides for the continued use of motorboat activities in designated \nareas. First, these activities are only allowed if they predate the \ndesignation. And, second, and most importantly, our language was \nmodified in the committee to ensure that it was consistent with the \n1964 act.\n  Also, he spoke of the language in our bill permitting low-level \nmilitary overflights. Let me remind the Senator that this language was \nprovided to us by the Pentagon, and is nearly identical to similar \nlanguage included in the California Desert Act. We have added language \nrequested by the Air Force that recognizes Hill Air Force Base as the \ngateway to the Utah Test and Training Range, located in Utah's west \ndesert area, that is the only training facility in the United States on \nwhich every aircraft in the Air Force inventory trains.\n  In closing, let me also say that our bill has been characterized as \nlacking large blocks of designated wilderness through which a traveler \ncould wander from one time zone to another. Well, in our bill we may \nnot extend any wilderness area beyond the mountain time zone, but it \ndoes have several large contiguous areas of spectacular wilderness all \nlinked together in huge blocks of land. A visitor could never see \nanother human being for days in these areas.\n  These areas include:\n  Desolation Canyon in central eastern Utah, through which the Green \nRiver flows--a total of 291,130 acres. This area may not cross any time \nzones, but it is located in three different counties.\n  Fiftymile Mountain in south central Utah--as mentioned, this is on \nthe Kaiparowits Plateau and consists of 125,823 acres.\n  North Escalante Canyons--this area, once pursued to become a national \npark, totals 101,896 total acres.\n  Book Cliffs--this area so appropriately named is a showcase of \ntopography and wildlife, and consists of 132,714 acres, all of which is \nlocated in Grand County, UT.\n  And, last but certainly not least is the San Rafael Complex--located \nin the heart of central eastern Utah and a topographer's dreamland, \nthis area consists of 193,384 acres.\n  If one looks at where some of the other areas designated by or bill \nare located, you will note that many of them are located near some of \nUtah's national parks to form blankets of pristine wilderness, such as \nthe area near Canyonlands National Park, Capitol Reef National Park, \nand Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.\n  Our legislation truly captures Utah's crown jewels of BLM lands, \nincluding high mountain ranges, deep river canyons, and red rock \ndeserts. These are all reflective of Utah's premier scenic landscapes, \nand why we in Utah are not shy in stating that it took God 6 days to \ncreate Utah before he made the rest of the world with leftover parts.\n  Again, I urge the Senator from New Jersey to take another careful \nlook at the facts and at the specific language in the substitute \namendment. I think he will find reassurances there that this is a good \nbill for Utah and a good bill for the environment.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to this now for the past 3 days. I \nadmire my friend from New Jersey. He is a fine person. He represents \nhis State well.\n  But, he does not know anything about Utah. However, I happen to think \nthat the Governor of Utah, both Senators, all three Congress people, \nvirtually everybody in the State legislature, everybody in the PTA, \nschool districts across the State, and 300 Democrat and Republican \nleaders, political leaders, know just a little bit better, just a \nlittle bit more, about Utah than the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey.\n  I have heard about all I can bear to hear about silence and time, and \nhaving respect for them. We understand that. In Utah, we know what \nsilence and time is because we have experienced them throughout our \nentire\n\n[[Page S2924]]\n\nState. However, you do not get much silence and time in all of that \nlow-lying sagebrush land along the highways which the other side has \ntried to put into this bill. They do not even know what wilderness is. \nWe do. We have plenty of it in Utah. We put through the 800,000-acre \nForest Service bill in 1984. I was a major mover on that bill. It has \nbeen a very good bill. We did it because Utahns agreed on what should \nbe done. We love our State.\n  To hear this, you would think that 20 million acres is going to be \nripped up for shopping centers. The fact is that every one of those 20 \nmillion acres will be subject to all environmental laws, and rightly \nso, as far as we are concerned. But on this 20 million acres, you might \nbe able to ride a bicycle, if you want to, which you cannot do in \nwilderness.\n  Let me just say this. I have gone all over Little Grand Canyon. I \nhave been all over the Black Box; Dirty Devil, and Sam's Mesa; North \nEscalante Canyons; San Rafael Swell; Book Cliff; Sid's Canyon; \nDesolation Canyon--beautiful areas that we put into this wilderness \nbill. Without this wilderness bill, they will not be wilderness. We \nthink they ought to be.\n  This business that we allow dams in this bill is misleading--they are \nnot there.\n  The polling data show that the majority of Utahns are for this bill, \nand once you explain to people in the polls that wilderness means no \nmechanization whatsoever, the support for those on the other side who \nare for 5.7 million acres drops off dramatically. But the majority are \nfor our bill.\n  With regard to the value of lands to be exchanged, that is going to \nbe negotiated under this bill. Nobody is going to rip off the Federal \nGovernment. But our school kids are dependent upon this bill, which is \nwhy we will negotiate the value of these school trust lands.\n  With regard to water, the Secretary can acquire water rights in the \nState through the State appropriation process. Can he not do that?\n  With regard to the release language, there is no binding of a future \nCongress whatsoever in this bill. If they want to do wilderness, they \ncan do wilderness in Utah again. But they are going to have an uphill \nbattle because people in Utah are tired of being pushed around.\n  With regard to the special management directives, I would say to my \ncolleague that every major wilderness bill since 1978 has contained \nsimilar directives to take care of conflicts. We provide for that as \nwell. On-the-ground conflicts have to be resolved, and over 20 separate \nbills passed by this body in the past two decades have done that. This \nis not something new.\n  We have used the public process here. This matter has gone through \ntwo decades, hundreds of meetings, $10 million, and brought people \ntogether all over the State. The affected counties did not want any \nwilderness--zero. Then they agreed to 1 million acres. We brought them \nup to 2 million acres. The other side wants 5.7 million. One group \nwants 16 million acres in wilderness. The fact is we have 100 percent \nmore acreage in this bill than the affected counties want, and about 60 \npercent less than what these people on the other extreme want. That is \nwhat compromise is all about.\n\n  The fact of the matter is that this process has not been politicized. \nThe Clinton administration came in and suddenly their BLM people \nstarted to decry all of the work that had been done through the years \nby other BLM people, and which was done in a reasonable and good way. \nThey have politicized this process. There are volumes and volumes of \ndata. The environmentalists have a 400-page book. We put the volumes \nand volumes of data here--two huge stacks this high--to show what we \nhave gone through.\n  Have most of these people who are criticizing this bill even been to \nthese places? The fact is most of them have not been there.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have put the crown jewels of Utah \nwilderness in this bill. I happen to believe that when you have the \nwhole congressional delegation, the Governor, the legislature, the \nschools, the farmers, and virtually every organization except these \nenvironmental extreme organizations, all for this bill in a State that \nhas protected its beauty itself, we do not need to be told by some \nSenator from New Jersey how to protect our State--or from any other \nState. We know how to do it. We know it is beautiful, and we are going \nto keep it that way, even while it is subject to these environmental \nlaws.\n  It is almost offensive what has been going on here. If you look at \nwhat they are recommending--these low-lying sagebrush lands along \nhighways--where is the silence and solitude there? It is crazy.\n  When we start ignoring our colleagues who have gone through a process \nin this manner in a reasonable, decent, honorable way, having had to \nbring the one side along and having had to bring the other side along--\nand, now we are going to ignore all this because we want to do some \nnational environmental agenda? That is when this particular body is \ngoing to have a lot of troubles in the future. That is all I can say. I \nyield the floor.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in response to the minority leader's \nunanimous-consent request, obviously we are all sensitive to the merits \nof the Presidio. The California delegation has worked very, very hard \non this. But as everyone in this body knows, this was a package that \nwas put together with great commitment and great understanding that, \nindeed, in order for it to pass the Congress, it had to stay as a \npackage.\n  Everybody knew that when we went in, and to suggest action by the \nU.S. Senate would be acceptable to the House everyone knows is \nunrealistic. So we are set with the reality here.\n  It is the intention of myself, as chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, to again pursue the package. It is the largest \nsingle environmental package that has come before the 104th Congress. \nWe are all disappointed at the action that was taken by adding on the \nminimum wage amendment, but that was something seen fit by the minority \nto do, and we are left with this reality today, which is, indeed, \nunfortunate.\n  It is my intention to continue to pursue working with the Members who \nobjected to the various aspects of the package, to try to continue to \npursue it, in this legislative year. That is the pledge I want to make \nto the minority and the minority leader as well.\n  I want everybody to understand the rationale behind the objection. \nThis would not have gone in the House as a freestanding Presidio bill. \nEverybody is aware of it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just say, the vote just cast had \nnothing to do with minimum wage. It had everything to do with simply \none provision dealing with Utah wilderness. There was no understanding \nwith regard to this package, as the distinguished Senator from Alaska \nhas called it.\n  Obviously, each one of these bills merits consideration in and of its \nown right. There is no objection to the package were we to remove the \nUtah wilderness bill. That is the issue. That is what this vote was all \nabout. But there is no disagreement whatsoever with regard to the \nPresidio bill on either side of the aisle, as I understand it, and to \nhold the Presidio hostage to all the other issues seems to me to be \nunfair.\n  I yield to the Senator from California for a brief comment and a \nquestion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I do have a question. I have a comment as well. To \nmy friend, Senator Murkowski, who has worked hard, along with Members \non both sides of the aisle here, the fact is the House has passed the \nPresidio as a freestanding bill.\n\n  Indeed, that is the bill we have marked up. So there is not any \nreason not to pass the Presidio as a freestanding bill. I would ask my \nleader on the Democratic side, since he is a cosponsor of the Presidio \nbill which Senator Feinstein and I have worked so hard on, and as well \nas Senator Dole, he is a sponsor of the Presidio bill, will my leader \ngive us his word that he will do all that he can to make this bill a \nreality? Because I would say to my friends on both sides, the Presidio \nis deteriorating? We need to get in there and make sure that that land \nis kept up. It is a priceless jewel. And we have such broad agreement. \nIt just seems a pity that we would catch it up in these other debates.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I answer to my friend from California in the \naffirmative. It is our desire to work with the delegation of California \nand others who are interested in maintaining the historic nature of \nthis remarkable facility, that we pass the legislation this year. In \nhas been a long, long effort, a tireless effort on the part of my two \ncolleagues from California.\n  I hope we can successfully complete our work this year. It ought not \nbe held hostage to very controversial legislation that has nothing to \ndo with the Presidio itself. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues of a fact \nthat in the package there were about 53 individual items. The package \nwas held up almost a year by a Member on the other side who refused to \nallow the individual issues to come up for action. That is a fact, and \nthe Record will reflect that. Now we are faced with the reality of who \nis to blame for the failure of the package. I think the Record will \nreflect the reality that this was well on its way to successful \nconsideration of cloture prior to the decision by the other side to put \nthe minimum wage on it, which changed the complexion and the \ninterpretation of the last vote. Many Members looked upon the last vote \nin actuality as a reference to support for the minimum wage and that it \ndid not belong there. We all know it.\n  So the responsibility has to be with the minority that chose to allow \nand support inclusion of the minimum wage on the largest environmental \npackage of this session, the 104th Congress. That is, indeed, \nunfortunate. Let us be realistic and recognize where the responsibility \nlay. It lay in holding that package hostage for a year and it lay with \nthe responsibility of putting the minimum wage on it. I thank the Chair \nand thank the leader.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I understand it is all right with the \nDemocratic leader if I obtain a consent agreement on the farm bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me do that while we also work out a time agreement on \nthe line-item veto.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S2925-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2925-S2926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nwill only again point out to my colleague from Alaska that we would \nenter into a unanimous-consent agreement today for all of the package \nthe Senator from Alaska referred to except the Utah wilderness. We will \ndo it this morning. We can pass that bill by 11:15. It is now 11:14. So \nif the Senator from Alaska is prepared to drop the one controversial \nbill we will enter into an agreement today, unanimous-consent \nagreement, passing all the rest. If he is prepared to do that, I am \nprepared to do that right now.\n  But I have no objection to the request propounded by the majority \nleader having to do with the farm bill conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me add my hope that we can resolve the \nproblem. I know there are a number of projects, including the Presidio, \nthat I support, and hopefully this will--now and then we get things \nresolved around here. Maybe we can do this in the next few days. But we \nwould like to in the interim, if we could, do the line-item veto and \nthe farm bill conference report. That will give us some time, if there \nis any negotiating opportunities, to do that. It is also my hope that \nwe can have a time agreement on the line-item veto. I understand that \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, would like \nus to at least proceed and then perhaps enter into a time agreement a \nbit later.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is my understanding, Mr. President, that is correct, \nthe Senator from West Virginia is prepared at some point to enter into \na time agreement. We assume he will be on the floor shortly, and we can \ndiscuss the matter with him at that time.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate on this side of the aisle, \nfor the present time the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, \nwill be the manager in charge of the time on this side for the line-\nitem veto.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, notwithstanding the unanimous-consent \nagreement, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak for 2 \nminutes on the cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Mr. President, I want to echo what our distinguished \nminority leader has said. There are over 50 pieces of parks or public \nlands legislation in the bill on which we just refused to invoke \ncloture. I have two pieces of legislation in that package that are very \nimportant to me. I received no pleasure in voting against cloture and \nknowing that I have to start all over again moving those two bills.\n  I do not mind telling you this is a lousy way to legislate. It is \nlike hanging a Damocles sword over your head by saying, ``If you will \nvote for these 52 goodies, you are going to have to choke this bad one \ndown too''; 49 Senators said they were not willing to do that.\n  They are all good pieces of legislation. If we want to sit here and \ntalk about who had holds on those bills over the past few months, or \nthe minimum wage bill, that is fine. However, that does not solve \nanything. As the minority leader stated, within 30 seconds we can pass \nmore than 50 bills, 100 to zip, by simply removing the Utah wilderness \nbill.\n  Having said that, let me also say these things are no fun. Nobody has \nmore respect for the two Senators from Utah than I do. Senator Bennett \nand I have worked together for endless hours trying to reform the \nconcessions policies of the National Park System.\n  Therefore, it is not easy for me to filibuster and require a cloture \nvote on something that is so important to the Senators from Utah. But \nthere are times, regardless of how close a friend you may be and how \nmuch respect you may have for another Senator, that you have to stand \nup for something you really feel is critically important. Perhaps the \nmajority leader and the minority leader could sit down with the Senator \nfrom Alaska, who is chairman of our committee, and with Secretary \nBabbitt.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. And come back to this floor and do something very \nresponsible that would be very pleasing to the people of this country. \nIf the people of our country saw the Democrats and the Republicans \njoining hands, to pass more than 50 pieces of legislation in a \nbipartisan spirit, everyone in America would applaud. I promise you it \nwould lift the morale of the country ever so slightly.\n  We ought to do it, and we certainly ought to do it before we check \nout of here tonight. I want to sit down with the two Senators from \nUtah. As I have suggested, perhaps the majority and minority leaders \ncan participate along with the chairman and ranking member of the \nEnergy Committee, and Secretary Babbitt and work on the Utah wilderness \nbill. I would like to get that contentious item off of the calendar.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I agree.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. People operating in good faith around here can do it. I \nam very pleased with the outcome of the cloture vote. I want my \ncolleagues from Utah to know they are my friends. I hope we can work \nsomething out with regards to this legislation. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, do I need unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute on the subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleagues for their patience.\n  I just feel for some of us here in the Senate, particularly the two \nSenators from California, feel it is an awfully difficult situation \nwhen you have worked so long and hard and you have built up the kind of \nbipartisan support that we have for the Presidio, from the majority \nleader, to the minority leader, to Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, who \nliterally came in and saved the thing, to Senator Bumpers for being \nthere for us through all the ups and downs of this battle, and to see \nit all come down in a crashing blow because of another issue, is \nawfully difficult for all of us.\n\n  I do hope that we can work something out on Utah wilderness, either \nby saying that it will come up in another context on its own--it does \ndeserve the attention on its own. I support what Senator Bumpers \nrecommended, which is a high-powered meeting with the Senators \nthemselves, a high-powered meeting to sit down with those who have \ntaken such an interest in this, Senator Bradley and others, to try and \nresolve these differences and these problems.\n  I just want to say that we have a crown jewel of a national park in \nthe Presidio, but if we do not quickly set up a trust and get to work \nmaking sure that there is upkeep, that the buildings are put to good \nand proper use, and that the income from those buildings go to repair \nthe facilities and keep them pristine, we will lose this priceless \njewel. I do not think anyone wants that to happen.\n  I was very pleased that Senator Daschle made a unanimous-consent \nrequest to pass Presidio on its own, because I think that we need to \nkeep coming back to that point. There is no controversy there. I was \nheartened by the majority leader's comments that he is going to do what \nhe can to make it happen. The clock is ticking on this priceless jewel. \nI hope we can reach across party lines as we did when we gained all the \nsupport to solve the\n\n[[Page S2927]]\n\nUtah wilderness problem, pass this bill, without that attached to it.\n  I think we could all go home as Republicans and Democrats and be \nproud of what we have done. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support the comments of my colleague \non the Presidio. I have lived all my life one block from the Presidio. \nI know it well. The Presidio bill is predicated on something that is \nunique. It is a private-public partnership whereby the more than 500 \nhistoric buildings and the additional buildings would be leased out, \nwith a hope that over a 15-year-period it would be able to make public \nareas of the Presidio self-supporting.\n  Having said this, I am hopeful that every Member of this body could \nrealize the longer it takes to get a bill, the more in jeopardy that \nplan becomes. Because of the rains, because of the fact that many of \nthese buildings are now boarded up, they are subject to intrusion, to \nvandalism; they are subject to the absence of an adequate policing \nauthority on that 1,500-acre post. The Presidio, by each day of delay, \nis placed in jeopardy.\n\n  I am also hopeful, and I address these remarks to the distinguished \nmajority leader, that he would be willing to become a party to \nnegotiations which I think can go on, on the subject of the Utah \nwilderness, so that we might be able to get an agreement that would be \nsatisfactory to the two Senators from Utah, as well. I think it is \npossible. I think that every area is not the same as Yellowstone or \nYosemite. They have certain unique characteristics which need to have \nattention, as well.\n  I am hopeful, Mr. Leader, that in the ensuing days, perhaps under \nyour auspice, there might be negotiations which could be carried out. \nAt least we should try and see if we cannot get some agreement which \ncan either enable the package to move ahead as a package, or enable the \nPresidio, something which my colleague just said, does have unanimous \nconsent in this body, to move ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am happy to indicate for the record that I \nwould be pleased to try to be helpful in an effort to resolve the \ndifferences. Obviously, the one big difference is the Utah wilderness \nprovision. The other projects, I understand, are not particularly \ncontroversial. I indicate that I am happy to be of help, or to take the \nleadership and try to bring people together. I have already spoken \nbriefly to the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski. It \nis the hope in the next few days we can make some progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S2926-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       LEGISLATIVE LINE-ITEM VETO ACT OF 1995--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. DOLE.

He did, I \nthink, a magnificent job in reconciling the differences that we had on \nthis side of the aisle.\n\n  I also want to thank the Senators from Alaska and New Mexico who \nobviously have a very deep and abiding interest, given their \nresponsibilities as chairmen of the respective committees. Again, I \nalso thank you for your leadership in making this nearly come to \nreality.\n  I understand that Senator Byrd will have certain motions to be made \non this issue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before we enter into the time agreement, \nwhile Senator McCain and Senator Coats are on the floor, I want to \ncongratulate them. This has been a long and arduous effort on both \ntheir parts. They have been single minded and resourceful about wanting \nto get line-item veto in as part of the legislation that Congress \npassed, and pass on some additional authority to the President.\n  I think the bill we have come up with, while there are some \ncompromises from their original stand and certainly some from the \noriginal stand of the bill that left the Senate floor, I think we have \na good bill. I think history is going to be made some time before too \nlate in the evening, and it will be passed here in the Senate.\n  I think it is a well-rounded bill. It is a little broader than the \noriginal concept of line-item veto, but overall, I extend my hearty \ncongratulation and most sincere feelings to them about their efforts, \nthe two Senators who have led this cause.\n  I also want to comment on what our distinguished whip did. I want to \nsay thanks to Senator Lott. It was not as easy as some think to put \nthis together. He brought us together. I want to thank our \ndistinguished majority leader because he actually said to the whip, \n``Let's get it done.'' Our distinguished whip takes that kind of a \nchallenge as a serious one, and it did not take too long for us to get \nthe job done.\n  With that, until Senator Byrd arrives, unless someone else wants the \nfloor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk \nproceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Snowe from \nMaine wants to address the Senate with reference to the death of \nSenator Muskie.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I will take just a moment of the \nSenate's time to prepare for a general debate. I ask unanimous consent \nthat I may proceed for 4 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S2927-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2927-S2928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE EPA STUDY ON ACID RAIN\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, New York State, or upstate New York, has \nbeen shocked--I think that is a fair term--and finds itself in near \ndisbelief to learn that the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] has \nclosed the Ithaca station, which is part of a broad network of \nmonitoring stations that collect data critical to understanding the \nimpact of acid rain on the Adirondack Preserve. There is little enough \ninstitutional memory around Washington, but one should think the EPA \nwould know that the concern about acid rain began with the \ndisappearance of trout from a number of lakes in the higher \nAdirondacks. This was a puzzle and, in the end, it was resolved by a \nfish biologist at Cornell University, Dr. Carl Scofield, who traced the \ncycle: acid rain caused by increasingly acidified air released aluminum \nfrom the granite surrounding the lakes. That aluminum leached into the \nlakes and was absorbed into fish gills. The fish died.\n  In 1980, I obtained approval of legislation--the Acid Precipitation \nAct--which was based on a bill I introduced here in the Congress the \nyear before. My bill was incorporated as title VII into the Energy \nSecurity Act of 1980--Public Law 96-294--and directed the EPA to study, \nover a 10-year period, just what was going on--not to panic, not to go \nscreaming to high Heaven that the skies were opening with awful \nsubstances that would burn holes in our children's heads, and things \nlike that--but just to say, ``What is this?''\n\n[[Page S2928]]\n\n Some longitudinal work obviously was in order. The effort was to last \nfor 10 years, at $5 million per year.\n  During the Reagan administration, as demand for action grew and \nknowledge was needed, money was collected from research budgets around \nthe country, such that our project, in the end, became a half-billion \ndollar research project, the largest of its kind. We ended up knowing \nmore about this subject than any of the other industrialized nations. \nIt is a real enough subject, but if our understanding of it is to \nprogress confidently, we need more data, such as can be collected by \nnormal scientific inquiry.\n  In the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments--Public Law 101-549--we made the \nbest use we could of our research on the subject. We called for large \nreductions in emissions in the Middle West. Winds blow those emissions \ntoward the Adirondacks, of course. And just to see that we continued \nalong this track, as the then-ranking member of the Committee on the \nEnvironment and Public Works--in the conference committee on the bill--\nI included certain provisions. One was designed so that the lay person \ncould understand what was going on. The provision directed the EPA to \ncompile and provide a registry of acidified lakes. Now, in Florida, \nthat could be all lakes, of course; but it would not be in Pennsylvania \nor in New York. With the registry, over time, we would see how many \nlakes were being added, how many were being subtracted; how might we \nmeasure, essentially, the effect of our legislation? That has not been \ndone.\n  I asked for other research measures in law, in statute, that have not \nbeen followed. And now the EPA has the arrogance and the insolence and \nthe stupidity to close the research facility at the site where this \nwhole subject was first understood, brought to national attention, and \nwas addressed with national legislation.\n  Mr. President, I regret to say this, but I hope the administrator is \nhearing. I am not surprised that persons are calling for the abolition \nof the Environmental Protection Agency. If it will not obey the law, \nand if it will not follow elemental common sense, do we in fact need \nit, or is it an obstacle to the environmental concerns we share?\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning business \nfor 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MUSKIE\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with a heart full of sadness, \nreflection, and fond memories of one of the true giants of this \ninstitution--former Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine.\n  Like millions of Americans across the country, I awoke Tuesday to the \nnews of Ed Muskie's passing. My heart goes out to his wonderful wife, \nJane, their five children, grandchildren, and the entire Muskie family. \nI hope that their grief is tempered with the knowledge that their loss \nis shared by a Nation grateful for the life of a man who gave so much.\n  Like many other Members of this body, upon hearing the news, I found \nmyself looking back on the remarkable career and lasting legacy of this \nfirst son of Maine who became one of the legendary figures in American \npolitical life.\n  Ed Muskie was a gentle lion. He sought consensus, but backed down \nfrom no one. He fought for what he believed in, and was loyal to his \ncountry. His greatest goal was to leave this Earth a better place for \ngenerations of Americans to come. And he succeeded.\n  Mr. President, as every citizen of my home State knows, Ed Muskie \ntransformed the political landscape of Maine. Before he was elected \nGovernor in 1954, Ed was fond of saying ``the Democrats in Maine could \ncaucus in a telephone booth.'' Well, much to the chagrin of some \nRepublicans, Ed Muskie's election as Governor changed all that. He was \nliterally the creator of the modern Democratic Party in Maine. After \ntwo 2-year terms as Governor, he went on to become the very first \npopularly elected Democratic Senator in Maine's history. And \nultimately, his distinguished career culminated in his service to this \nNation as Secretary of State.\n  But of all the positions he held in public service, it was here--as a \nMember of this institution, Mr. President, that Ed Muskie left his most \nindelible mark on history.\n  Whenever Washington gets mired down in partisan battles, I think of \nthe example set by Senator Muskie and his Republican colleague, the \nlate Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who died last year. They worked \ntogether across party lines on behalf of the people of Maine and the \nNation. Although they may have had differences, they were united in \ntheir dedication to public service and to reaching consensus. They \nrepresented the best of what bipartisanship has to offer.\n  In our present-day budget battles, I think of Senator Muskie, who \nhelped shape the modern budget process as the first-ever chairman of \nthe Budget Committee. Ed possessed a rare wisdom and discipline which \nallowed him to express in very simple terms why it is so difficult to \nachieve fiscal responsibility in the Congress. ``Members of Congress,'' \nhe once said ``have won reelection with a two-part strategy: Talk like \nScrooge on the campaign trail, and vote like Santa Claus on the Senate \nfloor.''\n  Ed brandished that incisive wit many times in this very Chamber, Mr. \nPresident, and perhaps it was this humor, along with his commonsense \napproach to political life, that made Ed Muskie so effective throughout \nhis remarkable career.\n  During his 21 years in the Senate, Ed Muskie was known for his \nmoderation but he did not hesitate to tangle with his colleagues when \nhe felt passionately about an issue. His reputation as a fighter was \nestablished early in his Senatorial career when he went head-to-head \nwith another giant of this body, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson.\n  One day, as the story goes, the freshman Senator from Maine decided \nhe just could not support the majority leader on a particular issue. \nNow, crossing the leader of your party is always risky, but that risk \ntook on added significance when the leader was Lyndon Baines Johnson. \nBut possessing a stubborn streak of downeast yankee independence that \nperhaps only a fellow Mainer can understand, Ed held his ground. He \nwould not give in.\n  So, in his typically forgiving--and nonvindictive--way, LBJ promptly \nassigned the freshman Senator his fourth, fifth, and sixth committee \nchoices.\n  From this rather dubious beginning, Ed Muskie landed a seat on the \nnot-so-choice Public Works Committee. The rest, as they say, is \nhistory. It did not take him long to leave his mark on Washington--or \non the land that stretches from the Allagash Wilderness of Maine, to \nthe Florida Everglades, to the Redwood forests of California.\n\n  You see, growing up in western Maine, Ed had developed a deep \nappreciation for the environment. Thoroughly committed and visionary, \nSenator Muskie helped transform the Public Works Committee and went on \nto become the founding father of environmental protection in America by \nsponsoring both the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act of 1972. \nThese two landmark pieces of legislation have both produced enormous \nbenefits to the health and well-being of our Nation and its people. It \nis his unwavering commitment to environmental protection that is, \nperhaps, Ed Muskie's single greatest legacy to the American people. He \nwas indeed Mr. Clean.\n  With the news of his passing, my thoughts went back almost 2 years \nago to the day--because Ed Muskie's birthday is March 28--when Ed and \nJane Muskie, accompanied by their children and grandchildren, came to \ncelebrate Ed's 80th birthday at the Blaine House, Maine's executive \nmansion, as the guests of my husband Gov. Jock McKernan and me. It was \na great privilege for us to give Ed and Jane and their family an \nopportunity to come back to a place that held some of their fondest \nmemories. It was a very special time for all of us. And they spent the \nnight. It was a truly honorable moment in my life.\n  That evening, Ed spoke passionately about the opportunities he \nenjoyed as a young man, and of the commitment\n\n[[Page S2929]]\n\nand dedication that his parents had to their family and their \ncommunity. And he spoke of the love and devotion that his father--a \nPolish immigrant--had for his new Nation.\n  He spoke of how much his roots in the small town of Rumford, ME, \nmeant to him. It was those deep roots, along with his strong sense of \nfamily, that gave Ed Muskie the foundation upon which he would stand as \nhe became a leading figure in American political life. And he cherished \nhis father's roots, and from the standpoint that he viewed it as \nAmerica giving every opportunity to anybody who sought to achieve.\n  I was struck with a very real sense of history listening to his \nreminiscences during that visit. I do not think it is possible for any \nMaine politician, regardless of party affiliation, to have come of age \nduring the Muskie era and not have been influenced in some way by his \npresence. He was that preeminent in the political life of my State.\n  Ed Muskie was a towering figure in every sense of the word. In his \nphysical stature, in his intellect, in his presence on Capitol Hill, in \nthe extent of his impact on the political life of Maine, and in the \nintegrity he brought to bear in everything he did.\n  And Ed was thoroughly and proudly a Mainer, with the quiet sense of \nhumor associated with our State. Each year, the distinguished senior \nSenator entertained guests at the Maine State Society lobster dinner at \nthe National Press Club by rubbing the belly of a live lobster, causing \nit to fall asleep, something only a real Mainer would know how to do.\n  Personally, I will always remember and be grateful for the warmth, \nfriendship, and encouragement that Ed Muskie gave me over the years. \nWhen I entered the U.S. House of Representatives in 1979, I was the \nnewest member of the Maine congressional delegation. Ed was the dean of \nthe delegation. We were congressional colleagues for only a year and a \nhalf, but our friendship lasted throughout the years. And when I was \nelected to the seat which he had held with such distinction, I was \ntouched by his kindness, and grateful for his advice and counsel.\n  Throughout his life, he never failed to answer the call of duty. He \nanswered the call from the people of Maine * * * He answered the call \nfrom America's rivers and streams * * * And he answered a call from the \nPresident of the United States and a worried Nation when Senator Muskie \nbecame Secretary of State Muskie in a moment of national crisis.\n  Mr. President, 75 years before Edmund Muskie was born, another famous \nMainer, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, captured what I believe is the \nessence of the wonderful man we remember today. Longfellow wrote:\n\n     Lives of great men all remind us\n     we can make our lives sublime,\n     And, departing, leave behind us\n     footprints on the sands of time.\n\n  Ed Muskie's footprints remain on those sands. They are there as a \nguide for those of us who would follow in his path. They are big \nfootprints, not easily filled. But we would all do well to try.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think we are still waiting for the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd. And \nwhile we wait, I would like to ask consent that I be permitted to speak \nfor 5 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S2928-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FORMER SENATOR ED MUSKIE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I cannot speak about Senator Ed Muskie \nwith the depth of knowledge that Senator Snowe had of his background \nand his impact on his beloved State of Maine. But it has fallen to me \nto be, at every stage of my growth in the Senate, on a committee with \nSenator Muskie.\n  My first assignment was the Public Works Committee. I was the most \njunior Republican, and Senator Muskie was the third-ranking Democrat \nand chaired the Subcommittee on the Environment. I also served on that \nsubcommittee. I saw in him a man of tremendous capability and \ndedication when he undertook a cause. He learned everything there was \nto learn about it, and he proceeded with that cause with the kind of \ndiligence and certainty that is not so often found around here. There \nwere various times during the evolution of clean water and clean air \nstatutes in the country that we could go in one of two directions, or \none of three. Senator Muskie weighed those heavily, and chose the \ndirection and the course that we are on now.\n  No one can deny that Senator Muskie is the chief architect of \nenvironmental cleanup of our air and water in the United States. Some \nwould argue about its regulatory processes, but there can be no \nquestion that hundreds of rivers across America are clean today because \nof Ed Muskie. There can be no doubt that our air is cleaner and safer \nand healthier because of his leadership. I really do not think any \nperson needs much more than that to be part of their legacy.\n  But essentially he took on another job, and a very, very difficult \none--to chair the Budget Committee of the U.S. Senate. Again, it fell \non me as a very young Senator to be on that committee. I have been on \nit ever since. I was fortunate to move up. He became chairman in its \nearliest days.\n  I might just say as an aside that the Chair would be interested in \nthis. When we moved the President's budget--$6 billion in those days--\nthat was a big, big thing, and we had a real battle for it. He would \ntake the Presidents--no matter which ones--on with great, great \ndetermination.\n  But I want to close by saying that one of the things I will never \nforget about him is that he saw me as a young Senator from New Mexico. \nI had a very large family. He got to meet them and know them. On a \nnumber of occasions he personally said that he would very much like to \nmake sure that we did not do things around here to discourage young \nSenators like Domenici from staying here. I think he was sincere, even \nthough I was on the Republican side. I think he saw us with an awful \nlot of feeling ourselves up here in trying to establish rules that were \nvery difficult, and he used to regularly say, ``I hope this does not \ndiscourage you. We need to keep some of you around.''\n\n  So to his wonderful family and to all of those close to him, you have \nsuffered a great loss, but I can say that his life has been a great \nlegacy for the country. That ought to lend you in these days of sorrow \na bit of consolation, because that legacy is great. Death is obviously \ninevitable. He accomplished great things before that day occurred.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S2929-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2929-S2995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       LEGISLATIVE LINE-ITEM VETO ACT OF 1995--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. What is the \npending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The conference report on the line-item veto.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, we \nhave just discussed the matter of a unanimous-consent agreement with \nSenator Byrd, and he indicated he is not prepared to enter into that \ntime agreement just now and would like to use some time and get a \nbetter feel for himself as to where we are. I have no doubts we will \nenter into a similar agreement to the one our majority leader \nindicated, but it will not be forthcoming at this point. I think that \nis fair statement.\n  Mr. President, I note in the Chamber the presence of Senator McCain. \nIt is our prerogative as proponents of the conference to lead off, and \nI wonder if he would like to make a few opening remarks, and then I \nwould make a few, and then perhaps we would yield the floor to Senator \nByrd for his opening remarks.\n  Since there is no time agreement at this point, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \neverything he has done on this issue. The Senator from New Mexico has \nbeen around here for a long time and is fully appreciative of the \nmagnitude of what we are about to do. He also has been one who \ncontinuously has sought to\n\n[[Page S2930]]\n\nimprove and to make more efficient, and indeed constitutional, this \neffort, and I am grateful for his continued support.\n  I also appreciate the very tough and very cogent arguments that he \nmade while we were arriving at this compromise which I think will \nprevail today. I never underestimate the persuasive powers of the \nSenator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd]. I know he will come forward with \na very strong and compelling and constitutionally and historically \nbased argument against what we are trying to do today. I will listen as \nalways with attention and respect.\n  Mr. President, 1 year ago, the Senate began consideration of S. 4, \nlegislation to give the President line-item veto authority. Ten years \nbefore that, I began my fight in the Senate to give the President this \nauthority, and 120 years before that Representative Charles Faulkner of \nWest Virginia introduced the first line-item veto bill. Hopefully, a \n120-year battle may soon be won. I would like to outline the line-item \nveto measure agreed to by the conferees. It is a good agreement and a \ngood line-item veto bill.\n\n  The conference report amends title X of the Congressional Budget \nImpoundment Control Act of 1974 to add a new part C comprising sections \n1021 through 1027. In general, part C will grant the President the \nauthority to cancel and hold any dollar amount specified in law for the \nfollowing purposes: First, to provide discretionary budget authority; \nor second, to provide new direct spending; or third, to provide limited \ntax benefits contained in any law. Congress has the authority to \ndelegate to the President the ability to cancel specific budgetary \nobligations in any particular law in order to reduce the Federal budget \ndeficit.\n  While the conference report delegates these narrow cancellation \npowers to the President, these powers are narrowly defined and provided \nwithin well-defined specific limits.\n  Under this new authority, the President may only exercise these new \ncancellation powers if the Chief Executive determines that such \ncancellation will reduce the Federal budget deficit and will not impair \nany essential Government function or harm the national interest. In \naddition, the President must make any cancellations within 5 days of \nthe enactment of the law which contains the items to be canceled and \nmust notify the Congress by transmittal of a special message within \nthat time.\n  The conference report specifically requires that a bill or joint \nresolution be signed into law prior to any cancellations from that act. \nThis requirement ensures compliance with the constitutional \nstipulations that the President enact the underlying legislation \npresented by Congress after which specific cancellations are then \npermitted.\n  We intend that the President be able to use his cancellation \nauthority to surgically eliminate Federal budget obligations. The \ncancellation authority does not permit the President to rewrite the \nunderlying law, nor to change any provision of that law.\n  The terms ``dollar amount of discretionary budget authority,'' ``item \nof new direct spending,'' and ``limited tax benefit'' have been \ncarefully defined in order to make clear that the President may only \ncancel the entire dollar amount, the specific legal obligation to pay, \nor the specific tax benefit.\n  ``Fencing language'' may not be canceled by the President under this \nauthority. This means that the President cannot use this authority to \nmodify or alter any aspect of the underlying law, including any \nrestriction, limitation or condition on the expenditure of budget \nauthority, or any other requirement of the law.\n\n  I wish to emphasize this point again. All fencing language is fully \nprotected under this bill.\n  The lockbox provision of the conference report has also been included \nto maintain a system of checks and balances in the President's use of \nthe cancellation authority. Any credit for money canceled will be \ndedicated to deficit reduction. The lockbox requirement ensures that \nthe President does not simply cancel a particular dollar amount of \ndiscretionary budget authority, item of new direct spending, or limited \ntax benefit in order to increase spending in other areas.\n  The President's special cancellation message must be transmitted to \nthe House of Representatives and to the Senate within 5 calendar days--\nexcluding Sundays--after the President signs the underlying bill into \nlaw.\n  Such special cancellation messages must be printed in the first issue \nof the Federal Register published after the transmittal.\n  Upon receipt of the President's special message in both Houses of \nCongress, each dollar amount of discretionary budget authority, item of \nnew direct spending, or limited tax benefit included in the special \nmessage is immediately canceled. The cancellation of a dollar amount of \ndiscretionary budget authority automatically rescinds the funds. With \nrespect to an item of new direct spending or limited tax benefit, the \ncancellation renders the provision void, such that the obligation of \nthe United States has no legal force or effect.\n  Any such cancellation is reversed only if a bill disapproving the \nPresident's action is enacted.\n  The conference report provides Congress with 30 calendar days of \nsession to consider a disapproval bill under expedited procedures. A \n``calendar day of session'' is defined as only those days during which \nboth Houses of Congress are in session.\n  I wish to note that the expedited procedures provide strict time \nlimitations at all stages of floor consideration of a disapproval bill. \nThe conference report sets out procedures designed to prevent delaying \ntactics including but clearly not limited to filibuster, extraneous \namendments, repeated quorum calls, motions to recommit, or motions to \ninstruct conferees.\n  When the President's message is received, any Member may introduce a \ndisapproval bill. The form of the disapproval bill is laid out in the \nconference agreement. For a disapproval bill to qualify for expedited \nprocedures, it must be introduced no later than the fifth calendar day \nof session following receipt of the President's special message. Any \nbill introduced after the fifth day of session is subject to the \nregular rules of the two Houses.\n\n  A disapproval bill introduced in the House of Representatives must \ndisapprove all of the cancellations in the special message. There are \nno similar requirements in the Senate, except no disapproval bill may \ncontain any legislative language not germane and directly related to \nthe President's cancellation message.\n  After introduction, a disapproval bill will be referred to the \nappropriate committee or committees. Any committee or committees of the \nHouse of Representatives to which such a disapproval bill has been \nreferred shall report it without amendment, and either with or without \nrecommendation, not later than the seventh calendar day of session \nafter the date of its introduction.\n  Again, in the Senate, the committee may amend the bill, but it may \nnot offer any amendments beyond the scope of the President's message.\n  If any committee fails to report the disapproval bill within the \nrequisite time period, then the bill will be discharged from committee.\n  Procedure for consideration of the disapproval bill in the House of \nRepresentatives is noted in the conference report.\n  In the Senate, a motion to proceed to the consideration of a \ndisapproval bill is not debatable. Section 1025(e)(6), of the bill, \nprovides a 10-hour overall limitation for the floor consideration of a \ndisapproval bill. Except as specifically provided in the bill, this \nlimit on consideration is intended to cover all floor action with \nregard to a disapproval bill. This section is specifically meant to \npreclude the offering of amendments or the making of dilatory motions \nafter the expiration of the 10 hours.\n  Amendments to a disapproval bill in the Senate, whether offered in \ncommittee or from the floor, are strictly limited to those amendments \nwhich either strike or add a cancellation that is included in the \nPresident's special message. No other matter may be included in such \nbills. To enforce this restriction in the Senate, a point of order, \nwhich may be waived by a three-fifths vote, would lie against any \namendment that does anything other than strike or add a cancellation \nwithin the scope of the special message. To the extent that extraneous \nitems are added to disapproval bills, and the Senate has not\n\n[[Page S2931]]\n\nwaived the point of order against such an item, the conference report \nintends that such legislation would no longer qualify for the expedited \nprocedures.\n  In addition, should differing House and Senate disapproval bills be \npassed and the measure go to conference, the conferees must include any \nitems upon which the two Houses have agreed and may include any or all \ncancellations upon which the two Houses have disagreed, but may not \ninclude any cancellations not committed to the conference.\n  Once a disapproval bill is passed by the Congress, it is assumed the \nPresident would veto the new bill. The President would have to use his \nconstitutional veto authority to do so and could not cancel any part of \na cancellation disapproval bill. The Congress would then have to muster \na two-thirds vote to override the veto and force the President to spend \nthe money.\n  Mr. President, there was considerable debate between the two Houses \nabout exactly what the President may veto. In the original version of \nboth S. 4 and H.R. 2, the President was given enhanced rescission \nauthority. This would have allowed the President to veto any dollar \namount he saw fit to cut. Some felt this authority would give the \nPresident too much power and might result in too much power shifting to \nthe Executive. The compromise developed by the conferees returns to the \nidea of a line-item veto--in other words, the President can cancel any \nline.\n  Let me get a chart here, and demonstrate it very quickly. This is a \nchart that is very familiar to the conferees, I might add, since we \nused this during our debate and discussions.\n  The bill also allows the President to line-item veto--or cancel--new \ndirect spending provisions in law. When the President vetoes these \nprovisions, he is effectively canceling the obligation to pay the new \nbenefits.\n  The bill also allows the President to line-item veto any targeted, or \nlimited, tax benefits if those benefits effect 100 or fewer \nindividuals.\n   Mr. President, this is not the approach I would have preferred. I \nbelieve that the Senate language developed with Mr. Bradley would have \nbeen more effective. However, as we all know, compromise often must \noccur in conference. The results can be seen here.\n  As I said, I would have preferred to see this issue addressed in a \ndifferent manner, but the compromise still has teeth and will result in \nfewer special interest tax breaks and less corporate welfare.\n  Finally, the bill will become effective on January 1, 1997 or as soon \nas a balanced budget is signed into law, which ever is first. I want to \nnote that President Clinton has agreed to this effective date. The \nline-item veto would sunset in 8 years. I would hope that after 8 years \nof use, the public would realize the value of the line-item veto and we \nwould make this authority permanent. However, the sunset is included in \nthe bill to address the concerns of some Members.\n  This is the actual language from the report, which calls for \n$49,846,000 for special grants for agricultural research.\n  The report language then goes on to state specific parts of the \nspecial grants for agricultural research, for example: Wood utilization \nresearch in Oregon, Mississippi, North Carolina, Minnesota, et cetera; \nwool research in Texas, Montana, and Wyoming.\n  What the President could do is say that he does not approval of wood \nutilization research in these six States. He could line item out, out \nof the report language, this $3,758,000, thereby subtracting that \n$3,758,000 from the $49 million which is in the bill for special grants \nfor agricultural research. That is fundamentally what this line-item \nveto does. So that what is in the report language affects the original \nbill.\n  I was disappointed that the conference was not able to keep the \nFeingold-McCain emergency spending amendment. However, I have been \nassured by the staff of the Budget Committee that they would be willing \nto meet with our respective staffs and develop language to address the \nSenator from Wisconsin's and my concerns regarding this matter.\n  Mr. President, the power to line item veto is not new. Every \nPresident from Jefferson to Nixon used a similar power. The line-item \nveto power they exercised ensured that the checks and balances between \nthe congressional and executive branch remained in balance. In 1974, in \nreaction to the Presidential abuses, the Congress stripped the \nPresident of this power. Unfortunately, since that time, the Congress \nhas abused its ability to dictate how money be spent. This bill would \nrestore the checks and balances envisioned by the Founding Fathers.\n  Further, unlike impoundment power where the President could use \nappropriated money to fund his priorities over the objections of the \nCongress, this bill contains a lockbox provision as I have described. \nAny money line item vetod under this bill could be used only for \ndeficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, many have characterized this legislation as a \ndangerous ploy, not as a true budgetary reform. This is not accurate \nand does not take into account the greater picture of the dangers \npresented by our out-of-control budget process. The real danger is what \nhas happened to the administration of the American Government. \nUnnecessary and wasteful spending is threatening our national security \nand consuming resources that could better be spent on tax cuts, deficit \nreduction, or health care. I do not make the charge that wasteful \nspending threatens our national security without a great deal of \nconsideration. After last year's defense appropriations bill, it is \nunfortunately clear how dangerous this kind of spending can be to our \nnational security. It should now be clear how urgent the need for a \nline-item veto is.\n\n  At a time when thousands of men and women who volunteered to serve \ntheir country have to leave military service because of changing \npriorities and declining defense budgets, we nonetheless are able to \nfind money for billions of dollars of unnecessary spending in the \ndefense appropriation bill. At a time when we need to restructure our \nforces and manpower to meet our post-cold war military needs, we have \nsquandered billions on pointless projects with no military value.\n  Mr. President, every Congressman or Senator wants to get projects for \nhis or her district. Everyone wants not only their fair share of the \nFederal pie for their States, they want more. Therein lies the problem. \nIt is an institutional problem. I am not a saint. But we are trying to \nmake a difference. I am not here to cast aspersions on other Senators \nwho secured an unnecessary project for their States. I am not here to \nstart a partisan fight.\n  Congress created the problem and its Congress' responsibility to fix \nit. It is a Congress that has piled up a $5 trillion debt. It is a \nCongress that is responsible for over a $200 billion deficit this year. \nIt is a Congress that has miserably failed the American people. It is \nan institution that desperately needs reform.\n  Anyone who feels that the system does not need reform need only \nexamine the trend in the level of our public debt. As I stated in my \nanalysis of the most recent budget plans, the deficit has continued to \nballoon and spending continues to increase. In 1960, the Federal debt \nheld by the public was $236.8 billion. In 1970, it was $283.2 billion. \nIn 1980, it was $709.3 billion. In 1990, it was $3.2 trillion, and it \nis expected to surpass $5 trillion this year.\n  My colleagues may ask: Why is the line-item veto so important?\n  Because a President with a line-item veto could help stop this waste. \nBecause a President with a line-item veto could play an active role in \nensuring that valuable taxpayer dollars are spent effectively to meet \nour national security needs, our infrastructure needs, and other social \nneeds without pointless pork barrel spending. And the President can no \nlonger say, ``I didn't like having to spend billions on a wasteful \nproject but it was part of a larger bill I just couldn't say no to.'' \nUnder a line-item veto, no one can hide\n  According to a recent General Accounting Office study, $70 billion \ncould have been saved between 1984 and 1989, if the President had a \nline-item veto.\n  It is important because it can help reduce the deficit. It can change \nthe way Washington operates. Mr. President, we cannot turn a blind eye \nto unnecessary spending when we cannot meet the needs of our service \nmen and women. We cannot tolerate waste when Americans all over this \ncountry are experiencing economic hardship and uncertainly.\n\n[[Page S2932]]\n\n  The American public deserves better than business as usual. As their \nelected representatives we are duty bound to end the practice of \nwasteful and unnecessary spending.\n  The line-tem veto is not a means to encourage Presidential abuse, but \na means to end congressional abuse. It will give the President \nappropriate power to help control spending and reduce the deficit. To \nanyone who thinks that Congress is fully capable of policing national \nfiscal affairs, I simply bring to the Senate's attention the $3.7 \ntrillion public debt as irrefutable proof of our inability.\n  Mr. President, a determined President will not be able to balance the \nbudget with the line-item veto. But a determined President could make \nsubstantial progress toward that goal.\n  I submit that had the President been able to exercise line-item veto \nauthority over the past 10 years the fiscal condition of our Nation \nwould not be nearly as severe as it is today.\n  With that in mind, I hope the Senate would consider the following \nquote by a prescient figure in the Scottish Enlightenment, Alexander \nTytler. He stated:\n\n       A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. \n     It can exist only until a majority of voters discover that \n     they can vote themselves, largesse out of the public \n     treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for \n     the candidate who promises them the most benefit from the \n     public treasury, with the result being that democracy always \n     collapses over a loose fiscal policy.\n\n  If our debt surpasses our output, I fear that our democracy may one \nday collapse over loose fiscal policy.\n  Today is a historic day. A 120-year battle is coming to a close. The \nline-item may soon be a reality.\n  Mr. President, I want to, again, extend my respect and consideration \nand appreciation for the Senator from West Virginia, with whom I have \ndebated this issue over the last 10 years. I would like to allege I \nhave always prevailed over the Senator from West Virginia both in logic \nand in humor. I am afraid neither is the case, but I have found him to \nbe a most distinguished opponent, most learned and most dedicated to \nthe proposition to which he is committed.\n  Mr. President, I yield floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his customarily \ngracious and courteous remarks concerning me. I wish to respond in kind \nby saying that, although I adamantly oppose the measure which the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona and the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana support, and for which they have fought so long, I have only \nthe utmost respect for both of them. I think that the Senator from \nIndiana works hard and is dedicated. I serve with him on the Armed \nServices Committee. I admire him. I consider him to be my friend, and I \nam sure, regardless of the outcome in this instance, I will remain his \nfriend.\n  The distinguished Senator from Arizona is a great patriot. He has \nserved his country overseas, and he has served his country in this \nChamber. He fights hard and very tenaciously for that in which he \nbelieves in the legislative field. He has done so in this instance. I \nregard him as one of the more skilled and devoted Members of the \nSenate. I have only the utmost respect for him.\n  I like to believe before the day is over, I will have prevailed over \nhis position, but that is somewhat doubtful insofar as I am concerned \nat the moment. But I do respect him, and regardless of how vehemently I \nmay propose my viewpoint, it has nothing to do with my respect for him \nand my friendship for him.\n  He also serves on the Armed Services Committee and is one of the \noutstanding members of that committee.\n  So with those words of respect, I now yield the floor. It is my \nunderstanding Senator Domenici plans to speak at this time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to first acknowledge the hard \nwork and dedication that Senator Ted Stevens from Alaska has put into \nthis conference report. Obviously, there is no Senator here who is more \ndedicated to our prerogatives as a Senate and our prerogatives as \nindividual Senators, and there is no Senator more concerned about \nmaintaining that power. And, likewise, there is none who understands \nthe effectiveness of the appropriations process any better than Senator \nTed Stevens from Alaska, I might say, perhaps with the exception of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Senator Stevens worked tirelessly to come up with a compromise. He \nwill speak for himself later in the day, but obviously, if there is a \nhero, he is one of them on this effort.\n  I have already indicated the two leaders on our side have spent a \nlong period of their Senate life devoted to this, and they took the \nlead from the beginning. Senator McCain is one, who has just spoken, \nand I am sure that we will have a number of Senators speak before we \nare finished. But Senator Coats of Indiana will also be here. \nObviously, he is a coleader of this cause. I acknowledge their \ndedicated effort.\n  I do not intend to speak very long at this point. We have completed a \nconference report after months in conference, and I rise in support of \nthe Line-Item Veto Act which is before us.\n  I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this legislation. I \nbelieve it has the potential to fundamentally change the way we make \nspending decisions in Congress and our relationship to the executive \nbranch. I think the objectives of this legislation are correct. We \nshould enact legislation that facilitates our ability to extract lower \npriority spending from legislation and to devote that to deficit \nreduction.\n  However, I share the concerns of others about this bill's impact on \nthe balance of power between the legislative and executive branch.\n  I also want to congratulate again the majority leader who brought \ntogether a group of Senators with very diverse views and got them to \ncompromise on this final bill. The distinguished chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senator Stevens, once again deserves a \ngreat deal of credit, for he chaired that effort, that conference and \nthat effort that our leader put together in an effort to resolve \ndifferences.\n  Senators McCain and Coats, as I indicated heretofore, deserve the \nlion's share of credit for getting this bill where it is. And they have \nbeen tenacious advocates, and obviously we will hear from both of them \nhere today.\n  Mr. President, I made line-item veto legislation a priority for the \nBudget Committee, because clearly we did not want to be making a point \nof order under the Budget Act on line-item veto because it came within \nthe purview of legislation that must be considered by the Budget \nCommittee. For a number of years getting this job done has been stopped \neither by filibuster or point of order. I thought it was time that we \nget that point of order out of the way and that we do our job and let \nus work our will.\n  We moved quickly to hold hearings and report Senate bill No. 4 at the \nbeginning of 1995. If this bill had not been reported, it would have \nbeen subject to the point of order, as indicated, and we would probably \nnever be here.\n  Mr. President, the conference report on this bill essentially adopts \nthe House's enhanced rescission approach. I repeat, this essentially \nadopts the House's enhanced rescission approach. Essentially that \napproach was similar to the approach advocated by Senators McCain and \nCoats and many who followed their lead.\n  There are a significant number of modifications to the House's \nenhanced rescission concept and particulars.\n  One, we sunset this authority after 8 years to give Congress an \nopportunity to review the President's use of this authority. Some \nwonder why, but, essentially, if you did not have that, there would be \nno time when you could change this law over a President's objection \nwithout having two-thirds vote here in the Senate, because, indeed, if \na President liked it and we did not like it--and there was a real \nreason for that, to argue that policy issue out--Presidents would veto \nwhatever we sent them.\n\n  As a matter of course, we would be saying, regardless of how it is \nused--\n\n[[Page S2933]]\n\nand it is a kind of new activity. Even the occupant of the chair, who \nused it as a Governor, understands and has spoken to me that this is \nsomewhat different in scope when you do it this way, when it is the \nnational picture, and we are treading on some new ground.\n  So I would have liked a shorter sunset provision, but the House had \nnone. So there are 8 years. We will live through two complete \nPresidential terms, starting next January, and see how it is working \nout with reference to a judicious exercise of that new power given to \nPresidents.\n  No. 2, the line-item veto applies to all new spending, including new \ndirect spending, that is frequently called entitlements or mandatories. \nDespite all the rhetoric, the only real deficit reduction this year has \nbeen in the area of discretionary spending. I have misstated the number \nheretofore, and let me be accurate. The only money saved in the \nbalanced budget argument to this point is $12 billion less in spending \nin the appropriated accounts, domestic, in the year 1995. It is obvious \nto those who know the budget, we cannot balance the budget or \nsignificantly restrain Federal spending by just having a veto over \ndiscretionary accounts, nor can we continue the idea and concept that \nwe can balance the budget on the back of the domestic discretionary \nprograms, that spending alone.\n  We devote any savings from the line-item veto to deficit reduction \nthrough a lockbox concept. We clearly define and place restrictions on \nthe President's cancellation authority. The President does not have \ncomplete discretion to cancel items in laws. He can only cancel entire \nitems in laws or accompanying reports.\n  Moreover, the bill makes clear he can cancel only budgetary \nobligations. He cannot use his authority under any circumstance to \nchange the provisions of law, that is, to write law in an \nappropriations bill.\n  We strengthen the expedited procedures for congressional \nconsideration of a bill to disapprove of a President's cancellation of \nan appropriation, either the line item or direct spending or the \nlimited tax benefit, which has been described by my friend from \nArizona. I will not go into it any further now other than to say this \nbill, as it left the Senate, carried with it an expanded concept of \nwhat ought to be subject to cancellation.\n\n  The two things included here that were not historically considered \nwere targeted taxes, that is, very special and direct taxes that \nbenefit a small group of people or institutions, and new additional \nmandatory or direct expenditures, not vetoing entitlements, but if you \ncreate a new one that spends more money, the President has one \nopportunity to address that.\n  Frankly, I think both are fair because if the statement, that is \nclear, that appropriated accounts alone do not create the problem of \ndeficit spending, nor are they the only area where special attention is \nmade to special needs of special constituents by legislators, the same \nis done in tax bills and the same is done in entitlements.\n  Clearly, the President, if he is going to have a chance to get at and \ncancel budget authority, obligational authority for appropriated \naccounts, both domestic and defense, he ought to have a similar \nauthority. This last part that I have just described is truly an \nexperiment, but we worked as diligently as we could to make it clear \nand to make sure that everyone would understand what the conferees had \nin mind on direct or mandatory expenditures and targeted tax \nexpenditures.\n  Again, I congratulate Senators Dole, McCain, and my cohort who \nchaired this conference, the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Senator \nTed Stevens. This is a remarkable achievement on their part. While it \nwill be contested here today, I do not believe it will be contested \nthat this is some very far-reaching legislation, that those who think \nchange is good will clearly understand that this is a formidable event \nin the ever-changing landscape of the legislation that Congress \nconsiders and finally passes.\n  There will be a number of Senators who oppose this. Clearly, I want \nto say right up front that the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, former chairman of the Appropriations Committee, majority \nleader, minority leader of this U.S. Senate, will oppose this. He will \nbe listened to. The concerns he expresses will not be light concerns. \nThey will be important concerns.\n  Many of us have agreed with him in the past, and we have concerns \nabout the legislation. However, we have come to the conclusion--many on \nthe Appropriations Committee, or a number, will support this \nlegislation--that the time is now to give line-item veto a chance, to \nget it over to the President who will sign it. First get it to the \nHouse, they will adopt it, and then go to work on making it work come \nJanuary.\n  Now, we have not yet agreed upon the time that will be taken here \nbecause, quite appropriately, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia wants to watch his time carefully, not only for himself but \nsome of his advocates.\n  When we started here on the floor, before a word was said, the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, in his usual style and \ngracious, gracious demeanor and respect for the institution, shook the \nhand of Senator McCain and Senator Domenici and indicated his respect, \nbut indicated in this particular measure he did not agree. That is a \ngreat part of our Senate heritage. He disagrees. He will have his day. \nWe disagree with Senator Byrd. We will have our day. I hope in the end \nwe will have a majority of Senators supporting what we propose. I yield \nthe floor.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, ``I am no orator, as Brutus is. But as you \nknow me all: a plain blunt man * * * for I have neither wit, nor words, \nnor worth, action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech to stir men's \nblood. I just speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do \nknow. * * *''\n  Mr. President, the Senate is on the verge of making a colossal \nmistake. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico was correct when he \nspoke of this measure as being a formidable measure, a far-reaching \nmeasure, a measure that will produce a sea change in the relationship \nbetween the executive and the legislative branch.\n  Let me say at the outset that I have only the utmost respect for the \ndistinguished, the very distinguished Senator from New Mexico. He is \none of the brightest Senators that I have seen during my 38 years in \nthis body. He understands the budget process, in all likelihood, better \nthan anyone else in this Chamber on either side of the aisle. He is \nskillful, he is dedicated, he is tenacious, and, of course, he is \nfighting for what he believes today. I cannot help but think, however, \nthat in his heart of hearts, he would rather be supporting a more \nmoderate measure than this that is before him. But I have no right to \nattempt to look into his mind or into his heart.\n\n  The Senate, you mark my words, is on the verge of making a colossal \nmistake, a mistake which we will come to regret but with which we will \nhave to live until January 1 of the year 2005, at the very least. We \nare about to adopt a conference report which will upset the \nconstitutional system of checks and balances and separation of powers, \na system that was handed down to us by the Constitutional Framers 208 \nyears ago, a system which has served the country well during these two \ncenturies, a system that our children and grandchildren are entitled to \nhave passed on to them as it was handed down to us.\n  And as I comprehend the appalling consequences--they may not become \nevident immediately, but in due time they will be seen for what they \nare--as I comprehend the appalling consequences of the decision that \nwill, unfortunately, likely have been rendered ere we hear ``the \ntrailing garments of the Night sweep through these marble halls,'' I \nthink of what Thomas Babington Macaulay, noted English author and \nstatesman, wrote in a letter to Henry S. Randall, an American friend, \non May 23, 1857:\n\n       Either some Caesar or Napoleon will seize the reins of \n     government with a strong hand; or your republic will be as \n     fearfully plundered and laid waste by barbarians in the \n     Twentieth century as the Roman Empire was in the Fifth--\n     with this difference . . . that your Huns and Vandals will \n     have been engendered within your own country by your own \n     institutions.\n\n  The Senate is about to adopt a conference report, Mr. President, \nwhich Madison and the other Constitutional Framers and early leaders \nwould have absolutely abhorred, and in adopting the report we will be \nbartering away\n\n[[Page S2934]]\n\nour children's birthright for a mess of political pottage.\n  The control of the purse is the foundation of our constitutional \nsystem of checks and balances of powers among the three departments of \ngovernment. The Framers were very careful to place that control over \nthe purse in the hands of the legislative branch. There were reasons \ntherefor.\n  The control over the purse is the ultimate power to be exercised by \nthe legislative branch to check the executive. The Romans knew this, \nand for hundreds of years, the Roman Senate had complete control over \nthe public purse. Once it gave up its control of the purse strings, it \ngave up its power to check the executive. We saw that when it willingly \nand knowingly ceded its powers to Julius Caesar in the year 44 B.C. \nCaesar did not seize power, the Senate handed power over to Caesar and \nhe became a dictator. History tells us this, and history will not be \ndenied.\n  The same thing happened when Octavianus, later given the title of \nAugustus in the Roman Senate, when in 27 B.C. the Senate capitulated \nand yielded its powers to Augustus, willingly desiring to shift from \nits own shoulders responsibilities of government. When it gave to him \nthe complete control of the purse, it gave away its power to check the \nexecutive.\n  Anyone who is familiar with the history of the English nation knows \nthat our British forebears struggled for centuries to wrest the control \nof the purse from tyrannical monarchs and place it in the hands of the \nelected representatives of the people in Parliament. Perhaps it would \nbe useful for us to review briefly the history of the British \nParliament's struggle to gain control of the purse strings, \nparticularly in view of the fact that the Constitutional Framers in \n1787 were very much aware of the history of British institutions, and \nwere undoubtedly influenced in considerable measure by that history and \nby the experiences of Englishmen in the constitutional struggle over \nthe power of the purse.\n\n  Cicero said that ``one should be acquainted with the history of the \nevents of past ages. To be ignorant of what occurred before you were \nborn is to remain always a child. For what is the worth of human life, \nunless it is woven into the life of our ancestors by the records of \nhistory?''\n  To better understand how our own legislative branch came to be vested \nwith the power over the purse, it seems to me that one should examine \nnot only the roots of the taxing and spending power but also the seed \nand the soil from which the roots sprang and the climate in which the \ntree of Anglo-American liberty grew into its full flowering, because \nonly by understanding the historical background of the constitutional \nliberties which we Americans so dearly prize can we fully appreciate \nthat the legislative control of the purse is the central pillar--the \ncentral pillar--upon which the constitutional temple of checks and \nbalances and separation of powers rests, and that if the pillar is \nshaken, the temple will fall. It is as central to the fundamental \nliberty of the American people as is the principle of habeas corpus, \nalthough its genesis and raison d'etre are not generally well \nunderstood. Therefore, before focusing on the power over the purse as \nthe central strand in the whole cloth of Anglo-American liberty, we \nshould engage in a kaleidoscopic viewing of the larger mosaic as it was \nspun on the loom of time.\n  Congress' control over the public purse has had a long and troubled \nhistory. Its beginnings are imbedded in the English experience, \nstretching backward into the middle ages and beyond. It did not have \nits genesis at the Constitutional Convention, as some may think, but, \nrather, like so many other elements contained in the American \nConstitution, it was largely the product of our early experience under \ncolonial and State governments and with roots extending backward \nthrough hundreds of years of British history predating the earliest \nsettlements in the New World.\n  Notwithstanding William Ewart Gladstone's observation that the \nAmerican Constitution ``is the most wonderful work ever struck off at a \ngiven time by the brain and purpose of man,''--although there is some \nquestion with regard to that quotation--the Constitution was, in fact, \nnot wholly an original creation of the Framers who met in Philadelphia \nin 1787. It ``does not stand in historical isolation, free of \nantecedents,'' as one historian has noted, but ``rests upon very old \nprinciples--principles laboriously worked out by long ages of \nconstitutional struggle.'' The fact is, Gladstone himself, contrary to \nhis quote taken out of context, recognized the Constitution's \nevolutionary development.\n  British subjects outnumbered all other immigrants to the colonies \nunder British dominion. The forces of political correctness are trying \nto change American history these days, but it cannot be changed. The \nvery first sentence of Muzzey's history, which I studied in 1928, 1929, \nand 1930--the very first sentence--says: ``America is the child of \nEurope.'' America is the child of Europe, political correctness \nnotwithstanding.\n  They brought with them--those early settlers from England--the \nEnglish language, the common law of England, and the traditions of \nBritish customs, rights, and liberties. The British system of \nconstitutional government, safeguarded by a House of Commons elected by \nthe people, was well established when the first colonial charters were \ngranted to Virginia and New England. It was a system that had developed \nthrough centuries of struggle, during which many of the liberties and \nrights of Englishmen were concessions wrung--sometimes at the point of \nthe sword--from kings originally seized of all authority and who ruled \nas by divine right.\n  The Constitutional Framers were well aware of the ancient landmarks \nof the unwritten English constitution. Moreover, they were all \nintimately acquainted with the early colonial governments and the new \nstate constitutions which had been lately established following the \nDeclaration of Independence and which had been copied to some degree \nfrom the English model, with adaptations appropriate to republican \nprinciples and local conditions. Let us trace a few of the Anglo-Saxon \nand later English footprints that left their indelible imprint on our \nown constitutional system.\n\n  Since time immemorial, Anglo-Saxon and later English kings had levied \ntaxes on their subjects with the advice and consent of the witenagemot \nor the Great Council. When Parliament later grew out of the Great \nCouncil, and when knights and burgesses from the shires and boroughs, \nand representatives from the town and rural middle class were chosen to \nparticipate in Parliament, the king sought approval, from this \nrepresentative body, of revenues for the operation of government, the \nnational defense, and the waging of wars.\n  In return for its approval of the sovereign's request for money, \nParliament learned that it could secure the redress of grievances and \nexact concessions from the king. You are asking for money? Then we, the \npeople's representatives, want this first. Make these concessions, and \nthen we will vote you the money. If he resisted, then Parliament would \nrefuse to grant funding requests and new taxes. In 1297, almost 700 \nyears ago now, Edward I reluctantly agreed to the ``Confirmation of the \nCharters,'' and, in doing so, he agreed, under clause 6 of the \nParliamentary document, that is the future he would not levy ``aids, \ntaxes, nor prises, but by the common consent of the realm.'' The \nsignificance of the event was twofold. In the first place, it was \nhenceforth necessary that representatives of the whole people, and \nespecially the middle class, be summoned to all Parliaments where any \nnon-feudal taxation proposals were to be considered. Moreover, and of \neven greater importance, the control of the purse was lodged in \nParliament, and this was a power that Parliament would frequently use \nto check the abuse of royal authority and to persuade the king to grant \nconcessions.\n  This is the meat of the coconut. On two occasions in Edward II's \nreign (1307-1327), Parliament had asked for a redress of grievances \nbefore it granted taxes on personal property, and in both cases, the \nsubstance of Parliament's petitions were approved and enacted into \nstatutes by the king. On one of these occasions, in 1309, the Commons \ngranted a subsidy ``upon this condition, that the king should take \nadvice and grant redress upon certain articles wherein they are \naggrieved.'' Members of Congress should take note.\n\n[[Page S2935]]\n\n  There are early instances of the allocation of funds for specific \npurposes, such as the Danegeld, which was a land tax levied to meet \nrequirements arising from Danish invasions and to buy off the invaders. \nIt usually was two shillings on each hide of land. It continued for \nsome time after the danger of Danish invaders had passed, and, as a \nland tax, it was revived by William the Conqueror for specific \nemergency purposes such as defense preparations in 1084, when the King \nof Denmark threatened to enforce his claim to the English throne. \nAlthough continued as a land tax under William I's successors, its \noriginal character was lost, and its name, the Dangeld, fell into \ndisuse in 1163, during the reign of Henry II. It became a source of \nrevenue for general purposes.\n  Feudal charges were levied by kings before the creation of Parliament \nand appropriated for specific purposes. For example, scutage, a tax \nlevied upon a tenant of a knight's fee in commutation for military \nservice, was assigned to the financing of military measures. Funds \ncollected to buy Richard I's freedom were paid into a special \n``exchequer of ransom.'' The Saladin tithe was applied to financing the \ncosts of a crusade, as were specific grants for Holy Land conquests in \n1201, 1222, and 1270. In 1315, the Barons successfully insisted that \nEdward II's personal expenditures be limited to Pounds Sterling, 10 a \nday. By Edward III's day (1327-1377), it was becoming customary to \nattach conditions to money grants. Parliament often insisted that the \nmoney granted should be spent for certain specified purposes, and for \nno others.\n  In 1340, a grant was made by Commons to the king on the condition \nthat it ``shall be put and spent upon the Maintenance and Safeguard of \nour said Realm of England, and on wars in Scotland, France, and \nGascoign, and in no places elsewhere during the said Wars.'' In 1344, a \ntwo-year subsidy was granted and appropriated specifically for the war \nin France and for defense of the North against invasion by the Scots. \nTwo years later, and again in 1348, it was stipulated that the aid must \nbe used for defence against the Scots. Parliament granted a subsidy to \nRichard II in 1382 with the express provision that it go to ``the \nimprovement of the defence of the realm of England and the keeping and \nGovernance of his Towns and Fortresses beyond the Sea.'' The expenses \nof Henry IV's coronation, who reigned from 1399 to 1413, were funded by \na special appropriation.\n\n  Sometimes, treasurers were appointed for overseeing a particular \nsubsidy to ensure that the money was spent in accordance with the terms \nspecified in the appropriations. Ship money was levied in early times \nin port cities to provide for naval maintenance and upkeep, the \nassumption being that the ports were the primary beneficiaries of a \nstrong navy and were safeguarded from invasion by it. In 1382, the \nrevenues from tonnage and poundage were specified for application to \nthe safe keeping of the sea.\n  Some of the early appropriations went into details. For instance, a \ngrant was made to Edward IV in 1472 to cover the expenses of 13,000 \narchers for one year at a daily wage of sixpence. Another grant was \nmade by Commons to Edward IV in 1475 for his war in France on the \ncondition that his departure for France be no later than St. John's Day \nin 1476, and he was not to receive the money until his ships were \nactually ready to leave for France.\n  Wool subsidies were specifically appropriated, on occasion, for \ndefraying the cost of the garrison of Calais. The terms of numerous \ngrants from the 14th century to the 17th century required the \napplication of customs receipts to the defense of the country against \ninvasion and to the protection of ships against pirates and hostile \nnavies. The preamble to the subsidy Act of 1558-9 quoted Edward I as \nhaving recognized that his predecessors ``tyme out of mynde have had \nenjoyed unto them, by authoritie of Parliament, for the defence of the \nRealms and the happy saulfguarde of the Seas'' the proceeds of customs \ncharges on certain goods.\n  Following the Restoration in 1660, Commons aimed at keeping Charles \nII short of funds to prevent the maintenance of a large standing army \nin time of peace. This was in contrast to their willingness to make \ngrants for the navy, and they took precautions to ensure that \nappropriations for the Navy were spent for that purpose and no other, \nas, for example, in 1675, it was provided that the funds ``for building \nships shall be made payable into the Exchequer, and shall be kept \nseparate, distinct, and apart from all other monies, and shall be \nappropriated for the building and furnishing of ships, and that the \naccount for the said supply shall be transmitted to the Commons of \nEngland in Parliament.''\n  The principle of appropriating the supplies (sums of money) for \nspecific purposes only, instead of placing the funds without reserve \ninto the king's hands, dates back at least as far as 1340. Here, then, \nas early as the mid-1300's--650 years ago--was the beginning of the \ncurrent system of congressional appropriations as we know it. Members \nof Congress should be aware of the venerableness of this aspect of the \nmodern appropriations process. It was not something that was conceived \njust yesterday and did not just come out of the woodwork.\n  After the Commons and Lords separated into two houses in the early \n1300's, around 1339, 1340, and 1341, the House of Commons reserved to \nitself the power to initiate tax and money bills.\n  In 1395, the grant to the king, Richard II, was made ``by the commons \nwith the advice and consent of the lords.'' It started out in the \ncommons. In 1407, the king--Henry IV, the former duke of Lancaster--\nagreed that he would listen to reports about money grants only ``by the \nmouth of the speaker of the Commons.'' The right of the commons to \noriginate taxes and money grants was a right by custom, not a statutory \nright, but it was a custom that was not easily shaken. For example, \nHenry IV had failed in 1407 when he tried to proceed first through the \nHouse of Lords. The Commons refused to accept such ``a great prejudice \nand derogation of their liberties.'' The U.S. Constitution, in Article \nI, reflects the very same principle: ``All Bills for raising revenue \nshall originate in the House of Representatives.''\n  As the years passed, Parliament extended its power in the control of \ngovernment expenditures and the earmarking of appropriations of money \nfor particular purposes. Almost always it was specified that general \ntaxes to the king were for national defense, a part of the custom on \nwool was to be used for the maintenance of Calais, as I have earlier \nstated, and the tunnage and poundage tax was to be spent for such \nspecific purposes as the navy and ``the safeguarding of the sea and in \nno other way.'' The royal income was to be used for the expenses of the \nroyal household.\n  During the Commonwealth, the House exercised full control over \ngovernment expenditures, and after the Restoration in 1660, the House \nclaimed, and Charles II grudgingly conceded, the right of appropriation \nin the Appropriation Act of 1665. From that time, it became an \nindisputable principle that the moneys appropriated by Parliament were \nto be spent only for the purposes specified by Parliament. Since the \nreign of William and Mary (1689-1701), a clause was inserted in the \nannual Appropriation Act forbidding--forbidding under heavy penalties--\nLords of the Treasury to issue, and officers of the Exchequer to obey, \nany warrant for the expenditure of money in the national treasury, upon \nany service other than that to which it was distinctly appropriated.\n  The right of Parliament to audit accounts followed, as a natural \nconsequence, the practice of making annual appropriations for specified \nobjects. Even as early as 1340, a committee of Parliament was appointed \nto examine into the manner in which the last subsidy had been expended. \nHenry IV resisted a similar audit in 1406, but in 1407 he conceded \nParliament's right to look at the ways the appropriations were spent. \nSuch audits became a settled usage.\n  These two principles--that of appropriations and that of auditing--\nwere united by the framers in a single paragraph of Article I, section \n9, of the U.S. Constitution: ``No Money shall be drawn from the \nTreasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a \nregular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all \npublic Money shall be published from time to time.''\n  So, Mr. President, as we can see, legislative control over taxation \nbears\n\n[[Page S2936]]\n\nclose relation to the history of Parliament. The witenagemot possessed \nthe right of advice and consent regarding taxation, although the right \nwas probably exercised only rarely because the royal needs in the \nAnglo-Saxon era were normally supplied by income from royal farms, \nfines, and payments in kind or the quasi-voluntary tribute paid by the \nkingdom to its sovereign. The Norman kings exacted feudal aids and \nother special varieties of taxation, retaining and adding to the \nimposts of Saxon kings. But there is scant evidence as to what extent \nthe council was asked by the kings. Although a tax in the reign of \nHenry I (1100-1135) was described as the ``aid which my barons gave \nme,'' it appears that until the time of Richard I (1189-1199), the king \nusually merely announced in assembly the amounts needed and the reasons \nfor his imposing subsidies. By the feudal doctrine, the payer of a tax \nmade a voluntary gift for relief of the wants of his ruler.\n  Magna Carta (1215) provided that, except for three feudal aids, no \ntax should be levied without the assent of a council duly invoked. But \nas the burden of taxation increased, the necessity for broadening the \ntax base to all classes of society also increased. Hence, the \nestablishment of the representative system is Parliament had its \nessential origin in the necessity for obtaining the consent, by chosen \nproxy, of all who were taxed. After the ``Confirmation of the \nCharters'' in 1297, the right of the people of the realm to tax \nthemselves through their own chosen representatives became an \nestablished principle. The Petition of Rights, reluctantly agreed to by \nCharles I in 1628, emphatically reaffirmed the principle. Charles had \nattempted a forced loan in 1627 to meet his urgent money needs. This \nwas, in effect, taxation without parliamentary sanction, and many \nrefused to contribute, whereupon Charles arbitrarily imprisoned several \npersons who would not pay. When he called Parliament into session the \nnext year, twenty-seven members of the new house had been imprisoned \nfor failure to pay the forced loan. When Charles demanded the money he \nso desperately needed, the commons paid no attention. They decided \nalmost at once to put their major grievances in a Petition of Rights. \nAmong these, the Petition asked that arbitrary imprisonment should \ncease and that arbitrary taxation should cease and ``no man hereafter \nbe compelled to make or yield any gift, loan, benevolence, tax, or such \nlike charge, without common consent by Act of Parliament.'' When \nCharles granted the Petition of Rights, the Commons voted him taxes.\n\n  The insistence by Charles I that he possessed a divine right to levy \ntaxation and could seek funds directly from citizens, created the \nconditions for civil war in England. James I had decided to raise \nrevenue by imposing an import duty on almost all merchandise, and the \npolitical struggle intensified when Charles acted to levy tonnage and \npoundage without parliamentary authority. After the House of Commons \npassed the Petition of Rights, it also moved to curb the King's power \nto raise revenue from customs duties, precipitating another clash with \nCharles.\n  Charles I tried to govern without Parliament by resorting to various \nmeans of raising revenue. Additional Knighthoods were created, \nrequiring the beneficiaries to pay a fee to the King. Those who refused \nwere fined. Other efforts to raise money led to increased resentment \nfrom citizens and threw the country into a state of crisis. Charles \nlost both his throne and his head.\n  The Bill of Rights, to which William III and Mary were required to \ngive their assent before Parliament would make them joint sovereigns, \ndeclared ``that levying money for or to the use of the crown, by \npretense of prerogative, without grant of Parliament, for longer time, \nor in other manner than the same is or shall be granted, is illegal.''\n  It was the violation of this constitutional principle of taxation by \nconsent of the taxpayers, through their chosen representatives, that \nled to the revolt of the colonies in America. The Declaration of \nIndependence explicitly names, as one of the reasons justifying \nseparation from England, that of her ``imposing taxes on us without our \nconsent.''\n  There is, then, a certain historic fitness in the fact that first \namong the powers of Congress enumerated in Article I, section 8, of the \nConstitution is the power ``to lay and collect taxes.'' The power to \nappropriate monies is also vested by Article I solely in the \nlegislative branch--nowhere else; not downtown, not at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue, but here in the legislative branch.\n  Mr. President, we have all perhaps been subject to the notion that \nthe Federal Constitution with its built-in systems of checks and \nbalances, was an isolated and innovative new instrument of government \nwhich sprang into existence--sprang into existence--during three months \nof meetings behind closed doors in Philadelphia, and that it solely was \nthe product of the genius of the Framers who gathered there behind \nclosed doors to labor to make it come about. However, as I have also \nsaid heretofore, American constitutional history can only be fully \nunderstood and appreciated by looking into the institutions, events, \nand experiences of the past out of which the organic document of our \nnation evolved and took unto itself a life and soul of its own.\n  To ascertain the origin of the Constitution, then, it must be sought \namong the records treating of the fierce conflicts between kings and \npeople--it cannot be found just in Madison's notes, but it must be \nsought among the records of treating fierce conflicts between kings and \npeople--the evolution of chartered rights and liberties, and the \ndevelopment of Parliament in the island home of those hardy forebears \nwho crossed the Atlantic to plant new homes in the wilderness and who \ntransplanted to the English colonies of the New World the familiar \ninstitutions of government which would assure to them the rights and \nliberties which they, as British subjects in a new land, held to be \ntheir due inheritance.\n  The U.S. Constitution was, in many ways, the product of many \ncenturies--many centuries--and it was not so much a new and untried \nexperiment as it was a charter of government based to some extent on \nthe British archetype, as well as on State and colonial models which \nhad themselves been influenced by the British example and by the \npolitical theories of Montesquieu and others, who believed that \npolitical freedom could be maintained only by separating the executive, \nlegislative, and judicial powers of government, which powers, when \ndivided, would check and balance one another, thus preventing tyranny \nby any one man, as had been the case in France.\n\n  Moreover, unlike the British Constitution, which, as I say, was, \ngenerally, an unwritten constitution consisting of written charters, \ncommon law principles and rules, and petitions and statutes of \nParliament, the American Constitution was a single, written document \nthat was ratified by the people in conventions called for the purpose.\n  In a real sense, therefore, the U.S. Constitution was an instrument \nof government that was the result of growth and experience and not \nmanufacture, and its successful ratification was, in considerable \nmeasure, due to the respect of the people for its roots deep in the \npast. The mainspring of the constitutional system of separation of \npowers and delicate checks and balances was the power over the purse, \nvested--where? Here in the legislative branch. That power guaranteed \nthe independence and the freedom and the liberties of the people.\n  James Madison, who is justly called the father of the Constitution, \nsummed up, in a very few words, the significance of the power over the \npurse in the preservation of the people's rights and liberties, and the \nfundamental importance of the retention of that power by the people's \nelected representatives in the legislative branch.\n  He did this in the Federalist No. 58, in which he referred to the \nHouse of Representatives and said:\n\n       They in a word hold the purse; that powerful instrument by \n     which we behold in the history of the British constitution, \n     an infant and humble representation of the people, gradually \n     enlarging the sphere of its activity and importance, and \n     finally reducing, as far as it seems to have wished, all the \n     overgrown prerogatives of the other branches of the \n     government. This power over the purse, may in fact be \n     regarded as the most compleat and effectual weapon with which \n     any constitution can arm the immediate representatives\n\n[[Page S2937]]\n\n     of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, \n     and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\n\n  Let me repeat just the last portion of the words by Madison.\n\n       This power over the purse, may in fact be regarded as the \n     most compleat and effectual weapon with which any \n     constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the \n     people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for \n     carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\n\n  Mr. President, the elected representatives of the people in this body \nshould remember those weighty words by Madison, the father of the \nConstitution. If they wish to know the value of constitutional liberty, \nthey might retire to those words and read.\n  Mr. President, to alter the constitutional system of checks and \nbalances, by giving the executive--any executive, any President, \nDemocrat or Republican--a share in the taxing or appropriations power \nthrough the instrument of an item veto or enhanced rescission would, in \nmy view, be rank heresy. As we have seen, the entrusting of the power \nover the purse to the legislative branch was no accident of history but \nrather the result of over 600 years of contest with royalty. To chisel \naway this rock, that through bloody centuries has undergirded the hard-\nwon, cherished rights of freemen in England and in America, should be \nanathema to any informed and thoughtful citizen in these United States.\n  To quote Aristotle: ``Of all these things the judge is Time.'' From \nour vantage point, then, Mr. President, as we take the long look \nbackwards into the murky past, history clearly teaches us that the \npower over the purse--the power to tax and to appropriate funds--wisely \ncame to be lodged, more than 600 years ago, in the directly elected \nrepresentatives of the people; that this principle lies at the \nfoundation, and is a chief source, of our liberties; and that it is not \na power that should be shared by a king or a President.\n  That our own Constitutional Framers clearly intended for the power \nover the purse to be solely in the hands of the elected representatives \nof the American people, we have only to review the words of Madison and \nHamilton as they appeared in the Federalist Papers.\n  Hamilton in the Federalist #78 stated: ``The legislature not only \ncommands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and \nrights of every citizen are to be regulated.''\n  Madison in the Federalist #48 stated, ``The legislative department \nalone has access to the pockets of the people.'' In Federalist Paper \n#58--as I have already pointed out--Madison stated: ``This power over \nthe purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most compleat and effectual \nweapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate \nrepresentatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every \ngrievance and for carrying into effect every just and salutary \nmeasure.''\n  Thus, the founders of this republic left no doubt as to what branch \nof the government had control over the purse strings. The Executive was \nnot given any control over the purse strings, with the single exception \nof the right of the President to veto, in its entirety, a bill--any \nbill--and in this case a bill making appropriations.\n  There was little discussion of the Presidential veto at the \nconvention, as a reading of the convention notes will show. There was \nabsolutely no discussion whatsoever with reference to a line item veto \nor any such modification thereof as we are now contemplating. Henry \nClay, one of the greatest Senators of all time, in a Senate Floor \nspeech on January 24, 1842, referred to the veto as ``this miserable \ndespotic veto power of the President of the United States.'' That is \nwhat he thought of a Presidential veto. It is not hard to imagine what \nHenry Clay would think of this conference report that is before the \nSenate today.\n  It is ludicrous--nay, it is tragic--that we are about to substitute \nour own judgment for that of the Framers with respect to the control of \nthe purse and the need to check the Executive. Yet, that is precisely \nwhat we are about to do here today. We are about to succumb, for \npolitical reasons only, to the mania which has taken hold of some in \nthis and the other body to put that most political of political \ninventions, the so-called ``Contract with America'' into law.\n  Saying this, I do not question but that some Senators genuinely, \nsincerely, and conscientiously believe that this is the right thing to \ndo, and that this is the way to get a handle on the budget deficits.\n  To quote Homer in ``The Iliad'': ``Not if I had ten tongues and ten \nmouths, a voice that could not tire, lung of brass in my bosom'', would \nI be able to persuade those who are motivated by political expediency \nthat future generations will condemn their shortsightedness and hold \nthem responsible for the damage to our constitutional system that will \nbe wrought by this radical shift of power from the legislative to the \nexecutive branch. ``Who saves his country, saves all things, saves \nhimself, and all things saved do bless him; Who lets his country die, \nlets all things die, dies himself ignobly, and all things dying curse \nhim.''\n  Most Presidents in recent times have espoused the line-item veto. I \nfought against surrendering this power to President Reagan, I fought \nagainst surrendering the power to President Bush, and I just as \nfervently oppose giving President Clinton--or any other President--a \nline-item veto or any modification thereof. I have taken an oath many \ntimes to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. My \ncontract with America is the Constitution of the United States. I paid \n15 cents for this copy several years ago. It cost $1, I think, now. \nThere it is, well-worn, taped together, and pretty well marked up. But \nthat is my contract with America.\n\n  So I have taken an oath many times to support and defend this \ncontract with America, the Constitution of the United States, and I do \nnot intend to renege on my sworn oath by supporting this conference \nreport. It is a malformed monstrosity, born out of wedlock. Although \nthe House voted on this version of the so-called line-item veto, the \nSenate did not. That is why I would say it was born out of wedlock.\n  It is a profanation of the temple of the Constitution which the \nFramers built, and it will prove to be an ignis fatuus in achieving a \nbalanced budget. Its passage will effectuate a tremendous shift of \npower from the legislative branch to the Executive Branch, and it will \nbe used as a club to be held over the head of every member of the \nUnited States Senate and House of Representatives by power hungry \nPresidents who will seek to impose their will over the legislative \nprocess to the detriment of the American people, whose elected \nrepresentatives in Congress will no longer be free to exercise their \njudgment as to what matters are in the best interests of the states and \nthe people whom they serve.\n  This so-called line-item veto act should be more appropriately \nlabeled ``The President Always Wins Bill.'' From now on, the heavy hand \nof the President will be used to slap down Congressional opposition \nwherever it may exist. Yet, I have no doubt that this measure will \npass. Political expediency will be the order of the day, for we are \nlike Nebuchadnezzar, dethroned, bereft of reason, and eating grass like \nan ox.\n  ``O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth! Then with a passion \nwould I shake the world.''\n  The efforts of those who oppose this surrender of power to the \nPresident may be likened to the last stand of General George Armstrong \nCuster, who with 200 of his followers, were wiped out by the Indians at \nthe Battle of the Little Big Horn, in Montana, in 1876, but I see this \nas the Battle of the ``Big Giveaway'', and I do not propose to go \nalong.\n  As a matter of fact, I do not believe that it is within the \ncapability of Congress to give away such a basic Constitutional power \nas the control over the purse strings, because that is the fundamental \npillar upon which rests the Constitutional system of separation of \npowers and checks and balances.\n  I know there are those who say that it will only be for 8 years--from \nJanuary 1, 1997, to January 1, in the year 2005. Senators will note \nthat the bill does not take effect upon passage, upon enactment, the \nreason being that the majority party does not want to give this \nPresident this line-item veto. He may use it against them. And so they \nhave crafted the date to follow the next\n\n[[Page S2938]]\n\nelection so that if President Clinton is able to use this ill-begotten \nmeasure at all, he would have to be reelected before he can do it. So \nthey say it will only be for 8 years.\n  I do not believe that the constitutional powers of Congress can be so \ncavalierly shifted to the executive branch, whether it be for 8 years \nor for 1 year or for 6 months.\n  It is instructive to reflect on what George Washington had to say \nabout checks and balances and separation of powers in his Farewell \nAddress, and I shall quote therefrom: ``It is important that the habits \nof thinking in a free country should inspire caution in those entrusted \nwith its administration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment, to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. * * * The \nnecessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power, by \ndividing and distributing it into different depositories, and \nconstituting each guardian of the public weal against invasions of the \nothers, has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern * * * To \npreserve them must be as necessary as to institute them. If, in the \nopinion of the people, the distribution or modification of the \nconstitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected \nby an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates.''\n  It is my firm belief that we are about to enact legislation that is \nclearly unconstitutional, and I fervently hope that it will be struck \ndown by the courts. But it might not be. In any event, this possibility \ndoes not relieve us of our own responsibility to make a judgment \nregarding the constitutionality of a measure which we are about to \nenact. Our oath to support and defend the Constitution against all \nenemies, foreign and domestic, requires no less of us than this. But I \nfear that the die, as Caesar said in the year 49 B.C. as he stood \nbefore the Rubicon, is cast. Before this day has ended, the Senate will \nhave turned its back in all probability on the Constitution and \npartially disenfranchised the very people we are charged to represent, \nand it will have done so to its own great shame.\n  The Policraticus of John of Salisbury, completed in 1159, we are \ntold, ``is the earliest elaborate mediaeval treatise on politics.'' In \nit, we find a reference to the House of Caesar and an account of the \nmeans by which each in this line of Roman rulers came to his end. \nJulius, as we all know, was done to death in 44 B.C., at the hands of \nBrutus, Cassius, and others as they gathered on the Ides of March where \nthe Senate was meeting. When Caesar saw those about him with their \ndaggers drawn, he veiled his head with his toga and drew down its folds \nover his eyes that he might fall the more honorably.\n  Nero, who reigned from 54 to 68 A.D., after he had heard that the \nSenate had condemned him to death, begged that someone would give him \ncourage to die by dying before him as an example. When he perceived \nthat the horsemen were drawing near, he upbraided his own cowardice by \nsaying, ``I die shamefully.'' So saying, he drove the steel into his \nown throat and thus, says John of Salisbury, came to an end the whole \nhouse of the Caesars.\n  Here, now, we see in the proposal before us, the Legislative Branch \nbeing offered the dagger by which, with its own hands, it too may drive \nthe steel into its own throat and thus die shamefully.\n  I say to Senators, beware of the hemlock. Let us pause and reject \nthis measure lest the ``People's Branch'' suffer a self-inflicted wound \nthat would go to the heart of the Constitutional system of checks and \nbalances--the power over the purse, a power vested by the Constitution \nin the Legislative Branch, and in the Legislative Branch only.\n  Section 9, article I of the Constitution says, ``No money shall be \ndrawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by \nlaw.'' And in the very first section of article I, it says, ``All \nlegislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the \nUnited States, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of \nRepresentatives.''\n  So here is where the power is vested to pass a law, to enact a law, \nto amend a law. But this conference report will change that. It will \nplace into the hands of the Chief Executive a power which in essence \nwill be a power to amend not only a bill but a law. A bill which has \nalready been signed into law by the President can then within the next \n5 days be amended almost single handedly by him by way of the \nrescissions process which is a loaded dice procedure. He cannot lose.\n  Now, let us take a look at this conference report and examine it.\n  For the record, let it be noted that this measure is not a true line-\nitem veto. A true line-item veto would allow the President to actually \nline out items with which he did not agree in an appropriations bill \nor, depending on how such legislation were to be written, in any other \nbill that would come across his desk for signature.\n  And in some States he may not only line out the item but he may \nreduce the item. He may line out language. But we are talking about the \nline-item veto on the Federal level.\n  The measure before us would allow the President not to line out items \nin a bill, but rather to send special messages to Congress deleting or \nrescinding certain items from bills after he has signed them into law. \nNot only that, but this measure will also allow any President to \nrescind portions of spending measures that are contained in their \naccompanying tables, committee reports, or statements by the managers \non the part of the conferees of both Houses. This approach is actually \nfar more effective in getting at ``presidentially-deemed'' unacceptable \nspending than would be a direct line-item veto authority. This is so \nbecause bill language does not lend itself to specificity, and line-\nitem veto authority would force the President to eliminate large lump \nsums in order to get at specific items he did not like, when perhaps he \nwas in agreement with most of the spending in the lump sum.\n  The conference report would have the effect of stripping from the \npeople's elected representatives, in Congress--the President is not \ndirectly elected by the people. The President is indirectly elected by \nthe people. We are the elected representatives of the people. And here, \nin this forum of the States, we represent the States and the people.\n  It would take much of that power and place it, instead, in the hands \nof the occupant of the Oval Office and his unelected bureaucrats. This \nconference report effectively places in the hands of the President and \nunelected bureaucrats--I do not use those words pejoratively, but they \nare unelected and they are bureaucrats. And we have to have them. But, \nit places in the hands of the President and unelected bureaucrats, \nultimate control over the Nation's finances.\n  I implore Senators, I beseech, I importune Senators to carefully read \nthe conference report, to see how this is done. It is all plainly there \nin black and white. And it is a ``heads-I-win, tails-you-lose'' \nproposition for the President of the United States. It is an eye \nopener. Read it, Senators.\n  Section 1021(a) of this conference agreement would allow the \nPresident to cancel in whole--(1) any dollar amount of discretionary \nbudget authority; (2) any item of new direct spending--see, it does not \nget into entitlements that are already in the law, and they are what is \ncausing the budget deficits, but they escape the reaches of this \nconference report--any item of new direct spending; or (3) any limited \ntax benefit; as long as the President notifies the Congress ``within 5 \ncalendar days (excluding Sundays) after the enactment of the law \nproviding the dollar amount of the discretionary budget authority, item \nof new direct spending, or limited tax benefit that was canceled.''\n  Now let us look at section 1023(a), which states, in part:\n\n       The cancellation of any dollar amount of discretionary \n     budget authority, item of new direct spending, or limited tax \n     benefit shall take effect upon receipt in the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate of the special message \n     notifying the Congress of the cancellation.\n\n  Once the message comes in the door, the cancellation takes effect.\n\n       If a disapproval bill for such special message is enacted \n     into law, then all cancellations disapproved in that law \n     shall be null and void and any such dollar amount of \n     discretionary budget authority, item of new direct spending, \n     or limited tax benefit shall be\n\n[[Page S2939]]\n\n     effective as of the original date provided in the law to \n     which the cancellation applied.\n\n  Section 1025(b) goes on to detail the time period in which Congress \nmust pass its rescission disapproval bill. The conference agreement \nallows for:\n\n       a Congressional review period of thirty calendar days of \n     session, during which Congress must complete action on the \n     rescission disapproval bill and present such bill to the \n     President for approval or disapproval;\n       an additional ten days (not including Sundays) during which \n     the President may exercise his authority to sign or veto the \n     rescission disapproval bill; and\n       if the President vetoes the rescission disapproval bill \n     during the period provided, Congress is allowed an additional \n     five calendar days of session to override the veto.\n\n  Allowing a presidential rescission to take effect unless specifically \ndisapproved by the Congress has the force of taking from a majority of \nthe people's representatives final say over how tax dollars are spent. \nThat is most certainly the impact, Mr. President, because under this \nconference report, for all practical purposes, it would be necessary \nfor Congress to marshal a two-thirds majority in both Houses in order \nto enact any appropriation to which the President might conceivably \nobject. It is a stacked deck, and Congress will lose every time.\n  Consider this scenario: Once the House and Senate have passed an \nappropriations bill, the President can then, if we were to adopt this \nconference report, use his new-found rescission power to carve that \nappropriations bill up just the same as if he were carving a \nThanksgiving turkey--a little here, a little there; the dark meat here, \nthe white meat there.\n  After he or his bureaucrats decide, over the will of a majority of \nthe representatives of the people, what they will carve out of duly \nenacted legislation, the President will then transmit a special message \nto Congress. Once he transmits his special message, Congress would have \nthirty days to pass a rescission disapproval bill. But since a \ndisapproval bill is a direct denial of the President's request, and \nsince the President is the one who proposed the rescission in the first \nplace, I think we are safe in assuming that he would nearly always veto \nany such disapproval bill passed by both Houses. Therefore, it would be \nfairly pointless to even bring a disapproval bill to the Floor for a \nvote unless it had the support of two-thirds of the Senators and two-\nthirds of the House of Representatives. And it will almost never have \nthat kind of support. This conference report loads the dice against \nCongress.\n  I used to play an old tune called, ``I Am A Roving Gambler.'' It did \nnot say anything about that roving gambler having loaded dice. But this \nconference report loads the dice and the President will always win--\nalways. And you and I will always lose, and the people we represent \nwill always lose.\n  Subsequent to the President's veto of the disapproval bill, Congress, \nof course, would have the opportunity to attempt an override. This \ntime, however, the Congress would be limited to five days of \nconsideration. In any event, it would take a vote of two-thirds of both \nHouses to override the President's veto of a disapproval bill.\n  In other words, under this conference report, Congress may actually \nhave to pass an appropriation by a two-thirds supermajority in both \nHouses, before that appropriation could finally be nailed into law. Is \nthat what Senators want? Are we truly intent on installing minority \nrule in this country? In our efforts to help get spending under \ncontrol, are we running over the basic principle of majority rule in \nthe process?\n  Additionally, by allowing the President--now, this is a radical \ndeparture from any idea I have ever heard suggested with reference to a \nline-item veto--by allowing the President to rescind new budget \nauthority in bills or their accompanying tables, reports or statements \nof managers, or charts, the President's veto power is no longer limited \nto the various line-items in an appropriations bill. In other words, \nthis conference agreement would enable a President to rescind any new \nbudget authority contained in either an appropriations bill, or any \ntable, report, or statement of managers accompanying any appropriation \nbills, by simply notifying Congress of such rescissions by a special \nmessage not later than five calendar days after enactment of an \nappropriations act.\n  So, he can go into this conference report--this does not go to the \nPresident for him to veto, the bill goes to the President for his \nsignature or veto. This conference report does not go. He never sees \nit. Nor does the statement of the managers go, but he can reach into \nthem through his bureaucrats who advise him, ``Mr. President, there is \na chart in this conference report on page 27, and you will find in that \nchart a certain item for certain States or certain regions of the \ncountry,'' and he can say, ``Rescind them.''\n  Congress' goal should be to give Presidents a stronger tool than they \nnow have to reduce unnecessary spending. But, I do not believe, Mr. \nPresident, that we have to gut the power of the purse in order to give \nthe President that new help. The approach outlined in this conference \nagreement would tend to arbitrarily substitute a President's judgment \nabout the needs of the various individual states for the judgment of \nthe duly elected representatives of those states and districts. I am \nsure that the people who vote to send us here do so at least in part \nbecause they feel we understand the needs of the states we represent \nand the views of the people of those states. I am equally sure that the \npeople do not intend for our judgment and our votes to be summarily \noverruled. I do not think they intend that. I think if they really \nunderstood this conference report, if they really understood what we \nare about to do here, I do not think that the people would intend for \nour judgment and our votes to be summarily overruled or dismissed by a \nPresident--this President or any other President. Nor would I suspect \nthat the people of our various states would want the deck so stacked \nagainst their elected representatives as to force us to muster votes of \ntwo-thirds of both Houses of Congress to overrule the President's \njudgment on a matter we thought important for the good of our states. \nBut, this conference report is rigged, and it deals the cards that way \nand leaves the President and a minority in each body with the ultimate \nace in the hole.\n  Mr. President, what we are talking about here is a measure that would \nincrease exponentially the already overwhelming advantage that is held \nby the Executive in his use of the veto power. Out of the 1,460 regular \nvetoes that have been cast by Presidents directly over these past 208 \nyears, only 105--or 7 percent--have been overridden in the entire \ncourse of American history. In 208 years, from the Presidency of George \nWashington, who vetoed two bills, and it was he who said the President \nhas to veto the whole bill or sign it or let it become law without his \nsignature. He cannot item veto it. That was George Washington. In 208 \nyears from the Presidency of George Washington right down through \nPresident Clinton today, Congress has only been able to muster enough \nvotes to override a President's veto 105 times, 7 percent of the total. \nIn this case, this so-called enhanced rescission authority requirement \nfor a disapproval resolution coupled with the President's veto power, \ncreases a ``heads I win, tails you lose'' situation.\n  This overwhelming advantage on the side of a President is magnified \nby the fact that often the funds rescinded are likely to be of \nimportance to only a few states or a single region. They may even be \nimportant to no more than a single congressional district. If that is \nthe case, then how many Members of either House are going to be \ninterested in overriding the President's veto? How many Senators are \ngoing to think it is worth standing up to the President and voting \nagainst reducing the deficit for the sake of one lonely House Member or \na handful of Senators or a few Members of the House?\n  Take, for instance, the following six States: Maine, with 2 votes in \nthe House; New Hampshire, with 2 votes; Massachusetts, 10 votes; \nVermont, 1 vote; Rhode Island, 2 votes; and Connecticut, with its 6 \nvotes. Collectively, those states have 23 votes in the House of \nRepresentatives and 12 votes in the Senate. Those 35 individuals are \ngoing to find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to interest \ntwo-thirds of the total House and Senate membership in overriding a \npresidential veto on an issue of concern only to the New England \nregion. The type of ``divide and conquer'' strategy, which this \nconference report creates for the White House to use, would have a \ndevastating\n\n[[Page S2940]]\n\neffect on the power of the purse, and the system of checks and \nbalances, which is the very taproot of the American constitutional \nsystem of government.\n  Not only will this conference report, when enacted into law, militate \nagainst small rural states like my own--which can muster only three \nvotes in the other body--but it will be a prescription for minority \nrule. For over 200 years, the theory undergirding our republican system \nof government--some people speak of ours as a democracy. It is not a \ndemocracy. Ours is not a democracy. It would be impossible for a \ngovernment that extends over 2,500 miles from ocean to ocean and has \n250 million people to be a democracy. People should learn their high-\nschool civics.\n  This is a republican form of government. And the theory undergirding \nour republican system of government has been that of majority rule. \nThis conference report will substitute minority rule for majority rule \nby requiring a supermajority vote in both Houses to adopt a disapproval \nmeasure overriding a presidential veto of appropriations passed \ninitially by simple majorities in both Houses. A minority of 34 votes \nin the Senate will sustain a presidential veto that may have already \nbeen given a two-thirds vote to override in the other body. In other \nwords, the President and 34 Senators can overrule the wishes of the \nother 66 Senators and 435 Members of the House--if this is not minority \nrule in the field of legislation, what else may one call it? Do \nSenators wish to substitute minority rule for majority rule in the \nlegislative process?\n  It is difficult to imagine why this body would want to deal such a \npainful blow, not only to itself, but to the basic structure of our \nconstitutional form of government and to the interests of the people we \nrepresent.\n  Whether the President is a Democrat or a Republican is not my \nconcern. Whether one party or another is in power in the Congress is \nnot my concern here. My concern is with unnecessarily upsetting the \nbalance of powers as laid out in the Constitution, and this conference \nreport simply gives away much of the congressional control over the \npurse strings to a President.\n  What is fundamentally at stake here is the division of powers between \nthe executive and legislative branches of Government, and the dangerous \neffects of instituting minority government. This is not a disagreement \nover reducing the deficit, or over giving the President some additional \npower to help do that. It is a disagreement over disrupting the \npeople's power over the purse beyond what is necessary to accomplish \nour deficit reduction goal.\n  If we enact this conference report into law, control of the Nation's \npurse strings by a majority in the legislative branch would be severely \nimpaired. That is a fact. It can be demonstrated by a careful reading \nof the report, and we ought not go down that road, because there is no \nturning back.\n  Mr. President, the most effective instrument of restraint possessed \nby the legislative branch against a powerful and reckless President is \nthe control over the purse. For example, cutting off the flow of funds \nfor an activity is the surest way of checking unwise presidential use \nof power. We have seen that in the effective use of curtailing funding \nin the example of our ill-advised adventure in Somalia.\n  I was the author of the amendment that drew the line which, in \nessence, said, ``All right, Mr. President, after that date, if you want \nto stay, you come back, make your case before Congress, and seek the \nmoney for it.''\n  Were the President to be granted enhanced rescission authority, \nthough, we would have seriously unbalanced the delicate system that was \nput in place by the Constitution. We would have ceded congressional \ncontrol over the purse to an executive who could then use it to affect \nour ability to check misadventures in foreign or domestic policy by \nthreatening important initiatives in one or more states or a region.\n  The Framers of the Constitution were induced to give to the President \nthe veto power, and they did this for two reasons: the first, was a \ndesire to protect the executive against possible encroachments from the \nlegislative branch, and the other was a desire to guard the country \nagainst the injurious effects of hasty and bad judgment.\n  Mr. President, it was a gross misapprehension on the part of the \nFramers who feared that the executive branch would be too feeble to \nsuccessfully contend with the legislature in a struggle for power. \nLittle did the Constitutional Framers dream that the powers of the \nchief executive would grow enormously with the passage of time. They \ncould not foresee the powers that would flow to the President through \nhis patronage as titular head of a political party. Nor, of course, \ncould they foresee the power of the ``bully pulpit'' that would come \nwith the invention of radio and television and modern \ntelecommunications, which enable the President, at the snap of a \nfinger, to summon before him for immediate disposal the advantages of \nthe modern news media which enable him to appeal directly to the \nAmerican people with one voice. The fears of the Framers, in this \nrespect, were not only unfounded, but the constant encroachment, which \nthey were concerned about, has not been by the legislative branch on \nthe executive but has been just the opposite--there has been a constant \nerosion by the executive of the legislative authority.\n  The legislative branch of Government meets periodically; its power \nlies in its assembling and acting; the moment it adjourns, its power \ndisappears. But the executive branch of the Government is eternally in \naction; it is ever awake on land and on sea; its action is continuous \nand unceasing, like the tides of some mighty river, which continues to \nflow on and on and on, swelling, and deepening, and widening, in its \nonward progress, until it sweeps away every impediment, and breaks down \nand removes every frail obstacle which might be set up to stay or slow \nits course.\n  The legislative branch sleeps but there stands the President at the \nhead of the executive branch, ever ready to enforce the law, and to \nseize upon every advantage which presents itself for the extension and \nexpansion of the executive power. And now, we are preparing here in the \nSenate to augment the already enormous power of an all-powerful chief \nexecutive by adopting a conference report that will shift the real \npower of the legislative branch to the other end of the avenue and \nplace that power in his hands--to be used against the legislative \nbranch, to be used against the elected representatives of the people in \nlegislative matters. It is as if the legislative branch has been seized \nwith a collective madness. The majority leadership in both Houses will \nhave succeeded in enacting a major plank in the so-called Contract With \nAmerica.\n\n  Mr. President, let me say once more, this is my contract with \nAmerica: The Constitution of the United States. It cost me 15 cents \nseveral years ago. It can be gotten from the Government Printing \nOffice, not for 15 cents today, but perhaps for a dollar. That is my \ncontract with America.\n  The majority leadership in both Houses will have succeeded in \nenacting a major plank in its so-called Contract With America while it \nturns its back on the Constitution--the real Contract with America, \nwhich we have all sworn to support and defend--and the majority party \nin Congress will forever carry on its hands the stain of this \nunpardonable and gross betrayal of the Constitution and its Framers.\n  Let us contemplate the effect that the passage of this conference \nreport would have on the power of the chief executive. At the present \ntime, if all Senators are voting, 51 Senators are required to \nconstitute a majority in the passage of a bill, while in the other body \n218 Members are required to constitute a majority in the passage of \nthat same bill. If the bill is vetoed, then two-thirds of the Senate, \nor 67 votes, if all Senators are present and voting, will be required \nto make that bill become a law over a presidential veto. In other \nwords, that veto by one man in the Oval Office will be worth the vote \nof 16 additional Senators, while in the House that presidential veto by \none man will be equal to 72 votes--a supermajority of 218 being \nrequired to pass the bill, and a supermajority of 290 being required to \noverride a presidential veto, or a difference of 72 votes. In other \nwords, a veto cast by a single individual who holds the presidency, \nwill be worth the\n\n[[Page S2941]]\n\nvotes of 88 members of the House and Senate. Is this not enough, Mr. \nPresident, that he would wield so vast and formidable an amount of \npatronage, and thereby be able to exert an influence so potent and so \nextensive? Must there be superadded to all of this power, a legislative \nforce equal to that of 16 Senators and 72 members of the House of \nRepresentatives?\n  I have viewed the veto power simply in its numerical weight, and the \naggregate votes of the two Houses, but there is another important point \nof view which ought to be considered. It is simply this: the veto, \narmed with the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds vote of both \nHouses in order to override, is nothing less than an absolute power. In \nall of the vetoes over the past 2 centuries, as I have said, only about \n7 percent of the regular vetoes have been overridden. When it comes to \noverriding the vetoes of bills of disapproval of presidential \nrescissions, the President's veto will constitute virtually an \nunqualified negative on the legislation of appropriations by Congress. \nIf nothing can set it aside but a vote of two-thirds in both Houses, \nthat veto of disapproval bills might as well be made absolute and now \nbecause that is what it will amount to. The Constitutional Framers did \nnot intend for such raw power over the control of the purse strings to \nbe vested in the hands of any chief executive.\n  Do Senators know what they are doing when they vote to adopt this \nconference report? They are voting willingly to diminish their own \nindependence as legislators. No longer will they feel absolutely \nindependent to speak their minds concerning any President, any \nadministration or administration policies in their speeches on this \nFloor, and no longer will they exercise a complete and uninhibited \nindependence from the chief executive when casting their votes on \nmatters other than appropriation bills because they will know that the \nPresident, with this new and potent weapon in his arsenal, can punish \nthem and their constituencies for exercising their own free \nindependence in casting a vote against administration policies, against \npresidential nominees, against approval of the ratification of \ntreaties.\n  Now, Mr. President, I find in the New York Times of today that not \nonly I am concerned about this loss of independence that we will suffer \nif we adopt this conference report. In today's New York Times, I find \nan article by Robert Pear titled ``Judges' Group Condemns Line-Item \nVeto Bill.''\n  I will just read one paragraph as an excerpt therefrom. Here is what \nJudge Gilbert S. Merritt, chairman of the Executive Committee of the \nJudicial Conference, has to say: ``Judges were given life tenure to be \na barrier against the wind of temporary public opinion,'' said Judge \nMerritt. ``If we didn't have judicial independence, I'm not sure we \ncould maintain free speech and other constitutional liberties that we \ntake for granted.'' So the judges are concerned about judicial \nindependence. I am concerned about the independence of lawmakers once \nthis conference report becomes law.\n  Plutarch tells us that Eumenes came into the assembly, and delivered \nhimself in the following fable. It was a fable about a lion. ``A lion \nonce, falling in love with a young damsel, demanded her in marriage of \nher father. The father made answer, that he looked on such an alliance \nas a great honor to his family, but he stood in fear of the lion's \nclaws and teeth, lest, upon any trifling dispute that might happen \nbetween them after marriage, he might exercise them a little too \nhastily upon his daughter. To remove this objection, the amorous lion \ncaused both his nails and his teeth to be drawn immediately; whereupon, \nthe father took a cudgel, and soon got rid of his enemy. This,'' \ncontinued Eumenes, ``is the very thing aimed at by Antigonus, who is \nliberal in promises, till he has made himself master of your forces, \nand then beware of his teeth and claws.''\n  Mr. President, President Clinton wants this conference report. \nPresident Bush would have liked to have had it. President Reagan wanted \nit. All Presidents, with the exception of President Taft, have wanted \nthe veto power. So perhaps this President is about to be given the \npower which he will not be able to exercise, however, under its \nphraseology, unless and until he is reelected for the second term.\n  Mark my words, Mr. President, once he gets it--or any other \nPresident--then beware of his teeth and claws. Senator Byrd, you will \nnot be as independent in your exercise against freedom of speech, \nagainst the policies of an administration, once that President has in \nhis power this weapon. Beware of his teeth and claws. Senator Byrd, you \nmight not have voted against Clarence Thomas if the President had this \neffective weapon in his arsenal. I do not know about that.\n  In other words, Mr. President, this power of rescinding discretionary \nspending will not be used by a President to reduce the deficit. It is \nnot a deficit-reducing tool because it does not get at entitlements, \npast entitlements. They are one of the real causes of the deficit. This \nconference report does not get to them. It is not a deficit-reduction \ntool. Discretionary spending has already been cut to the bone. \nEntitlement spending, which is a real cause of growth in the deficits \ncannot be touched under this conference report. No. This new power of \nrescissions will be used by a President to threaten and coerce and \nintimidate members of the legislative branch to give the President what \nhe wants or he will cut the projects and programs that our constituents \nneed and want. It will be a sword of Damocles suspended over every \nMember.\n\n  This conference report, when it is examined in its minutest detail, \nwill constitute an inhibition on freedom of speech. It is going to \nconstitute an inhibition on the independence of judges. That is what \nthis judge feared. I say it will constitute an inhibition on freedom of \nspeech in both Houses, an inhibition on a Member's casting of votes on \nadministration policies, an inhibition on every Member's free and \nuntrammeled independence in carrying out his duties and \nresponsibilities toward the constituents who send him or her here. What \nSenator is willing to surrender his independence of thought and action \nand speech--we will see--to an already all-powerful executive, made \nmore powerful by a major share in the control of the purse strings \ngiven to him by this conference report, a power that no Chief Executive \nhas heretofore, in the course of over 200 years, shared.\n\n  The political leadership of the majority party in this Congress may \nreap temporary political gain from the enactment of this unwise \nmeasure, but the damage that will have been done to our constitutional \nsystem of checks and balances will constitute a stain upon the \nescutcheon of the Congress for a long time to come. As the Roman \nSenator Lucius Postumius Megellus said to the Tarentines: ``Men of \nTarentum, it will take not a little blood to wash this gown.'' It will \ntake not a little blood to wash this gown.\n  The majority party may reap an immediate and temporary political gain \nfrom this action, but in ``reaching to take of the fruit'' of this \namendment, its proponents--like those in Milton's ``Paradise Lost''--\nwill ``chew dust and bitter ashes.''\n  In a March 10, 1993, hearing before the House Government Operations \nCommittee, Mr. Milton Socolar, Special Assistant to the Comptroller \nGeneral of the United States, stated ``proposals to change the \nrescission process should be viewed primarily in terms of their effect \non the balance of power between the Congress and the President with \nrespect to discretionary program priorities.'' He went on to say that \nenhanced rescission authority ``would constitute a major shift of power \nfrom the Congress to the President in an area that was reserved to the \nCongress by the Constitution and historically has been one of clear \nlegislative prerogative.''\n  Mr. President, once this shift of power to the President takes place, \nit will not be recovered by the legislative branch. Any bill to take it \naway from the President will be vetoed summarily and the prospects of \noverriding such a veto would be practically out of the question.\n\n     The moving finger writes; and, having writ,\n     moves on; nor all your piety nor wit\n     shall lure it back to cancel half a line,\n     nor all your tears wash out a word of it.\n\n  Senators should think long and hard before they agree to trade the \nlong-term harm that will be done to the structure of our government for \nthe short-term gain that might or might not come from passage of this \nbill. We\n\n[[Page S2942]]\n\nshould all stop and think about our Constitution, its system of checks \nand balances, and the wisdom of the Framers who placed the power of the \npurse here in this institution. We should all take the time to reread \nthe Constitution, particularly those who may not have done so lately. \nWe should reread it, and think about what that great document says \nbefore we agree to hand the type of enhanced rescission authority \ncontained in this conference report over to the executive branch.\n\n  Mr. President, press reports tell us that this so-called item veto \nbill would give the Republicans their biggest legislative achievement \nof the 104th Congress. What a sad commentary to think that a bill of \nthis quality, surrendering legislative power--the people's power \nthrough their elected representatives--and legislative responsibility \nto the President, and a bill so poorly drafted that we can only guess \nhow it will be implemented, is considered an achievement. I cannot \nbelieve that the 104th Congress is so bereft of accomplishment that \nthis bill represents its crowning glory.\n  Supporters of the item veto bill claim that it gives the President an \nessential tool in deleting ``wasteful'' federal projects and \nactivities. Let us not deceive ourselves or the voters. There is not \nthe slightest basis in our political history for believing that \nPresidents are peculiarly endowed by nature to oppose federal spending. \nPresidents like to spend money. They like proposing expensive new \nprojects and programs, and they like to wield power, especially over \nthe Members of the legislative branch. The national highway system, \nlanding on the Moon, and Star Wars are some of the presidential \ninitiatives.\n  The joint explanatory statement of the conference committee states \nthat a January 1992 GAO report indicates that a line item veto ``could \nhave a significant impact upon federal spending, concluding that if \nPresidents had applied this authority to all matters objected to in \nStatements of Administration Policy on spending bills in the fiscal \nyears 1984 through 1989, spending could have been reduced by a six-year \ntotal of about $70 billion.'' The fact is that the Comptroller General \nlater apologized for this report, acknowledging that it had serious \ndeficiencies and that the theoretical figure of $70 billion could not \nbe defended. Actual savings, he said, could have been ``close to \nzero.'' The Comptroller General even admitted that giving line item \nveto authority with the President could lead to higher spending, \nbecause the administration could use that authority to strike quid pro \nquos with legislators.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter to which I \nhave just referred, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               Comptroller General\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 1992.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is in response to your recent \n     letter concerning our report on the line item veto.\n       In reviewing the report and the way it has been \n     interpreted, it is now apparent that we were not sufficiently \n     clear about the purpose of the report or what we judged to be \n     its implications.\n       Let me emphasize that the analysis was not an attempt to \n     predict what would have happened if the President were \n     granted line item veto or line item reduction authority, only \n     to define the outer limits of potential item veto savings \n     during a particular period as a way of testing the assertion \n     that item veto authority would permit a President to achieve \n     a balanced budget.\n       Having defined an outer boundary for the possible budgetary \n     savings from a hypothetical line item veto, it necessarily \n     follows that the actual savings from such veto power are \n     likely to have been much less than this. As you suggest in \n     your letter, there are several reasons to believe that this \n     would have been the case:\n       The President might not have applied the veto to every item \n     to which objections were raised in the Statements of \n     Administration Position (SAPs).\n       Some vetoes might have been overridden by the Congress.\n       Some, perhaps all, of the savings resulting from successful \n     item vetoes might have been spent for other purposes which \n     were either acceptable to the President or commanded \n     sufficiently broad support in the Congress to override a \n     veto.\n       Thus, depending on how the President chose to use the \n     hypothetical item veto power and how the Congress responded, \n     it seems likely that the actual savings could have been \n     substantially less than the maximum and maybe, as you have \n     suggested, close to zero. Indeed, one can conceive of \n     situations in which the net effect of item veto power would \n     be to increase spending. This could be the result, for \n     example, if a President chose to announce his intent to \n     exercise an item veto against programs or projects favored by \n     individual Senators and Representatives as a means of gaining \n     their support for spending programs which would not otherwise \n     have been enacted by the Congress.\n       We attempted in the report to make it clear that we were \n     developing an estimate of the theoretical maximum potential \n     savings, not a prediction of the likely actual results. We \n     cited the limited empirical evidence as suggesting that the \n     actual use of an item veto would likely produce savings \n     substantially smaller than the theoretical maximum but \n     apparently we were not as clear in this regard as we had \n     thought. We regret the inappropriate highlighting of the $70 \n     billion total amount and the way it was characterized, which \n     undoubtedly contributed to a misleading impression of the \n     purpose and import of our analysis.\n       Finally, I regret that this report, which was undertaken on \n     our own initiative, was not discussed with you before the \n     assignment was begun and that it was addressed to you without \n     your having been apprised of that intention. I have taken \n     steps to assure that it will not happen again.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                           Charles A. Bowsher,\n\n                                               Comptroller General\n                                             of the United States.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Let us speak plainly. This bill changes the existing \nprocess the President uses to rescind, or terminate, appropriated \nfunds. That process takes place after the President signs a bill into \nlaw. It does not operate when he is signing a bill, as is the case with \nthe real item veto used by governors. It is a misnomer to call this \nbill an item veto.\n  Why do we not talk straight to the American people? Do we think they \nare unable to understand what we do in Washington, DC? How can we \njustify using false language and false concepts? This bill has nothing \nto do with an item veto. It is a change in the rescission process.\n  This executive attitude of ``We know best'' persists from decade to \ndecade. The President's Economic Report for 1985 includes a discussion \nabout the pros and cons of the item veto. It admits that there is \nlittle basis to conclude from the State experience that an item veto \nwould have a substantial effect on Federal expenditures. In fact, it \nsays that ``per capita spending is somewhat higher in States where the \nGovernor has the authority for a line-item veto, even corrected for the \nmajor conditions that affect the distribution of spending among \nStates.''\n  There are other constitutional problems with this bill. First, this \nbill will have a serious impact on the independence of the Federal \njudiciary. With enhanced rescission authority the President can delete \njudicial items, perhaps for punitive reasons. He has no such authority \nnow.\n  Second, this bill contains a number of legislative vetoes declared \nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the 1983 Chadha case. The \nCourt said that whenever Congress wants to alter the rights, duties, \nand relations outside the legislative branch, it must act through the \nfull legislative process, including bicameralism and presentment of a \nbill to the President. Congress could not, said the Court, rely on \nmechanisms short of a public law to control the President or the \nexecutive branch. The item veto bill, however, relies on details in the \nconference report to determine to what extent the President can propose \nrescissions of budget authority.\n  Third, this bill enables the President to make law or unmake law \nwithout Congress. If Congress fails to respond to the President's \nrescission proposals within the thirty-day period, his proposals become \nlaw. In fact, as soon as the rescission message is submitted to \nCongress, the President's proposal takes effect. If Congress has to \ncomply with bicameralism and presentment in making law, how can the \nPresident make law and unmake law unilaterally?\n  Constitutional problems in the bill? Proponents say not to worry. \nSection 3 authorizes expedited review of constitutional challenges. Any \nmember of Congress or any individual adversely affected by the item \nveto bill may bring an action, in the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia, for\n\n[[Page S2943]]\n\ndeclaratory judgment and injunctive relief on the ground that a \nprovision violates the Constitution. Any order of the district court \nshall be reviewable by appeal directly to the Supreme Court. It shall \nbe the duty of both the district court and the Supreme Court to advance \non the docket and to expedite to the greatest possible extent the \ndisposition of a case challenging the constitutionality of the item \nveto bill.\n  Evidently the authors of this legislation had substantial concern \nabout the constitutionality of their handiwork. A provision for \nexpedited review to resolve constitutional issues is not boilerplate in \nmost bills. You may remember that when we included a provision for \nexpedited review in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1985, the result \nwas a Supreme Court opinion that held that the procedure giving the \nComptroller General the power to determine sequestration of funds \nviolated the Constitution.\n  Why are we trying to pass a bill that raises such serious and \nsubstantial constitutional questions? We should be resolving those \nquestions on our own. All of us take an oath of office to support and \ndefend the Constitution. During the process of considering a bill, it \nis our duty to identify--and correct--constitutional problems. We \ncannot correct these here because we cannot amend the conference \nreport. It is irresponsible to simply punt to the courts, hoping that \nthe judiciary will somehow catch our mistakes.\n  As to the first constitutional issue: the impact that this bill might \nhave on the independence of the judiciary. That is what the judges are \nconcerned about, as reported by the New York Times today. Under this \nlegislation, the President can propose rescissions for any type of \nbudget item, regardless of whether it is for the executive, \nlegislative, or judicial branch.\n  There is no exemption for the judiciary and certainly none for \nCongress. The President has full latitude to look through any bill and \npropose that certain funds and tax benefits be cancelled.\n  The item veto bill would allow the President to rescind funds for all \nof the judiciary except for the salaries of Article III Justices and \njudges. Anything else funds for courthouses, staff, expenses, etc. is \nsubject to rescissions. Are these selections to be made solely for \neconomy and ``savings,'' or could they be retaliations for court \ndecisions the executive branch finds disappointing? Probably we would \nnever know, but the appearance of executive punishment for unwelcome \ndecisions would be ever with us.\n  Given the fact that the executive branch is the most active litigant \nin federal courts, allowing the President this kind of leverage over \nthe judiciary is improper and unwise. Furthermore, it represents a \ndistinct danger to the independence of the judiciary. The availability \nof the rescission power, especially under the procedures of this bill, \nraises a clear issue of separation of powers and has constitutional \ndimensions.\n  If the President includes judicial items in a rescission proposal, \njudges would have to enter the political fray and lobby against the \nPresident. This is unseemly, whether the judges lobby openly or behind \nthe scenes. They should not be put in that position, as this bill does.\n  Judges understand that they have to justify their budgets to Congress \nlike any other agency, legislative or executive. But we have designed \nthe process to protect their independence from the executive branch.\n  For example, the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 specifically \nprovided that budgetary estimates for the Supreme Court ``shall be \ntransmitted to the President on or before October 15th of each year, \nand shall be included by him in the Budget without revision.'' Congress \nwrote the 1921 statute this way not only for purposes of comity but to \nrespect the coequal status of the judiciary. As the law now stands, in \nthe U.S. Code, budget estimates for the entire judicial branch must be \nincluded in the President's budget without change.\n  Nevertheless, this item veto bill allows the President to reach into \nappropriations, to reach into conference reports, to reach into the \nstatement of the managers, to reach into the tables and charts, and \npick out judicial items for rescission. Last year, in testimony before \nthe joint hearings conducted by the House Committee on Government \nReform and Oversight and the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, \nJudge Gilbert S. Merritt testified that it ``seems inconsistent to \nprohibit the Executive Branch from changing the Judiciary's budget \nprior to submission, but then to give the President unilateral \nauthority to revise an enacted budget.'' His point is well taken. \nCertainly it is inconsistent. It cannot be justified.\n  More recently, the Judicial Conference of the United States has \nexpressed its concern about the application of the item veto bill to \njudicial funds. It believes that there may be constitutional \nimplications in giving the President this authority and notes that the \ndoctrine of separation of powers recognizes the importance of \nprotecting the judiciary against presidential interference. As the \nJudicial Conference points out, control of the judiciary's budget \nrightly belongs to Congress, not the executive branch. In light of the \nfact that the United States almost operating through the executive \nbranch has more lawsuits in federal court than any other litigant, this \nrescission authority endangers the integrity and fairness of our \nfederal courts. Judicial decisions should not be affected in any way, \nhowever remote, by potential budget actions by the executive branch.\n  Not only did Congress recognize this fundamental principal in the \nBudget and Accounting Act, it expressed the same value in legislation \nenacted in 1939. Although the 1921 statute prohibited the President \nfrom altering judicial budget estimates, the judiciary lacked a \nseparate administrative office to prepare and implement its own budget. \nOddly, it had to rely on the Department of Justice for this work. It \nwas the Attorney General who prepared and presented to the Bureau of \nthe Budget the estimates for judicial expenses. Several Attorneys \nGeneral considered it ``anomalous and potentially threatening to \nthe independence of the courts'' for the chief litigant the Department \nof Justice to have any control over the preparation of judicial \nbudgets.\n\n  This anomaly was corrected by legislation in 1939 that created the \nAdministration Office of the United States Courts, with the director \nappointed by the Supreme Court. The director prepared budget estimates \nsubmitted to the Bureau of the Budget and later to the Office of \nManagement and Budget. The legislative history of the 1939 statute \nhighlighted the need to protect the independence and integrity of the \ncourts. In 1937 the Attorney General said that,\n\n       * * * there is something inherently illogical in the \n     present system of having the budget and expenditures of the \n     courts and the individual judges under the jurisdiction of \n     the Department of Justice. The courts should be an \n     independent, coordinate branch of the Government in every \n     proper sense of the term. Accordingly I recommend legislation \n     that would provide for the creation and maintenance of such \n     an administrative system under the control and direction of \n     the Supreme Court.\n\n  On January 8, 1938, an article in the Washington Post pointed out \nthat the Federal Government was the chief litigant in the federal \ncourts. While there was no intention on the part of the newspaper \n``even to intimate that the Attorney General or his aides would use \ntheir power over the purse strings of the judiciary to bring a \nrecalcitrant judge into line,'' the mere fact that the Attorney General \n``could do so if he wished constitutes a factor in the relationship \nbetween the Justice Department and the courts which should be \neliminated.''\n  During floor debate on the bill creating the Administrative Office of \nthe U.S. Courts, Senator Henry Ashurst, chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, came to the same conclusion. ``No one believes,'' he said, \n``that either the present Attorney General or the preceding one would \nuse his position to attempt to intimidate any judge; but we know enough \nabout human nature to know that no man, not even a judge, is coldly \nimpersonal and objective with one who holds the purse strings.'' In his \ntestimony last year, Judge Merritt said that during the years between \n1921 and 1939 the Budget Bureau had ``refused to pass on requests for \nnew judgeships'' and the Department of Justice ``cut judges' travel \nfunds, eliminated bailiffs, criers and messengers, and reduced\n\n[[Page S2944]]\n\nthe salaries of secretaries to retired judges by one-half.''\n  The judiciary should not be subject to the rescission requests made \nunder this item veto bill. If such a bill were to pass, it is crucial \nto give a full exemption to the judiciary. Exempting the judiciary does \nnot mean that the courts would escape the current pressure for \nbudgetary cutbacks. Judges would still have to present their budget \nestimates to Congress and defend them. As Judge Merritt noted in his \ntestimony last year, the judiciary's budget requests ``are subjected to \nfull review by the congressional appropriations committees in keeping \nwith the fiscal power conferred on Congress by the Constitution. The \nJudiciary must justify each dollar it receives. This is appropriate and \nthe Judiciary cheerfully respects this role of Congress.'' Scrutiny of \njudicial budgets should be in the hands of Congress, not the President.\n  I turn now to the issue of the legislative veto. This bill gives the \nPresident the authority to cancel any dollar amount of discretionary \nbudget authority, any item of new direct spending, and any limited tax \nbenefit. This authority applies to any ``appropriation law,'' defined \nin the bill to mean any general or special appropriation act, or any \nact making supplemental, deficiency, or continuing appropriations \n``that has been signed into law pursuant to Article I, section 7, of \nthe Constitution of the United States.''\n  Notice that the enhanced rescission authority applies only to \nappropriations bills ``signed into law'' by the President. This is a \nvery peculiar feature. If the President vetoes a bill and the veto is \noverridden, the enhanced rescission authority is not available. \nSimilarly, if the President decides not to sign an appropriations bill \nand it becomes law after ten days, Sundays excepted, the President may \nnot use the enhanced rescission authority either. You will recall that \nPresident Clinton last December allowed the defense appropriations bill \nto become law without his signature.\n  Why does the enhanced rescission authority apply only to signed \nbills? If the goal is to maximize the opportunity for the President to \nrescind ``wasteful'' funds, why restrict the President this way? What \nis the purpose? Perhaps we are saying that if the President vetoes a \nbill and Congress overrides the veto, this second action by Congress \nshould settle the matter. Congress has reaffirmed and reinforced the \npriorities established in the bill. Those priorities are not to be \nsecond-guessed in a rescission action.\n\n  Clearly this provision puts some pressure on a President not to \nexercise his constitutional right of veto which is set forth in section \n7 of article I of the Constitution of the United States. If he vetoes \nand is overridden, the enhanced rescission procedure is not available. \nI doubt it we have thought through the merits and demerits of \ndiscouraging a veto.\n  The new procedure--this so-called line-item veto, enabling the \nPresident to simply cancel items of spending with which he does not \nagree, will make him, in fact, a super legislator. It will discourage \nhim from using his existing constitutional veto powers to veto an \nentire bill, and encourage him to try to ``fix'' legislation with which \nhe does not fully agree by canceling only portions of the bill. He will \nbe the lawmaker sui generis because his cancellations will in practical \neffect, be absolute. There will be no recourse--no way to override his \ncancellations under the convoluted, stack-deck procedures set forth in \nthis conference report.\n  The temptation to simply do a ``cut and paste'' job on spending \nbills, thereby foregoing the route of a full Presidential veto of an \nentire bill which might then be overridden will, it seems to me, be \nnearly overwhelming. As a result, we will have a President who not only \n``proposes,'' but also ``deposes,'' in other words a super lawmaker in \nthe White House circumventing in yet another way the principle of \nmajority rule.\n  Additionally, such an approach will have the effect of discouraging a \nPresident from vetoing a whole bill, and thus through consensus and \ncompromise and negotiations between the two branches, develop a new and \nbetter total product which he could then sign.\n  If the goal of this bill is to allow the President to rescind \nappropriations for projects and programs he objects to, we all know \nthat appropriations bills contain large lump-sum amounts. We don't put \ndetails, or items, in appropriations bills. How does the President \nreach that level of detail?\n  The answer is that this bill allows the President to rescind dollar \namounts that appear not merely in a bill but also in the conference \nreport and the statement of managers included in the conference report. \nHere is where the issue of the legislative veto emerges. As defined in \nthis bill, the term dollar amount of discretionary budget authority \nincludes the entire dollar amount of budget authority ``represented \nseparately in any table, chart, or explanatory text included in the \nstatement of managers or the governing committee report accompanying \nsuch law.'' The dollar amount of discretionary budget authority also \nincludes the entire dollar amount of budget authority ``represented by \nthe product of the estimated procurement cost and the total quantity of \nitems specified in an appropriation law or included in the statement of \nmanagers or the governing committee report accompanying such law.''\n  In INS v. Chadha (1983), the Supreme Court ruled that whenever \ncongressional action has the ``purpose and effect of altering the legal \nrights, duties and relations of persons'' outside the legislative \nbranch, it must act through both Houses in a bill or joint resolution \nthat is presented to the President. In other words, we cannot act by \none House or even by both Houses in a concurrent resolution, because a \nconcurrent resolution is not presented to the President. Nor can we act \nby committee or subcommittee. Anything that has the purpose and effect \nof altering the legal rights, duties, and relations outside Congress \nmust comply fully bicameralism and presentment.\n  What of these details and items that appear in a conference report or \nin the statement of managers? This is a nonstatutory source. It \ncomplies with bicameralism but not with presentation. How can it bind \nthe President?\n  I recognize that proponents of this bill can argue that the \nconference report and the statement of managers will continue to be \nnonbinding on the President in the management of these particular laws. \nTo a certain extent that is true. The joint explanatory statement for \nthis bill states: ``The inclusion of subparagraph (A)(ii) is not \nintended to give increased legal weight of authority to documents that \naccompany the law that is enacted.'' For example, if Congress in a \nconference report takes a lump sum of $800 million and breaks it into \none hundred discrete projects, the breakdown is nonstatutory and \nnonbinding with regard to implementing the law. The executive branch \nmay depart from the breakdown over the course of a fiscal year. What is \nlegally binding is the ceiling of $800 million. If the executive branch \ndecides that it would like to shift money from one project to another, \nit can do that by following established reprogramming procedures. The \nbreakdown, in that sense, is advisory.\n\n  But when it comes to submitting the rescission proposals, the \nbreakdown in the conference report and the statement of managers is \nabsolutely binding. If Congress decides to omit the breakdown in the \nconference report and the statement of managers, the President is \nlimited to the lump sums and aggregates found in the bill signed into \nlaw.\n  It could be argued that any breakdown in the conference report and \nthe statement of managers is a benefit to the President. Itemization \ncreates an opportunity for the President he would not otherwise have. \nWhy should he complain?\n  The constitutional point I raise is not answered by saying that the \nprocedure might benefit the President. When Congress chose to authorize \nthe Attorney General to suspend the deportation of aliens, subject to a \none-House veto, that was a benefit. Without that authority the Attorney \nGeneral would have to seek a private bill for each threatened alien. \nBut the fact that this procedure constituted a benefit or advantage to \nthe Attorney General, and that the Attorney General was better off with \nthis mechanism than the previous one, did not save the one-House veto. \nIn the Chadha case, the Court asked the specific question: did the one-\nHouse legislative veto comply with\n\n[[Page S2945]]\n\nbicameralism and presentment? Clearly it failed both tests.\n  Similarly, Presidents sought authority to reorganize the executive \nbranch and accepted the one-House veto that went with this delegation. \nReorganization authority offered many benefits to the executive branch. \nCongress could not amend a presidential reorganization plan and it \ncould not bury it in committee. The presidential plan would become law \nunless either House disapproved within a specific time period. Distinct \nand clear advantages to the President, but that did not save the one-\nHouse veto. Chadha said that this mechanism is unconstitutional for \nprocedural reasons.\n  That returns us to my central question: Does the use of conference \nreports and statements of managers constitute an attempt by Congress to \ncontrol the President short of passing a public law? Is this procedure \na forbidden legislative veto? Whether it is a benefit, advantage, or \nopportunity for the President is irrelevant in answering this \nconstitutional question.\n  Let me put this another way. Suppose we itemize the $800 million lump \nsum into a hundred specific projects in the conference report and \nstatement of managers. Suppose further that Congress becomes unhappy \nwith the President's subsequent rescission proposal and decides to \nretaliate the next year by eliminating all details in the conference \nreport and statement of managers. Now the President is limited to the \nlump sum of $800 million in the bill. He can live with it or decide to \npropose the rescission of that full amount. Can any one doubt that \nCongress, in something that is short of a public law, is controlling \nthe President this time in a negative or restrictive way?\n  Measure that fact against the explicit language of the Court in the \nChadha case. In examining the one-House veto over the suspension of \ndeportations, the Court concluded that the congressional action was \n``essentially legislative in purpose and effect.'' 462 U.S. at 952. Can \nanyone doubt that the congressional action in making language in a \nconference report and statement of managers the explicit guide for \npresidential rescissions is ``essentially legislative in purpose and \neffect''?\n  Moreover, the Court in Chadha decided that the disapproval by the \nHouse of suspended deportations ``had the purpose and effect of \naltering the legal rights, duties, and relations of persons'' outside \nthe legislative branch. Again, there can be no uncertainty about the \npurpose and effect of the conference report and the statement of \nmanagers. They have the purpose and effect of altering the legal \nrights, duties, and relations of the President in submitting \nrescissions.\n  Proponents of this bill may claim that it will be beneficial and \nconstructive. We may differ on that score, but there can be no doubt \nabout how the Court will react to such arguments. In Chadha, the Court \nsaid that ``the fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, \nconvenient, and useful in facilitating the functions of government, \nstanding alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the \nConstitution.'' 462 U.S. at 944.\n\n  The question remains: Does this bill square with the Chadha ruling? \nIf it does not, we are being asked to consciously adopt a bill that we \nknow is unconstitutional, whatever merit its proponents may claim for \nit. All of us are capable of analyzing this issue. If the procedure \nestablished in this bill amounts to a legislative veto prohibited by \nthe Chadha case, we are violating our oath of office in passing this \nbill. If enhanced rescission is of value, then we must vote down this \nbill and insist that its supporters construct an alternative bill that \nmeets the constitutional test. To simply kick this issue to the courts \nis irresponsible.\n  It is curious that Chadha told Congress that if you want to make law \nyou must follow the entire process, bicameralism and presentment, and \nyet this bill allows the President to make law and unmake law without \nany legislative involvement. Under the terms of this conference report, \nwhenever Congress receives the President's special message on \nrescissions, the ``cancellation of any dollar amount of discretionary \nbudget authority, item of new direct spending, or limited tax benefit \nshall take effect.'' The cancellation is ``effective'' upon receipt by \nCongress of the special message notifying Congress of the cancellation. \nWhy is the cancellation ``effective'' before Congress has an \nopportunity to respond to the President's message? The executive branch \nmay have legitimate reasons to make sure that agencies do not obligate \nfunds that are being proposed for cancellation, but the language in \nthis bill is offensive to the role of Congress in canceling prior law.\n  Of course the bill gives Congress thirty days to disapprove the \nPresident, subject to the President's veto and the need then for a two-\nthirds majority in each for the override. If Congress does nothing \nduring the thirty day review period, the President's proposals become \nbinding and the laws previously passed and enacted are undone. Through \nthis process the President can make and unmake law without any \nnecessary legislative action. How does that square with the intent and \nspirit of Chadha? Are we to argue that the President can make, or \nunmake, law singlehandedly and unilaterally, but Congress is compelled \nto follow the full lawmaking scheme laid out in the Constitution?\n  I earlier stated that placing details in a conference report and \nstatement of managers violates Chadha because this phase of the \nlegislative process is something short of a public law. It should be \npointed out that in some legislative vehicles, like continuing \nresolutions, Congress incorporates by reference phases of the \nlegislative process that are also short of a public law, such as a bill \nreported by committee or a bill that has passed one chamber. Yet those \nphases of the legislative process are in a vehicle--continuing \nresolution--that must pass both Houses and be presented to the \nPresident for his signature or veto. These precedents offer no support \nfor the procedure adopted in this bill. The reference to committee \nreport language in the item veto conference report does not comply with \nChadha.\n  This is an enormous shift of power to the President but we cannot be \nsure that the courts will reverse such an abdication. If Congress is \nunwilling to protect its prerogatives, the courts won't always \nintervene to do Congress' work for it. As Justice Robert Jackson said \nin the Steel Seizure Case of 1952: ``I have no illusion that any \ndecision by this Court can keep power in the hands of Congress if it is \nnot wise and timely in meeting its problems. * * * We may say that \npower to legislate for emergencies belongs in the hands of Congress, \nbut only Congress itself can prevent power from slipping through its \nfingers.''\n  On March 2, 1805, Vice President Aaron Burr bid adieu to the Senate, \nstepping down to make way for the new Vice President, George Clinton, \nwho had been elected to serve during Jefferson's second term. Burr's \nfarewell speech, according to those who heard it, was received with \nsuch emotion that Senators were brought to tears and stop their \nbusiness for a full half hour. It was truly one of the great speeches \nin the Senate's history: ``This House,'' said Burr that day, ``is a \nsanctuary; a citadel of law, of order, and of liberty; and it is here--\nit is here in this exalted refuge; here, if anywhere, will resistance \nbe made to the storms of political phrensy and the silent arts of \ncorruption; and if the Constitution be destined ever to perish by the \nsacrilegious hands of the demagogue or the usurper, which God avert, \nits expiring agonies will be witnessed on this Floor.''\n  I regret to say, Mr. President, that, in my opinion, before this day \nis done, the ingenious prescience of Aaron Burr will have made itself \nmanifest in the fateful events that will inevitably unfold and which \nwill be witnessed on this Floor.\n  Philosophers, in their dreams, had constructed ideal governments. \nPlato had luxuriated in the bliss of his fanciful Republic. Sir Thomas \nMore had taken great satisfaction in the refulgent visions of his \nUtopia. The immortal Milton had expressed his exalted vision of \nfreedom. Locke has published his elevated thoughts on the two \nprinciples of government. But never, until the establishment of \nAmerican independence and the drafting and ratification of that charter \nwhich embodied in it the checks and balances and separation of powers \nof our own constitutional system, was it ever acknowledged by a people, \nand made the cornerstone of its government, that the\n\n[[Page S2946]]\n\nsovereign power is vested in the masses.\n  It was just such a noble attachment to a free constitution which \nraised ancient Rome from the smallest beginnings to the bright summit \nof happiness and glory to which the Republic arrived, and it was the \nloss of that noble attachment to a free constitution that plunged her \nfrom that summit into the black gulf of indolence, infamy, the loss of \nliberty, and made her the slave of blood thirsty dictators and \ntyrannical emperors.\n  It was then that the Roman Senate lost its independence, and her \nSenators, forgetful of their honor and dignity, and seduced by base \ncorruption, betrayed their country. Her Praetorian soldiers urged only \nby the hopes of plunder and luxury, unfeelingly committed the most \nflagrant enormities, and with relentless fury perpetrated the most \ncruel murders, whereby the streets of imperial Rome were drenched with \nher noblest blood. Thus, the empress of the world lost her dominions \nabroad, and her inhabitants dissolute in their manners, at length \nbecame contented slaves, and the pages of her history reveal to this \nday a monument of the eternal truth that public happiness depends on an \nunshaken attachment to a free constitution.\n  And it is this attachment to the Constitution that has preserved the \ncause of liberty and freedom throughout our land and which today \nundergirds the noble experiment that never has ceased to inspire \nmankind throughout all the earth.\n  The gathered wisdom of a thousand years cries out against this \nconference report. The history of England for centuries is against this \nconference report. The declarations of the men who framed our \nConstitution stand in its way.\n  Let us resolve that our children will have cause to bless the memory \nof their fathers, as we have cause to bless the memory of ours.\n  Let us not have the arrogance to throw away centuries of English \nhistory and over 200 years of the American experience for political \nexpediency. No party, Republican or Democrat, is worth the price that \nthis conference report will exact from us and our children. Considering \nthe fact that only about 7 percent of the regular vetoes have been \noverridden over a period of more than 200 years, it stands to reason \nthat even a much smaller percentage of vetoes of disapproval bills will \nbe overridden--keeping in mind that the presidential vetoes over the \nperiod of two centuries have been vetoes of measures which, in the \nmain, have had national significance; the relatively few disapproval \nbills which will be vetoed under the conference report before the \nSenate will not likely be measures of national importance but will be \nof importance to only one or a few states, or perhaps a region at most, \nand it is very unlikely that the vetoes of disapproval bills will \narouse sufficient sentiment in both Houses to produce a two-thirds vote \nto override. Hence, the President's single act of rescinding an \nappropriation item will be tantamount to its being stricken from the \nlaw.\n  This is an enormous power for the Legislative Branch to transfer into \nthe hands of any President. The power to rescind will be tantamount to \nthe power to amend, and this conference report will transfer to any \nPresident the power to single-handedly amend a measure after it has \nbecome law whereas a majority of both Houses is required to amend a \nbill by striking an item from the bill. The President will be handed \nthe power to strike an item from a law which, if done by action of the \nLegislative Branch, would require the votes of 51 Senators and 218 \nmembers of the House, if all members were in attendance and voting. \nWhat an enormous legislative power to place in the hands of any \nPresident!\n  Mr. President, let us learn from the pages of Rome's history. The \nbasic lesson that we should remember for our purposes here is, that \nwhen the Roman Senate gave away its control of the purse strings, it \ngave away its power to check the executive. From that point on, the \nSenate declined and, as we have seen, it was only a matter of time. \nOnce the mainstay was weakened, the structure crumbled and the Roman \nrepublic collapsed.\n  This lesson is as true today as it was two thousand years ago. Does \nanyone really imagine that the splendors of our capital city stand or \nfall with mansions, monuments, buildings, and piles of masonry? These \nare but bricks and mortar, lifeless things, and their collapse or \nrestoration means little or nothing when measured on the great clock-\ntower of time.\n  But the survival of the American constitutional system, the \nfoundation upon which the superstructure of the republic rests, finds \nits firmest support in the continued preservation of the delicate \nmechanism of checks and balances, separation of powers, and control of \nthe purse, solemnly instituted by the Founding Fathers. For over two \nhundred years, from the beginning of the republic to this very hour, it \nhas survived in unbroken continuity. We received it from our fathers. \nLet us as surely hand it on to our sons and daughters.\n  Mr. President, I close my reflections with the words of Daniel \nWebster from his speech in 1832 on the centennial anniversary of George \nWashington's birthday:\n\n       Other misfortunes may be borne or their effects overcome. \n     If disastrous war should sweep our commerce from the ocean, \n     another generation may renew it. If it exhaust our Treasury, \n     future industry may replenish it. If it desolate and lay \n     waste our fields, still, under a new cultivation, they will \n     grow green again and ripen to future harvests. It were but a \n     trifle even if the walls of yonder Capitol were to crumble, \n     if its lofty pillars should fall, and its gorgeous \n     decorations be all covered by the dust of the valley. All \n     these might be rebuilt. But who shall reconstruct the fabric \n     of demolished government? Who shall rear again the well-\n     proportioned columns of constitutional liberty? Who shall \n     frame together the skillful architecture which unites \n     national sovereignty with State rights, individual security, \n     and public prosperity? No. If these columns fall, they will \n     be raised not again. Like the Colosseum and the Parthenon, \n     they will be destined to a mournful, a melancholy \n     immortality. Bitterer tears, however, will flow over them \n     than were ever shed over the monuments of Roman or Grecian \n     art. For they will be the remnants of a more glorious edifice \n     than Greece or Rome ever saw: the edifice of constitutional \n     American liberty.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe newspaper article to which I alluded earlier today under the \nheadline of ``Judges' Group Condemns Line-Item Veto Bill''--that is an \narticle from the New York Times--together with a letter addressed to me \nby Leonidas Ralph Mecham, Secretary of the Judicial Conference of the \nUnited States, in which he expresses concern with respect to the \nconference report before the Senate; an item from the Legal Times, the \nweek of March 25, 1996, entitled ``Points of View: Loosening the Glue \nof Democracy, the Line-Item Veto Would Discourage Congressional \nCompromise.'' The article is by Abner J. Mikva, a retired judge who \nserved on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, a former \nWhite House counsel for President Clinton, and a former Member of the \nU.S. House of Representatives. He served as chief judge in the D.C. \ncircuit from 1991 to 1994.\n  Mr. President, with the permission of the distinguished Senator from \nNew York [Mr. Moynihan], I ask unanimous consent that a letter from \nMichael Gerhardt, a professor of law at the College of William and \nMary, also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 27, 1996]\n\n               Judges' Group Condemns Line-Item Veto Bill\n\n                            (By Robert Pear)\n\n       Washington, March 26.--The organization that represents \n     Federal judges across the country today denounced a plan \n     developed by Republican leaders of Congress that would allow \n     the President to kill specific items in spending bills.\n       The organization, the Judicial Conference of the United \n     States, said such authority posed a threat to the \n     independence of the judiciary because a President could put \n     pressure on the courts or retaliate against judges by vetoing \n     items in judicial appropriations bills.\n       The proposal would shift power to the President from \n     Congress, permitting him to block particular items in a \n     spending bill without having to veto the entire measure. \n     Early last year the House and Senate approved different \n     versions of the proposal, known as a line-item veto. Recently \n     they struck a compromise, which is expected to win approval \n     in both chambers this week. President Clinton supports it.\n       But any line-item veto bill signed by the President is sure \n     to be challenged in court, and today's criticism from the \n     Judicial Conference suggests that it may get a chilly \n     reception.\n\n[[Page S2947]]\n\n       Judge Gilbert S. Merritt, chairman of the executive \n     committee of the Judicial Conference, said it was unwise to \n     give the President authority over the judicial budget because \n     the executive branch was the biggest litigant in Federal \n     court, with tens of thousands of cases a year.\n       The potential for conflict of interest is obvious, said \n     Judge Merritt, who is also chief judge of the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The court's \n     headquarters are in Cincinnati: Judge Merritt's chambers are \n     in Nashville.\n       In approving the line-item veto, Congress said it was \n     necessary to curb ``runaway Federal spending.'' But in an \n     interview, Judge Merritt said the inclusion of the judiciary \n     among agencies subject to the line-item veto was ``a rather \n     serious defect'' in the bill.\n       The line-item veto was a major element of the Republicans' \n     Contract With America and is a top priority of Senator Bob \n     Dole, the majority leader, who has all but clinched the \n     Republican nomination for President. The House passed its \n     version of the line-item veto in February 1995, by a vote of \n     294 to 134. The Senate approved its version, 69 to 29, in \n     March 1995, with 19 Democrats supporting it.\n       Under the compromise struck this month, the President could \n     cancel spending for projects listed in tables and charts that \n     accompany a bill, as well as in the bill itself. He could \n     also cancel any new tax break that benefits 100 people or \n     fewer.\n       Alan B. Morrison, a lawyer at the Public Citizen Litigation \n     Group who has successfully challenged several unconventional \n     law-making procedures, said: ``In my view, this bill is \n     unconstitutional. It certainly will be challenged in court.''\n       Mr. Morrison said the line-item veto trampled on the \n     procedure set forth in the Constitution for making law. Under \n     that procedure, he said, the President may veto whole bills \n     but not pieces of a bill.\n       In recent weeks, the decisions of several Federal judges \n     have been harshly criticized by the White House and \n     Republican candidates for President. Judges said such \n     criticism highlighted the need for judicial independence.\n       ``Judges were given life tenure to be a barrier against the \n     winds of temporary public opinion,'' said Judge Merritt. ``If \n     we didn't have judicial independence, I'm not sure we could \n     maintain free speech and other constitutional liberties that \n     we take for granted.''\n       In a letter to Congress, L. Ralph Mecham, secretary of the \n     Judicial Conference, said: ``The doctrine of separation of \n     powers recognizes the vital importance of protecting the \n     judiciary against interference from any President. This \n     protection needs to endure. Control of the judiciary's budget \n     rightly belongs to the Congress and not the executive \n     branch.''\n       Judge Richard S. Arnold, chairmen of the budget committee \n     of the Judicial Conference, said in an interview: ``We don't \n     have any qualms about this particular President, but \n     institutionally we have reservations about providing any \n     President with a weapon that could, in the wrong hands, be \n     used to retaliate against the courts for deciding cases \n     against the Federal Government.''\n       Judge Arnold, a longtime friend of Mr. Clinton, is chief \n     judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth \n     Circuit, which has its headquarters in St. Louis. Judge \n     Arnold sits in Little Rock, Ark.\n       The Federal judiciary has a budget of $3 billion a year, \n     accounting for two-tenths of 1 percent of the $1.5 trillion \n     spent last year by the Federal Government. Congress may not \n     reduce the salary of a sitting Federal judge, but may cut the \n     budget for court clerks, secretaries, probation officers and \n     security officers, as well as for judicial travel.\n       In the interview today, Judge Merritt described the judges' \n     concern about the line-item veto this way: ``If for some \n     reason the President, whoever he may be, is irritated about \n     something the judiciary has done, he could excise the \n     appropriation for a particular court or a particular judicial \n     function.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Judicial Conference\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 21, 1996.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: I understand an agreement has been \n     reached between Republican negotiators on ``line-item veto'' \n     legislation. Although we have not seen a draft of the \n     agreement to determine the extent to which the Judiciary \n     might be affected, I did not want to delay communicating with \n     you. The Judiciary had concerns over some previous versions \n     of the legislation that were considered by the House and \n     Senate. These concerns could also apply to the version on \n     which agreement was just reached, depending on how it is \n     drafted.\n       The Judiciary believes there may be constitutional \n     implications if the President is given independent authority \n     to make line-item vetoes of its appropriations acts. The \n     doctrine of separation of powers recognizes the vital \n     important of protecting the Judiciary against interference \n     from any President.\n       Protection of the Judiciary by Congress against \n     Presidential power and potential intervention is also evident \n     in the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, which ensures that \n     the financial affairs of the Judiciary be insulated from \n     political influence by the President and his staff. Prior to \n     this Act, the Judiciary's budget was controlled by the \n     Executive Branch. Now, by law, requests for judicial branch \n     appropriations must be submitted to the President by the \n     Judiciary, but must by transmitted by him to Congress \n     ``without change''.\n       This protection needs to endure. Control of the Judiciary's \n     budget rightly belongs to the Congress and not the Executive \n     Branch, particularly in light of the fact that the United \n     States, almost always through the Executive Branch, has more \n     lawsuits in the Federal courts than any other litigant. The \n     integrity and fairness of our Federal Courts should not be \n     endangered by the potential of Executive Branch political \n     influence.\n       In whatever agreement is ultimately reached by the \n     conference committee, on behalf of the Judicial Conference of \n     the United States, I urge that the independence of the Third \n     Branch of Government be preserved.\n       I appreciate your consideration and we stand ready to \n     assist you in any way necessary.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Leonidas Ralph Mecham,\n     Secretary.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Legal Times, Mar. 25, 1996]\n\n                    Loosening the Glue of Democracy\n\n                          (By Abner J. Mikva)\n\n       There is a certain hardiness to the idea of a line-item \n     veto that causes it to keep coming back. Presidents, of \n     course, have always wanted it because the line-item veto \n     represents a substantial transfer of power from the \n     legislative branch to the executive branch. Government \n     purists favor the idea because the current appropriations \n     process--whereby all kinds of disparate expenditures are \n     wrapped or ``bundled'' into one bill so that the president \n     must either swallow the whole thing or veto the whole thing--\n     is very messy and wasteful. Reformers generally urge such a \n     change because anything that curtails the power of Congress \n     to spend has to be good.\n       My bias against the unbundling of appropriations and other \n     legislative proposals has changed over the years. When I \n     first saw the appropriations process, back in the Illinois \n     legislature, it seemed the height of irresponsibility to \n     bundle dozens of purposes into a single bill. It also seemed \n     unconstitutional since the Illinois Constitution had a \n     ``single purpose'' clause, under which bills considered by \n     the legislature were to contain only one subject matter. But \n     the ``single purpose'' clause had been observed in the breach \n     for many years by the time I was elected in 1956.\n       I first saw the bundling process work when a single bill, \n     presented for final passage, appropriated money for both the \n     Fair Employment Practices Commission and a host of other \n     commissions, including one to provide services for Spanish-\n     American War veterans (there were two left in the state at \n     the time) and one to study the size of mosquitoes that \n     inhabited the downstate portions of Illinois. If I wanted to \n     vote for the FEPC, I had to swallow all those other \n     commissions, which I thought were wasteful. So I invoked the \n     constitutional clause. to my dismay, the legislature favored \n     all the other commissions on separate votes, but the FEPC \n     went down to defeat. That is how I learned that there are \n     some pluses to the bundling process.\n       Bundling is very asymmetrical in effect and probably \n     wasteful. But it is also a legislative device that allows \n     various coalitions to form and thus moves the legislative \n     process forward.\n       Consider South America, where regional rivalries and \n     resentments in many countries make governing very difficult. \n     The inability to form the political coalitions that are \n     normal in this country creates enormous pressure on the \n     central government. This pressure is certainly one of the \n     causes of the mini-revolts that perpetually arise. The have-\n     nots feel excluded from the process, while the majority for \n     the military regime) exercise their power without taking care \n     of the depressed areas of the country.\n       It is more difficult to ignore the have-notes in the United \n     States. First of all, members of Congress are elected as \n     representatives of geographic areas, rather than as \n     representatives of parties. Woe betide the congressman who \n     starts thinking too much like a national legislator and \n     forgets the parochial interests of his constituents.\n       Second, the separate elections of the president and \n     Congress creates the necessity for the two branches to \n     cooperate in setting spending priorities. Floating coalitions \n     that take into account the needs of all the sections and \n     groups in the country become essential. When urban interests \n     wanted to promote a food program for the cities, for example, \n     They formed a coalition with agricultural interests, and food \n     stamps were joined with farm subsidies.\n       It is true that bundling encourages the merger of bad ideas \n     with good ideas, and diminishes the ability of the president \n     to undo the package. A line-item veto, which would allow the \n     president to veto any single piece of an appropriations bill \n     (or, under some proposals, reject disparate pieces of any \n     other bill), makes the whole process more rational.\n       But it also makes it harder to find the glue that holds the \n     disparate parts of our country together. City people usually \n     don't care about dams and farm policy. Their rural cousin \n     don't think much about mass transportation or urban renewal \n     or housing policy. If the two groups of representatives don't \n     have anything to bargain about, it is unlikely that either \n     set of concerns will receive appropriate attention.\n       The other downside to the line-item veto is exactly the \n     reason why almost all presidents\n\n[[Page S2948]]\n\n     want the change and why, up to now, most Congresses have \n     resisted the idea. The line-item veto transfers an enormous \n     amount of power from Congress to the president. For those of \n     us who think that the executive branch is strong enough, and \n     that an imperial presidency is more of a threat than an \n     overpowering Congress, the current balance of power is just \n     right.\n       That has been the gist of Sen. Robert Byrd's opposition to \n     the line-item veto. The West Virginia Democrat has argued \n     that the appropriations power, the power of the purse, is the \n     only real power that Congress has and that the line-item veto \n     would diminish that power substantially. So far, he has \n     prevailed--although last year, the reason he prevailed had \n     more to do with the Republicans' unwillingness to give such a \n     powerful tool to President Bill Clinton.\n       But now the political dynamics have changed. The \n     Republicans in Congress can fashion a line-item veto that \n     will not benefit the incumbent president--unless he gets \n     relected--and their probable presidential candidate, Senate \n     Majority Leader Robert Dole, has recently made clear that he \n     wants this passed. Chances for the line-item veto are vastly \n     greater.\n       There are some constitutional problems in creating such a \n     procedure. The wording of the Constitution suggests pretty \n     strongly that a bill is presented to the president for his \n     signature or veto in its entirety. It will take some creative \n     legislating to overcome such a ``Technicality.'' I \n     reluctantly advised the president last year that it was \n     possible to draft a line-item veto law that would pass \n     constitutional muster. The draft proposal involved a Rube \n     Goldberg plan that ``pretended'' that the omnibus \n     appropriations legislation passed by Congress and presented \n     to the president actually consists of separate bills for \n     various purposes. This pretense was effectuated by putting \n     language in legislation to that effect.\n       President Clinton was not then asking for my policy views, \n     and I did not have to reconcile my advice with my policy bias \n     toward the first branch of government--Congress. But I was \n     uneasy enough to become more sympathetic to the late Justice \n     Robert Jackson's handling of a similar dilemma in one of the \n     Supreme Court opinions. He acknowledged his apostasy \n     concerning an issue on which he had opined to the contrary \n     during his tenure as attorney general. Quoting another, \n     Justice Jackson wrote, ``The matter does not appear to me now \n     as it appears to have appeared to me then.''\n       My apostasy was less public. My memo to the president was \n     only an internal document, and I didn't have to tell him how \n     I felt about the line-item veto. But now that I have no \n     representational responsibilities, I prefer to stand with \n     Sen. Byrd.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         The College of William & Mary, School of Law.\n                                 Williamsburg, VA, March 27, 1996.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: I appreciate the chance to share \n     with you my opinion on the constitutionality of the Line Item \n     Veto Act of 1996, as set forth in the Conference Report, \n     dated March 4, 1996 (hereinafter ``the Republican draft'' or \n     ``the Conference Report''). In this letter, I focus only on a \n     few of the more serious problems with the Republican Draft \n     and do not purport to analyze exhaustively its \n     constitutionality. Even no, I am of the view that, given just \n     the few significant flaws in the Conference Report that I \n     identify and explain below, its constitutionality is plainly \n     doomed.\n       Describing how the law works is crucial for identifying and \n     understanding the constitutional and practical problems posed \n     by some of its major provisions. As I read it, the critical \n     delegation made by the Republican draft to the President is \n     the authority to ``cancel'' all or any part of \n     ``discretionary budget authority,'' ``any item of direct \n     spending,'' or ``any targeted tax benefit.'' Presumably, a \n     presidential cancellation pursuant to the act has the effect \n     of nullifying a portion of a budgetary or appropriations bill \n     unless a majority of each chamber of Congress agrees within a \n     specific time period to pass a ``disapproval bill'' \n     specifying it intention to reauthorize the particular item \n     cancelled by the President. The President may veto the \n     disapproval bill, which can then become law only if two-\n     thirds of each chamber of Congress agree to override his \n     veto.\n       In my opinion, there are three fatal constitutional \n     problems with the procedures outlined above. First, the law \n     effectively allows any portion of a bill enacted by Congress \n     that the President signs into law but does not cancel to \n     become law, in spite of the fact that Congress will have \n     never voted on it as such. This kind of lawmaking by the \n     President clearly violates Article I, section 1, which grants \n     ``[a]ll legislative powers'' to Congress, and Article I, \n     section 7, which grants to Congress alone the discretion to \n     package bills as it sees fit.\n       Article I states further that the President's veto power \n     applies to ``every Bill . . ., Every Order, Resolution or \n     Veto to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives may be necessary.'' \\1\\ This means the \n     President may wield his veto on the legislative product only, \n     as Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe maintains in his \n     treatise, ``in the form in which Congress has chosen to send \n     it to the White House: be the bill small or large, its \n     concerns focused or diffuse, its form particular or omnibus, \n     the President must accept or reject the entire thing, \n     swallowing the bitter with the sweet.'' \\2\\ Tribe's \n     subsequent change of position is of no consequence, because \n     he was right in his initial understanding of the \n     constitutional dynamics of a statutorily created line-item \n     veto mechanism. The fact that the President has signed the \n     law as enacted is irrelevant, because a law is valid only if \n     it takes effect in the precise configuration approved by the \n     Congress. The President does not have the authority to put \n     into effect as a law only part of what Congress has passed as \n     such. The particular form a bill should have as a law is, as \n     the Supreme Court has said, the ``kind of decision that can \n     be implemented only in accordance with the procedures set out \n     in Article I.'' \\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Conference Report would enable the President to make \n     affirmative budgetary choices that the framers definitely \n     wanted to preclude him from making. The framers deliberately \n     chose to place the power of the purse outside of the \n     executive because they feared the consequences of \n     centralizing the powers of the purse and the sword. As James \n     Madison wrote in the Federalist No. 58, ``This power of the \n     purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and \n     effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the \n     immediate representatives of the people.'' \\4\\ Every Congress \n     (until perhaps this most recent one)--as well as all of the \n     early presidents, for that matter--has shared the \n     understandings that only the Congress has the authority to \n     decide how to package legislation, that this authority is a \n     crucial component of checks and balances, and that the \n     President's veto authority is strictly a negative power that \n     enables him to strike down but not to rewrite whatever a \n     majority of Congress has sent to him as a bill.\n       The wisdom of leaving the power of the purse in Congress, \n     as the framers desired as a means of checking the executive, \n     is buttressed by the recognition that pork barrel \n     appropriations--the evil sought to be eliminated by the \n     Republican draft--are just unattractive examples of \n     legislating for diverse interests, which is the very stuff of \n     representative government. Apportioning the public fisc in a \n     large and diverse nation requires degrees of coordination and \n     compromise that the framers left to the initial discretion of \n     Congress to be undone only as specified in Article I.\n       The second constitutional defect with the Conference \n     Report's basic procedures involves the legitimacy of the \n     cancelling authority given to the President. Proponents of \n     this cancellation power defend it as a legitimate delegation \n     of congressional authority to the President; however, this \n     argument rests on a misunderstanding of the relevant \n     constitutional doctrine. This misunderstanding is reflected \n     in the CRS Report, which claims erroneously that ``while \n     the [Supreme] Court has used a balancing test in some \n     separation of powers cases, it has never chosen to do so \n     in delegation cases.'' \\5\\ The latter assertion is simply \n     wrong.\n       In fact, the Supreme Court has issued two lines of cases on \n     congressional delegations. The first, which is not implicated \n     by the Conference Report, involves delegations from Congress \n     to administrative agencies or inferior bodies. The Court \n     tends to evaluate such delegations under a ``functionalist'' \n     approach to separation of powers under which the Court \n     balances the competing concerns or interests at stake to \n     ensure that the core function of a branch is not frustrated. \n     For example, the Court used this approach in Morrison v. \n     Olson \\6\\ to uphold the Independent Counsel Act in which the \n     Congress had delegated the executive function of criminal \n     prosecution to an individual not formally associated with any \n     of the three branches. Similarly, in Mistretta v. United \n     States, \\7\\ the Court upheld the constitutionality of the \n     composition and lawmaking function of the United States \n     Sentencing Commission, at least three of whose members are \n     required by statute to be lower court judges and to which the \n     Congress delegated the authorities to promulgate, review, and \n     revise sentence-determinative guidelines.\n       The Republican Draft clearly violates, however, the second \n     line of Supreme Court decisions on congressional delegations. \n     These cases involve delegations from Congress to the titular \n     head of a branch, such as one of its chambers or the \n     President. In these cases, the Court has not used a balancing \n     test; rather, the Court has used a ``formalist'' approach \n     that treats the Constitution as granting to each branch \n     distinct powers and setting forth the maximum degree to which \n     the branches may share those powers. A formalist approach to \n     separation of powers treats the text of the Constitution and \n     the intent of its drafters as controlling and changed \n     circumstances and broader policy outcomes as irrelevant to \n     constitutional outcomes. In recent years, the Court has used \n     this approach to strike down the legislative veto in Chadha \n     because it would have allowed one House to take legislative \n     action without complying with the procedures set forth in \n     Article I; to hold in Bowsher v. Synar \\8\\ that Congress may \n     not delegate executive budgetary functions to an official \n     over whom Congress has removal power; and to strike down in \n     Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens for the Abatement \n     of Aircraft Noise \\9\\ the creation of a Board of Review \n     partially composed of members of Congress with executive \n     veto-like power over the decisions of the directors of the \n     Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.\n\n[[Page S2949]]\n\n       Undoubtedly, the Court would follow a formalist approach in \n     striking down the Republican draft. For one thing, the Court \n     would not be able to escape applying the logic of Bowsher v. \n     Synar to the proposed law. Whereas the crucial problem \n     Bowsher was Congress' attempt to authorize the exercise of \n     certain executive authority by a legislative agent--the \n     Comptroller General, here the problem is that the President \n     would plainly be exercising what everyone agrees is \n     legislative authority--the discretion to determine the \n     particular configuration of a bill that will become law. Even \n     the law's proponent's admit it allows the President to \n     exercise legislative authority, albeit in their view \n     delegated to him by Congress.\n       Formalist analysis would be appropriate in evaluating such \n     a delegation's constitutionality because it would be the kind \n     about which the framers were most concerned; the checks and \n     balances set forth in the Constitution deal directly with how \n     the titular heads of each branch should interrelate. Hence, \n     the Court has opted for a formalist approach to deal with \n     delegations between the branches at their respective apexes \n     to preclude one branch from aggrandizing itself at the \n     expense of another. The Conference Report would clearly \n     undermine the balance of power between the branches at the \n     top, because it would eliminate the Congress's primacy in the \n     budget area and would unravel the framers' considered \n     judgment to restrict the President's role in the lawmaking \n     process to a qualified negative rather than to have him \n     exercise an affirmative power to redraft or reconfigure a \n     bill.\n       Even if the Court used a functionalist approach to evaluate \n     the constitutionality of the Republican draft, it would \n     strike down the proposed law. The reason is that the law \n     establishes an uneven playing field for the President and \n     Congress on budgetary matters. In so doing, it profoundly \n     alters the balance of power set forth in the Constitution. As \n     Professor Tribe recognizes further in his treatise, such a \n     scheme ``would enable the President to nullify new \n     congressional sending initiatives and priorities as well as \n     to wipe out previously enacted programs that receive their \n     funding through the annual appropriations process. Congress, \n     which the Constitution makes the master of the public purse, \n     would be demoted to the role of giving fiscal advice that the \n     President would be effectively free to disregard.\\10\\ Once \n     again Tribe's subsequent change of position does not \n     undermine the soundness of his initial reasoning, for the \n     historical record is clear that the framers, as Tribe has \n     recognized himself, never intended nor tried to grant the \n     President any ``special veto power over appropriation bills, \n     despite their awareness that the insistence of colonial \n     assemblies that their spending bills could not be amended \n     once they had passed the lower house had greatly enhanced the \n     growth of legislative power.\\11\\\n       An example should illustrate the problematic features of \n     the proposed cancellation mechanism. Suppose that 55% of \n     Congress passes a law, including expenditures for a new \n     Veterans Administration hospital in New York. The President \n     decides he would prefer for Congress not to spend any federal \n     money on this project, so, after signing the bill into law, \n     he exercises his authority to cancel the allocations made for \n     the new facility. Again 55% of the Congress agrees to make \n     this expenditure but this time through the passage of a \n     disapproval bill. The President vetoes the latter, and \n     Congress fails to override his veto, with only 55% of \n     Congress (yet again) voting for the appropriation. The net \n     effect is that the President would get to refuse to spend \n     money 55% of the Congress will have thrice said it wanted to \n     spend. Thus, the Conference Report would require Congress to \n     vote as many as three separate times to fund something while \n     assuming in the process an increasingly defensive posture \n     vis-a-vis the President. In other words, the Republican draft \n     allows the President to force Congress to go through two \n     majority votes--the second of which is much more difficult to \n     attain because it would have to be in favor of a specific \n     expenditure that is now severed from the other items of the \n     compromise giving rise to its inclusion in the first place--\n     and one supermajority vote in order to put into law a \n     particular expenditure.\n       A third constitutional problem with the Conference Report \n     involves the constraints it tries to place on the President's \n     cancellation authority. The latter if for all intents and \n     purposes a veto. It has the effect of a veto because it \n     forces Congress in the midst of the lawmaking process into \n     repassing something as a bill that ultimately must carry a \n     supermajority of each chamber in order to become law. \n     Nevertheless, the Conference Report attempts to constrain the \n     reasons the President may have for cancelling some part of a \n     budget or appropriations bill. Just as Congress lacks the \n     authority through legislation to enhance presidential \n     authority in the lawmaking process by empowering him to \n     reconfigure what Congress has passed as a bill into some \n     other form prior to its becoming a law, Congress lacks the \n     authority to restrict presidential authority by limiting the \n     grounds a president may consider as appropriate for vetoing \n     something.\n       Even apart from whatever constitutional problems the \n     Conference Report may have, it poses two serious practical \n     problems. First, the possibility for substantial judicial \n     review of presidential or congressional compliance with the \n     Republican draft is quite high. For example, it seems likely \n     that lawsuits could be brought challenging whether the \n     President has appropriately considered, as the act directs, \n     such things as ``the legislative history'' or ``any specific \n     sources of information referenced in such law or, in the \n     absence of specific sources of information, the best \n     available information'' or ``the specific definitions \n     contained'' within it. At the very least, the bill requires \n     that the President make some showing that he has done these \n     things to the satisfaction of members of Congress (or at \n     least those disposed to bring a lawsuit in the absence of \n     such a showing). There are also numerous procedures OMB and \n     each house of Congress must follow that, presumably, could \n     become the basis for judicial challenge if not done \n     completely to the satisfaction of partisan foes in the other \n     branch. In addition, there may be some questions as whether \n     the President has in fact complied with Congress' or the \n     Republican draft's understanding of the kinds of items he may \n     cancel, such as a ``targeted tax benefit.''\n       The likely prospect of substantial judicial interference \n     with the budgetary process is unsettling. The framers \n     deliberately excluded the unelected federal judiciary from \n     exercising any kind of decisive role in budgetary \n     negotiations or deliberations. The Republican draft does not \n     ensure that this exclusion will always be honored. The \n     framers wanted all of the key decisionmakers within budget \n     negotiations to be politically accountable; any budgetary \n     impasse between the President and Congress that the federal \n     courts help to resolve in favor of one or the other will \n     simply diminish even further the public's confidence that the \n     political process is the place to turn for answers to such \n     deadlocks.\n       Another practical difficulty is with the authorization made \n     by the Republican draft to the Joint Committee on Taxation to \n     render an official opinion, which may become a part of a \n     budgetary or appropriations measure, on whether it ``contains \n     any targeted tax benefit.'' The bill precludes the House or \n     the Senate from taking issue with the judgment of the Joint \n     Committee's finding. As a practical matter, this empowers a \n     small number of members of Congress to impose their will on \n     the whole body. Although this might have the salutary effect \n     of expediting the passage of the covered legislation, it \n     forces those members of Congress who disagree with the Joint \n     Committee to express their disagreement only by voting down \n     rather than by trying to amend a bill that they otherwise \n     would support.\n       In summary, I believe that the Republican draft conflicts \n     with the plain language, structure, and traditional \n     understanding of the lawmaking procedure set forth in Article \n     I; relevant Supreme Court doctrine; and the delicate balance \n     of power between Congress and the President on budget \n     matters. I am confident that the Supreme Court ultimately \n     would strike the bill down if it were passed by Congress and \n     signed into law by the President.\n       It has been a privilege for me to share my opinions about \n     the Conference Report with you.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. How much time \nhave we used on our side in favor of the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has used 38 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes of the time under my \ncontrol to the distinguished senior Senator from Oregon, [Mr. \nHatfield].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his yielding \nme time.\n  Mr. President, a very interesting experience occurred this morning at \nthe Senate prayer breakfast. That is that former Senator Joseph Tydings \nfrom Maryland came to join us and some of the newer Senators sitting in \nour area, and we were informed about Senator Joe Tydings' father, \nSenator Millard Tydings, who represented the State of Maryland and had \na very interesting political experience; and that was that he stood up, \nas a Democrat, to the effort on the part of President Roosevelt in 1937 \nto alter the structure of the Supreme Court, and that, as a result, \nPresident Roosevelt undertook a purge in the 1938 elections of those \nSenators who blocked his effort to change the structure of the Supreme \nCourt which was in effect termed in those days ``to pack the Court.''\n  But he failed because the people of Maryland, as well as the people \nfrom Georgia, both returned those Senators that helped fight the \npacking of the Supreme Court--Democrats. They said, in effect, we \nsupport Mr. Roosevelt and the New Deal, but when he begins to tamper \nwith the separation of powers and the checks and balances that our \nforefathers established in the Constitution, President Roosevelt has \ngone too far.\n  Mind you, at that time, Mr. President, there were about 19 \nRepublicans sitting on this side of the aisle, out of the 96, and they \nhad what they called the Cherokee strip because there were not enough \nseats for the Democrats to stay on that side of the aisle, and they \ntook these back rows across this Senate and occupied those.\n  Senator Charles McNary of Oregon, with his little band of 19 \nSenators, with the assistance of the Democrats who would not support a \nDemocratic President in packing the Supreme Court, held Mr. Roosevelt's \neffort and blocked it.\n  Mr. Roosevelt was not suggesting that we change the Supreme Court in \nterms of its rulings and its duties, ``But just let me appoint one here \nand one there and one somewhere else when they get a certain age and \nthey have not retired,'' because he was facing a hostile Supreme Court \nwhich was knocking down his legislation point by point when they found \nit to be unconstitutional.\n\n  Mr. President, this is the greatest effort to shift the balance of \npower to the White House that has happened since Franklin Roosevelt \nattempted to pack the Supreme Court. He is asking, ``Oh, just give me a \nlittle veto here and a little veto there and a little veto somewhere \nelse, and I select.''\n  This is a concentration and transfer of power to the Chief Executive. \nI think it is contrary to sound constitutional practice. I am appalled \nthat my colleagues on the Republican side should help by leading the \neffort to give more power to the White House, more power to the \nPresident of the United States. I suppose this is a generational gap. I \ngrew up thinking only Franklin Roosevelt would ever be the President of \nthe United States. And the Republican cry was, ``He's leading us to a \ndictatorship,'' the concentration of power in the President's hands. \nThe Republican campaign songs, campaign speeches in campaign after \ncampaign, whether you were running for county sheriff or for Governor \nor for Senator, was to point to the fact that under the New Deal and \nPresident Roosevelt, they were concentrating power in the hands of the \nChief Executive. And they were.\n  But here we are now, anxious to say, ``Oh, please, Mr. President, \ntake this new power. We don't have the ability to exercise the \nconstitutional responsibility of creating and holding the purse \nstrings.''\n  That is what it is. Call it by any other name, it is still a transfer \nof power and an enhancement of power in the hands of the President. I \nthink it is a sad commentary on the responsibility and the history and \nthe constitutional duties of the U.S. Congress to say to the President, \n``We don't have the capability to exercise this, so we're going to dump \nit in your lap.''\n  That was the story we talked about this morning with Senator Joe \nTydings, because his father had the courage to stand firm as a Democrat \nagainst a Democratic President to stop this kind of imbalance that was \nbeing suggested by the President of the United States to add new \nmembers to the Supreme Court so he could have his total way. He \ncontrolled the Congress of the United States by extraordinary, \nextraordinary majorities. But it was the Supreme Court that got in his \nway. So he was going to change the structure of the Supreme Court so he \ncould have more power.\n  Now, here is an interesting thing. Here is a Republican-led effort to \ngive more power to a Democratic President. Maybe the election will \nchange that in November, but once you transfer that power, no matter \nwho is the President, you have transferred power to the other branch of \nGovernment.\n\n  One last little incident that I want to mention, and that is a few \nyears ago Frank Church, a Democratic Senator from Idaho--Senator Church \nhad been a strong supporter of President Johnson's Vietnam policy. The \nday came when he decided to join those of us who were opposing the \nVietnam policy, and he got up over there--and I can remember how he \nmade his speech, of stating his position now as an opponent of the \nVietnam war. In that speech he quoted Walter Lippmann, who was a very \nrenowned, very respected writer and had commented extensively on the \nissue of the Vietnam war.\n  So he quoted Walter Lippmann in his speech in saying, ``I now stand, \nand I hate to say this to President Johnson, but I have to now take my \nposition in opposition to the war policy.''\n\n[[Page S2955]]\n\n  Well, a week or so later Senator Church and Bethine, his wife, were \ndown at the White House for a social function that President Johnson \ninvited them to. As was the custom, they were going through the \nreceiving line to pay their respects to President Johnson. You say \ndifferent kinds of little remarks at that point to the President, very \nmuch a personal eyeball to eyeball. So Frank Church said to President \nJohnson, ``You know, I have this Idaho project, and it's going to be \ncoming down to the White House soon. I hope you'll help me on it.'' \nPresident Johnson looked him straight in the eye and said, ``Why don't \nyou go ask Walter Lippmann for it.'' ``Why don't you go ask Walter \nLippmann for it.''\n  I do not have to draw a picture to see the linkage in the President's \nmind that you have decided not to support me on a war policy, well, I \nprobably will be less than helpful to you on some kind of a project you \nhave in Idaho. It invites all sorts of mischief. I can imagine the days \nwhen I stood very much in the minority on this Senate floor in opposing \nthat Vietnam policy. I can very well imagine that I could have been \ngiven the same kind of treatment that he was extending to Frank Church, \nprobably more likely because I was a Republican.\n  But let me say, there is not a single Senator in this body who could \nnot become a target for that kind of political mischief exercised by a \nPresident when he wants your vote, when he needs your vote, when he, in \neffect, is demanding your vote. Then you stand there with your \nparticular constituency when you have some funding of some kind in the \nAppropriations Committee, and he can just take that pen of his and, \nbop, just knock you out of the box; or he can say, ``Now, I'll listen \nto your willingness to support me on this.''\n  Likewise, it invites political mischief in this body, the Congress. \nThey can load up a bill and say, ``Well, the President now will have to \nveto that. He'll have to take that kind of political stance. We can \nembarrass him by forcing him to veto that out of the bill.'' I do not \nthink we want to do that either.\n  I only wish that we would read our history, and remember that we came \nto this country to escape monarchies, dictators, czars, kaisers, and \nthose powerful executives that ran everything in their governments. We \ndeliberately set up three branches of government; we deliberately \nassigned different powers; at the same time, we had mixing of powers.\n\n  We are in the middle of an appropriation effort. There is not one way \nthe President of the United States can force us to appropriate a dollar \nwe do not want to appropriate. However, we cannot appropriate a dollar \nwithout the President's approval or veto. That is the mixing of powers. \nHe has legislative powers; we have executive powers. Consequently, we \nshould not tinker with something that has worked very well for over 200 \nyears in the separation of powers.\n  I want to say, I do not trust any President--I do not care whether he \nis Democrat or Republican--wanting to exercise all the power we want to \ngive to him. Every person in this body that votes for this in the \nyounger generations will live to see the day when it passes that they \nwill regret that they bestowed this kind of power on the Chief \nExecutive of the United States. It is contrary to our Republican \ndoctrine. We want diffusion of power. We want the diffusion and the \ndecentralization of power.\n  Yet the same Republicans that talk on the one hand about too much \npower in the Federal Government, we should give more power to local \ngovernment or more power to the private sector, are now wanting to \nbestow an additional amount of power on the Chief Executive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask that the time that was consumed by Mr. \nHatfield be charged against the 5 hours under my control and not \nagainst the time on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that prerogative. The time \nwill be charged that way.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield such time as I need. It will not \nbe very long. I do want to say at the beginning that I am of the \ngeneration of the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from \nOregon, and have taken the positions they have stated in the past.\n  I am here today to explain why I support this bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Whatever time is consumed by the Senator, I ask that it \nbe charged against the bill and not against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that prerogative. It will be \ncharged that way.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I was pleased to be able to file this \nconference report on S. 4, which is called the Line-Item Veto Act. If \nenacted, I believe it will be the most significant delegation of \nauthority by the Congress to the President since the Constitution was \nratified in 1789.\n  What the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Oregon has \nsaid is true. It is a major, major, change in the policy of the \nCongress toward the executive branch. It is a temporary delegation of \nauthority under this bill. This delegation is necessary and appropriate \nto help reduce the current Federal budget deficit, a deficit that I \nbelieve threatens to destroy the future well-being of our great Nation.\n  It is not without a lot of soul searching that I made the change in \nposition that I have made on this bill. Mr. President, 43 Governors \naround the country have some form of line-item veto authority, \nincluding my own Governor in Alaska. As Governor of California, Ronald \nReagan used the line-item veto authority to effectively reduce wasteful \nspending.\n  I have opposed this bill in the past because it did not cover the \nlargest culprits of wasteful spending: entitlements and tax breaks for \nspecial interests. Together, they account for hundreds of billions of \ndollars each year. I opposed this bill because I did not think that we \nwere committed to a balanced budget concept. This bill goes together \nwith the balanced budget amendment and the significant steps that the \nCongress took in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings procedures. In my judgment, \nthis bill will enable the President to assist in carrying out the \noriginal intention of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. At my request, the bill \nhas been expanded and broadened to cover not only appropriations for \nspecific projects but tax breaks and entitlements as well.\n\n  Today, Congress has the power to cut programs the President proposes \nthat we believe are unnecessary, but unless the President vetoes an \nentire appropriations bill, he is powerless to single out a specific \nproject he opposes. Likewise, unless he vetoes an entire tax bill, he \ncannot eliminate an unnecessary tax break designed to benefit only a \nnarrow, special interest. This bill gives the President those powers \ntemporarily.\n  In his annual State of the Union Address nearly 15 years ago, \nPresident Reagan came before us and asked us for the same power that \nGovernors have, the power the Governor of Alaska has, and that he \nenjoyed as the Governor of California. Today, we are giving a President \nwhat President Reagan requested, but it is enhanced, Mr. President. It \nis more than President Reagan requested. It has been a long time \ncoming, and I am pleased and hope that we will fulfill his dream. I \nwant everyone to understand it is much, much, greater than what \nPresident Reagan asked for.\n  I have supported this conference report because it includes the core \nconcept that I insisted on when the Senate considered S. 4 a year ago. \nThat was that the line-item authority would apply to all three areas of \nFederal spending. Until then, as I said before, the proposals for a \nline-item veto hit only appropriations and left those large culprits, \nentitlements and target tax breaks, untouched.\n  The conference report gives to the President the specific authority \nto cancel dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority, items of \nnew direct spending, and limited tax benefits in any law that is \nenacted after the effective date. This means the President will be able \nto line out specific items in all three areas of Federal spending, \nwhether it be appropriations, entitlements, or limited tax breaks.\n  The cancellation would be effective immediately and the money that is \nnot spent goes to deficit reduction. It is part of the budget process, \nin my opinion. Money that is saved because of the\n\n[[Page S2956]]\n\nexercise of the veto in this bill cannot be spent for any other purpose \nby the President or by Congress.\n  Now, much has been said in the press about the need for the line-item \nveto to control wasteful spending through the appropriations process. \nWe have heard from the former chair of the Appropriations Committee and \nthe current chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I still have \nhopes and dreams that I may be chair of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Many people wonder why I have changed my mind at this time. I think \nthat some Members here seem to miss the fact that the discretionary \nappropriations account only for 35 percent--not even 35 percent, but \napproximately 35 percent--of Federal spending. The remainder of Federal \nspending is mandatory, in the form of entitlements, tax breaks, \ninterest on the national debt, items we cannot control. There is no \nfigure available for the amount of revenue that is lost to the \nGovernment through these targeted tax breaks, what the conference \nreport now calls limited tax benefits.\n  If the Balanced Budget Act that Congress sent to the President had \nnot been vetoed, by fiscal year 2002 discretionary appropriations would \naccount only for 26 percent of Federal spending, a decrease of 9 \npercent even without the line-item veto. Let me repeat that: Congress \nagreed to a bill that the President vetoed that would have reduced the \nmoneys covered by the appropriations process within a 7-year-period by \n9 percent. The Congress already vetoed the prospect of an increase to \nthe extent of 9 percent, Mr. President. By contrast, entitlements under \nthe balanced budget bill that we passed and the President vetoed would \nhave grown from 55 percent to 60 percent of Federal spending. The \nincrease would continue. That was an increase of 5 percent in 7 years, \nwith interest on the national debt accounting for the balance of \nFederal expenditures.\n  To put it another way, Mr. President, in 1980 the Defense Department \naccounted for 23 percent of Federal spending while the Social Security \nAdministration accounted for 19 percent, and the Department of Health \nand Human Services 10 percent of total Federal spending. Seventeen \nyears later, the Department of Defense will get 17 percent; Social \nSecurity, 25 percent; Health and Human Services, 22 percent. In other \nwords, the Department of Defense continues to go down while Social \nSecurity and Health and Human Services continues to go up.\n\n  Defense spending is all discretionary. It would be subject to the \nline-item veto under the original concept. The other two agencies that \nhandle primarily entitlement programs would have been immune under the \noriginal line item veto concept.\n  This conference report allows the President to cancel new direct \nspending, which means any provision contained in nonappropriations laws \nwhich increase Federal spending above the current baseline. By allowing \nthe President to cancel increases in existing entitlement programs, or \nthe creation of new ones, the conference report provides the \nopportunity to control the explosive growth in mandatory spending. I \nbasically support this bill because it now will give us a tool to \nrequire the President to help us control the growth in nondiscretionary \nspending.\n  Now, I think that ought to be very clear. In the area of taxes, the \nconference report does not go as far as I would have liked. But it was \nthe best that we could get the conferees to agree to. Under our \nagreement, the President could cancel any limited tax benefit in a law \nunder one of two conditions:\n  First, if the law contains a list of specific provisions, identified \nby the Joint Committee on Taxation as meeting the definition of a \nlimited tax benefit in the conference report before the Senate now, \nthen the President may cancel any provision so identified.\n  Second, if the law does not contain such a list prepared by the Joint \nTax Committee, then the President may cancel any provision that meets \nthe definition, in his opinion, of the limited tax benefit contained in \nthis conference report. As I mentioned earlier, Mr. President, there is \nno ready list of revenue that has been lost to the Federal Government \nthrough targeted tax benefits. However, I believe it continues to run \ninto hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  In the analytical perspectives that accompanied the President's 1997 \nbudget, there is a table on pages 86 and 87 that I call to the Senate's \nattention. This lists the revenue that will be lost from major tax \nbreaks of the past. The largest is $70 billion in fiscal year 1997 for \nthe exclusion of employer contributions to medical insurance.\n  Over fiscal years 1997 to 2001, that exemption will cost the \nGovernment $423 billion. Let me repeat that in case anyone did not get \nthat. In the period of time between 1997 and 2001, in the exemption \nthat is already in one of the tax bills that exempts employer \ncontributions to medical insurance, we will lose revenues of $423 \nbillion. That is 75 percent of the entire discretionary budget that we \nare working on now in the Appropriations Committee.\n  The smallest tax break listed in the President's addendum is a \nspecial alternative tax on small property and casualty insurance \ncompanies. That provision will cost the Government, according to the \nPresident's statement, $25 million between 1997 and 2001.\n  It is impossible to tell from the table whether any of the provisions \nlisted would in fact meet the definition of limited tax benefits under \nthe conference report. I urge the Senate to remember that. It may well \nbe that, although we are starting toward an attempt to give the \nPresident the right to eliminate limited tax breaks, we may have so \ndefined limited tax breaks that they will never be touchable by the \nveto pen. But I think it illustrates my point that appropriations are \nnot now, nor will they be in the future, totally responsible for the \ncurrent Federal budget deficit. They are a part of it. They are a part \nof it, but the major part of it is the entitlement spending and the \nspecial tax breaks that account for so much of the problem.\n  In the case of appropriations, the President may cancel any dollar \namount identified in an appropriations bill itself, or in the \naccompanying statement of managers or committee reports.\n  In addition, if an authorizing law has the effect of requiring the \nexpenditure of funds provided in appropriations law for a particular \nprogram or project, the President may also cancel the dollar amount \nspecified in the authorization law. I am not sure how many Senators \nrealize that. But this is a very, very broad power we are delegating to \nthe President of the United States.\n  The delegation is carefully structured in order to precisely define \nthe President's authority.\n  In order to increase the President's discretion to cancel dollar \namounts, the conferees agreed to allow the President to use the \nstatement of managers or the governing committee report to identify \nthose dollar amounts.\n  However, in order to prevent disagreements between the President and \nCongress over the dollar amount that can be canceled, the conferees \nspecifically limited the President's authority to the entire dollar \namount specified by Congress in the particular document he references--\neither the law itself or an accompanying report.\n  In addition, the President is required to cancel the entire dollar \namount and may not cancel part of that dollar amount.\n  This limitation was included in order to ensure that the line item \nveto authority is not used to change policies adopted by the Congress \nthat deals with appropriations or increases in tax benefits or \nentitlements. The line item authority cannot, for example, be used to \nreduce the amount appropriated for B-2 bombers so that the number of \nthe bombers has changed. He must delete the entire amount to effect a \nchange in policy.\n  Likewise, the conferees made clear that the cancellation authority \ndoes not apply to any condition, limitation, or restriction on the \nexpenditure of funds or activities involving expenditure of funds.\n  This means, for example, that the President cannot cancel a \nprohibition on the expenditure of funds to implement a particular law \nor regulation.\n  The statement of managers before the Senate contains a number of \nspecific examples to illustrate the conferees' intent with respect to \nthose items the President may cancel in appropriations bills, and I \nwant to incorporate those in my remarks at the conclusion.\n\n[[Page S2957]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that they be printed following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lott). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as the Senator from New Mexico, Pete \nDomenici, said earlier today, this has been a difficult conference. \nSenator Domenici and his staff worked tirelessly on this conference \nreport and deserve much of the credit for it.\n  Let me review just briefly some of the differences that had to be \nresolved. In the House bill, there was an enhanced rescissions \napproach, while the Senate bill that went to conference used separate \nenrollment.\n  The House bill applied only to appropriations and targeted taxes, \nwhile the Senate bill applied to appropriations, any tax that favored \nany one group, and new entitlement programs as well.\n  The House bill made the President's line item veto of a program \neffective after a congressional review period, while the Senate used a \nconstitutional veto that was effective immediately.\n  The Senate bill contained a mandatory lockbox for deficit reduction. \nThe House bill did not.\n  The Senate bill contained a sunset, and the House bill did not.\n  The list can go on and on, but foremost among all of these issues \nwere real questions about just what it was that we were delegating to \nthe President, and if that delegation would be found constitutional.\n  After many long days and nights, and not a few testy meetings--and I \nmust say, these conferences were the most acrimonious I have faced in \n28 years--I believe that we have taken the best elements of both bills \nand created something that will work as Congress intends. I think it \nmay be too narrow, rather than too broad, before we are through.\n  More importantly, I think we have a clear delegation of authority to \nthe President for a specific purpose, and it is for the purpose of \ndeficit reduction. That is what will pass constitutional muster, and I \nurge Members to remember that.\n  This is a bill for deficit reduction that goes hand-in-hand with the \nconcept of a balanced budget bill, a bill to require the elimination of \na deficit. It is a mechanism to assist in congressional discipline to \nensure that the Congress and the executive branch exercise the \ndiscipline that is necessary to bring about an elimination of the \ndeficit that so plagues our future. It is not something that is a \npermanent change in constitutional power. If it is to be continued, \nthat is for someone who comes to this body after most of us will have \nleft. But, as a practical matter, I think it is a step that must be \ntaken if we are to demonstrate our complete commitment to the concept \nof eliminating a deficit and bringing about a balanced budget.\n\n  I want to congratulate the members of the conference. In particular, \nI want to point to the chairman of the Budget Committee, who was a \ncochairman of the Senate portion of the conference, and I point to \nSenators McCain and Coats, who brought the original concept to the \nfloor, and Chairmen Clinger and Solomon on the House side. Their hard \nwork helped to bring this bill together and bring it before the two \nbodies now.\n  We are all indebted to our majority leader, Senator Dole. He really \nheld our noses--and sometimes other things--to the grindstone.\n  I thank the current occupant of the chair, Senator Lott, for his role \nas the assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. President, this bill is really a significant bill. Anyone who \nthinks it is something that should be passed over lightly is wrong. It \nis a major change in the balance of Government power. It is really a \ncheck on the check of the checks and balances, as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  We are indebted to the staff who worked out many of the problems \nwhich we encountered with this bill. We would point them in the general \ndirection, and they came back with language and concepts that would \nfulfill our goal.\n  Earl Comstock, who is here with me now, on my personal staff; \nChristine Ciccone, who helped from the Governmental Affairs Committee; \nAustin Smythe, Bill Hoagland, Beth Felder, and Jennifer Smith on the \nBudget Committee; Mark Busey with Senator McCain; Sharon Soderstrom and \nMegan Gilly with Senator Coats; John Schall with Senator Dole; Monty \nTripp with Chairman Clinger; Eric Pelliter with Chairman Solomon; and \nWendy Selig with Congressman Goss.\n  We got to know them pretty well, Mr. President. Unfortunately, they \ngot to know us too well.\n  I think this is truly a momentous piece of legislation. I regret \ndeeply that I disagree with my good friend from West Virginia and my \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee now. In my judgment, if it is \nmy watch between the years 1997 and 2000, I intend to see to it that \nthe Appropriations Committee heeds this warning. If we take action \nwhich might lead to increases in the deficit, if we allow funds to be \nspent which are not necessary, I hope the President will use this \nauthority. If he uses his pen, as my good friend from West Virginia \nsuggests, in a political fashion--if any President does that, he or \nshe--during this period we are dealing with, then I think this is a \npowerful tool that will go away. The Congress will not allow the \nexecutive branch to have a power such as this to be exercised \nfrivolously or politically.\n  This is a change in the Government structure we are suggesting. We \nare suggesting that the President hold the pen which allows the \nCongress to carry out the discipline that it imposed on itself. Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings started this, Mr. President, and this bill that is \nbefore us today will continue the mechanisms of discipline to bring \nabout elimination of the deficit. I pray to the good Lord that we will \nsucceed this time.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I have asked that one page from this report be printed after my \nremarks. I call the Senate's attention to it. I do hope every Senator \nwill read it. It is on page 20, section 1021, line-item veto authority.\n  That is what this bill is, not what it is not, but that is what it \nis. I think Senators should realize that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   Excerpt From Statement of Managers\n\n       (7) Dollar Amount of Discretionary Budget Authority. The \n     term ``dollar amount of discretionary budget authority'' is \n     carefully defined in section 1026(7) in order to ensure that \n     the President's authority to cancel discretionary spending in \n     appropriation laws is clearly delineated. The conference \n     report delegates the authority to the President to cancel in \n     whole any dollar amount specified in an appropriation law.\n       In addition, to increase the President's discretion, the \n     conference report allows the President to cancel a dollar \n     amount of budget authority provided in an appropriation law \n     by specific amounts identified by the Congress in the \n     statement of managers, the governing committee report, or \n     other law. By limiting the delegation of authority, the \n     conferees intend to preclude arguments between the Executive \n     and Legislative Branches and to ensure that the delegation is \n     not overbroad or vague. As is described in further detail \n     below, the conferees have sought to provide the President the \n     ability to rescind entire dollar amounts, even if not \n     specified as a dollar amount in the law itself, so long as \n     the dollar amount can be clearly identified and is in an \n     indivisible whole with which Congress has previously agreed.\n       The conferees note that the definition specifically \n     excludes certain types of budget authority that are addressed \n     by other provisions in part C of title X, as well as any \n     restriction, condition, or limitation that Congress places on \n     the expenditure of budget authority or activities involving \n     such expenditure. The exclusion of restrictions, conditions, \n     or limitations is included to make clear that the President \n     may not use the authority delegated in section 1021(a) to \n     cancel anything other than a specific dollar amount of budget \n     authority.\n       The cancellation authority cannot be used to change, alter, \n     modify, or terminate any policy included by Congress, other \n     than by rescinding a dollar amount. Obviously, if the \n     Congress has included a restriction in the law that prohibits \n     the expenditure of budget authority for any activity, there \n     is no dollar amount to be rescinded by the President, nor \n     would any money be saved for use in reducing the federal \n     budget deficit, which is a requirement for the use of the \n     authority provided under section 1021(a).\n       As described in subparagraph (A)(i), the President many \n     cancel the entire dollar amount of budget authority specified \n     in an appropriation law. The term ``entire'' means just that; \n     the President may rescind, or ``line out'' the dollar amount \n     of budget authority specified in the law, so that the dollar \n     amount provided in the law becomes zero after the \n     cancellation. For example, in Public Law 104-37, the \n     Agriculture Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1996, \n     $49,486,000 was\n\n[[Page S2958]]\n\n     provided in the law for special grants for agriculture \n     research. Using the authority granted under section \n     1021(a)(1), as defined under section 1026(7)(A)(i), the \n     President could cancel only the entire $49,486,000.\n       Further, again under subparagraph (A)(i), if the \n     appropriation law does not include a specific dollar amount, \n     but does include a specific proviso that requires the \n     allocation of a specific dollar amount, then the President \n     may rescind the entire dollar amount that is required by the \n     proviso. A fictitious example of what the conferees intend in \n     this case follows:\n       An appropriation law includes a provision that states ``for \n     the operation and maintenance of the Army, $1,400,000,000, \n     provided Fort Fictitious is maintained at Fiscal Year 1995 \n     levels,''. In this instance, the President could ascertain \n     what the operation of Fort Fictitious cost in FY 1995, and \n     could rescind that entire amount from the $1.4 billion \n     provided for Army O The conferees note that the President \n     would have to take the entire dollar amount required to \n     operate Fort Fictitious in FY 1995, and could not simply take \n     part of that amount. It is intended to be an all or \n     nothing decision.\n       As a further specific illustration, the conferees note that \n     the General Construction Account in Public Law 104-46, the \n     Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1996, \n     states:\n       ``$804,573,000 to remain available until expended, of which \n     such sums as necessary pursuant to Public Law 99-662 shall be \n     derived from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, for one-half of \n     the costs of construction and rehabilitation of inland \n     waterways projects, including rehabilitation costs for the \n     Lock and Dam 25, Mississippi River, Illinois and Missouri . . \n     . ''\n       In this example, the President could cancel the entire \n     $804,573,000 or could cancel an amount equal to the entire \n     dollar amount that would be required to fund the \n     rehabilitation costs of the Lock and Dam 25 project, noting \n     in his message all information as required by section 1022.\n       In subparagraph (A)(11) the President is given the \n     authority to rescind the entire dollar amount represented \n     separately in any table, chart, or explanatory text included \n     in the statement of managers or the governing committee \n     report that accompanies an appropriation law. The term \n     ``governing committee report'' is included to address the \n     fact that the current practice in preparing the statement of \n     managers for a conference report on an appropriation law is \n     to simply address changes that were made in the statutory \n     language and the accompanying committee reports, thus leaving \n     intact and incorporating by reference tables, charts, and \n     explanatory text in one of the two committee reports that \n     were not modified by the conference.\n       An example of the authority described in subparagraph \n     (A)(ii) is found in the Conference Report accompanying the FY \n     1996 Military Construction Appropriations Act (Public Law \n     104-32). The statement of managers accompanying the \n     conference report contains a chart denoting allocations of \n     dollars to various installations and projects. On page 38 \n     there is an allocation of $10,400,000 for a physical fitness \n     center at the Bremerton Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. Except \n     for this chart there is no other reference to the physical \n     fitness center in either the statute or narrative explanation \n     in the Conference Report. under the authority provided by the \n     definition in subparagraph (A)(ii), the President could \n     cancel the entire $10,400,000 provided for the physical \n     fitness center, but could not cancel only a part of that \n     amount.\n       The inclusion of subparagraph (A)(ii) is not intended to \n     give increased legal weight or authority to documents that \n     accompany the law that is enacted. Rather, as an exercise of \n     its authority to specify the terms of the delegation to the \n     President, Congress is choosing to use those documents as a \n     means of allowing the President increased discretion to \n     reduce dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority \n     provided in an appropriation law. In order to ensure that the \n     delegated authority is clear, the conferees have limited that \n     authority to dollar amounts identified by Congress in the \n     appropriation law, the accompanying statement of managers, \n     the governing committee report or other law. Since Congress \n     often provides detailed identification of dollar amounts in \n     the accompanying documents, they represent an agreed upon set \n     of dollar amounts that the President may rescind in their \n     entirety.\n       Subparagraph (A)(iii) has been included by the conferees to \n     address a specific circumstance where neither the \n     appropriation law nor the accompanying statement of managers \n     or committee reports include any itemization of a dollar \n     amount provided in that appropriation law. However, another \n     law mandates that some portion of the dollar amount provided \n     in the appropriation law be allocated to a specific program, \n     project, or activity that can be quantified as a specific \n     dollar amount. In this case, the President could rescind the \n     entire dollar amount required to be allocated by the other \n     law, since that dollar amount has been identified by Congress \n     as a specific dollar amount that must be spent. As is the \n     case with the earlier provisions, the President could not \n     rescind part of the dollar amount mandated by the other law. \n     It is an all or nothing decision. Likewise, the President \n     could not use the cancellation authority to change, alter, or \n     modify in any what the other law.\n       An example of the authority provided in subparagraph \n     (A)(iii) is found in section 132 of Public Law 104-106, the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996. \n     Section 132 states that ``Of the amounts appropriated for \n     Fiscal Year 1996 in the National Defense Sealift Fund, \n     $50,000,000 shall be available only for the Director of the \n     Advanced Research Projects Agency for advanced submarine \n     technology activities.'' In this example the President could \n     ``look through'' the appropriation law to the authorization \n     law that mandates that $50 million is available only for \n     advanced submarine technology activities, and could cancel \n     the entire $50 million.\n       However, had the appropriation law contained a provision \n     that contradicted or otherwise made the mandate in the \n     authorization law ineffective with respect to the allocation \n     of the National Sealift Fund, then the President would not be \n     able to use the amount in the authorization law as the basis \n     for the cancellation of a dollar amount of discretionary \n     budget authority. As with appropriations laws, the President \n     cannot use the authority in subparagraph (A)(iii) to change, \n     alter, or modify any provision of the authorization law.\n       Subparagraphs (A)(iv) and (A)(v) are variations on the \n     authority granted in clauses (i) through (iii), and are \n     intended to address the circumstance where Congress does not \n     specify in the appropriation law, the accompanying documents, \n     or other law a specific dollar amount, choosing instead to \n     require the purchase of a particular quantity of goods. \n     Subparagraphs (A)(iv) and (A)(v) allow the President to \n     rescind the entire dollar amount of discretionary budget \n     authority represented by the quantity specified in the law or \n     documents. To determine the specific dollar amount, the \n     President is required to multiply the estimated procurement \n     cost by the total quantity of items specified in the law or \n     documents. The President may then rescind the entire dollar \n     amount represented by the product of those two figures. The \n     conferees expect that the President will use the best \n     available information, as represented by the President's \n     budget submission or binding contract documents, to estimate \n     the procurement cost.\n       The conferees have included the following example in order \n     to more clearly explain the definition of dollar amount of \n     discretionary budget authority as defined by section 1026(7). \n     These examples are used solely for illustrative purposes and \n     the conferees are in no way commenting on the merit of any of \n     these programs. The conferees do not intend for these \n     examples to represent all instances where cancellation \n     authority may be used.\n       The FY 1996 Agriculture Appropriations Act (Public Law 104-\n     37) appropriates $49,846,000 in special grants for \n     agriculture research. The Conference Report accompanying this \n     law contains a table that allocates the $49,846,000 total \n     into lesser dollar amounts of all which correspond to \n     individual research programs. This table, for example, \n     contains a $3,758,000 allocation for ``Wood Utilization \n     Research (OR, MS, MN, ME, MI)''.\n       Using the definition in section 1026(7)(A) (i) and (ii), \n     the President could cancel either the entire $49,846,000 \n     specified in the statute or the entire $3,758,000 described \n     in the chart in the Conference Report. However, because the \n     Congress did not break down the allocations for each state \n     associated with this project the President would not have the \n     authority to take a portion of the $3,758,000 allocated to \n     wood utilization research.\n       The conferees intend that cancellation authority only \n     applies to whole items. If an item (or project) occurs in \n     more than one state, and the law or a report that accompanies \n     an appropriation law lists an item (project) and then lists a \n     series of states, it is the entire item that must be \n     canceled.\n       In the example listed above, ``Wood Utilization Research'' \n     appears in the report as: ``Wood Utilization Research (OR, \n     MS, NC, MN, ME, MI).''\n       The conferees believe it is important to note that this \n     line in the report must be canceled in its entirety. The \n     President's cancellation authority is strictly limited. The \n     President has no authority in this example to cancel wood \n     utilization research for Michigan only.\n       To further illustrate this example, the conferees submit \n     the following examples that corresponds to a chart contained \n     in the same conference report: ``Aflatoxin (IL), 133,000; \n     Human Nutrition (AR), 425,000; Human Nutrition (IA), 473,000; \n     Wool Research (TX, MT, WY) 212,000.''\n       In this case, the President may cancel Aflatoxin (IL), \n     Human Nutrition (AR), Human Nutrition (IA), and/or Wool \n     Research (TX, MT, WY). Although there are two human nutrition \n     research projects listed in two different states, because of \n     the manner in which they are listed, each project may be \n     separately canceled. Again, the President may only cancel the \n     entire wool research program and may not cancel only wool \n     research in Texas.\n       Section 1026(7)(B) describes what is not included in the \n     definition of ``dollar amount of discretionary budget \n     authority.'' Subparagraphs (B)(i) and (B)(ii) exclude items \n     of new direct spending, for which cancellation authority is \n     provided under other sections of part C of title X. \n     Subparagraph (B)(iii) excludes from the definition any budget \n     authority canceled or rescinded in an appropriation law in \n     order to ensure that those cancellations or rescissions \n     cannot be undone by the President using the cancellation \n     authority.\n       As described earlier, subparagraph (B)(iv) excludes from \n     the definition any restriction,\n\n[[Page S2959]]\n\n     condition, or limitation in an appropriation law or the \n     accompanying statement of managers or governing committee \n     report on the expenditure of budget authority or on \n     activities involving such expenditure. The following two \n     examples illustrate the conferees' intent that the President \n     cannot use the cancellation authority to alter the \n     Congressional policies included in these restrictions, \n     conditions, or limitations.\n       The Labor, Health and Human Services and Education and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, H.R. 1217, as amended by \n     the Senate Appropriations Committee contained the following \n     section:\n       ``Sec. 103. No amount of funds appropriated in this Act for \n     fiscal year 1996 may be used to implement, administer, or \n     enforce any executive order, or other rule or order, that \n     prohibits Federal contracts with, or requires that debarment \n     of, or imposes other sanction on, a contractor on the basis \n     that such contractor or organizational unit thereof \n     permanently replaced lawfully striking workers.''\n       The President's cancellation authority only applies to \n     entire dollar amounts. The above example of ``fencing \n     language'' is a limitation and contains no dollar amount. \n     Therefore, the President has no authority to alter or cancel \n     this statement of Congressional policy.\n       If a limitation or condition on spending--``fencing \n     language''--is not written as a separate numbered or \n     unnumbered paragraph, but instead is written as a proviso to \n     an appropriated amount, the President still has no power to \n     cancel the proviso.\n       The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1996, \n     (Public Law 104-46), Title II, Department of the Interior, \n     General Administrative Expenses, states:\n       ``For necessary expenses of general administration and \n     related functions in the office of the Commissioner, the \n     Denver office, and offices in the five regions of the Bureau \n     of Reclamation, $48,150,000, of which $1,400,000 shall remain \n     available until expended, the total amount to be derived from \n     the reclamation fund and to be nonreimbursable pursuant to \n     the Act of April 19, 1945 (43 U.S.C. 377); Provided, that no \n     part of any other appropriation in this Act shall be \n     available for activities or functions budgeted for the \n     current fiscal year as general administrative expenses.\n       Using this example, the President may cancel $48,150,000 or \n     the $1,400,000 noted, but may not cancel or alter in any way \n     the proviso restricting the use of other appropriated funds \n     contained in this Act.\n       The conference report also allows the President to cancel \n     the entire amount of budget authority required to be \n     allocated by a specific proviso in an appropriation law for \n     which a specific dollar figure was not included. The \n     conferees recognize that from time to time, budget authority \n     may be mandated to be spent on a specific program or project \n     without a specific dollar amount being listed. However, in \n     order to comply with the proviso, the President would have to \n     expend appropriated funds.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n     Sec. 1021. Line item veto authority\n       Section 1021(a) permits the President to cancel in whole \n     any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority, item of \n     new direct spending, or limited tax benefit contained in any \n     bill or joint resolution that has been signed into law \n     pursuant to Article I, section 7, of the Constitution of the \n     United States. The cancellation may be made only if the \n     President determines such cancellation will reduce the \n     federal budget deficit and will not impair any essential \n     government function or harm the national interest. In \n     addition the President must make any cancellations within \n     five days of the date of enactment of the law from which the \n     cancellations are made, and must notify the Congress by \n     transmittal of a special message within that time.\n       The conferees specifically include the requirement that a \n     bill or joint resolution must have been signed into law in \n     order to clarify that the cancellation authority only becomes \n     effective after the President has exercised the \n     constitutional authority to enact legislation in its \n     entirety. This requirement ensures that the President \n     affirmatively demonstrates support for the underlying \n     legislation from which specific cancellations are then \n     permitted.\n       The term ``cancel'' was specifically chosen, and is \n     carefully defined in section 1026. The conferees intend that \n     the President may use the cancellation authority to \n     surgically terminate federal budget obligations. The \n     cancellation authority is specifically limited to any entire \n     dollar amount of discretionary budget authority, item of new \n     direct spending, or limited tax benefit. The cancellation \n     authority does not permit the President to rewrite the \n     underlying law, nor to change any provision of that law. The \n     President may only terminate the obligation of the Federal \n     Government to spend certain sums of money through a specific \n     appropriation or mandatory payment, or the obligation to \n     forego the collection of revenue otherwise due to the Federal \n     Government in the absence of a limited tax benefit.\n       Likewise, the terms ``dollar amount of discretionary budget \n     authority,'' ``item of new direct spending,'' and ``limited \n     tax benefit'' have been carefully defined in order to make \n     clear that the President may only cancel the entire dollar \n     amount, the specific legal obligation to pay, or the specific \n     tax benefit. ``Fencing language'' may not be canceled by the \n     President under this authority. This means that the President \n     cannot use this authority to modify or alter any aspect of \n     the underlying law, including any restriction, limitation or \n     condition on the expenditure of budget authority, or any \n     other requirement of the law.\n       The conferees intend that, even once the federal obligation \n     to expend a dollar amount or provide a benefit is canceled, \n     all other operative provisions of the underlying law will \n     remain in effect. If the President desires a broader result, \n     then the President must either ask Congress to modify the law \n     or exercise the President's constitutional power to veto the \n     legislation in its entirety.\n       The lockbox provision of the conference report has also \n     been included to maintain a system of checks and balances in \n     the President's use of the cancellation authority. Any credit \n     for money not spent, or for revenue foregone, is dedicated to \n     deficit reduction through the operation of the lockbox \n     mechanism. This ensures that the President does not simply \n     cancel a particular dollar amount of discretionary budget \n     authority, item of new direct spending, or limited tax \n     benefit in order to increase spending in other areas.\n       Section 1021(b) requires the President to consider \n     legislative history and information referenced in law in \n     identifying cancellations. It also requires that the \n     President use the definitions in section 1026, and provides \n     that the President use any sources specified in the law or \n     the best available information.\n       Section 1021(c) states that the President's cancellation \n     authority shall not apply to a disapproval bill, as defined \n     in section 1026. The provision is intended to prevent an \n     endless loop of cancellations.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one moment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I take this occasion to congratulate the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], and the other Members \nof the Senate who were conferees.\n  As I sat and listened to him as he has outlined the changes that were \nbrought within the bill during the meeting of the conference, I commend \nour Senate conferees. I think they brought about several improvements \nover the House position. I thank them for that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am honored by those comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for his \ngracious remarks, and all of those involved in this, including the \noccupant of the chair, the Senator from Mississippi.\n  There is very little doubt that the Senator from Alaska had the most \ndifficult time with this legislation. That is understandable given the \nfact that he will play a key and vital role in the upcoming \nappropriations process which affects us.\n  So we are very grateful, not only for his gracious remarks, but for \nhis very cooperative participation in this process.\n  Mr. President, in behalf of this side, I yield 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Texas, who also played a very important role from time to \ntime during our conference bringing a degree of insight, particularly \nhelping us understand the difference between enhanced rescissions and \nreal line-item vetoes.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I believe this bill represents a \nsignificant break with the past. I think it does in a very real sense \nrepresent the changing of the guard. Might I say that I think it is \nlong overdue.\n  The last time we balanced the Federal budget was in 1969 when Richard \nNixon was President, and it happened only because of a big tax increase \nthat occurred in 1968--an income surtax. It lasted only for 1 year, and \nthen it was gone. The last time we balanced the budget 2 years in a row \nwhere the budget was balanced by fiscal restraint by doing what every \nfamily and every business in America has to do every year was in the \nmiddle of the 1950's when Dwight David Eisenhower was President of the \nUnited States.\n\n  In other words, we are here today changing the fundamental powers of \nthe Presidency as they relate to the Congress and altering our system \nof the distribution of that power because for 40 years we have not been \nable or willing to say ``no.'' And because we have not said ``no,'' \nbecause we have said ``yes'' to virtually any organized special \ninterest group with a letterhead, that has meant that families\n\n[[Page S2960]]\n\nhave had to say ``no'' on a constant basis. The problem is we have said \n``yes'' to spending money when ``yes'' was the wrong answer, forcing \nfamilies to say ``no'' to investing in their future and the future of \nthis country, when ``no'' was the wrong answer. We are here today to \ntry to change that.\n  What does the line-item veto do, and what does it not do? The line-\nitem veto allows the President to go inside an appropriations bill and \nto eliminate a program, a project, or an activity. He does not have the \nability to change it. He can either say ``yes'' or ``no'' to the whole \nthing and strike it out, and then alter the budget total at the top of \nthe page.\n  This will allow the President to exercise leadership in controlling \nspending and to impose priorities. But, if the Congress does not agree \nand if there is strong disagreement, the President can be overridden. \nBut what it does, no doubt about it--and the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia is right--it changes the balance of power between the \nCongress and the President in one fundamental way: It gives the \nPresident enhanced power to say ``no'' to spending. It does not give \nhim the ability to spend more money. It does not give him the ability \nto change priorities by partially altering spending figures. It \nenhances his ability to say ``no.''\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, after 40 years of living proof every \nday that our Government cannot say ``no'' when ``no'' is clearly the \nright answer, the time has come to change the system. This is a \nfundamental reform, there is no doubt about it.\n  If you had a President who was honest-to-god willing to get out a pen \nand to veto, he could change America. And he could change it very, very \nquickly. Let us hope that the Lord will give us such a person.\n  What is the problem with which we are trying to deal? The problem is \nnot just this abstract idea of deficits. The problem is that in the \nmid-1960's, we fundamentally changed America without America ever \nknowing it, without an election ever being held on this subject, and \nmaybe without Members of Congress knowing it.\n  What happened is that prior to 1965, in this whole century, excluding \nthe years of the Great Depression, our economy had performed very well. \nWe had experienced an economic growth rate of almost 3.5 percent. From \n1950 to 1965, our economy grew at over 4 percent a year. What that \nmeant was new jobs, new growth, new opportunity. It created a situation \nthrough the whole of the 20th century, with the exception of 4 years \nduring the Great Depression, where in almost every family in America \nparents did better than their parents, and they could be almost certain \nthat their children were going to do better than they had done.\n  Beginning in 1965, we traded that in for a Government growing at an \naverage of 9 percent each and every year since. What has happened is \nthis year the economy is growing at 1.7 percent. The average family's \ntake-home, after-tax pay today is lower than it was in 1992. For the \nwhole decade of the 1970's, the average working American family was \nworse off at the end of the decade than they were at the beginning \nbecause the economy did not perform, because we spent the seed corn of \nour economy here in Congress, and the President in signing \nappropriations bills had no ability to go inside those bills and strike \nitems.\n  So what we are doing today is trying to change a system that is \nbroken. There are clearly people who love the old ways, who believe \nthat Congress ought to have this ability to fill up bills with little \nadd-ons that the President would like to veto but cannot veto without \nvetoing the whole bill. But I think after 40 years of failure, after 40 \nyears of mortgaging the future of the country, after 40 years of \nlowering the potential living standard of our people, we have an \nopportunity if we would change the way Government does its business to \nguarantee that our grandchildren will be twice as well off as they will \nbe if you continue business as usual.\n  That is the ability to affect the lives of everybody in this country \nand everybody on this planet. It is the ability to give people the \nopportunity to escape poverty and fulfill their dreams. That cannot \nhappen when Government is borrowing 50 cents out of every dollar. So we \nare here today to change it. This is going to be a fundamental, \nsweeping change in Government. My only disappointment is that it is not \npermanent. This is grandfathered, and what it will mean is that if we \ndo have a President who actually uses it, my guess is we will not \nrestore it to them once this expires. I had hoped this would be \npermanent law, but this is a very, very important bill. I commend \neverybody who has been involved in it.\n  Let me conclude by just thanking some people individually.\n  First of all, I thank Ted Stevens, who had very real hesitation about \nthis bill. I thank Pete Domenici. Both of these men had real \nreservations when we started. This has meant a compromise for them, and \nI think, quite frankly, we have a better bill right now than we did \nwhen we started this process. I think they are largely responsible for \nit. But only because of their support will this bill become the law of \nthe land.\n  I thank Dan Coats and John McCain for their leadership. This has been \na battle which has really raged for 8 years. Many people have despaired \nof it ever happening. But it did happen because we had people who cared \nstrongly about it. I think it reveals the basic lesson of democracy, \nand that is intensity counts. If you have people who care very strongly \nabout something and they do not give up, ultimately they succeed.\n  I also thank the Presiding Officer, our distinguished assistant \nmajority leader, for his good counsel in bringing people together and \nhelping to push this matter to a final conclusion.\n  It is interesting in that I think this is an old issue which has been \ndebated a long time and as a result there is not the clamor which \nnormally would surround a bill that is as important and momentous as \nthis bill is, and that is a disappointment I am sure both to those of \nus who are for it and those who are against it in terms of its profound \nimpact on America. There are very few things we have done in the last 4 \nor 5 Congresses that have a larger potential impact than the passage of \nthis bill.\n  I congratulate everybody who has been involved. I believe we are not \nonly making history today, but we are making good history. That is \nsomething which does not happen very often. This is one more tool the \nPresident has, if the President wants to do something about the \ndeficit. If we have a President who really wants to do it, all that \nPresident has to do is get one-third plus one in one House of Congress, \nsharpen up his pencil, and he is in business. I believe it is going to \ntake strong leadership.\n  I wish to conclude by remembering the words of Ronald Reagan when he \nasked for this power and said, ``Give me the line-item veto and let me \ntake the heat.'' I was always disappointed we did not do that, but we \nare going to give whoever is President in January this power. We will \nsee if they can take the heat.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I shall quote Lord Byron:\n\n       A thousand years scarce serve to form a state; an hour may \n     lay it in the dust.\n\n  Mr. President, let me explain my motion now for the benefit of \nSenators on both sides.\n  Mr. President, in offering this motion to recommit, I am, I hope, \nproviding one last opportunity for the Senate to come to grips with \nwhat we are about to do. It is my desire that each one of us, before we \ncast our vote on the conference agreement to S. 4, have the chance to \nreevaluate our position, to rethink the damaging consequences that will \nnecessarily extend from this enhanced rescission proposal, and to vote, \ninstead, for a more sensible approach than that offered in S. 4, as \namended.\n  In essence, my motion to recommit would supplant the provisions \ncurrently contained in the conference agreement with those contained in \nS. 14, as originally introduced by Senators Domenici, Exon, Craig, \nBradley, Cohen, Dole, Daschle, and Campbell on January 4, 1995. That \nmeasure was, I believe, a workable proposal that would give the \nPresident broad and uncomplicated authority to propose the\n\n[[Page S2961]]\n\nrescission or repeal of not only appropriated funds, but, also, new \ndirect spending and targeted tax benefits.\n  Consequently, my proposal will allow any President to rescind any of \nthese budget items under an expedited process that guarantees the \nPresident will receive a vote on any of his proposed rescissions. The \nprocess would work as follows:\n  The President would have 20 calendar days after the date of enactment \nof each covered measure to transmit a special message to Congress \nproposing to cancel any of the budget items previously mentioned. The \nHouse and Senate would then be required to take up the President's \nproposed rescissions under expedited procedures which would ensure that \na vote on final passage of the President's proposed rescissions shall \nbe taken in the Senate and House of Representatives on or before the \nclose of the tenth day of session of that House after the date of the \nintroduction of the bill in that House.\n  Furthermore, procedures are contained in the measure to ensure that \nsuch measures are introduced no later than the third day of session of \neach House after receipt of a special message from the President.\n  During consideration of the rescission bill in either House, any \nmember may move to strike any proposed cancellation of a budget item. I \nmight note parenthetically that this represents a change from S. 14, as \nintroduced, in that S. 14 would have required a member of the House to \ngather the signatures of 49 other members in order to offer an \namendment to a rescission bill on the Floor and in the Senate would \nhave required a Senator to collect an additional 11 signatures in order \nto be able to offer an amendment to strike a proposed rescission from a \nbill. I do not agree that members of the House and Senate should be \nprohibited from offering their amendments as they so wish without the \nnecessity of gathering signatures from other members.\n  Under my proposal, debate in the Senate on a rescission bill and all \ndebatable motions and appeals in connection therewith shall not exceed \n10 hours. A motion in the Senate to further limit debate on a \nrescission bill is not debatable. A motion to recommit a bill is not in \norder. Debate in the House of Representatives or the Senate on any \nconference report on any rescission bill shall be limited to not more \nthan two hours, motions to further limit debate will be nondebatable, \nand motions to recommit the conference report will not be in order.\n  Finally, my proposal contains an ironclad lockbox provision to ensure \nthat any monies saved through these rescissions are, indeed, used for \ndeficit reduction. Under this proposal, the President and Congress must \neach take action to reduce the discretionary spending limits contained \nin section 601 of the Congressional Budget Act, the committee \nallocations under section 602, and the balances for the budget under \nsection 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act.\n  By adopting this proposal, I believe that the Senate will then have \npassed a measure that effectively amends the present impoundment \nprocedure, while at the same time maintaining the constitutional \nseparation of powers by protecting congressional control of the purse \nstrings from an unchecked executive.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that it was the considered \njudgment of the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, working \nin conjunction with the ranking member of that committee, Mr. Exon, \nthat the expedited rescission process contained in S. 14, as originally \nintroduced, was the most appropriate approach to this issue. Based on \ntheir expertise--expertise gained through many years of study of the \nbudget process--the provisions contained in the Domenici-Exon \nrescission bill give us a workable process. Consequently, my motion, if \nadopted, would force the Congress to vote, in an expedited fashion, on \nthe President's rescission proposals. No longer would Congress be in a \nposition to simply ignore the recommendations of the President. We \nwould be mandated, under the language I am proposing to have \nsubstituted, to consider the President's request, and to do so in a \ntimely manner.\n  Furthermore, under the terms of S. 14, as introduced, this newly \ncrafted expedited rescission process would extend not only to \nappropriated funds, but, also, to the vast amounts of revenues lost \neach year through the use of tax expenditures. As with entitlement \nprograms, tax expenditures cost the U.S. Treasury billions of dollars \neach year; nearly $500 billion in this fiscal year alone. And, again, \nlike entitlements, they receive little or no scrutiny once they are \nenacted into law. Even though they increase the deficit, just like \nspending on mandatory programs, tax expenditures routinely escape any \nmeaningful fiscal control or oversight. Indeed, by masquerading as a \ntax expenditure, a program or activity that could not pass \ncongressional muster could be indirectly funded and survive for years.\n  Yet, the conference agreement on S. 4 effectively puts this entire \narea of Federal expenditures out of the reach of the President. By \nlimiting the President's rescission authority to only those tax \nexpenditures that, by definition, benefit 100 or fewer taxpayers, S. 4 \nabsurdly restricts the ability of the President to get at this type of \nbackdoor spending.\n  How absurd is this? Imagine limiting the scope of the President's \nrescission authority to those appropriations that impacted 100 or fewer \nbeneficiaries. Imagine the wrath of verbal indignation that would \nbefall any Senator who stood up here and proposed that kind of \nrescission process. What would the proponents of S. 4 think of the \nefficacy of their legislation with that type of restriction in place on \nappropriated funds?\n  Mr. President, the concept of numerical definitions on tax \nexpenditures was rejected in the Senate because we all know that any \ntax lawyer worth his salt can find a few extra people to qualify for \nthe targeted tax benefit, thereby bringing the number of beneficiaries \nabove 100 and out of range of rescission authority. Consequently, this \nlimitation is nothing more than an open invitation to the many creative \ntax attorneys in this country to find ways to abuse the system.\n  But the asininity of such a provision does not stop there. The \ndefinition of a tax expenditure, or ``limited tax benefit'' as S. 4 \ncalls it, is further gutted with exemptions for tax breaks that serve \nto benefit all persons in the same industry, or all persons engaged in \nthe same type of activity, or even all persons owning the same type of \nproperty. Thus, under that definition, a special tax break passed by \nthe Congress for anyone owning a Rolls Royce, for example, would not be \nsubject to a presidential rescission since everyone affected would own \nthe same type of property, in this case a Rolls Royce.\n\n  Mr. President, I find it ironic that the proponents of S. 4--who seem \nto be claiming that their so-called line-item veto is the only version \nthat will effectively cut wasteful spending--are the very same people \nwho seem to be afraid to give the President of the United States a \nsimilar method of cutting wasteful tax breaks. Why should the President \nbe given the power to veto spending for school lunches, or highway \nconstruction, or drug programs, and not be given the power to veto the \ntax deduction claimed by businessmen for a three-martini lunch? Whether \nwasteful spending is in a program funded through an appropriation or \nthrough a tax break, it is still wasteful spending.\n  The Domenici-Exon expedited rescission bill, which I am offering as a \nsubstitute to the current conference agreement, gives the President \nreal authority to go after wasteful tax breaks. Under the substitute, \nevery tax break would get the same presidential scrutiny as every \nprogram funded through the appropriations process. No more, but \ncertainly no less.\n  Finally, but not insignificantly, Mr. President, is the issue of \ntiming. The rescission process that I am proposing is immediate. It is \nnot put off until next year. It is not delayed until 1997, as it is \nunder the conference agreement. Under the substitute, the President \nwould have the opportunity to exercise his newfound rescission powers \nright away, this year, on any appropriations, or entitlements, or tax \nexpenditures enacted by this Congress. But, under the conference \nagreement, the President--in this case President Clinton--is not \nallowed to affect the fiscal year 1997 appropriations. Apparently, \nPresident Clinton is not to be\n\n[[Page S2962]]\n\ntrusted with this new power. Apparently, the hope of the proponents of \nthe conference agreement is that, after 1996, the White House will be \nunder Republican control. Apparently, what is good for a possible \nRepublican President is not so good for a President for the Democratic \nparty.\n  Mr. President, my position on enhanced rescission is well known to my \ncolleagues. I believe that passage of this conference report, in its \npresent form, would be a truly monumental mistake that will do great \nharm to the constitutional balance of powers while contributing very \nlittle toward balancing the federal budget. I have been, and continue \nto be, unalterably opposed to granting any President the power to \nrescind portions of spending measures under conditions which would \nrequire a two-thirds vote of both Houses to override such rescissions.\n  But if we are to have legislation that amends the current rescission \nprocess, I hope that we will at least have the presence of mind to \nensure that we do not give away, in wholesale fashion, that which the \nconstitutional Framers so wisely placed in this branch of government. \nAccordingly, I urge my colleagues to adopt my motion to recommit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. McCain). Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask the time be charged against my time on \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time will be so charged. The Senator from \nIndiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I, first of all, want to take this \nopportunity to express my respect for the Senator from West Virginia. \nWe clearly are on different sides of this issue. He has been an \narticulate and zealous protector of the prerogatives and rights of this \ninstitution, and he has articulated those well, and I respect that.\n  I also respect his unswerving allegiance and dedication to that \nproposition and know that it is very, very important, and it has been \nover the 8 years of debate on line-item veto, a great history lesson \nfor this Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \noverly generous and charitable remarks.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that it has been \ncleared that we could move to a vote at 5:45, to have Senator Domenici \nrecognized in order to make a motion to table the pending motion to \nrecommit.\n  I want to make sure the minority leader and Senator Byrd--if that is \nhis understanding?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is my understanding. I have no objection. I ask the \nrequest be amended to provide that Mr. Moynihan be recognized at 5 \no'clock to speak in opposition to the conference report, and the time \nto be charged against my time on the bill.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. COATS. We have no objection to that, Mr. President. Therefore, I \nask unanimous consent that at the hour of 5:45 this evening, Senator \nDomenici be recognized in order to make a motion to table the pending \nmotion to recommit, and, prior to that, at 5 p.m. this evening, Senator \nMoynihan of New York be recognized to speak in opposition--in favor of \nthe motion to recommit and in opposition to the bill on the floor, the \ntime to be charged to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would just alert our fellow Senators that \na rollcall vote will now occur at 5:45 p.m. today; that there will \nstill be, after that vote, time remaining on this debate. I am not sure \nhow much of that time will be used. I do know there are some requests \nfor time, so Senators should also expect that there will be additional \ndebate and a vote on final passage on this line-item veto conference \nreport sometime this evening.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to request some time on this \nside. I think 5 minutes will be adequate.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nMississippi whatever time he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to say this afternoon I am extremely \nproud of the U.S. Senate and of the Congress, because I believe before \nthis week is out we will have passed this already described momentous \nlegislation into law. It is not an easy thing to do. It is very \ndifficult.\n  I remember, soon after I came to the Senate, we had debate on the \nline-item veto. I think probably the Senator from Indiana and the \nSenator from Arizona, Senator McCain, were involved in it then. I made \nsome comments, and I had a couple of Senators come over and explain to \nme that might not be a good idea, to support that. They caused me to \nthink a lot about it.\n  But here, in effect, we are taking action against our interests. This \nis a fundamental change; there is no denying it. The Senator from West \nVirginia is right; the Senator from Alaska. Yet, we are going to do it \nbecause, first, I think, we have come up with better legislation than \nwe had 7 years ago, or earlier this year.\n  We have improved it. We have made it more acceptable to more Senators \nor Congressmen, Republicans and Democrats. So we are going to go \nforward with it, and we are going to do it at a time when the majority \nof the Congress is not of the party of the President in the White \nHouse. We are saying that in spite of that--maybe because of it--we \nwant him to have this additional authority.\n  For 15 years, we have been talking about the line-item veto, maybe \nlonger. But I personally have been familiar with it for those years. As \na Member of the House, I was for the line-item veto. I remember making \nspeeches when President Carter was in the White House, and I continued \nto be for it during the Reagan administration, the Bush administration, \nand I continue to be for it.\n  So I think we are showing that we can rise above politics, if you \nwill--partisan politics--and take an action because we believe it will \nbe the right thing to do for our country, we believe it will be the \nright thing to do in trying to help control spending. It may not work \nlike we hope it will, it may run into difficulties, but I believe it is \nthe right thing to do, and I do support it.\n  I think that it will be used responsibly by the Presidents of the \nUnited States, this one or his successors. I think most Governors use \nit responsibly in their exercise of the line-item veto, and I think the \nPresidents will. But if they do not, we will have another opportunity \nto address it.\n  I do also want to join in commending the Senator from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, for his dogged support of this idea, and also the \nSenator from Indiana. They have worked together. They have worked \nagainst overwhelming odds and never gave up, even though it looked \npretty dismal just a month or so ago.\n  I have to express my appreciation for Senator Stevens and Senator \nDomenici. They were aggressive, they were active, but they were \ninvolved. I remember I had been talking with the Senator from Alaska \none night about what we had been trying to do, and he had been very \naggressive in saying how he did not want us to do that. He had worked \nme over from three or four different angles trying to educate me. Then \nI said, ``OK, I understand you don't want it. Is there a solution?'' He \nstopped and said, ``Well, maybe there is.''\n  So we worked together. Even the Senator from West Virginia, who so \nopposes this legislation, has been very much a gentleman in the way he \nhas handled the debate, how he is addressing this issue today, the \nmotion to recommit he has offered, and the time agreements he has \nentered into. So a lot of people deserve credit.\n\n  I think it is a carefully crafted piece of legislation. We went into \nthe detail of what would it mean for the President to be able to veto \nin whole or in part. Quite frankly, we were a little bit surprised--I \nknow I was--at what that could mean. So we worked to try to clarify \nwhat that ``in part'' meant.\n  It does include things other than just appropriations. It does \ninclude the so-called tax expenditure. But that provision is carefully \ndrafted, it is carefully defined, and I think we came up with the right \nblend, so that also can be considered by the President when he reviews \nlegislation we send to him.\n  We were very careful in deciding what to do on the sunset. There was \na lot of argument that we should have no sunset, and there were others \nwho said,\n\n[[Page S2963]]\n\nand I kind of agreed, ``Look, this is big legislation, important \nlegislation, it may not work out correctly. It may be abused. So after \na certain period of time, let's be allowed to take a look at it.''\n  I think it will work correctly. I hope it will be extended. I hope to \nsupport to extend it when the time comes.\n  We even talked a lot about the effective date. We wanted to make sure \nit was going to be handled in such a way it would go into effect as \nsoon as possible. We do have a provision that says if we reach a \nbalanced budget this year, it will go into effect on that date, or \nJanuary 1, 1997, whichever is earlier. The President and the majority \nleader talked about that and agreed that was the fair way to do it.\n  I think we have done what we said we were going to do. I have always \nfelt the President should have this authority. I am in the Congress. I \nguess I should be jealous of ceding authority to the President, but I \nreally do feel the President should have this authority. We can only \nhave one Commander in Chief at a time. He is the ultimate authority. He \nshould have the ability to go inside a bill and knock out things that \nare not justified, that have not been sufficiently considered, that \ncost too much--whatever reason--without having to veto the whole bill.\n  I am very pleased this afternoon to rise on the floor of the Senate \nand commend the Senate for what I believe will be their action today \nand all those associated with this effort. I think it is the right \nthing to do. I believe it will help save some of our children's tax \nmoney in the future.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan [Mr. Levin], 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first, let me thank our friend from West Virginia. He \nhas already been told this afternoon by so many of us just how \nimportant he is to the Nation and to the U.S. Senate in the cause he is \nfighting and the many causes he has fought and continues to fight for \nin this body. Many of the accolades, indeed, have come from people who \nare on the other side of this issue from him, but I want to let him \nknow, as someone on the same side of this issue as he is, we, too, feel \nparticularly keenly about the leadership that he has exerted on this \nissue and so many other issues involving the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  This is our bedrock document, a fundamental document. It has no more \nstaunch supporter of the Constitution in this body or in this country \nthan Senator Byrd, and I just want to add my voice to those of so many \nothers in this body on both sides of this issue in gratitude for the \nlabor that he has given to this Constitution. From his perspective, I \nknow they are not labors because they are labors of love.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan is a man of great \ntenacity and perception and love for the Constitution and for him to \ndeliver remarks on my behalf, he certainly has brightened my day. I am \nvery grateful.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while we are expressing sentiments about \neach other personally, before I get into my remarks on this bill, which \nI oppose for reasons I will set forth, I want to add my thanks also to \nthe Presiding Officer and the Senator from Indiana, who is managing the \nbill, and to others on the other side of this particular issue for the \nmanner in which this debate has proceeded.\n  It is a very significant debate, and people on both sides of this \nissue feel very keenly about it. I think there is unity in terms of \ntrying to find a form of line-item veto, so-called, which is \nconstitutional, because whatever side of the particular bill we are on, \nas to whether we think this version is constitutional or not, I think \nmost of us would like to find a formula which would give the President \ngreater power to identify issues in bills, items in bills which he \nfeels should be separately voted upon, which should be highlighted for \nthe public, for the Congress, and we should then vote up or down on.\n  I, for instance, very much favor the version which the Senator from \nWest Virginia has offered, which will be voted upon later this \nafternoon. That so-called expedited rescission process, it seems to me, \nis constitutional and is something which we can in good conscience, at \nleast I can in good conscience, support.\n  The Presiding Officer and many others in this body obviously feel \nthat the version which is currently before us is constitutional or I do \nnot think they would have been proposing it. There is a difference on \nthis issue, but it is a difference which is held in good faith. I must \nsay, I greatly admire the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nIndiana and others for the manner in which they have proceeded relative \nto this issue.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I support the version of the line-item veto \nwhich is known as expedited rescission. That version would ensure that \nany item of spending which is enacted by the Congress that the \nPresident believes to be inappropriate would, in fact, have a separate \ncongressional vote.\n  That approach to the line-item veto would make it impossible to hide \nquestionable spending in massive appropriations bills. That is one of \nthe goals of the sponsors of the version that is before us. It is to \nmake it impossible to hide questionable spending in these massive \nappropriations bills.\n  Senator Byrd's version--the expedited rescission approach --also will \nmake it impossible for these kinds of items to be hidden by a Congress \nbecause it would require and ensure a separate congressional vote on \nany item of spending that the Congress enacts that the President feels \nis inappropriate.\n  The problem with the current bill is that it fails the fundamental \ntest of being consistent with the requirements of the Constitution that \nany repeal or amendment to a law be enacted in the same way that the \nlaw itself was enacted. The Constitution establishes the method by \nwhich laws are enacted, by which laws are amended, and by which laws \nare repealed. It is fundamental constitutional law. It is basic, \nbedrock law that says that a bill becomes law when it is passed by both \nHouses of Congress and signed by the President, or if the bill is \nvetoed by the President, when that veto is overridden by a two-thirds \nvote in each House.\n  The bill before us purports to create a third way by which laws can \nbe made, a way not recognized in the Constitution. And this third way, \nthis new way, is by giving the President the unilateral power to repeal \na law or part of a law without any action by the Congress.\n  The Founding Fathers made a conscious decision to give the power of \nthe purse to the Congress and not to the President. This power of the \npurse serves an important check on the power of the Presidency. It is, \nin fact, a crucial element in the system of checks and balances which \nwas established by the Founding Fathers. These checks and balances are \nnot a mere abstraction; they were expressly written into the \nConstitution to protect our freedom.\n  James Madison warned in Federalist No. 47 that--\n\n       There can be no liberty where the legislative and executive \n     powers are united in the same person.\n\n  He quoted Montesquieu for that point. It was because of that, the \nfear of uniting executive and legislative powers in the same person, \nthat article I of the Constitution gives Congress, and not the \nPresident, the power of the purse.\n  Article I, section 1, states without qualification--and the first \nword in this quote is the critical one--\n\n       All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a \n     Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a \n     Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n  Article I, section 8 adds:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, . . \n     . to pay the debts and provide for the common Defense and \n     general Welfare of the United States; . . . [and] To make all \n     Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into \n     Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested \n     by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, \n     or in any Department or Officer thereof.\n\n  Article I, section 9 affirms that:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by law.\n\n  It was Madison, in Federalist No. 58, who explained that the power of \nthe purse was granted to Congress because\n\n[[Page S2964]]\n\nit represents the ``most complete and effectual weapon with which any \nConstitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people for \nobtaining a redress of every grievance and for carrying into effect \nevery just and salutary measure.''\n  Congress cannot change the system of checks and balances established \nby the Founding Fathers. We cannot do it, and we should not try. But \nthis conference report, in the mechanism which it chooses, attempts to \nchange the system of checks and balances which are embedded--and may I \nuse the word ``enshrined''--in the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  The enhanced rescission power that is granted to the President by \nthis bill attempts to alter our constitutional system by giving the \nPresident unilateral authority to control spending and to substitute \nhis personal budget priorities for the priorities that have been passed \nby the Congress and signed into law. This bill would give the President \nthe unilateral power to repeal a statute or part of a statute without \nany action at all by the legislative branch.\n  That is the heart of the matter. This bill in front of us would give \nto the President the unilateral power to repeal a statute or part of a \nstatute, the law of the land, without any action by the legislative \nbranch. That is something that we cannot do.\n  The Supreme Court said as recently as in the Chadha case, that it is \nbeyond Congress' power to alter the carefully defined limits and the \npower of the branches. This is what the Supreme Court said in Chadha:\n\n       The bicameral requirement, the Presentment Clauses, the \n     President's veto, and Congress' power to override a veto were \n     intended to erect enduring checks on each Branch and to \n     protect the people from the improvident exercise of power by \n     mandating certain prescribed steps. To preserve those checks, \n     and maintain the separation of powers, the carefully defined \n     limits on the power of each Branch must not be eroded.\n\n  The Chadha court went on to say:\n\n       There is no support in the Constitution or decisions of \n     this Court for the proposition that the cumbersomeness and \n     delays often encountered in complying with explicit \n     constitutional standards may be avoided, either by the \n     Congress or by the President. . . . With all the obvious \n     flaws of delay, untidiness, and potential for abuse, we have \n     not yet found a better way to preserve freedom than by making \n     the exercise of power subject to the carefully crafted \n     restraints spelled out in the Constitution.\n\n  The veto or the repeal or the cancellation, unilaterally, of an \nexisting law by the President is subject to the same constitutional \nrestraints.\n  The Chadha court explicitly stated that ``[a]mendment and repeal of \nstatutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Article I'' of the \nConstitution.\n  That is an explicit statement of Chadha by the Chadha court. We \ncannot change that unless we adopt a constitutional amendment and send \nit to the States.\n  The Chadha court has told us what courts have told us throughout our \nhistory, what the Constitution has told us. It says explicitly, \n``[a]mendment and repeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must \nconform with Article I'' of the Constitution.\n  What this bill says is, ``Well, we will try to create something else. \nWe will let the President decide within 5 days after a law becomes law \nthat he wants to cancel a part of that law.'' Unless the Congress acts \nto override him, the President's unilateral cancellation effectively \namends the law of the land. We cannot do that. We should not try.\n  The Chadha court explained why it reached the conclusion that it did. \nIt wrote that during the Convention of 1787 the application of the \nPresident's veto to repeals of statutes was addressed. It was very \nexplicitly addressed during the Constitutional Convention. The Chadha \ncourt went through the Convention. The issue was the application of the \nPresident's veto to repeals of statutes. The Chadha court concluded, \n``There is no provision allowing Congress to repeal or amend laws by \nother than legislative means, pursuant to article I.''\n  Now, Mr. President, the conference report acknowledges what I think \nis obvious: That when the President signs the appropriations bill--this \napproach would allow him to cancel within 5 days that appropriations \nbill--upon his signature that becomes the law of the land. The \nconference report, section 1021 says that notwithstanding the provision \nof parts A and B and subject to provisions of this part, ``the \nPresident may with respect to any bill or joint resolution that has \nbeen signed into law, pursuant to article I, section 7 of the \nConstitution, may cancel in whole or in part,'' and it goes on to talk \nabout what the President can cancel.\n  We are only talking here about bills which have become the law of the \nland. Those are pretty important words in this government of law. We do \nnot allow Presidents to pick and choose which laws they abide by and \nwhich ones they do not. I cannot think of any other places where we say \na law could be canceled by a President acting unilaterally; yet this \nbill says that a law--and that has become enacted, signed by the \nPresident--can be canceled in whole or in part by the President, acting \nalone.\n  Of course, the bill gives us the opportunity to override that \ncancellation with new legislation. That is not the point. That is not \nwhat article I of the Constitution provides. Article I of the \nConstitution as interpreted by Supreme Court opinion after Supreme \nCourt opinion as recently as Chadha says the repeal, the amendment, the \nmodification of a law must be done in the same way that a law is \nenacted. This bill is a deviation from that. This bill says ``Well, we \nwill create another way. We will create a new way. You do not have to \nenact an amendment. You do not have to adopt an amendment. You do not \nhave to repeal the law the way the Constitution provides. We're going \nto say that the President of the United States, acting alone, is able \nto cancel a law of the United States.''\n  Now, Mr. President, the argument has been made that the bill just \nrestores to the President the authority that he exercised prior to the \nenactment of the Impoundment and Control Act in 1974. That is plainly \nwrong. No President has ever exercised the kind of unrestrained right \nto override congressional budget decisions that this bill would attempt \nto create. The Assistant Attorney General, Charles Cooper, in the \nReagan administration, stated in a 1988 legal opinion, the following:\n\n       To the extent that the commentators are suggesting that the \n     President has inherent constitutional power to impound funds, \n     the weight of authority is against such a broad power. This \n     office has long held that the existence of such a broad power \n     is supported by neither reason nor precedent. Virtually all \n     commentators have reached the same conclusion without \n     reference to their views as to the scope of executive power.\n\n  I note that same Assistant Attorney General, Charles Cooper, in the \nReagan administration, cited no less an authority than Chief Justice \nRehnquist, writing in his position as Assistant Attorney General in the \nNixon administration, for the proposition that a Presidential power not \nto spend money ``is supported by neither reason nor precedent.''\n  The Constitution does not authorize this version of a line-item veto. \nThe Constitution does not permit the President to repeal a law, to \nsuspend a law, to ignore a law, unless he chooses to veto the law \nitself. He cannot cancel laws. This is just another word for modifying \nit or ignoring it or vetoing it.\n  George Washington said 200 years ago, ``From the nature of the \nConstitution I must approve all the parts of a bill or reject it in \ntoto.''\n  Former President and Chief Justice William Howard Taft explained, \n``The President has no power to veto parts of the bill and allow the \nrest to become a law. He must accept it or reject it, and even his \nrejection of it is not final unless he can find more than one-third of \none of the Houses to sustain him in his veto.''\n  Congress cannot give the President that authority or even greater \nauthority simply by changing the labels and calling a repeal or an \namendment the ``cancellation'' of a law. It is not the labels that \ncount. It is the substance of what we are doing or purporting to do. \nWhat we are purporting to do in this bill is to give the President of \nthe United States unilaterally a right which the Constitution denies \nhim, and that is the right to cancel or veto or amend or modify or \nignore the law of the United States.\n  If it is unconstitutional for Congress to give the President a \nparticular power under one label, it is not suddenly constitutional \nmerely because we change the label. We cannot acknowledge that the \nPresident does not have\n\n[[Page S2965]]\n\nthe right to ``modify'' or ``repeal'' a law under the Constitution, but \nat the same time maintain that he can ``cancel'' a law. A veto is no \nless a veto and a repeal is no less a repeal because we call it \nsuspension or cancellation.\n  As a matter of fact, the Random House dictionary defines a veto as \n``The power vested in one branch of a government to cancel the \ndecisions, enactments, et cetera, of another branch.'' To paraphrase \nthe statement of Senator Sam Ervin on a similar issue in 1973, ``You \ncan't make an onion a flower by calling it a rose.''\n  Now, it is argued by some that this bill is a constitutional \ndelegation of power because the President is simply exercising some \nlegislatively authorized discretion not to enforce a statutory \nprovision. By this reasoning, the appropriation that has been canceled \nis still law. But I do not believe that is the intent of the sponsors. \nThe bill itself is entitled the ``Line-Item Veto Act.'' The bill \ncreates a new part of the Congressional Budget Act entitled, ``Part C, \nLine-Item Veto.'' The first provision of this new part is entitled, \n``Line-Item Veto Authority.''\n\n  Now, in addition, the so-called discretion in this conference report \nonly operates in one direction. Once a President cancels an \nappropriation under the bill, neither that President nor any other \nPresident would be permitted to spend the appropriated money without \nthe enactment of new legislation.\n  When a President cancels a provision of law providing for direct \nspending, this bill provides that the provision shall have no legal \nforce or effect. The bill expressly states in section 1026(4)(b) that \nthe term ``cancel'' means, in the case of budget authority provided by \nlaw, to prevent such budget authority from having legal force or \neffect. That is right in the bill itself. There is no discretion that \nis being granted here to the President. There is only one-way \ndiscretion here, which is to cancel a provision of law and deprive it \nof legal force and effect in perpetuity.\n  Similarly, in the case of entitlement authority, the bill states that \na cancellation ``prevent[s] the specific obligation of the United \nStates from having legal force or effect.'' The whole purpose of this \nbill is to deny the legal force or effect of any part of an \nappropriation that the President has canceled. In the case of the Food \nStamp Program, the bill says its purpose is to ``prevent the specific \nprovision of law that results in an increase in budget authority or \noutlays for that program from having legal force or effect.''\n  Now, Random House defines the term ``cancel'' to mean, ``make void, \nto revoke, to annul.'' I think we would all agree that any bill that \npurported to authorize the President to unilaterally void or annul or \nrevoke a statute would be unconstitutional.\n  Can the result be different because, instead of calling it a repeal \nor an annulment, we call it a cancellation? Can the application of the \nlabel ``cancel'' to what is clearly a repeal and an annulment change \nthe outcome legally? I do not think so.\n  The bottom line is that this bill purports to grant to the President \nof the United States a unilateral authority, which the Constitution \nwill not allow him to have or us to grant to him; that is, the \nauthority to repeal a law without any action by Congress.\n  Chadha says that you cannot repeal or modify a law without any action \nby Congress. The Constitution says it. We cannot do --and we should not \nattempt to do--what the Supreme Court says cannot be done and which the \nvery logic of the Constitution says cannot be done.\n  Assistant Attorney General Cooper, again in the Reagan \nadministration, explained this in his legal memorandum on impoundment. \nHe said that because an inherent impoundment power would not be subject \nto the limitations on the veto power contained in article I, clause 8, \nan impoundment would, in effect, be a superveto with respect to all \nappropriations measures. The inconsistency between such an impoundment \npower and the textural limits on the veto power further suggests that \nno inherent impoundment power can be discovered in the Constitution.\n  The same conclusion must be reached with regard to the cancellation \npower which is proposed in this conference report. Like an inherent \nimpoundment power, cancellation of a provision would, in effect, be a \nsuperveto, going far beyond the veto power given to the President in \nthe Constitution, because the President would not be required to veto \nthe entire bill. Congress cannot, by statute, give the President powers \nthat were denied to him in the Constitution.\n  As Prof. Thomas Sargentich of the Washington College of Law at \nAmerican University explained in a March 13, 1995 letter to me, \nregarding an earlier version of this bill which took the same approach:\n\n       S. 4 presents the question whether, given that the \n     President cannot unilaterally rewrite or delete some portion \n     of a bill at the time of presentment, the President \n     nevertheless can sign the bill and decide thereafter to \n     rescind budget authority under the law. Proponents of S. 4 \n     seek to rely on a verbal contrast between ``rescission'' of \n     budget authority and ``repeal'' or ``veto'' of all or part of \n     a statute. The notion is that a `rescission' is simply the \n     execution of the law pursuant to a broad delegation.\n       The problem with this suggestion is that it seems to exalt \n     verbal form over legal substance. * * * A repeal of all or \n     part of a statute after it becomes effective can only be \n     accomplished by new legislation enacted with adherence to \n     bicameralism and presentment. Using words like ``suspend'' or \n     ``rescind'' or any other somewhat muted verb does not alter \n     the underlying legal situation.\n\n  Similarly, Louis Fisher of the Congressional Research Service \nconcluded in 1992 testimony before the House Rules Committee that a \nstatute purporting to give the President unilateral power to rescind an \nappropriation would be unconstitutional. Dr. Fisher stated:\n\n       Under what theory of government can Congress delegate to \n     the President the power to rescind laws without further \n     legislative involvement? Congress regularly delegates to the \n     President substantial authorities to `make law,' but this \n     consists of discretion within the bounds of statutory law, \n     not the power to terminate law. * * * Even if contemporary \n     case law sustains the constitutionality of broad delegations, \n     I would argue that the rescission of previously appropriated \n     funds requires action through the regular legislative \n     process: action by both Houses on a bill that is presented to \n     the President.\n\n  And, a 1987 Note in the Yale Law Journal concludes unequivocally \nthat--\n\n       A transfer of authority to the President [through an \n     enhanced rescission bill] to decide which parts of \n     appropriation bills to enforce, would be a delegation of \n     Congress' spending power. Such a delegation, however, would \n     be unconstitutional. * * * Congress cannot constitutionally \n     seek to solve its budget problems by attempting to divest \n     itself of its constitutionally assigned powers.\n\n  Mr. President, I am confident that the courts will strike this \nprovision down as an improper attempt by Congress to override the \nexplicit standards, in article I of the Constitution, for the enactment \nand repeal of legislation. However, I do not believe that we should \nrely upon the courts to strike down unconstitutional statutes; we have \nan independent duty to scrutinize our actions and reject any proposal \nthat would violate the strictures of the Constitution.\n  It has been argued that the end of hope for deficit reduction \njustifies the means.\n  The line-item veto has been cast as a mechanism to cut wasteful \nspending by Congress.\n  The premise has been weakened by the fact that the Presidents' \nbudgets during most of the Reagan-Bush years had greater deficits than \nthe budgets adopted by the Congress.\n  Also numerous studies show that State line-item veto provisions, \nrather than reducing spending, have been used for partisan, political \npurposes. CBO Director Robert Reischauer testified before the \nGovernmental Affairs committee that:\n\n       Evidence from the states suggests that the item veto has \n     not been used to hold down state spending or deficits, but \n     rather has been used by state governors to pursue their own \n     priorities. . . . [A] comprehensive survey of state \n     legislative budget officers found that governors were likely \n     to use the item veto for partisan purposes. . ., but unlikely \n     to use the veto as an instrument of fiscal restraint.\n\n  The same is likely to be true at the Federal level. For example, a \nPresident could push his agenda in Congress by threatening to use a \nline-item veto or enhanced rescission authority to kill projects in the \nState or district of a Member who opposed his proposals. Such threats \ncould be used to advance policies in area--such as health care and \nwelfare reform--that are completely unrelated to Federal spending. They \ncould even be used to persuade\n\n[[Page S2966]]\n\nCongress to increase Federal funding for projects favored by the \nPresident.\n  But even if one believes line-item veto will have a major impact on \nthe deficit, then do it constitutionally. That is what the Byrd motion \nis all about. We should not do it by trying to give the President a \npart of the power over the purse, a power the constitution reserves to \nthe Congress. We should not do it by trying to give the President the \nright to repeal a law or a portion of a law without congressional \ninvolvement.\n  The sponsors of the bill have taken the position that Presidents are \nunlikely to abuse these new powers. That view is not only naive, it is \nalso inconsistent with the view of our Founding Fathers and the purpose \nof our constitutional system of checks and balances. As James Madison \nexplained in ``Federalist Number 51'':\n\n       [The great security against a gradual concentration of the \n     several powers in the same department, consists in giving to \n     those who administer each department, the necessary \n     constitutional means, and personal motives, to resist \n     encroachments of the others. . . . If men were angels, no \n     government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, \n     neither external nor internal controuls on government would \n     be necessary.\n\n  Moreover, as Justice Frankfurter pointed out in the wake of our \nbattle against dictatorship in the Second World War, the road to \ntyranny may be paved with the best of intentions. Writing in the so-\ncalled Steel Cases overturning President Truman's attempt to take \ncontrol of steel mills, Justice Frankfurter states:\n\n       [The Founders] rested the structure of our central \n     government on the system of checks and balances. For them the \n     doctrine of separation of powers was not mere theory; it was \n     a felt necessity. Not so long ago it was fashionable to find \n     our system of checks and balances obstructive to effective \n     government. It was easy to ridicule that system as outmoded--\n     too easy. The experience through which the world has passed \n     in our own day has made vivid the realization that the \n     Framers of our Constitution were not inexperienced \n     doctrinaires. These long-headed statesmen had no illusion \n     that our people enjoyed biological or psychological or \n     sociological immunities from the hazards of concentrated \n     power. It is absurd to see a dictator in a representative \n     product of the sturdy democratic traditions of the \n     Mississippi Valley. The accretion of dangerous power does \n     not come in a day. It does come, however slowly, from the \n     generative force of unchecked disregard of the \n     restrictions that fence in even the most disinterested \n     assertion of authority.\n\n  Much will no doubt be made in the course of this debate of the fact \nthat the President supports this bill of course. Every President would \nlike Congress to hand over part of its power over the purse.\n  I would point out however that former Counsel to the President--the \nPresident's own counsel--has parted company with the President on this \nissue. In a March 25, 1996, column in the Legal Times, Abner Mikva \nwrote that line-item veto proposals not only raise constitutional \nproblems, but would also transfer excessive power to the President. \nJudge Mikva has been consistent, and convincing, on this issue. Back in \n1986, Judge Mikva wrote, in the University of Georgia Law Journal:\n\n       [T]he source of almost all congressional power--the spine \n     and bite of legislative authority--lies in Congress' control \n     of the nation's purse. If ever Congress loosens its hold on \n     this source of power or if ever the President wrests it away, \n     then, to quote the late Senator Frank Church, ``the American \n     Republic will go the way of Rome.'' The delicate balance \n     created by the Framers will have been destroyed.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Since 1873, when Ulysses Grant first proposed the idea, \n     over 150 legislative proposals have called for Congress to \n     give to the President the ability to veto individual parts of \n     a bill. Congress has thus far rejected such proposals; with \n     any luck, it always will.\n       For regardless of whether Congress yields budgetary \n     authority or the President usurps it, the threat to our \n     constitutional order is the same. In our governmental system, \n     the legislature does and must have plenary power over the \n     budget. The power of the purse is the strength of the \n     Congress; take that away, and all else will fall. Is \n     Congress' management of the budget inefficient? Surely it is; \n     the workings of democratic institutions always are. Is it \n     cumbersome? Of course it is; getting a majority of 535 \n     political prima donnas to agree on anything is a difficult \n     task. But if we wish to live in a pluralistic and free \n     society, we will strive to ensure that Congress retains \n     exclusive control of the nation's purse. Only in that event \n     will the delicate balance of our constitutional structure be \n     preserved.\n\n  Mr. President, this bill is an unwise attempt to give away Congress' \npower over the purse and undo the system of checks and balances created \nby our Founding Fathers. It is at odds with the requirements of the \nConstitution. I urge my colleagues to reject it and adopt a different \nversion called expedited rescission.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we were sort of going back and forth from \none side to the other. Since Senator Levin just went, Senator Roth was \ngoing to go and, then, I understand Senator Daschle will go. I believe \nthat is the normal custom.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wonder if the floor manager would be \nwilling to enter into a unanimous-consent agreement specifically naming \nthe order of those who were here on the floor so others will know \napproximately when to come to the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I note the presence of the Senator from West Virginia. I \nhope that is agreeable with him.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I defer to our leader there, Senator Byrd, with how to \napproach this.\n  Mr. BYRD. Under the circumstances, I would be willing to do that. I \nam ordinarily not willing to stray away from what the rules require, \nbut I would be happy to do that on this occasion.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I suggest that Senator Roth be recognized next, \nfollowing which Senator Daschle be recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, Senator Bumpers has been here longer than I have.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I do not mind yielding to the leader. He has a much \nbusier schedule than I do. Who would be next on that side?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am not sure at this time whether it would be Senator \nNickles or Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. And then it would come back to me?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, then the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Does the Senator from Maryland wish to speak on this \nissue?\n  Mr. SARBANES. How long do we expect people to speak if we set up this \nprocedure?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Maryland that usually about this \ntime of the afternoon and evening we find there are a lot of speakers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notes that Senator Moynihan is to be \nrecognized at 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, by previous unanimous consent, and there is a vote \nunder a previous unanimous consent at 5:45.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is a certain time allotted to Senator Moynihan?\n  Mr. BYRD. It is 30 minutes, I believe.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the Chair, how much time does Senator Moynihan \nhave? Is there a certain amount of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time was allotted.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 30 minutes to Mr. Moynihan.\n  Mr. McCAIN. At 5:45 is a vote to table the Byrd motion to recommit, \nunder a previous agreement.\n  Mr. BYRD. So, between now and 5, there is time for several Senators.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware, Senator Roth.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield to me briefly?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nLine-Item Veto Act. The final Senate consideration and passage of this \nhistoric legislation is the result of years of hard work on the part of \nmany of my colleagues.\n  I particularly wish to congratulate Senator McCain and Senator Coats, \nwho have dedicated so much of their time and energy to this initiative. \nIn recent years, they have taken up this cause which was so actively \npursued in the past by Senator Mattingly, Senator Evans, and Senator \nQuayle.\n  My colleagues have shown great courage over the years in continuing \nto bring this issue to the floor of the Senate. They did this at some \npolitical risk, yet they did not waiver. They believe in this issue, \nand I think they are right.\n  I believe the line-item veto is vitally important, Mr. President. It \nwill save money, and right now we are spending too much and our budget \nprocess does not work very well. The line-item veto is certainly not a \npanacea for all our\n\n[[Page S2967]]\n\nbudget problems, and it will not balance the budget. But it will help.\n  According to the Library of Congress, at least 10 Presidents since \nthe Civil War have supported the line-item veto, including Presidents \nGrant, Hayes, Arthur, Franklin Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Nixon, \nFord, Reagan, and Bush. Further, 43 of 50 State Governors have some \nform of line-item veto authority.\n  At its essence, this is a debate over checks and balances. Right now, \nwe are writing a lot of checks, and there are few balances. Congress \nspends the money, and the President has two options. One, he signs the \nbill, or two, he vetoes the bill.\n  Historically, the balance of spending power between the executive and \nlegislative branches of Government has varied considerably. Prior to \n1974, several Presidents impounded congressionally directed spending, \nand Congress had little recourse.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the first \nsignificant impoundment of funds occurred in 1803 when President Thomas \nJefferson refused to spend $50,000 appropriated by Congress to provide \ngunboats to operate on the Mississippi River. President Grant impounded \nfunds for harbor and river improvement projects in 1876 because they \nwere of a local interest rather than in the national interest. \nPresident Roosevelt impounded funds during the Great Depression and \nWorld War II, and in the 1960's President Johnson withheld billions of \ndollars in funding for highway projects.\n  This conflict came to a head in the 1970's when President Nixon \nimpounded over $12 billion for public works housing, education, and \nhealth programs. Nixon's action led to the enactment of the \nCongressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Under this \nlegislation, Congress eliminated the President's impoundment authority \nin exchange for establishing its own budget process.\n  Under the Congressional Budget Act, the balance of spending power is \nnow significantly in Congress' favor. The President may now propose \nrescissions of appropriated funds, but Congress is not obligated to \nconsider them. The General Accounting Office reports that from 1974 to \n1994, Presidents have proposed 1,084 rescissions of budget authority \ntotaling $72.8 billion. Congress has adopted only 399, or 37 percent, \nof the proposed rescissions in the amount of $22.9 billion. Congress \nhas also initiated 649 rescissions totaling $70.1 billion, but most of \nthese rescissions have been used to offset other Federal spending.\n   Mr. President, I have served on the Appropriations Committee. They \nprobably work as hard as any committee in the Senate, and they are \nresponsible for spending a little over $500 billion, about a third of \nwhat the Government spends right now.\n  For the most part, they do an excellent job with the annual \nappropriations bills and supplementals, but I can tell you from \nexperience that every single appropriations bill has had items in it \nthat we do not need and we cannot afford. The line-item veto will give \nthe President the ability to strike those items that we cannot afford. \nWe may or may not agree with him. If we disagree, we can try to \noverride his veto.\n   Mr. President, I think it is important to note that this line-item \nveto will impact not only appropriated spending, but also new \nentitlement spending and limited tax benefits. We all know it is the \noutrageous growth of entitlement spending that is causing our deficit \nproblems, so I think it is a significant step to give the office of the \nPresident more authority to control the growth of these programs.\n   Mr. President, again, I compliment my colleagues, particularly \nSenator McCain and Senator Coats, for their leadership. They have taken \nthis issue on year after year, many times at considerable economic and \npolitical pain. I compliment them for their courage, and I am proud of \ntheir success.\n  The line-item veto is a significant accomplishment for the 104th \nCongress, but I continue to hope that it is not our most significant \naccomplishment. It is with no small degree of frustration that I note \nthat President Clinton and the Democrats killed the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, they killed the Balanced Budget Act, \nand they killed welfare reform.\n  When President Clinton campaigned on a line-item veto in 1992, he \nclaimed that he could reduce spending by $9.8 billion during his term. \nI wish we could have given it to him earlier, since spending has \nactually increased during his term so far. Even more amazing is that \nright now, in some room in the Capitol building, the President's aides \nare insisting on spending $8 billion more this year.\n   Mr. President, I hope the line-item veto is not our most significant \nbudget accomplishment this year, but even if the President continues to \nblock our other initiatives, this legislation will stand out as a \nshining example of our success.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 30 minutes to Mr. Bumpers and 30 \nminutes to Mr. Sarbanes at such time as they are recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today the Senate turns to the conference \nreport on the line-item veto legislation. This legislation would \nprovide for enhanced rescissions procedures to allow the President to \ncancel new items of direct or entitlement spending, appropriations, and \nlimit the tax benefits; in sum, virtually all Government expenditures.\n  Mr. President, while I do support the conference report and believe \nin the intent of the legislation, I am concerned about the way the \nlegislation affects tax provisions. Let me first outline my views \nregarding the underlying conference report, and then I will turn to the \ntroublesome language regarding taxes.\n\n  Let me be clear that I believe that the line-item veto will not solve \nour deficit problem. In fact, it will be used as a tool to help trim \nFederal spending. We all know, that we need every possible tool to help \nreduce Federal spending.\n  This is a very important issue that was contained in the Contract \nWith America. The Republican-led Congress continues to keep its \npromises to the American people in passing legislation that will help \nreduce Government spending, the budget deficit, and the debt burden on \nour children. In the Senate's first joint hearing with the House on the \nissue in January 1995, before the Governmental Affairs Committee, Dr. \nAlice Rivlin, Director of the Office of Management and Budget asked \nthat the Congress provide the ``strongest possible line-item veto power \nto the President'' I agreed with Dr. Rivlin's statement. Congress has \nacted and will now give the President a very strong version of the \nline-item veto powers. Both the Senate and House passed the line-item \nveto overwhelmingly. This week the Senate will pass the conference \nreport. A historic moment.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to put an end to out of control \nFederal spending that has taken money from the private sector--the very \nsector that creates jobs and economic opportunity for all Americans.\n  The American people are crying out for a smaller, more efficient \nGovernment. They are concerned about the trend that for too long has \nput the interests of big government before the interests of our job-\ncreating private sector. They are irritated by the double-standard that \nexists between how our families are required to balance their \ncheckbooks and how Government is allowed to continue spending despite \nits deficit accounts.\n  I believe that spending restraint for our nation is one of the most \nimportant steps we can take to ensure the economic opportunities for \nprosperity for our children and for our children's children.\n  As a nation--and as individuals--we are morally bound to pass on \nopportunity and security to the next generation.\n  The Federal behemoth must be reformed to meet the needs of all \ntaxpayers for the 21st century. I am convinced that it is through a \nsmaller, smarter government we will be able to serve Americans into the \nnext century.\n  The President's recent budget proposals for next year offer clear \nevidence of the lack of political will to make the hard choices when it \ncomes to cutting Government spending. His budget does not take \nseriously the need for spending restraint. In fact, Bill Clinton \nproposes spending over $1.5 trillion dollars this year and nearly $1.9 \ntrillion dollars in 2002. In other\n\n[[Page S2968]]\n\nwords, the only path that the President proposes is one that leads to \nhigher Government spending, higher taxes, and ever-increasing burdens \nfor our children.\n  Deficit spending cannot continue. We can no longer allow waste, \ninefficiency, and overbearing Government to consume the potential of \nAmerica's future. I am committed to spending restraint as we move to \nbalance the budget. As I said before, the line-item veto legislation \nwill not solve our deficit problems, but it will be a helpful tool to \ncut spending.\n  While the authority conferred upon the President in this legislation \nis commonly referred to as a line-item veto, the authority is actually \nan authority to cancel--with specified limitations--appropriations, \nentitlements, and tax cuts. This cancellation authority bears closer \nresemblance to impoundment authority than to a traditional veto.\n  What this legislation before us does is to allow a President to sign \nan appropriation, entitlement, or tax bill and then exercise a separate \nauthority to cancel an item in those laws, such cancellation to be \neffective unless Congress passes another law, presumably over the \nPresident's veto, to negate the President's exercise of his \ncancellation authority.\n  My concern with this legislation is that I have never heard of \nimpounding a tax cut. I have heard of impounding spending, but not a \ntax cut. As you know, 43 State Governors have line-item veto authority, \nbut not a single Governor has any authority to cancel a tax cut.\n  It is my studied judgment that the Federal Government spends too much \nand taxes too much. The well being of our people would be significantly \nimproved if both spending and taxation were diminished. Consequently, I \nwould like this legislation better if it allowed the President to \ncancel only spending items and not tax-cut items.\n\n  Fortunately, the President's authority in the tax area is narrow--\nevidence of the fact that the conferees understood the anomaly of \nimpounding tax cuts. In contrast to the authority on the spending side \nwhereby the President may cancel, first, ``any dollar amount of \ndiscretionary budget authority'' and (2), ``any item of new direct \nspending,'' the authority on the tax side is limited. The President has \nthe authority to cancel only items which meet the definition of a \n``limited tax benefit.''\n  A ``limited tax benefit'' is a defined term, which covers two \nspecific categories:\n  First, a revenue losing provision which provides a Federal tax \ndeduction, credit, exclusion, or preference to 100 or fewer \nbeneficiaries under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in any fiscal \nyear for which the provision is in effect; or\n  Second, any Federal tax provision which provides temporary or \npermanent transition relief for 10 or fewer beneficiaries in an fiscal \nyear from a change to the Internal Revenue Code.\n  In further contrast to the President's authority to cancel on the \nspending side, the legislation before us provides an additional \nmechanism that applies only with respect to limited tax benefits, in \norder to further circumscribe the President's authority. This mechanism \nprovides that in certain circumstances Congress may reserve unto itself \nthe sole discretion to identify those items in a revenue or \nreconciliation bill or joint resolution that constitute a limited tax \nbenefit. Such identification by Congress is controlling on the \nPresident, notwithstanding the definition of a ``limited tax benefit'' \nin the pending legislation, and is not subject to review by any court.\n  Historically, the Senate has enacted tax legislation either by \nunanimous consent, in the case of simple bills, or by agreeing to a \nconference report, in the case of more significant bills. As a \npractical matter, the bills adopted by unanimous consent generally deal \nwith one subject and are not an important concern to advocates of a \nline-item veto authority in the tax area. Conference reports, in \ncontrast, may contain a large number of tax items. It is in such \ncontext that a limited tax benefit might be found.\n\n  Consequently, whenever a revenue or reconciliation bill or joint \nresolution that amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is in \nconference, the Joint Committee on Taxation is required to review the \nlegislation and identify any provision that constitutes a limited tax \nbenefit. If the conferees include this list of identified items in the \nconference report, the President can cancel a tax item only if it \nappears on the list. If the Joint Committee on Taxation finds that the \nbill contains no limited tax benefits and Congress includes a statement \nin the conference report that no such items exist, the President is \nthereby foreclosed from canceling any tax item. However, if Congress \ndoes not include a statement either identifying the specific limited \ntax benefits or declaring that none is contained in the bill, then the \nPresident may cancel a tax item if it falls within the definition of a \nlimited tax benefit and the exercise of the President's authority meets \nthe requirements of section 1021 of the Budget Act, as written by this \npending legislation. Similarly, the President has such authority to \ncancel a limited tax benefit contained in legislation that is not \nadopted as a conference report. However, as I said, the occasion for an \nexercise of such authority would be rare, indeed.\n  The pending legislation authorizes conferees, in the above \ncircumstances, to include a statement regarding the provision of \nlimited tax benefits, notwithstanding any precedents or House or Senate \nrules--such as those rules relating to the proper scope of a \nconference--that might create a point of order against such inclusion. \nHowever, nothing in the pending legislation that authorizes the \ninclusion of such statements in a conference report limits either House \nfrom exercising its constitutional rulemaking authority by requiring, \nrather than authorizing, the inclusion of such statements.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their attention, and I urge \nthat they join me in supporting this needed legislation. I thank the \nChair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia yielded me 30 minutes, and I am quite sure I will not take \nthat amount of time. I know there are many wishing to speak. It is one \nof those cases that Mo Udall described one time: ``Just about \neverything that needs to be said has been said but everybody has not \nsaid it.'' So I am going to add my two cents worth.\n  First of all, the constitutional problems with this bill are \ninsurmountable.\n  The people listening or watching would be interested in knowing, \nnowhere in the Constitution is the word veto mentioned. Here is what \nthe Framers said in article I of the Constitution:\n\n       Every bill which shall have passed through the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate shall before it become a law \n     be presented to the President of the United States. If he \n     approve he shall sign it but if not he shall return it with \n     his Objections to the House in which it shall have \n     originated.\n\n  I have been here 21 years. I am not a constitutional scholar but a \ncountry lawyer with a great reverence for the Constitution. I have \nvoted against more constitutional tinkering, I will bet, than any \nSenator here in the past 21 years. Unhappily, we have Members of this \nbody who think that what Madison and Adams and Franklin did 207 years \nago was simply a rough draft for us to finish. This is a classic case \nof casual tinkering with our Constitution, that sacred document which \nwas put together by the greatest assemblage of minds under one roof in \nthe history of the world.\n  Do you know what else it is? It is a classic political response to an \nadmitted problem. It is a diversion and a distraction of the American \npeople. It tells them, ``Here is a simple answer to spending and \ndeficits.''\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. But people busy trying to \nmake a living and keeping food in the mouths of their children do not \nhave time to examine the complicated details of this proposal.\n  How did it all start? Where did this idea of a line-item veto \noriginate? I do not know. I had not been here very long when Ronald \nReagan was elected President. He had promised to balance the budget, \nand the first thing you know the deficit was soaring. And 8\n\n[[Page S2969]]\n\nyears later the national debt had gone from $1 trillion to $3 \ntrillion--tripled in 8 years. I do not want to be hypercritical of \nPresident Reagan, but I heard him say time and time again, ``I can't \nspend a nickel that the Congress doesn't appropriate.''\n  What he should have been saying is ``The Government cannot spend a \ndime unless I sign off on it.'' Despite all of that rhetoric and talk \nabout spending and deficits, from 1980 to 1992, the deficit went from \n$1 to $4 trillion. President Bush never vetoed an appropriations bill, \nand President Reagan vetoed one spending bill because it was not big \nenough--a Defense bill. He vetoed it because it did not have enough \nmoney in it.\n  President Clinton told my friends on the other side of the aisle, \n``You pass that reconciliation bill, and I am going to veto it.'' And \nthey passed it, and he vetoed it. He did not veto it because of the \namount of money in it. He vetoed it because of its priorities. But at \nthis very moment, conferees all over this Capitol building are meeting \ntrying to craft a resolution about differences on spending and \nprograms. Frankly, not making much headway.\n  The President wants another $3 billion in education, and that is the \nsticking point. Let me digress just for a moment on that point and say \nI saw the most interesting quote yesterday. I think it was the \nPresident of Peru who said everything should be subordinate to our \nchildren they are just forming their brain cells, their bones, their \nminds, and bodies, and they do that in a few short years. His point was \nthat if you neglect your children, you have lost a generation of what \nwould otherwise be healthy, productive citizens.\n  I thought that comment was beautiful, appropriate, and absolutely \ntrue.\n  So our President is simply saying that for everybody we allow to grow \nup in ignorance, we all pay a price for it. I do not know whether he is \ngoing to get the $3 billion or not. We may have another continuing \nresolution. I think we will. But my point is this. We are negotiating, \nand we are talking. If I were to say to my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle, ``Let us just send this bill over to the President and let \nhim pick and choose what he wants to kick out,'' I would start a riot \nright on the floor of the Senate. Nobody wants to do that.\n  I can remember when this line-item veto thing came up. I did not like \nit. People would say, ``Well, you were a Governor, weren't you?\n  ``Yes, I was Governor.''\n  ``Didn't you have a line-item veto?''\n  ``Yes, I had a line-item veto.''\n  And I used it occasionally. Do you know what I used it for? To get \nlegislators in line.\n  ``Senator, you know that vo-tech school for your high school in this \nbill? That sucker is going to be gone unless you get back down there \nand change your vote.'' That is the way I used it. That is the way a \nPresident of the United States would use it. It is a lethal weapon in \nthe hands of the executive branch.\n  Today, at this very moment, the deficit has fallen from a projected \n$390 billion--that is what it was projected to be. In 1992, we were \nlooking at a 1995 deficit of $390 billion. It is half that amount, and \nit is already down close to $20 billion from that projection, during \njust the first 3\\1/2\\ months of this new fiscal year. And it was not \ndone with a line-item veto. It was done by people who were determined \nto try to get the budget balanced.\n  Oh, this is a terrible, terrible, lousy idea. It started out as a \npolitical diversion for the benefit of a party, to say, ``Oh, wouldn't \nit be great if the President could just take all that pork out of \nthere?'' I have seen figures to show if the President utilized the \nline-item veto to its maximum, it would have about a 1 to 2 percent \neffect on the total budget. It is unneeded, hopelessly unworkable, and \nan unprecedented grant of power to the President of the United States. \nAnd, yes, it is patently unconstitutional.\n  This morning we had a vote. Everybody here knows what it was about. \nIt was about the Utah wilderness bill. Even the people of Utah, \napparently, did not think much of that bill. It is very controversial. \nBut the bill tracked almost exactly what President Bush recommended \nwhen he was President.\n  Now, if President Bush were sitting in the White House right now and \nwe were voting on cloture, as we did this morning, and the advocates of \nthe Utah wilderness bill needed the nine votes that they did not get \nthis morning, they could go to the White House and the President could \ncall three Republicans and maybe six Democrats and say, ``I have been \nlooking at this bill over here. You know that little old research \ncenter you have down in your State? My people tell me they do not much \nlike that. They do not think it is needed. They think it is a waste of \nmoney. I am inclined to disagree with my people. But, while I have you \non the phone, I am a strong proponent of the Utah wilderness bill. \nPerhaps you and I could sit down. We could talk this over. Maybe you \ncould see my way on the Utah wilderness bill and perhaps I could see \nyour way on that little research center you have in your State.''\n  It is not unheard of. I just got through confessing to you that is \nwhat I did when I was Governor. I have fought against 12 aircraft \ncarriers; I thought 10 was adequate. I fought against bringing those \nold moth-eaten battleships out of mothballs at a cost of about $2 \nbillion. Now they are back in mothballs. I fought and have continued to \nfight against the space station, which will go down in history as the \nmost outrageous waste of money in the history of the U.S. Government. \nWe finally killed the super collider. On every one of those things, the \nPresident was on the other side. And we build a multiple launch rocket \nin Camden, AR. Are you beginning to get the picture? The President \nmight say, ``Well, now, Senator, they tell me you are hot against the \nspace station. I am hot for it. And the Defense Department told me they \nwere thinking about moving the manufacturing of the multiple-launch \nrockets from Camden, AR, to someplace in Alabama.'' Do you think that \ndoes not get my attention, 750 jobs?\n  When James Madison and his colleagues in Philadelphia in 1787 were \ncrafting that document that has given this country the oldest democracy \nin the history of the world, they said the power of the purse will be \nvested in Congress. They did not say ``unless the President decides to \ntinker with the figures.'' They said, ``The Congress shall pass \nappropriation measures.'' Do you know what they gave us in exchange for \nthat? They said, ``You can spend the money, but you also have to raise \nit.'' That was supposed to be a nice balance. You have to tax the \npeople. That is not popular. You have to raise the money with taxation \nbefore you can spend it, but we are going to give you the power of the \npurse.\n\n  What are we doing? We are saying, ``James Madison, you did not know \nwhat you were doing. You made a colossal mistake when you crafted our \nConstitution, so we are going to correct it. We are going to give the \nPresident all the powers you gave him in the Constitution, and we are \ngoing to take some away from Congress and say you not only have all the \nexecutive powers, being Commander in Chief and all those things, we are \nnow going to give you the power of the purse.''\n  Colleagues, do not, 2 years from now, 3 years from now, come on this \nfloor and start crying about this mistake we are about to make. Oh, I \nknow it is popular. You walk in any diner in America and ask, ``Do you \nfavor the line-item veto?'' You bet. ``Do you favor prayer in school?'' \nYou bet. ``Do you favor a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution?'' You bet. Count me in. ``Are you against flag burning?'' \nYou bet. All those things that have a great emotional impact on people, \nuntil they have heard, as Paul Harvey says, ``the rest of the story.''\n  We are saying, ``Mr. President, stop us before we spend again. We are \nout of control, and only you can bring us under control.''\n  This is not such a good idea for the President, either. Everybody \nknows President Clinton and I have served our beloved State of Arkansas \ntogether for many, many years. He is my friend. But he is for this. I \nam sick that I did not get a chance to dissuade him before he said that \npublicly. But he says he is for a line-item veto, and that is a mild \ndisappointment to me.\n  But, you know, Mr. President, if he picks out some projects that are \nthe wrong projects and decides to send them back over here and require \nus, ultimately, to have a two-thirds vote in both Houses in order to \npass, he may\n\n[[Page S2970]]\n\nget in trouble in some State. So what do you think he is going to do? \nHe did not just fall off a watermelon truck. He did not get elected \nPresident by being stupid. He is going to be very careful about what he \nexcises out of the appropriations bills for fear he will lose that \nState.\n  Right now this Presidential race is heating up. Do you think a \nPresident is going to take anything big out of a bill in an election \nyear? In an off year, when he is not running for President, he might \npick out a couple of Senators he does not like, who have been \nparticularly obstreperous and have fought against some of his programs, \nand in a year when he is not up for reelection, he may decide to take \nsome of those projects out of the States of Senators of the other \nparty.\n  Bear in mind, when we first started talking about term limits, it \nswept this country like a prairie fire. It is a terrible idea, a lousy \nidea. I have never been for it and will never be for it. Virtually \nevery Member of this body on the other side of the aisle thought it was \nwonderful until they got control of Congress, and now you cannot even \nget it up for a vote.\n  We kept people's attention diverted just long enough, and the \nRepublicans took control of Congress, and now it is not worth the cost \nof electricity to have a roll call on term limits. It would be defeated \nsoundly. And when it comes to the line-item veto, they wanted a line-\nitem veto so desperately--in all fairness 19 Democrats voted for this \nthing, too. What was it about? Take the heat off Ronald Reagan. That is \nreally where it all started.\n  Then, suddenly, the contract, the famous Contract With America, over \nin the House of Representatives, it was put in the contract: line-item \nveto. Not many people in America knew it. Not many people in America \ncared. So we passed it. How long did it take after Bill Clinton got \nelected President--something nobody anticipated--we could not even get \nconferees appointed. Do you know what the bill now says? It will not go \ninto effect until January 1997, with the ardent, divine hope that Bob \nDole will be President January 1, 1997.\n\n  Those are the shenanigans that are going on with our sacred \nConstitution.\n  Mr. President, another thing that those great minds in Philadelphia \ndid almost 209 years ago is they provided a third branch of Government \ncalled the judicial branch. They set up a Supreme Court and such lower \ncourts as Congress may establish. They are independent, and they are \nnamed for life. You cannot threaten them. An article in New York Times \nthis morning describes a letter from the Federal judges vigorously \nopposing this, because if a Federal court renders a decision the \nPresident does not like, the next time around, he can just take their \nmoney away from them. He cannot take their salaries because you cannot \nreduce their compensation as long as they are sitting on the Court. You \ncan take their clerks and secretaries away from them; you can cut the \nair-conditioning off. To give the President that kind of authority over \nthe independent judiciary is the height of irresponsibility.\n  We not only have an independent judiciary, we just, fortunately, had \na very wise man named John Marshall who was Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court when the Marbury versus Madison case was argued. John \nMarshall said: ``Somebody has to decide: Are those laws they're passing \nover there in conformance with this Constitution or not?''\n  So was born the doctrine of judicial review. Thank God for John \nMarshall and judicial review and a truly independent judiciary.\n  So, Mr. President, this bill gives the President a legislative \nauthority to amend bills. He can literally amend our bills. I am \nterribly uncomfortable knowing this bill is going to sail through here \nwith a big majority, but I am comforted in the fact that I believe the \nindependent judiciary that was set up to stop such foolishness as this \nwill, indeed, do so. So I repose my trust in the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, when the Senate passed the line-item \nveto back in March of 1995, taxpayers across the Nation applauded the \nbipartisan efforts of the 69 Democrats and Republicans that worked \nshoulder to shoulder for the common good. What a difference a year \nmakes. A year later with Presidential politics well underway, \nRepublican conferees have engaged in an outrageous bait-and-switch \noperation designed to win political points and push meaningful reforms \nonto the back burner. Gone is the carefully crafted compromise bill \noffered on the floor by the distinguished majority leader that \nRepublicans embraced after deep divisions arose in their own ranks \nregarding the appropriateness of expanding Presidential rescission \npowers. Instead, conferees have substituted legislation based on the \nMcCain-Coats enhanced rescission proposal--a measure that in 1993 \nreceived only 45 votes. In abandoning the Senate approach, the \nRepublican majority has dangerously eroded bipartisan support for the \nSenate line-item veto and now threatens to snatch defeat from the jaws \nof victory.\n  Mr. President, I have been in this fight for too long to accept such \ncircus tricks. For well over the last decade, I have touted the line-\nitem veto as a meaningful way to restore responsibility and \naccountability to the budget process. Specifically, I have supported \nthe separate enrollment legislative line-item veto which avoids the \nconstitutional objections that are evident in proposals that seek to \nchange the President's constitutionally prescribed veto powers. Under \nthe separate enrollment mechanism, after legislation had passed both \nHouses of Congress in the same form, the enrolling clerk would enroll \neach appropriations item, targeted tax benefit, or new entitlement \nspending provision as a separate bill. In allowing these items to be \nconsidered as separate bills, the President would be able to use his \nexisting veto power as defined in the Constitution to reject \nlegislation.\n  Currently, some 43 States provide their chief executive with some \nversion of the veto pen. As a Governor of South Carolina, I used the \nline-item veto to balance four State budgets and win the first AAA \ncredit rating of any Southern State. As a United States Senator, I have \nworked tirelessly to pass the line-item veto. In 1985, working with \nformer Republican Mack Mattingly of Georgia, we rounded up 58 votes in \nthe Senate for a line-item veto that was the prototype for the Senate \npassed version. In 1990, I offered similar legislation before the \nSenate Budget Committee and we adopted my bill by a vote of 13 to 6--\nthe first time ever that the line-item veto had ever been favorably \nreported out of the Budget Committee. In 1993, Senator Bill Bradley and \nI offered an amendment to the budget reconciliation bill that would \nhave applied the line-item veto to wasteful tax breaks as well as \nunnecessary spending and garnered 53 votes.\n  But instead of fighting for the proposal that has been gaining \nground, the Republican majority, in resurrecting the enhanced \nrescission proposal, has backed the wrong horse. First, the conference \nreport's enhanced rescission approach damages the fundamental balance \nof power between the coordinate branches of Government that is the \ncornerstone of our constitutional system of Government. Under current \nlaw, Presidential rescissions are suggestions. They have no force of \nlaw until Congress, as the legislative branch, enacts those changes. \nHowever, under new enhanced rescission powers, Presidential spending \ncuts and loophole closings would have immediate force and thus, \naffirmatively change the existing law just passed by Congress. To \nreinstate those provisions, Congress would have to reenact the specific \nproposals in a rescission disapproval bill, itself subject to a \nPresidential veto requiring two-thirds of both Houses to override. In \nmy view, giving the President such legislative power amounts to an \nunconstitutional transfer of legislative power.\n\n  Second, the conference report's definition of a limited tax benefit \nwould do little to focus scrutiny on special interest tax breaks. The \noriginal Senate bill, like the legislative language in the Republican \nContract With America, appropriately recognized that pork is pork, be \nit of the tax or spending variety. But under the conference report, the \ndefinition becomes a tax lawyer's dream. It States that an item will be \nconsidered to be a limited tax benefit only if it is a tax benefit that \ngoes to 100 or fewer beneficiaries or a transitional relief provision \nthat accrues to\n\n[[Page S2971]]\n\n10 or fewer beneficiaries. This numerical distinction bears little \nrelation to the relative wastefulness of a tax break and, if valid, \nmight just as well apply to appropriations or new entitlement spending. \nBy setting numerical thresholds, Congress does little to close outdated \ntax loopholes and a lot to encourage the Gucci gulch crowd to abuse the \nsystem and make sure that any newly proposed tax break has at least 101 \nbeneficiaries. Moreover, additional restrictions further reduce the \nscope of qualifying tax benefits and erode the effectiveness of the \nline-item veto far beyond earlier versions.\n  Third, the conference report promises to give the President the veto \npen, but withholds the ink. If conferees were really concerned about \ndeficit reduction and not politics, why not make the act effective \nimmediately rather that wait until either 1997 or the enactment of a \nbalanced budget plan?\n  It is a sad truth, that politics are now more important than policy \nto this crowd. Having brought the line-item veto through the Senate on \na bipartisan basis, the Republican majority has now retreated, fearing \nthat a bipartisan line-item veto would leave no one over whom to claim \nvictory. I do not know whether the Republican majority has the votes to \nprevail today, but ultimately this enhanced rescission approach will be \nfound to be unconstitutional, which will bring us right back to where \nwe started.\n  As I have stated earlier, it does not have to be that way. The \nbipartisan proposal that I and others have advocated, and that the \nSenate adopted last year, allows Congress to consider individual items \nin enacted legislation as separate bills. The Founding Fathers \nentrusted our Nation's chief executive with the power of the veto to \nprovide our Government with the benefits of reconsideration and to \npromote legislative self-control. Unfortunately, over time, \ncongressional construction of legislation has eroded that veto power \nwhere disparate spending and tax provisions are bundled in large \nomnibus bills. As a result, the President is forced to take it or leave \nit. Thus, the separate enrollment item veto eliminates this all or \nnothing choice and allows the President to apply his veto power in \nconsidering each item on its own merits.\n  More importantly, by maintaining congressional control over the \nprocess, the separate enrollment approach avoids the constitutional \ninfirmities of enhanced rescission bills. As Lawrence Tribe, \nConstitutional Law Scholar at Harvard University, wrote in a letter to \nSenator Bradley,\n\n       The most promising line-item veto by far is the suggestion \n     . . . that Congress itself begin to treat each appropriation, \n     and each tax measure, as an individual `bill' to be presented \n     separately to the President for his signature or veto. Such a \n     change could be affected simply, and with no constitutional \n     difficulty, by a temporary alteration in Congressional rules \n     regarding the enrolling and presentment of bills.\n\n  Mr. President, this struggle will continue. And I will be willing in \nthe future to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as I \nhave in the past, to develop a responsible, workable, constitutional, \nand bipartisan legislative line-item veto. I wish that day were today, \nbut with the Presidential races in full swing, I fear once again that \npolitics, not policy, is the driving force behind today's controversy.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have for many years now supported a line-\nitem veto that can help to wipe out wasteful special-interest spending \nitems that are added to our appropriations bills.\n  But I have also cosponsored and supported line-item veto authority \nfor the President that includes the authority to cut special-interest \ntax breaks, that lose money from the Treasury as surely as any spending \nprogram. In many ways they weaken our control over the deficit more \nthan annual spending bills.\n  Because tax breaks characteristically last for years with little or \nno review, they can cause more damage than any single item in 1 year's \nappropriations bill.\n  The line-item veto we passed out of the Senate last year, the \nseparate enrollment version that I have consistently supported for over \na decade, included clear and strong language that put special-interest \ntax breaks under the same veto power as any pork-barrel spending \nproject.\n  Unfortunately, the version that came out of conference with the House \nhas so diluted that provision that it may well apply to virally no tax \nbreaks.\n  That is why I will vote for Senator Byrd's proposal, that restores \nthe clear authority to cut tax breaks as well as special-interest \nspending.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the time situation, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 86 minutes. \nThe Senator from West Virginia has 4 hours 9 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. At this moment, do I understand there is 5 minutes \nbefore Senator Moynihan's time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, before we finally vote to table Senator Byrd's motion, \nthere will be another 15 minutes on our side for discussion and some \nkind of rejoinder. But I just want to have a 5-minute discussion with \nthe Senators about this issue of the shift in power.\n  I say to all of them, I have been concerned about that for a long \ntime. I was concerned about it as this line-item veto concept, over the \nlast decade, worked its way through here. But I do not think we ought \nto leave the record with any inference that Congress is left with no \npower to respond to a President's use of this item veto authority.\n  So if, indeed, Mr. President, any President of the United States \nchooses to make a mockery of the Senate or the House by arbitrarily \nexercising this veto, let me suggest the Senate has to confirm his \nCabinet. The Senate has to confirm his appointees, and there are \nhundreds of them. Presidents of the United States need legislation. \nThey work to get elected, and they send us their proposals. Their \nproposals are their policies and they need to pass Congress to become \nlaw.\n  Let me suggest that any President who would choose to act \ncapriciously and arbitrarily in this line-item veto exercise will do so \nat his own risk. We are really trying out this item veto--it is an \nexperiment in seeing if we can do a better job of spending the \ntaxpayers' money. I believe Presidents who will arbitrarily and \ncapriciously use that tool take unto themselves the opportunity that \nwill certainly find that Congress will have a chance to a respond \narbitrarily toward Presidents.\n  I am not threatening this, and I am not suggesting a tit-for-tat sort \nof situation. But the truth of the matter is, there is some serious \nbalance of this power that remains vested in the Congress of the United \nStates, and, indeed, speaking for our institution, the U.S. Senate, \nthis institution, there are plenty of things Presidents need the U.S. \nSenate to do so they can do their executive work well.\n  After all, the President is the Executive. He needs Congress to help \nhim so he can use his Executive powers. If he chooses to use them \narbitrarily with reference to the line-item veto, then, obviously, he \nmight find an uncooperative Senate, he might find an uncooperative \nCongress. I do not think that is ever going to occur, but I thought it \nmight be good for the record just to explore that we have not given \naway all our power, we have not given away all our ability to say \n``yes'' and ``no'' to Presidents of the United States on a myriad of \nthings that the President needs for his Executive power.\n  Now, why do I say it that way? Because the contention is that he is \ntaking away some of our prerogatives as legislators in the \nappropriating process, and if he chooses to do that arbitrarily, then \nhe is, obviously, weakening our power.\n  I am suggesting we are not without recourse. I think there is going \nto be a give and take for a few years, but we are not also accepting \nthis concept in perpetuity. We are giving the Executive the line-item \nveto for 8 years, two full Presidential terms. Then we will have to \npass it again or change it.\n  But, indeed, that event of taking another look to see if it is being \nused properly or if we should further define things is not left solely \nwithin the discretion of Presidents, because this line-item veto \nsunsets in 8 years and we will have something to say about the \ncontinuation of it.\n  The arguments about constitutionality, the arguments about balance of\n\n[[Page S2972]]\n\npower are serious. I commend the number of Senators for raising these \nserious issues in very delicate and sincere ways and I commend them for \ntheir concern. Most of all, I commend Senator Byrd for his dedicated \nexplanations here and heretofore. He even wrote a whole book about the \nRoman senate versus losing its power and compared it in many ways to \nwhat he perceives might happen in this regard.\n  I was privileged to get one of those books. I do not always read \nbooks that are given to me, but I read that book. In fact, I told the \nSenator I had and I thought it was exciting.\n  He reminded me the successor to Rome was Italy. He reminded me I \nmight even be a descendant of one of those people he wrote about.\n  Nonetheless, I thought that we ought to get this short 5-minute \nargument in response, just for our perspective in terms of why we are \nnot fearful, why we do this with open eyes and open minds, hoping that \nit will help the American people get better Government at less cost. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to begin by joining the \nchairman of the Budget Committee in expressing my profound gratitude \nand admiration to the revered, sometime President pro tempore of the \nSenate, Robert C. Byrd, who has set us a standard which if we fail to \nmeet today, will remain to measure those who come after us.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nYork, whose obstinate veracity we all admire. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in the serene confidence that \nthis measure is constitutionally doomed. That speaks to the stability \nof the American political system, a stability sustained in so many \nmoments of peril by the American judiciary.\n  By contrast, I find myself once again agitated that a measure of such \nenormity--I use that word in both of its meanings--comes to us for so \nfrivolous a reason. We are told by the committee of conference that the \npurpose of the conference report, which is to say the bill, is to \npromote savings. We are further informed that this is necessary because \nthe American people consistently cite runaway Federal spending and a \nrising national debt as among the top issues of national concern over \nthe past 15 years alone.\n  The national debt has quintupled from 1981 and 1996. Our total \nnational debt amounted to just $1 trillion in 1981. Yet today, just 15 \nyears later, that debt exceeds $5 trillion. Those numbers are not quite \naccurate, but they are approximate and will do.\n  I have stood on this floor for on to 15 years making the plain point \nthat the increase in debt of the 1980's was an act of policy, designed \nto reduce the size of the Federal Government by reducing its fiscal \nresources. Fifteen days into his Presidency, February 5, 1981, \nPresident Reagan declared in a television address, ``There are always \nthose who told us that taxes can't be cut until spending was reduced. \nWell, you know, we can lecture our children about extravagance until we \nrun out of voice and breath or we can cut their extravagance by simply \nreducing their allowance.''\n  ``Starve the beast'' was the phrase. A huge increase in debt was the \nresult. But at least until now we have not set out to mangle the \nConstitution to make up for the honest mistakes of one administration.\n  The separate enrollment bill passed by the Senate last March would \nhave required appropriations bills to be disassembled by the enrolling \nclerks after passage and presented to the President, one by one, for \nhis signature. During that debate I spoke at some length about its \nconstitutional and practical defects. The legislation before us is \nsomewhat less convoluted. But its effect on the separation of powers \nbetween legislative and executive branches would be just as profoundly \ndestabilizing.\n  I will describe at this point what has been described as the methods, \nthe procedure for cancellation. Once such a cancellation is made, it \nwould ultimately require a two-thirds vote of the Congress to override. \nThe legislation would have us depart dramatically from the procedures \nset forth in the plain language of the presentment clause in article I, \nsection 7.\n\n       Every Bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a \n     Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If \n     he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it . \n     . .\n\n  There is nothing ambiguous about this provision. The Supreme Court \ndeclared in INS versus Chadha in 1983 that--I quote the Court:\n\n       It emerges clearly that the prescription for legislative \n     action in Art. I, Section 7, represents the Framers' \n     decision--[the framers' decision, Mr. President]--that the \n     legislative power of the Federal Government be exercised in \n     accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively \n     considered procedure.\n\n  In Chadha the court held unconstitutional a statute that permitted \neither House of Congress by resolution to invalidate decisions of the \nexecutive branch as to whether certain aliens could be deported. This \nso-called legislative veto, according to the Court, impermissibly \ndeparted from the explicit procedures set forth in article I, which the \ncourt said were ``integral parts of the constitutional design for the \nseparation of powers.''\n  And 3 years later, in Bowsher versus Synar, the Supreme Court was \nequally scrupulous in requiring strict adherence to the procedures set \nforth in article I. In Bowsher, the Court invalidated the provision of \nthe Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Deficit Control Act, giving the Comptroller \nGeneral of the United States authority to execute spending reductions \nunder the act. The Court held that this violated the separation of \npowers because it vested an executive branch function in the \nComptroller General, who is a legislative branch official. ``Underlying \nboth decisions,'' the Congressional Research Service has written, ``was \nthe premise . . . that the powers delegated to the three Branches are \nfunctionally identifiable, distinct, and definable.''\n  There is no ambiguity about the meaning of the requirements of \narticle I, section 7, nor is there any uncertainty about why the \nframers vested the power of the purse in Congress. Madison in \nFederalist No. 58:\n\n       This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the \n     most complete and effectual weapon with which any \n     constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the \n     people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for \n     carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\n\n  Until the Supreme Court considers this bill--and it surely will--we \nwill not have a definitive constitutional determination. But some of \nthe Nation's leading constitutional scholars have already concluded \nthat this legislation will be struck down by the courts when it reaches \nthem.\n  Michael J. Gerhardt, a sometime professor of law at Cornell \nUniversity, and now professor of law at the College of William and \nMary, has written me to say, that in his opinion--I quote--``its \nconstitutionality is plainly doomed.''\n  He argues first that this legislation violates article I, section 7, \nin that it permits enactment of a bill that has never been voted on by \nCongress as such. That is, by exercising its power to cancel any part \nof the bill after signing it, the President would be creating a new law \nin a form never considered by Congress. That is plainly \nunconstitutional.\n  Professor Gerhardt argues that granting the President power to \nreconfigure bills passed by Congress is a legislative function which \nmay not be delegated to the Executive. Finally, he notes that even if \nCongress could delegate the proposed veto power to the President, \n``Congress lacks the authority to restrict Presidential authority by \nlimiting the grounds a President may consider as appropriate for \nvetoing something.''\n  In his treatise, ``American Constitutional Law,'' Laurence H. Tribe \nof the Harvard Law School writes that--\n\n       . . . empowering the President to veto appropriations bills \n     line by line would profoundly alter the Constitution's \n     balance of power. The President would be free not only to \n     nullify new congressional spending initiatives and \n     priorities, but to wipe out previously enacted programs that \n     receive their funding through the annual appropriations \n     process.\n\n  Professor Tribe goes on to say:\n\n       Congress, which the Constitution makes the master of the \n     public purse, would be demoted to the role of giving fiscal \n     advice that the executive would be free to disregard. The \n     Framers granted the President no such special veto over \n     appropriations bills, despite\n\n[[Page S2973]]\n\n     their awareness that the insistence of colonial assemblies \n     that their spending bills could not be amended once they \n     passed the lower house had greatly enhanced the growth of \n     legislative power.\n\n  Yesterday, we asked Professor Tribe for his opinion on the \nlegislation before the Senate today. He graciously telephoned our \noffice this morning to say that after studying the conference report, \nhe has concluded as follows. This is Laurence H. Tribe this morning:\n\n       This is a direct attempt to circumvent the constitutional \n     prohibition against legislative vetoes, and its delegation of \n     power to the President clearly fails to meet the requisites \n     of article I, section 7. Furthermore, nothing in my letter of \n     January 13, 1993 regarding ``separate enrollment'' has any \n     bearing on the mechanism that would be enacted here.\n\n  Professor Tribe refers to a letter that was quoted several times in \nlast year's debate in which he discussed the possibility that separate \nenrollment might be constitutional. He emphasizes now that his 1993 \nletter should not be interpreted to indicate any support for this \nlegislation, which he concludes is certainly not constitutional. Those \nare the constitutional considerations briefly stated.\n  Now to an additional subject that is of particular interest to me as \nranking member and sometime chairman of the Committee on Finance, I \ndirect the attention of the Senate to the provision of section \n1021(A)(3) of this legislation dealing with limited tax benefits. This \nnew language appears to be a response to the argument, raised in the \ndebate last year, that spending and tax benefits should be treated \nequally under a line-item veto.\n  The provision purports to subject tax benefits to the same treatment \nunder the line-item veto as other spending, yet the bill's application \nto limited tax benefits would have very little real effect, save, as I \nbelieve, pernicious ones.\n  Under the proposal, ``limited tax benefit'' is defined as any tax \nprovision identified by the Joint Committee on Taxation as, (first), a \nrevenue-losing provision; (second), having 100 or fewer beneficiaries \nin any fiscal year; and (third), not within a number of very broad \nexceptions designed to exempt from the line-item veto any tax provision \nunder which ``all similarly situated persons receive the same \ntreatment.'' Any transition rule that the Joint Tax Committee estimates \nwill benefit 10 or fewer taxpayers in any fiscal year would also be \ndefined as a limited tax benefit.\n  This definition is so narrowly drawn that it will be almost \neffortlessly circumvented, for it is surely simple enough--and, \nSenators, as a member of the Finance Committee for 20 years, let me \nassure you, there is no problem expanding the number of beneficiaries \nfrom 10 to 100. It is very readily done and perhaps too often so.\n  To the extent the drafters are unwilling or unable to manipulate this \nnumerical standard, one of the ``similarly situated'' exceptions often \nwill be available to avoid the limited tax benefit designation. By way \nof an example, the conference report states that a provision that \nbenefits only automobile manufacturers would not be treated as a \nlimited tax benefit because ``the benefit is available to anyone who \nchooses to engage in the activity.'' Thus, a provision that benefits \nonly Ford Motor Co. but is drafted in a manner potentially open to \nGeneral Motors and Chrysler would apparently escape the line-item veto.\n\n  The tax-writing committees often and properly find that tax relief \nmay be justified in narrow circumstances. Such narrow relief is and \nought to be granted sparingly, yet these features of the bill create a \nperverse incentive to craft broader tax benefits than necessary in \norder to avoid application of the line-item veto. This is surely \ncounterproductive.\n  Second, while seemingly objective on its face, the definition \nincludes several elements that are seriously ambiguous, raising a \nnumber of questions. For example, what does it mean to be ``similarly \nsituated?'' Can a provision be drafted to benefit all baseball team \nowners to the exclusion of other sport franchises? How does one \ndetermine who are the beneficiaries of a particular provision? Would \nthe football coaches pension provision--and, yes, there was one, in the \nvetoed Balanced Budget Act of 1995--be deemed to benefit only the \npension plan itself or the more than 100 coach participants? I could go \non longer than the Senate would be interested or perhaps even edified \nto hear.\n  There is a final point, sir. By vesting in the Joint Committee on \nTaxation the exclusive authority--not subject to judicial review, not \nsubject to debate on the Senate floor--the exclusive authority to make \nthese determinations, this legislation would effectively grant great \nadditional power in drafting tax legislation to the chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Finance and the chairman of the House Committee on \nWays and Means--those two persons to the exclusion, I fear, of the rest \nof the Congress, the Members of either body.\n  While the Joint Tax Committee may indeed be the best institutional \ndecisionmaker on technical tax issues, the decision of what constitutes \na limited tax benefit can and no doubt would be quite political. The \nchairmen of the two tax-writing committees could exert pressure on the \nJoint Tax Committee to exclude favored items from application of the \nbill. Conversely, the chairmen would be granted potentially undue \ninfluence over other Members' legislative items with the implicit \nthreat that such items would be deemed subject to the line-item veto. \nIn his letter to which I referred earlier, Professor Gerhardt expresses \nsimilar concerns about this provision.\n  Now, I mentioned that the purpose of this legislation, according to \nthe conference committee, is to limit runaway Federal spending and \nthereby reduce the debt. I am here to report--and I hope someone will \nhear--that, in point of fact, the era of runaway spending is behind us.\n  The Federal budget is in primary surplus for the first time since the \n1960's--for the first time. This came about largely as a consequence of \nthe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which provided for \ndeficit reduction of some $500 billion--the largest deficit reduction \nmeasure in the half century since the wartime-incurred deficit was \nreduced following World War II. Such was the size of the reductions \nthat interest rates fell sharply, and the deficit premium, as it had \nbeen called, in the markets dropped, and another $100 billion was \nsaved. And we are, at long last, moving our deficits down--down to 2 \npercent of gross domestic product this year. The difference between the \npresent deficit and a true surplus is merely the debt service on the \ndebt accumulated in those previous 15 years. If we had the debt of the \n1970's, we would be in surplus today.\n  The sequence whereby that happened was the surpluses of the Kennedy-\nJohnson era became neutral in the Nixon administration, and the \nrecessions and inflation of the Ford and Carter administrations \nproduced small primary deficits. Then came the 1980's.\n  Then came 1993 and, among other things, I stand here saying --\nhappily, to an almost empty Chamber--we had the largest tax increase in \nhistory, and I was chairman of the Finance Committee. It was not \nforgotten entirely in New York when I came back from the election. How \ndid we do this? Very simply, we did it by compromise. We did it by the \nkind of compromise the Framers anticipated. The Framers said they did \nnot create a system of government which presumed virtue. They took \ninterest as a given and virtue as something to be acquired. And the \noffsetting principles, as Madison put it, to make up for the defect of \nbetter motives. We made all manner of compromises in that legislation, \nand we would not have our deficit down to 2 percentof GDP today had we \nnot.\n  For example, the business meal tax deduction was reduced from 80 to \n50 percent. That was something a chairman from New York could offer and \nsay, ``Here, I am willing to do this.'' The restaurant owners said, \n``What about us?'' They were given a tax credit for the FICA tax they \nare required to pay on their employees' tips. Well, it was a \ncompromise. I could go on and on about that. Gasoline and diesel fuels \nwere raised 4.3 cents per gallon. Oh, Mr. President, do I remember that \n0.3 cents--1 week in a room on the third floor without windows of this \nCapitol. But we got that. How? Airlines were given a 2-year exemption \nfrom the increased tax. We also took away tax benefits previously \naccorded exporters of raw timber.\n  Mr. President, these compromises make major legislation agreeable and \neffective. Supposing a member with\n\n[[Page S2974]]\n\nwhich a chairman worked were asked to make a concession in return for \nan accommodation; supposing that member had to think: The minute this \nbill becomes law, that chairman will go to that President and say, \n``Take out that provision that was made for the Senator from Louisiana, \nbecause it was only done to get your bill by, Mr. President.'' You will \nnot have that which makes legislation possible. You will not have that \nspirit of trust, which performance reinforces and creates the stability \nof our institutions. For if there is no trust, there will be no \ncompromise, and if there is no compromise, there will be no \nGovernment--no stable Government.\n  I sometimes think of this simple fact. Mr. President, there are seven \nnations on Earth that both existed in 1914 and have not had their form \nof government changed by violence since 1914. There are two since 1800, \nand we are one of them. We are one of the seven and we are one of the \ntwo. That stability did not come easily, nor should it be assumed a \ngiven. That stability rests on the rock bed of the Constitution, and we \ndo a very poor service to that stability when we begin to dynamite away \nparts of that rock bed.\n  I will close with simply one statement, which we are all required on \nour oaths to observe. The Judicial Conference of the United States has \nwritten to us to say: Do not do this. We are the least harmless \nbranch--again, remember Madison--and we cannot make you do it. I will \nquote them:\n\n       The line-item veto authority poses a threat to the \n     independence of the judiciary because a President could put \n     pressure on the courts or retaliate against the judges by \n     vetoing items in judicial appropriation bills.\n\n  This is a profound responsibility which--in the end, we will turn to \nthe courts to see sustained. I believe this is a serious concern. I \nhope that it will be attended to. Mr. President, I thank the Senate for \nits careful, courteous attention. I thank Senator Domenici. I thank, \nwith special gratitude, Senator Byrd.\n  I will also, finally, ask unanimous consent that the letter from \nProf. Michael Gerhardt, along with two letters from the Judicial \nConference of the United States, be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         College of William & Mary\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                 Williamsburg, VA, March 27, 1996.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: I appreciate the chance to share \n     with you my opinion on the constitutionality of the Line Item \n     Veto Act of 1996, as set forth in the Conference Report, \n     dated March 4, 1996 (hereinafter ``the Republican draft'' or \n     ``the Conference Report''). In this letter, I focus only on a \n     few of the more serious problems with the Republican Draft \n     and do not purport to analyze exhaustively its \n     constitutionality. Even so, I am of the view that, given just \n     the few significant flaws in the Conference Report that I \n     identify and explain below, its constitutionality is plainly \n     doomed.\n       Describing how the law works is crucial for identifying and \n     understanding the constitutional and practical problems posed \n     by some of its major provisions. As I read it, the critical \n     delegation made by the Republican draft to the President is \n     the authority to ``cancel'' all or any part of \n     ``discretionary budget authority,'' ``and item of direct \n     spending,'' or ``any targeted tax benefit.'' Presumably, a \n     presidential cancellation pursuant to the act has the effect \n     of nullifying a portion of a budgetary or appropriations bill \n     unless a majority of each chamber of Congress agrees within a \n     specified time period to pass a ``disapproval bill'' \n     specifying its intention to reauthorize the particular item \n     cancelled by the President. The President may veto the \n     disapproval bill, which can then become law only if two-\n     thirds of each chamber of Congress agree to override his \n     veto.\n       In my opinion, there are three fatal constitutional \n     problems with the procedures outlined above. First, the law \n     effectively allows any portion of a bill enacted by Congress \n     that the President signs into law but does not cancel to \n     become law, in spite of the fact that Congress will have \n     never voted on it as such. This kind of lawmaking by the \n     President clearly violates Article I, section 1, which grants \n     ``[a]ll legislative powers'' to Congress, and Article I, \n     section 7, which grants to Congress alone the discretion to \n     package bills as it sees fit.\n       Article I states further that the President's veto power \n     applies to ``every Bill . . ., Every Order, Resolution or \n     Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives may be necessary.'' \\1\\ This means that the \n     President may wield his veto on the legislative product only, \n     as Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe maintains in his \n     treatise, ``in the form in which Congress has chosen to send \n     it to the White House: be the bill small or large, its \n     concerns focused or diffuse, its form particular or \n     omnibus, the President must accept or reject the entire \n     thing, swallowing the bitter with the sweet.''\\2\\ Tribe's \n     subsequent change of position is of no consequence, \n     because he was right in his initial understanding of the \n     constitutional dynamics of a statutorily created line-item \n     veto mechanism. The fact that the President has signed the \n     law as enacted is irrelevant, because a law is valid only \n     if it takes effect in the precise configuration approved \n     by the Congress. The President does not have the authority \n     to put into effect as a law only part of what Congress has \n     passed as such. The particular form a bill should have as \n     a law is, as the Supreme Court has said, the ``kind of \n     decision that can be implemented only in accordance with \n     the procedures set out in Article I.''\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Conference Report would enable the President to make \n     affirmative budgetary choices that the framers definitely \n     wanted to preclude him from making. The framers deliberately \n     chose to place the power of the purse outside of the \n     executive because they feared the consequences of \n     centralizing the powers of the purse and the sword. As James \n     Madison wrote in the Federalist No. 58, ``This power of the \n     purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and \n     effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the \n     immediate representatives of the people.''\\4\\ Every Congress \n     (until perhaps this most recent one)--as well as all of the \n     early presidents, for that matter--has shared the \n     understandings that only the Congress has the authority to \n     decide how to package legislation, that this authority is a \n     crucial component of checks and balances, and that the \n     President's veto authority is strictly a negative power that \n     enables him to strike down but not to rewrite whatever a \n     majority of Congress has sent to him as a bill.\n       The wisdom of leaving the power of the purse in Congress, \n     as the framers desired as a means of checking the executive, \n     is buttressed by the recognition that pork barrel \n     appropriations--the evil sought to be eliminated by the \n     Republican draft--are just unattractive examples of \n     legislating for diverse interests, which is the very stuff of \n     representative government. Apportioning the public fisc in a \n     large and diverse nation requires degrees of coordination and \n     compromise that the framers left to the initial discretion of \n     Congress to be undone only as specified in Article I.\n       The second constitutional defect with the Conference \n     Report's basic procedures involves the legitimacy of the \n     cancelling authority given to the President. Proponents of \n     this cancellation power defend it as a legitimate delegation \n     of congressional authority to the President; however, this \n     argument rests on a misunderstanding of the relevant \n     constitutional doctrine. This misunderstanding is reflected \n     in the CRS Report, which claims erroneously that ``while \n     the [Supreme] Court has used a balancing test in some \n     separation of powers cases, it has never chosen to do so \n     in delegation cases.''\\5\\ The latter assertion is simply \n     wrong.\n       In fact, the Supreme Court has issued two lines of cases on \n     congressional delegations. The first, which is not implicated \n     by the Conference Report, involves delegations from Congress \n     to administrative agencies or inferior bodies. The Court tens \n     to evaluate such delegations under a ``functionalist'' \n     approach to separation of powers under which the Court \n     balances the competing concerns or interests at stake to \n     ensure that the core function of a branch is not frustrated. \n     For example, the Court used this approach in Morrison v. \n     Olson\\6\\ to uphold the Independent Counsel Act in which the \n     Congress had delegated the executive function of criminal \n     prosecution to an individual not formally associated with any \n     of the three branches. Similarly in Mistretta v. United \n     States,\\7\\ the Court upheld the constitutionality of the \n     composition and lawmaking function of the United States \n     Sentencing Commission, at least three of whose members are \n     required by statute to be lower court judges and to which the \n     Congress delegated the authorities to promulgate, review, and \n     revise sentence-determinative guidelines.\n       The Republican Draft clearly violates, however, the second \n     line of Supreme Court decision on congressional delegations. \n     These cases involve delegations from Congress to the titular \n     head of a branch, such as one of its chambers or the \n     President. In these cases, the Court has not used a balancing \n     test; rather, the Court has used a ``formalist'' approach \n     that treats the Constitution as granting to each branch \n     distinct powers and setting forth the maximum degree to which \n     the branches may share those powers. A formalist approach to \n     separation of powers treats the test of the Constitution and \n     the intent of it drafters as controlling and changed \n     circumstances and broader policy outcomes as irrelevant to \n     constitutional outcomes. In recent years, the Court has used \n     this approach to strike down the legislative veto in Chadha \n     because it would have allowed one House to take legislative \n     action without complying with the procedures set forth in \n     Article I; to hold in Bowsher v. Synar\\8\\ that Congress may \n     not delegate executive budgetary functions to an official \n     over whom Congress has removal power; and to strike down in \n     Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens for the Abatement \n     of Aircraft Noise\\9\\ the creation of a Board\n\n[[Page S2975]]\n\n     of Review partially composed of members of Congress with \n     executive veto-like power over the decisions of the directors \n     of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.\n       Undoubtedly, the Court would follow a formalist approach in \n     striking down the Republican draft. For one thing, the Court \n     would not be able to escape applying the logic of Bowsher v. \n     Synar to the proposed law. Whereas the crucial problem in \n     Bowsher was Congress' attempt to authorize the exercise of \n     certain executive authority by a legislative agent--the \n     Comptroller General, here the problem is that the President \n     would plainly be exercising what everyone agrees is \n     legislative authority--the discretion to determine the \n     particular configuration of a bill that will become law. Even \n     the law's proponents admit it allows the President to \n     exercise legislative authority, albeit in their view \n     delegated to him by Congress.\n       Formalist analysis would be appropriate in evaluating such \n     a delegation's constitutionality because it would be the kind \n     about which the framers were most concerned; the checks and \n     balances set forth in the Constitution deal directly with how \n     the titular heads of each branch should interrelate. Hence, \n     the Court has opted for a formalist approach to deal with \n     delegations between the branches at their respective apexes \n     to preclude one branch from aggrandizing itself at the \n     expense of another. The Conference Report would clearly \n     undermine the balance of power between the branches at the \n     top, because it would eliminate the Congress's primacy in the \n     budget area and would unravel the framers' judgment to \n     restrict the President's role in the lawmaking process to a \n     qualified negative rather than to have him exercise an \n     affirmative power to redraft or reconfigure a bill.\n       Even if the Court used a functionalist approach to evaluate \n     the constitutionality of the Republican draft, it would \n     strike down the proposed law. The reason is that the law \n     establishes an uneven playing field for the President and \n     Congress on budgetary matters. In so doing, it profoundly \n     alters the balance of power set forth in the Constitution. As \n     Professor Tribe recognizes further in his treatise, such a \n     scheme ``would enable the President to nullify new \n     congressional spending initiatives and priorities as well as \n     to wipe out previously enacted programs that receive their \n     funding through the annual appropriations process. Congress, \n     which the Constitution makes the master of the public purse, \n     would be demoted to the role of giving fiscal advice that the \n     President would be effectively free to disregard.\\10\\ Once \n     again Tribe's subsequent change of position does not \n     undermine the soundness of his initial reasoning, for the \n     historical record is clear that the framers, as Tribe had \n     recognized himself, never intended nor tried to grant the \n     President any ``special veto power over appropriation bills, \n     despite their awareness that the insistence of colonial \n     assemblies that their spending bills could not be amended \n     once they had passed the lower house had greatly enhanced the \n     growth of legislative power.'' \\11\\\n       An example should illustrate the problematic features of \n     the proposed cancellation mechanism. Suppose that 55% of \n     Congress passes a law, including expenditures for a new \n     Veterans Administration hospital in New York. The President \n     decides he would prefer for Congress not to spend any federal \n     money on this project, so after signing the bill into law, he \n     exercises his authority to cancel the allocations made for \n     the new facility. Again 55% of the Congress agrees to make \n     this expenditure but this time through the passage of a \n     disapproval bill. The President vetoes the latter, and \n     Congress fails to override his veto, with only 55% of \n     Congress (yet again) voting for the appropriation. The net \n     effect is that the President would get to refuse to spend \n     money 55% of the Congress will have thrice said it wanted to \n     spend. Thus, the Conference Report would require Congress to \n     vote as many as three separate times to fund something while \n     assuming in the process an increasingly defensive posture \n     vis-a-vis the President. In other words, the Republican draft \n     allows the President to force Congress to go through two \n     majority votes--the second of which is much more difficult to \n     attain because it would have to be in favor of a specific \n     expenditure that is now severed from the other items of the \n     compromise giving rise to its inclusion in the first place--\n     and one supermajority vote in order to put into law a \n     particular expenditure.\n       A third constitutional problem with the Conference Report \n     involves the constraints it tries to place on the President's \n     cancellation authority. The latter is for all intents and \n     purposes a veto. It has the effect of a veto because it \n     forces Congress in the midst of the lawmaking process into \n     repassing something as a bill that ultimately must carry a \n     supermajority of each chamber in order to become law. \n     Nevertheless, the Conference Report attempts to constrain the \n     reasons the President may have for cancelling some part of a \n     budget or appropriations bill. Just as Congress lacks the \n     authority through legislation to enhance presidential \n     authority in the lawmaking process by empowering him to \n     reconfigure what Congress has passed as a bill into some \n     other form prior to its becoming a law, Congress lacks the \n     authority to restrict presidential authority by limiting the \n     grounds a president may consider as appropriate for vetoing \n     something.\n       Even apart from whatever constitutional problems the \n     Conference Report may have, it poses two serious practical \n     problems. First, the possibility for substantial judicial \n     review of presidential or congressional compliance with the \n     Republican draft is quite high. For example, it seems likely \n     that lawsuits could be brought challenging whether the \n     President has appropriately considered, as the act directs, \n     such things as ``the legislative history'' or ``any specific \n     sources of information referenced in such law or, in the \n     absence of specific sources of information, the best \n     available information'' or ``the specific definitions \n     contained'' within it. At the very least, the bill requires \n     that the President make some showing that he has done these \n     things to the satisfaction of members of Congress (or at \n     least those disposed to bring a lawsuit in the absence of \n     such a showing.) There are also numerous procedures OMB and \n     each house of Congress must follow that, presumably, could \n     become the basis for judicial challenge if not done \n     completely to the satisfaction of partisan foes in the other \n     branch. In addition, there may be some questions as whether \n     the President has in fact complied with Congress' or the \n     Republican draft's understanding of the kinds of items he may \n     cancel, such as a ``targeted tax benefit.''\n       The likely prospect of substantial judicial interference \n     with the budgetary process is unsettling. The framers \n     deliberately excluded the unselected federal judiciary from \n     exercising any kind of decisive role in budgetary \n     negotiations or deliberations. The Republican draft does not \n     ensure that this exclusion will always be honored. The \n     framers wanted all of the key decisionmakers within budget \n     negotiations to be politically accountable; any budgetary \n     impasse between the President and Congress that the federal \n     courts help to resolve in favor of one or the other will \n     simply diminish even further the public's confidence that the \n     political process is the place to turn for answers to such \n     deadlocks.\n       Another practical difficulty is with the authorization made \n     by the Republican draft to the Joint Committee on Taxation to \n     render an official opinion, which may become a part of a \n     budgetary or appropriations measure, on whether it ``contains \n     any targeted tax benefit.'' The bill precludes the House or \n     the Senate from taking issue with the judgment of the Joint \n     Committee's finding. As a practical matter, this empowers a \n     small number of members of Congress to impose their will on \n     the whole body. Although this might have the salutary effect \n     of expediting the passage of the covered legislation, it \n     forces those members of Congress who disagree with the Joint \n     Committee to express their disagreement only by voting down \n     rather than by trying to amend a bill that they otherwise \n     would support.\n       In summary, I believe that the Republican draft conflicts \n     with the plain language, structure, and traditional \n     understanding of the lawmaking procedure set forth in Article \n     I; relevant Supreme Court doctrine; and the delicate balance \n     of power between Congress and the President on budget \n     matters. I am confident that the Supreme Court ultimately \n     would strike the bill down if it were passed by Congress and \n     signed into law by the President.\n       It has been a privilege for me to share my opinions about \n     the Conference Report with you. If you have any other \n     questions or need any further analysis, please do not \n     hesitate to let me know.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                              Michael J.

Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives, Capitol Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Robert J. Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Capitol Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker and Mr. Majority Leader: I understand an \n     agreement has been reached between Republican negoitators on \n     ``line-item veto'' legislation. Although we have not seen a \n     draft of the agreement to determine the extent to which the \n     Judiciary might be affected, I did not want to delay \n     communicating with you. The Judiciary had concerns over some \n     previous versions of the legislation that were considered by \n     the House and Senate. These concerns could also apply to the \n     version on which agreement was just reached, depending on how \n     it is drafted.\n       The Judiciary believes there may be constitutional \n     implications if the President is given independent authority \n     to make line-item vetoes of its appropriations acts. The \n     doctrine of separation of powers recognizes the vital \n     importance of protecting the Judiciary against interference \n     from any President.\n\n[[Page S2976]]\n\n       Protection of the Judiciary by Congress against \n     Presidential power and potential intervention is also evident \n     in the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, which ensures that \n     the financial affairs of the Judiciary be insulated from \n     political influence by the President and his staff. Prior to \n     this Act, the Judiciary's budget was controlled by the \n     Executive Branch. Now, by law, requests for judicial branch \n     appropriations must be submitted to the President by the \n     Judiciary, but must be transmitted by him to Congress \n     ``without change''.\n       This protection needs to endure. Control of the Judiciary's \n     budget rightly belongs to the Congress and not the Executive \n     Branch, particularly in light of the fact that the United \n     States, almost always through the Executive Branch, has more \n     lawsuits in the Federal courts than any other litigant. The \n     integrity and fairness of our Federal Courts should not be \n     endangered by the potential of Executive Branch political \n     influence.\n       In whatever agreement is ultimately reached by the \n     conference committee, on behalf of the Judicial Conference of \n     the United States, I urge that the independence of the Third \n     Branch of Government be preserved.\n       I appreciate your consideration and we stand ready to \n     assist you in any way necessary.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Leonidas Ralph Mecham,\n     Secretary.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        Judicial Conference of the\n\n\n                                                United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 21, 1995.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: On behalf of the Judicial Conference of \n     the United States, I am pleased to respond to your request \n     for the Judiciary's views on an amendment to the Dole \n     substitute to S. 4. The amendment would require all \n     appropriations of the Judiciary to be enrolled in one bill.\n       The Judiciary believes the amendment is critical to ensure \n     the independence of the third branch. Without the amendment, \n     each appropriated line item within the Judiciary would be a \n     separate bill. The Executive Branch would then have the power \n     to pick and choose which activities of the Judiciary it did \n     and did not want funded. Such power over individual items \n     raises the possibility that the Executive could seek to \n     influence the outcome of litigation by selective vetoes or \n     could try to retaliate for unwelcome decisions. The Executive \n     is the major litigator in the federal courts.\n       The doctrine of separation of powers recognizes the extreme \n     importance of protecting the Judiciary against inappropriate \n     Executive Branch interference. This is reflected in the \n     Constitution, which protects the tenure and salaries of \n     Article III judges. It is also evident in the Budget and \n     Accounting Act of 1921, which ensures that the financial \n     affairs of the Judiciary be insulated from political \n     influence by the President and his staff. Prior to this Act, \n     the Judiciary's budget was controlled by the Executive \n     Branch. Now, by law, requests for Judicial Branch \n     appropriations must be submitted to the President and \n     transmitted by him to Congress ``without change''. This \n     protection needs to endure. Control of the Judiciary's budget \n     rightly belongs to the Congress and not the Executive Branch. \n     The Judicial Branch budget has never been the source of \n     claims of ``pork barrel'' appropriations in Congress.\n       I appreciate having the opportunity to comment on this \n     legislation and your amendment that will ensure that the \n     integrity and fairness of our Federal Courts are not \n     endangered by the potential of Executive Branch political \n     influence.\n       We do not want our citizens to ever think that they are \n     back in the position of the Colonists in 1776 who separated \n     from England in part because of their perception, as \n     Jefferson stated in the Declaration of Independence, that the \n     Executive ``has obstructed the administration of justice, by \n     refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary \n     powers. He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for \n     the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of \n     their salaries.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Gilbert S. Merritt,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I believe I have two moments. I yield \nthem to whichever Senator wishes to use them. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note that the minority leader is on \nthe floor. I understand a vote is scheduled for 5:45, and we have 15 \nminutes. Is that the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator desire to use his leader time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we do it even though time is set?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We can do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished minority leader be permitted to speak for 10 minutes, \nafter which the 15 minutes that I have follow, and after that we \nproceed to a vote on or in relation to the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would be more than happy to keep my \nremarks to fewer than 5 minutes. So perhaps if it would work, we can \nstill try to keep the time. I know a lot of people are scheduling their \ntime for the vote. I will be happy to limit my remarks to no more than \n5 minutes, and perhaps even less.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes of my 15 minutes \nto the distinguished minority leader so we keep the time as agreed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill. Mr. \nPresident, let me begin by acknowledging the masterful presentation \nmade by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. No one knows this \nissue better than he does. No one has studied constitutional balance of \npower more carefully than has he. He has raised issues today of \nconstitutionality and the balance of power with a clarity of vision and \na depth of knowledge that every Senator ought to carefully consider.\n  His motion certainly would lead to a more thoughtful approach, in my \nview. The Byrd motion is one that should be supported by all Members of \nthe Senate. It instructs the conferees to report a bill similar to S. \n14, a bipartisan bill that was debated very carefully on the Senate \nfloor a little over one year ago. It was sponsored by Senators Domenici \nand Exon and cosponsored by the majority leader, and reported out of \nthe Budget Committee and the Governmental Affairs Committee. It does \nwhat the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee \nhas indicated it would do--maintain the proper relationship between the \nrole of Congress as well as the responsibilities of the President.\n  I believe it has three major advantages, and I want to touch very \nbriefly on each of these advantages.\n  First, this plan provides an equal opportunity for the President to \nexamine tax expenditures as well as appropriations measures. The \nRepublican plan, constituted in the conference report, does not allow \nthe President to review all of the special-interest tax breaks that are \nall too often considered on the Senate floor. It applies only to those \nthat benefit fewer than 100 taxpayers. Frankly, there are not many \nprovisions that apply to 100 or fewer taxpayers. The Joint Tax \nCommittee determines which breaks can be canceled, and I believe that \nin many cases that alone ought to give us pause. Under S. 14, the \nPresident has the opportunity to more broadly apply the powers to \nexamine all expenditures in a more careful way, not only on \nappropriations bills but also with regard to tax expenditures.\n  Second, we protect majority rule, which is a central principle of \ndemocracy. S. 14 requires a congressional majority to approve the cuts \nproposed by the President. Under the conference report, the President \ncan prevail with the support of only one-third of either House of \nCongress. So, clearly, we abrogate the concept of majority rule. We \ncertainly would not permit a minority to hold a majority hostage in \ncases like this.\n  Clearly, S. 14 is constitutional, as the distinguished ranking member \nand former chairman of the Appropriations Committee has so eloquently \ndescribed in many ways this afternoon. He has enlightened us as to the \nproblems with the conference report. The alternative that he presents \navoids these problems by requiring Congress to vote to approve \nPresidential rescissions. Congress should not approve a bill subject to \ncourt challenge, and, clearly, the conference report will be challenged \nin court.\n  So, I believe, Mr. President, the motion of the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia offers the best of both worlds. It gives the \nopportunity for the President to apply additional scrutiny to items in \nlegislation which may be called into question. It gives him the\n\n[[Page S2977]]\n\nopportunity to apply that scrutiny both to tax expenditures as well as \nappropriated spending. It allows us to retain majority rule and \npreserves the balance of power. It avoids constitutional questions that \nwill certainly be raised as soon as this legislation would be enacted, \nand it is effective immediately.\n  We do not have to wait for the end of this year. We do not have to \nassume that we have to wait until the next term of the President to \nallow the power to be utilized. It allows him to do it now. We can look \nbetween now and the end of the year at the ways in which this might be \nutilized. This will allow us more opportunity to examine whether or not \nthis approach is an appropriate way with which to assure additional \nscrutiny of spending and tax breaks in the future.\n\n  So I applaud the work of the Senator from West Virginia and others \nwho have brought us this opportunity. I think it is important. It is \ncritical that we carefully consider the constitutional questions that \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia has raised.\n  I hope our colleagues will support this motion to recommit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with the minority leader on the floor, I \nwonder if it might be in order for me to ask unanimous consent that the \nyeas and nays be ordered on the Domenici motion to table the underlying \namendment. I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes of my time to Senator Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call the attention of the Senate to the \nvery basic provision in this bill. It says in section 1021(a), \n``Notwithstanding the provisions of part A and B, and subject to this \npart, the President may, with respect to any bill or joint resolution \nthat has been signed into law pursuant to article I, section 7, of the \nConstitution of the United States * * *'' take the action under this \nbill.\n  What we in fact under this bill are doing is giving the President the \nauthority, in effect, to impound moneys that we have given him \nauthority to spend. And we have the right to take that notification of \nany cancellation that he sends to us and send him, in effect, another \nbill saying we intend for you to spend those moneys. He may veto that \nsecond bill if he wants. But in the first instance, we are not giving \nthe President any authority to change the law. We are telling him he \ncan cancel funds provided only if the cancellation would reduce the \nFederal budget deficit, not impair essential Government functions, and \nnot harm the national interest.\n  The issue here is whether the Congress has the right to delegate to \nthe President the authority to not spend money. This is not a violation \nof separation of powers or a violation of the presentation clause of \nthe Constitution. We have given the President, under this bill, limited \nauthority to cancel--that is, to not spend--certain moneys Congress \notherwise would have directed the President to spend.\n  I want to make sure people understand the way this works. A bill is \nsent to the President, which the President may sign, reject, or let it \ntake effect without his signature under article I, section 7, of the \nConstitution. If, and only if, the President signs the bill into law, \nthen under this bill the President is given the delegated authority \nfrom Congress not to spend certain portions of the money that he \ncancels according to the provisions of the bill.\n  I have heard the concept of many of the Senators, but I want to make \nsure that we all understand this is no different from giving the \nPresident the discretion not to enforce a particular law under certain \ncircumstances or to decide, when based on specific criteria, to impose \nor to lift an import duty. We have done that. This conference report \nhas no Chadha problems, based on the Supreme Court decision in the \nChadha case. Congress is not going to be given the power to \nlegislatively overturn a Presidential decision with regard to a veto or \nimplementation of a law.\n  We have the power to take action for the second time after the \nPresident uses his authority under this bill to impound or cancel \nmoneys and, in effect, put them into the track where they will reduce \nthe deficit. We can pass a second bill. The President would veto that. \nHe has no authority under this bill to deal with that second proposal. \nIf we pass such a bill and direct the President to spend money he \notherwise thought he should cancel, he has the authority to veto that \nbill, and we have the authority to override his veto; in effect, to \nmandate him to spend the money as we have said to do so on two \noccasions.\n  But I urge Senators not to refer to this as some action to give the \nPresident the authority to change a bill before it becomes law or to \nchange in any way legislation that does not affect dollars. He only has \nthe authority to, in effect, cancel the spending of dollars under \nspecific circumstances that, while the circumstances are clearly \nlimited, the scope of the authority is very broad.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, let me add to my brief comments a \nwhile ago about Presidents who might abuse this power because a lot has \nbeen said about how this might change the balance of power.\n  I remind every Senator that there is nothing in this bill that says \nwe have to appropriate money that the President asks us for. Let me \nrepeat; we do not have to appropriate money that the President asks us \nfor. You see, if a President decides to be totally arbitrary about \nthis, the Congress of the United States does not have to appropriate \nmoney for things the President wants. That is our balance. There can be \nno money spent unless we appropriate it.\n  So, in addition to all of the other things the President needs of a \nCongress and a Senate under the Constitution, those are all our powers \nthat he needs to help him do his job.\n  In addition, he needs dollars to run the Government of which he is \nthe Chief Executive, and we have to appropriate those dollars.\n  I am not worried about the balance of power because, obviously, \nCongress will withhold some of the President's power if this gets into \nan arbitrary match of power, and I believe it is going to be used to \nthe betterment of our country, our people, and the taxpayers.\n  With reference to the motion we are going to vote on, let me be very \nbrief and very forthright. The amendments Senator Byrd has offered and \nthat I am going to move to table shortly will return the line-item veto \nto conference. It took us 6 months to reach a compromise on the line-\nitem veto. To send it back with instructions is to kill it because what \nis purported to be instructed cannot pass the Senate and cannot pass \nthe House.\n  This motion calls us to cast aside the compromise embodied in this \nconference report. It calls on the conferees to adopt an expedited \nrescissions approach instead. Both Houses rejected the expedited \napproach. Last year, during the Senate's consideration of the line-item \nveto, we voted 62 to 38 to table the expedited approach which the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, is asking us to \ninstruct the conference committee to do again--a nullity for sure, for \nnothing will happen, and I believe that is what is intended if these \namendments were adopted.\n  I support the compromise, and it is now time to vote on the \nconference report on the line-item veto. A vote in favor of the motion \nwill be a vote to defeat the line-item veto conference report before \nus. I urge Senators not to do that.\n  So we will all have a chance to make sure we do not send this to \nconference, I yield back the remaining time that I have, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  I move to table the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the motion to recommit the conference report. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.

Mr. President, I thank the managers for the opportunity \nto speak in favor of the conference report to accompany the Line-Item \nVeto Act, S. 4.\n  I would challenge those who argue that the President already has \nsufficient authority to rescind unwanted spending items. The opposite \nis true. The rescission authority vested in the President today barely \nworks at all. In the overwhelming number of cases, Presidential \nrescission orders are ignored by Congress, and the subject funds are \nultimately obligated.\n  In fact, since the rescission authority was established in 1974, \nCongress has only given approval to $23.7 billion of the $74 billion \nPresidential rescission requests. In other words two-thirds of the \nrescission requests died a quiet death.\n  By requiring Congress to affirmatively disapprove rescissions, this \nlegislation would transform the present ``paper tiger'' into a \nfunctional tool for reducing and eliminating: Special interest spending \nitems in appropriations bills; expansions of existing, or establishing \nof new, entitlements; and tax expenditures which benefit narrow groups \nof taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, the debate over this issue has been a long and \ntortured one. In looking back, I found an interesting item which \nillustrates just how long and tortured it has been. I want to direct \nthe Senate's attention to a speech given on the floor of the House by \nCongressman R.P. Flowers from New York in support of the line-item \nveto. The date was December, 1882.\n  In addition to a belief that it would foster economy in Government, \nRepresentative Flowers had another motivation--that of supporting the \nwishes of a constituent who just happened to be President of the United \nStates. That President was Chester A. Arthur, who advanced from Vice \nPresident to President when James A. Garfield was tragically struck \ndown by an assassin's bullet in 1881.\n  In his annual message to the Congress, President Arthur stated:\n\n       I commend to your careful consideration the question \n     whether an amendment of the Federal Constitution . . . would \n     not afford the best remedy for what is often a grave \n     embarrassment both to Members of Congress and to the \n     Executive, and is sometimes a serious public mischief.\n\n  The ``embarrassment'' and ``public mischief'' to which the 21st \nPresident was referring was the same problem then that it is today: The \ntactic we in Congress employ of burying narrow spending provisions--\nwhich cannot on their own merits survive the legislative process--in \nmassive must-pass appropriation bills.\n  Congressman Flowers delivered his speech 114 years ago. While the \nproposal before us today is far less ambitious than the constitutional \namendment requested by President Arthur, the arguments have been \nthoroughly vetted.\n  Representative Flowers summarized the arguments against the line-item \nveto as: First ``. . . an indignant howl about our rights an \ninterests'' [in the Legislative Branch]; and second, ``. . . those who \nfeign mistrust of the Executive, who fear too much `one-man power.' ''\n  Wisely, the bill before the Senate today includes a sunset provision. \nIf it turns out that this authority is abused by the Chief Executive--\nwhich I do not fear--then Congress can let the authority die.\n  The point is, we have been debating this issue for at least 114 \nyears, and the arguments pro and con have been debated ad nauseam. \nPassage of this legislation will not solve our deficit problems. \nHowever, it will give the American people one more tool--one more check \nagainst unnecessary spending. Frankly, in my view, we need all the help \nwe can get in that regard. So, I say: Let us pass this conference \nreport and get on to other business.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Line-Item Veto Act is a good bill, but \none that should not be necessary. Congress should always have the good \nsense to spend taxpayers' hard-earned money wisely, for the benefit of \nall citizens.\n  Mr. President, British historian Alexander Tytler once said:\n\n       A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. \n     It can only exist until the voters discover that they can \n     vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that \n     moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates \n     promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the \n     result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal \n     policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of \n     the world's greatest civilization has been 200 years.\n\n  Alexander Tytler makes an excellent point, but perhaps the American \npeople have wisdom and foresight that he could not understand. The \nAmerican people recognize the burden that a spendthrift government can \nimpose on them, their children, and their grandchildren. And that is \nwhy they have been so adamant about demanding change. Demanding less \nGovernment spending, lower taxes, and a leaner Government--before \nTytler's prophecy comes to pass.\n  The American people began to change the face of Congress in the last \nelection. And of course, electing fiscally responsible individuals to \nthe Congress is probably the most powerful and effective weapon that \nthe American people can wield in the fight against pork-barrel \nspending. It is more effective than a line-item veto can ever be.\n  The line-item veto itself is not a cure-all. It will not result in a \nbalanced budget. There is not enough pork that can be deleted from the \nbudget to accomplish that. But, if properly exercised by the President, \nit can make it easier to get to balance.\n  Make no mistake about it, this bill will shift a great deal of new \npower to the President. I do not relish that prospect because the \npotential for abuse by the President is great. He can use the veto \npower to reward or punish Members of Congress, depending upon whether \nthey support or oppose other policies of his administration.\n  Most Presidents, however, will be responsible about how they use this \nawesome new power. That is because all eyes of the American people will \nbe on the President if he abuses it, or if he fails to properly delete \nwasteful spending from appropriations bills. By signing this bill into \nlaw, President Clinton will be accepting significant new \nresponsibilities from the American people to safeguard their hard-\nearned tax dollars. I have no doubt that they will hold him accountable \nif he fails to use the new power wisely.\n  Mr. President, just a few weeks ago, the nonpartisan taxpayers' \norganization, Citizens Against Government Waste, released the 1996 \nCongressional Pig Book Summary. The good news is that the organization \ncertified that, in 1995, Congress produced the first pork-free \nappropriation bill ever--the legislative branch appropriations bill.\n  Unfortunately, however, not all of the news was good, and that is one \nreason why the line-item veto is still necessary. Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste found a total of $12.5 billion in pork-barrel spending \nin eight other fiscal year 1996 appropriations bills that have been \nsigned into law. Among the projects that the group identified were rice \nmodeling at the Universities of Arkansas and Missouri; shrimp \naquaculture; brown tree snake research; the International Fund for \nIreland; and the Iowa communications network, to name a few.\n  These are the kinds of projects that are likely to be the target of a \nline-item veto, projects that are typically\n\n[[Page S2979]]\n\nhidden away in annual spending bills. They're enough to demonstrate the \nability of certain legislators to ``bring home the bacon'' and curry \nfavor with special interest groups back home. But, they don't amount to \nenough to cause Congress to reject an entire bill or prompt the \nPresident to veto a bill and bring large parts of the Government to a \nstandstill.\n  The line-item veto is designed to bring accountability to the budget \nprocess. Instead of forcing the President to accept wasteful and \nunnecessary spending in order to protect important programs, it puts \nthe onus on special interests and their congressional patrons to prove \ntheir case in the public arena. It subjects projects with narrow \nspecial interests to a more stringent standard than programs of \nnational interest. The special interests would have to win a two-thirds \nmajority in each House. Programs of national interest would merely \nrequire a simple majority.\n  That is the shift in the balance of power which the line-item veto \nrepresents. It is a shift in favor of the taxpayers, and that is why I \nintend to support it. If the Government were running a surplus, the \ntaxpayers might be willing to tolerate some extra projects. But the \nGovernment is running annual deficits that are far too high, and there \nis no extra money to go around. There is not even enough to fund more \nbasic needs.\n  Mr. President, when you find yourself in a hole, the first rule of \nthumb is to stop digging. Let us begin climbing out of the hole we have \ndug for ourselves and future generations. Let us pass the line-item \nveto.\n\n\n                     emergency spending provisions\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arizona yield for \na question?\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona noted in his opening \nstatement on this measure that the emergency spending reforms he and I \nwere able to include in the Senate-passed version were dropped in the \nconference committee version of this line-item veto measure.\n  Our provision limited emergency spending bills solely to emergencies \nby establishing a new point of order against nonemergency matters, \nother than rescissions of budget authority or reductions in direct \nspending, in any bill that contains an emergency measure, or an \namendment to an emergency measure, or a conference report that contains \nan emergency measure.\n  The provision also featured an additional enforcement mechanism to \nadd further protection by prohibiting the Office of Management and \nBudget from adjusting the caps on discretionary spending, or from \nadjusting the sequester process for direct spending and receipts \nmeasures, for any emergency appropriations bill if the bill includes \nextraneous items other than rescissions of budget authority or \nreductions in direct spending.\n  I know he shares my disappointment that those provisions were \ndropped.\n  Is it his understanding that though the emergency spending provisions \nwere dropped from the final conference version of the line-item veto \nmeasure, we have been given assurances that the Budget Committee staff \nwill work with our own staffs to bring this matter back on an \nappropriate legislative vehicle?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, that is my understanding, and I look \nforward to working with the Senator from Wisconsin and the Budget \nCommittee staff to address any technical concerns there might be with \nthe emergency spending provisions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank my friend from Arizona.\n  As we consider ways to empower the President to veto unjustified \nspending through this new authority, it only makes sense to enact \nreforms that prevent those abuses from passing in the first place.\n  The emergency spending reforms that Senator McCain and I introduced \nas legislation, and included in S. 4 as it passed the Senate, did just \nthat.\n  Our emergency spending legislation previously passed the House by an \noverwhelming vote and I am hopeful that we will soon be able to \novercome the resistance to this provision and have it enacted into law \nas well.\n  And though I regret our reforms were not included in this proposal, I \nlook forward to working with the Budget Committee and my good friend \nfrom Arizona to iron out any drafting problems, and find an appropriate \nvehicle for this needed reform.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the line-\nitem veto. No single legislative procedure will do more to curb \nwasteful Government spending than this powerful legislative tool. For \nyears, Washington has talked about this idea without acting. I am proud \nto be a Member of the Congress that will make the line-item veto a \nreality.\n  For years, the Federal Government has demonstrated an appalling lack \nof fiscal responsibility. Today, our national debt is over $5 \ntrillion--more than $19,000 for every man, woman, and child in \nAmerica--and is growing at a rate of $600 million a day. Entitlement \nspending--the two-thirds of the Federal budget on automatic pilot--is \ngrowing so fast that it will consume all of our tax dollars in just \nover a decade. Meanwhile, the other third of our budget, discretionary \nspending, is riddled with unnecessary pork-barrel projects. Basically, \nit is too easy to spend and too hard to save here in Washington. We owe \nit to the American taxpayer to impose fiscal discipline on Federal \nspending habits.\n  The line-item veto reforms our institutional and procedural tendency \nto overspend. Here's how it works. The President already can veto \nspending bills passed by Congress. S. 4 gives the President the \nauthority to veto specific spending items--including appropriations, \nnew entitlements, and limited tax benefits. The President's \ncancellations will stand unless Congress passes a bill restoring the \nspending and providing the two-thirds support necessary to override any \nadditional vetoes.\n  Some people argue that S. 4 shifts too much power from Congress to \nthe President. However, I believe the President needs a tool to help \ncontrol Congress' insatiable appetite for spending the taxpayers' \nmoney. We must give our Chief Executive the power to strike discreet \nbudget items which do not serve the national interest. In fact, I am so \nconvinced that the line-item veto is the right thing to do that I am \nwilling to give this power to a President of another political party.\n  While the line-item veto alone cannot balance our budget or pay off \nour national debt this one legislative tool could perform radical \nsurgery on wasteful federal spending In 1992, the General Accounting \nOffice [GAO] estimated that a line-item veto could have saved $70 \nbillion in wasteful spending during the last half of the 1980's. That \n$70 billion could provide a $250 tax credit for families with children \nfor 7 years. Taxpayer watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste \nidentified an additional $43 billion in procedural pork spending in the \nlast 5 years, spending which circumvented normal budget procedures. \nImagine how a line-item veto could have saved a significant portion of \nthat money.\n  But we don't need the GAO or a taxpayer watchdog to tell us that the \nline-item veto works. We only need to ask the 43 of our Nation's \nGovernors who use this tool on a regular basis. In fact, when President \nClinton was Governor or Arkansas, he used the line-item veto 11 times. \nIf the States can control spending and balance their budgets, the \nFederal Government should follow their example.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the day when I can tell my three \nsons, my fellow Tennesseans, and every American that they have \ninherited a country free of debt. I look forward to the better job \nopportunities and higher the standards of living they they will enjoy. \nAnd at that moment, I hope I can look back at the day we passed the \nline-item veto as the day a bipartisan group of legislators took a \nsignificant step down the road to fiscal accountability. I strongly \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n\n        the line-item veto: still an ill-considered proposition\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, when the line-item veto was last before us, \nI said that I found myself in opposition both on philosophical as well \nas practical grounds.\n  I must be quick to acknowledge that my reservations on practical \ngrounds have been met. The conferees deserve credit for replacing the \ncumbersome and unworkable scheme of separate enrollment in the Senate \nversion of the\n\n[[Page S2980]]\n\nlegislation, with at least a workable plan for enhanced rescission \nauthority.\n  But my underlying philosophical reservation remains. As I said when \nthe bill was last before us, I simply believe that Congress should be \nextremely chary in yielding its power of the purse to the executive \nbranch. I hold this view on the basis of my Senate service under eight \nPresidents of both parties during my 35 years in the Senate, and \nnotwithstanding the cordial relationships I have had with all of them.\n  I continue to believe that the executive branch, which under our \nConstitution, quite properly is a separate power center with its own \nagenda and its own priorities, inevitably will seek and use any \nadditional power to achieve its objectives. And the pending grant of \nveto power over specific items, I fear, will surely give even the most \nbenign and well-motivated Chief Executive a new means for exercising \nundue influence and coercion over individual members of the legislative \nbranch.\n  I hold this view, notwithstanding my loyalty and respect for \nPresident Clinton, who I know would use such a grant of authority \nwisely. But it is the balance of institutional forces that must be \nconsidered, and it is in this connection that we have been well served \nby the erudition of the senior Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], \nwho has reminded us so eloquently of the need to protect the \nlegislative prerogatives. I agree with him and I commend him for his \ngreat service to the cause of constitutional government.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have a number of serious concerns and \nquestions about the conference report on the line-item veto, S. 4.\n  First, the line-item veto encourages minority rule by allowing a \nPresidential-item veto to stand with the support of only 34 Senators or \n146 Representatives. This is not majority rule. We are back to anti-\ndemocratic super-majority requirements, which I thought were dismissed \nduring the balanced budget amendment debate.\n  By imposing a two-thirds supermajority vote to override a \nPresidential-item veto, the line-item veto undermines the fundamental \nprinciple of majority rule. Our Founders rejected such supermajority \nvoting requirements on matters within Congress' purview.\n  Alexander Hamilton described supermajority requirements as a poison \nthat serves to destroy the energy of the government, and to substitute \nthe pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or \ncorrupt junto to the regular deliberations and decisions of a \nrespectable majority.\n  Such supermajority requirements reflect a basic distrust not just of \nCongress, but of the electorate itself. I reject that notion.\n  Moreover, supermajority requirements in any line-item veto bill is \noverkill. I am afraid that this bill will sacrifice many worthy \nprojects on the altar of supermajority votes.\n  But supermajority power is not needed to strike wasteful line items.\n  The purpose of any line-item veto bill is to give the President the \npower to expose wasteful line items to the sunlight of a congressional \nvote.\n  A majority vote is enough to kill any wasteful line item while still \nallowing Members to convince their colleagues to vote for a worthy line \nitem.\n  In addition, these supermajority requirements hurt small States, like \nmy home State of Vermont, by upping the ante to take on the President.\n  Under the line-item veto, Members from small States would have to \nconvince two-thirds of Members in each House to override the \nPresident's veto for the sake of a project in another Member's \ndistrict.\n  With Vermont having only one representative in the House, why would \nother members risk the President's wrath to help us with a project \nvetoed by the President?\n  Another question mark under this conference report is tax breaks.\n  Under the bill, the President has authority to veto only limited tax \nbenefits, which are defined as providing a Federal tax deduction, \ncredit or concession to 100 or fewer beneficiaries.\n  Any accountant or lawyer worth his or her high-priced fee will be \nable to find more than 100 clients who can benefit from a tax loophole. \nIf more than 100 taxpayers can figure out a way to shelter their income \nin a tax loophole, the President would not be able to touch it. The \nbigger the loophole in terms of the number of people who can take \nadvantage of it, the safer it is.\n  The definition of limited tax benefit sounds like a tax loophole in \nitself.\n  Would the President have line-item veto authority over the capital \ngains tax cut described in the House Republican Contract With America?\n  It certainly is estimated to lose revenue--the bipartisan Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has estimated that the contract's capital gains \ntax cut would lose almost $32 billion from 1995 to 2000.\n  Yet somehow I think a capital gains tax cut would fall beyond the \nscope of being a limited tax benefit under this legislation.\n  Why do we not quit this shell game. Just state in plain language that \nthe President has line-item authority over all tax expenditures.\n  I believe we should tread carefully when expanding the fiscal powers \nof the Presidency. The line-item veto will change one of the \nfundamental checks and balances that form the separation of powers \nunder the Constitution--the power of the purse.\n  The line-item veto hands over the spending purse strings to the \nPresident, whose cuts would automatically become effective unless two-\nthirds of both Houses of Congress override the veto.\n  The President would have no burden of persuasion while a Member would \nhave the Herculean task of convincing two-thirds of his or her \ncolleagues in both Houses to care about the vetoed project.\n  It is truly a task for Hercules to override a veto. Just look at the \nrecord--of the more than 2,500 Presidential vetoes in our history, \nCongress has been able to override only 105.\n  As noted so well in The Federalist Papers: ``the accumulation of all \npowers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, \nwhether of one, a few or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, \nor elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.''\n  Let us not try to score cheap political points at the expense of over \n200 years of constitutional separation of powers.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the proposed Line-\nItem Veto Act. The conference report does more to upset the balance of \npowers than any legislation this body has considered this year. This is \nnot about curbing expenditures. It is body abrogating constitutional \nresponsibility. It is about ceding unbridled spending authority to one \nindividual in one branch of the Government. It should not be called the \nLine-Item Veto Act. Rather, it should be called the Presidential \nSpending Empowerment Act. It grants unprecedented amounts of spending \npower to one individual. Proponents attack discretionary spending as \nthough this were the reason for our deficit. They know better. \nDiscretionary spending becomes a smaller part of the Federal budget \nevery year. The days of pork-barrel spending have long since passed. \nThis concept is replaced by yielding the President authority to punish \nhis enemies.\n  This is an invitation to unfettered politicization of the Federal \nspending process. It is exactly this kind of undue influence that the \nfounders sought to avoid through separation of powers doctrine. It does \nnot take the imagination of Machiavelli to see how this power could be \nused for nefarious purposes. This is particularly true in an election \nyear. Look at the possible scenarios that could be in store. This would \ngive a future incumbent President quite a political weapon. Perhaps it \ncould be used to entice the endorsement of Members from key primary \nStates. A President could agree to not cancel an item of new direct \nspending on the condition that a member endorse his candidacy. \nConversely, he could punish a Member for deciding not to support him. \nEven in a nonelection year, this unfettered power could be unleashed \nfor the rawest of political purposes. Why? Because this legislation \ncreates an implied threat against all Members of Congress. This implied \nthreat is vested in one politician. It can be exercised on any piece of \nlegislation this body considers.\n  The significance of the conference report is not what is said, it is \nwhat is not said. It attempts to remove politics from the process. \nUnfortunately, it will have the exact opposite effect that its\n\n[[Page S2981]]\n\nsupporters intend. It injects the rawest form of power politics into \nthe Federal spending process.\n\n  The conference report creates enormous political arsenal and endows \nit in one individual. Its proponents say it will act as a shield \nagainst unnecessary spending. But it's really an axe that can bludgeon \nany legislator who dares to disagree with a President. This is not just \nabout concentrating unprecedented amounts of power in one individual in \none branch of government. It is about giving that individual a lethal \npolitical weapon. We are giving that individual license to use this \nweapon in whichever manner he sees fit.\n  Proponents of the conference report say this measure can be used as a \nsurgical scalpel. I believe it more closely resembles a hovering \nguillotine. It is not just congressional spending authority that will \nbe infringed. Our third branch of government, the judiciary, will have \nits independence placed in jeopardy.\n  I would encourage all Members to read an excellent piece on this \nissue in today's New York Times. It sets out some interesting arguments \nas to why the legislation is opposed by the judiciary. Many legal \nscholars are beginning to make their opposition known. Indeed, the \nJudicial Conference of the United States has spoken out against this \nmeasure. It said such authority posed a threat to the independence of \nthe judiciary because a President could put pressure on the courts or \nretaliate against judges be vetoing items in judicial appropriations \nbills.\n  Judge Gilbert Merritt, chief judge of the Court of Appeals for the \nSixth Circuit opposed this measure. Judge Merritt said it was unwise to \ngive the President authority over the judicial budget because the \nexecutive branch was the biggest litigant in Federal court. I believe \nJudge Merritt is correct. The potential for conflict is obvious. All of \nus, at some point or another, have likely found ourselves in profound \ndisagreement with a judicial ruling. But we realize there is a process \nin place for disagreeing with clearly wrongheaded decisions. We \nintroduce legislation, hold hearings, and attempt to persuade our \ncolleagues of the proposal's merits. None of us, individually, has the \nability to influence a judicial decision we disagree with.\n\n  The conference report endows in one individual the tools with which \nto immediately demonstrate displeasure. Why don't we simply eliminate \nthe lifetime tenure provisions from article III. Judges have good \nreason to fear this measure. They should be on notice that all future \ndecisions could be subject to political appeal. The Supreme Court may \nultimately have the final say but the President can ensure whether it \nhas the paper on which to say it.\n  This political weapon can be exercised in many different ways. The \nexecutive branch may be litigating one of its policies in Federal \ncourt. This happens all the time in every administration. Consider the \nconflict that could arise if the administration receives an unfavorable \nruling from a particular court. Now, the President could employ the \npower of the bully pulpit or appeal to Congress to handle the matter \nlegislatively. With this new political weapon, he could also excise the \nappropriation for that particular court. This is not meant to cast \naspersions on our future Presidents. It merely reflects the political \nreality that the Framers recognized when they wrote the Constitution.\n  Process for considering item vetoes binds this body to new rules that \nare overly burdensome and unduly restrictive. It will be very \ndisruptive to the consideration of substantive legislative matters. We \ndon't even know how this will play out and we are today being asked to \naccept a 10-hour time agreement. A large number of line-item vetoes may \ndeserve debate. Are we all willing to enter into a 10-hour time \nagreement today? What kind of chaos are we binding ourselves to?\n  There is a great deal of thought and consideration that goes into \nwriting an appropriations bill. Typically, the White House is involved \nthroughout this process. It is not as if the administration reads \nappropriations bills for the first time upon their passage. \nAdministration officials are actively involved in every step of the \nway. Why not really make this easier? Allow the administration to write \nthe measures and schedule up or down votes in both bodies.\n  Presidential veto of targeted tax benefits was a key feature of the \nSenate-passed bill. The conference report attempts to define tax \nbenefits by counting the number of beneficiaries. At best, this is \ndisingenuous. A tax benefit is defined as an income tax deduction, \ncredit exclusion or preference to 100 or fewer people. Why not limit \nthe scope of the veto to appropriations or new direct spending that \nimpacts 100 or fewer beneficiaries? Perhaps this was added in \nconference to gain the support of tax lawyers. Any good tax lawyer will \nbe able to find an extra person or two to meet the sufficient number of \nbeneficiaries.\n\n  I believe that is why this body explicitly rejected the concept of \nnumerical beneficiaries earlier. Different types of taxes are treated \ndifferently. Interestingly, other taxes such as estate and excise taxes \nwould not be subject to a Presidential rescission. The report also \nexcludes tax breaks that target persons owning the same type of \nproperty. Thus a tax benefit to owners of 1997 Rolls Royces would not \nbe subject to a veto since all persons owned the same type of property.\n  Today, less than 7 percent of vetoes are overridden. If this measure \npasses, veto overrides will likely be nonexistent. This Presidential \npolitical weapon will be used against regions, States, or congressional \ndistricts. There, of course, will never be enough vetoes to override. \nThis is a far worse bill than the one which made it out of this Chamber \na year ago. That bill included a provision that allowed 60 Senators to \nprevent an item from being singled out for a veto. The conference \nreport requires two-thirds of both the Senate and the House to override \na veto. Thus, the President needs only 34 percent of one House in order \nto rescind appropriations the majority of Congress had previously voted \nto approve.\n  This is an unprecedented amount of veto power to endow in one \nindividual. This Senator contends it is an unconstitutional delegation \nof legislative power.\n  Many legal scholars claim we have little to fear because this act \nwill be ruled unconstitutional in the courts. I do not believe that is \na chance worth taking. I realize the majority party is under a lot of \npressure to complete its so-called Contract With America. But in its \nzeal for closure is it really willing to pass clearly unconstitutional \nacts? Are we willing to now discount and discard the doctrine of \nseparation of powers? And what are the consequences?\n  Perhaps it was best stated by the Senate's great constitutional \nscholar, Senator Byrd, in an earlier debate: ``History shows that when \nthe Roman Senate gave away its power of the purse, it gave away its \ncheck on the executive.'' As for the line-item veto eliminating \nwasteful spending, Senator Byrd said it is ``analogous to giving \ncyanide for a cold.''\n  Who are we, the benefactors of these great constitutional rights, to \nsit in judgment of our Founding Fathers? If they were so right then, \ncould we be so wrong today?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have long supported an experiment with a \nline-item veto power for the President. Over a decade ago, I introduced \nmy own plan for a line-item veto, with Senator Mattingly. Since then I \nhave cosponsored several similar plans, in particular those offered by \nmy distinguished colleagues Senator Hollings and Senator Bradley.\n  I have held this position for all these years, Mr. President, not \nbecause I believe the line-item veto will solve our deficit problem. No \nsingle procedural change can do that.\n  I support a line-item veto because it will, at the margins, shift the \nincentives now in our system to attach special-interest spending to our \nappropriations bills. To rein in that practice, Mr. President, we must \nexpose it. The line-item veto will give the President a tool, if he \nchooses to use it, to raise the profile of wasteful, special-interest \nspending--to expose it to the light of public scrutiny.\n  The need to track down and remove wasteful spending is not new, Mr. \nPresident, but it has never been more important than now. As we \ncontinue down the road toward a balanced budget, we must reserve every \ndime of taxpayers' money for the most important\n\n[[Page S2982]]\n\npriorities of this country. Now, more than ever, waste in one program \nwill require cuts in more deserving areas.\n  So we must do all we can do to change the incentive to smuggle such \nspending into appropriations bills in the first place, or to give the \nPresident the power to cut it out once it gets there.\n  Mr. President, the version of the line-item veto that I have \nconsistently supported is not the one before us now. Nevertheless, I \nwill vote for this line-item veto plan today, because I believe that it \ncan be a useful check on wasteful spending, at a time when we must \nsubject every dollar we spend to the most careful scrutiny.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to explain the difference \nbetween the version I have consistently supported--the one, I must add, \nthat we passed out of the Senate last year--and the version here before \nus today. I have long held that separate enrollment is the best \napproach, in contrast to the enhanced rescission plan before us now. \nBut what do those fancy titles mean?\n  The separate enrollment approach to the line-item veto is the one \nthat I have supported, and the one that I think most people have in \nmind when they think of a line-item veto. Quite simply, separate \nenrollment requires that the Congress take each item in the spending \nbills we pass and send them to the President separately, instead of \nlumped together as we do it now.\n  We used to send individual spending items to the President \nseparately, back before the Civil War. I believe that the separate \nenrollment approach would restore a relationship between Congress \nand the Executive that was upset by the practice of lumping those items \ntogether. To that extent, it would be less disruptive of the \nconstitutional relationship between the branches of our Government.\n\n  The way we do it now, we send the President every item for national \ndefense, for example, in a single spending bill. If the President \nbelieves that there are too many tanks, or too many trucks, or too many \nmissiles, he must veto the entire national defense bill to cut out the \nspending that he doesn't want.\n  We write bills that way on the bet that the President will accept \nadditional spending as the price of getting our national defense or \nother basic needs paid for.\n  And, we must admit, Mr. President, we write bills that way because it \nserves the needs of individual Members of Congress to have their \nspecial projects--that on their own merits, in the cold light of day, \ncould not muster a majority vote--to have those special projects pulled \nthrough the process by the locomotive of essential legislation.\n  By sending each item of spending to the President as individual \nbills--by separate enrollment of each item--Congress would expose each \nof those items to the scrutiny it deserves, would remove the camouflage \nof the larger spending bills.\n  The modest hope is not that the President will, willy-nilly, cut and \nslash special-interest items.\n  Rather, the expectation of those of us who have promoted this idea is \nthat Members of Congress--confronted by a President with this new \npower--would choose not to include those special interest items that \ncannot pass the threshold of public scrutiny.\n  That is essentially the version that we passed out of the Senate last \nyear, Mr. President, with one important addition. We included special \ninterest tax breaks among the items the President could veto. Those tax \nexpenditures lose money from the Treasury just as surely as any \nspending program.\n  And as for those items vetoed by the President, the normal \nconstitutional procedures would apply--two-thirds majorities of each \nHouse would be required to override the veto, to restore the spending \nthat the President has cut.\n  I have supported that approach as the one that least disturbs the \nconstitutional relationship between the President and Congress, \nparticularly on the crucial issue of the power of the purse.\n  I was heartened when that was the version passed by the Senate last \nyear.\n  By the same token, Mr. President, I am less happy about the version \nbefore us today. But because I am still convinced that we need to \nimprove our capacity to discourage if possible, and to cut out \nif necessary, any wasteful, special-interest spending, I will vote for \nthis version.\n\n  The line-item veto bill before us today provides for a procedure that \nis more correctly known as enhanced rescission. It greatly transforms a \nPresidential procedure that right now has virtually no teeth--the \nrescission.\n  Currently, the President may tell Congress that he doesn't want to \nspend funds for one or more items in a spending bill that he has signed \ninto law. But that will have no effect unless the Congress chooses, on \nits own, to pass a rescissions bill that may or may not include the \nitems specified by the President.\n  If Congress chooses not to act, the President remains obligated to \nspend those funds in the legislation he has signed into law. So right \nnow the rescission power doesn't amount to much, Mr. President, unless \nCongress decides on its own to make it law.\n  The bill here today would change that, would put real teeth in the \nrescission power. It would give the power of the law to a President's \ndecision not to spend money on those items he chooses. That decision \nwould become law unless Congress passed a specific bill to disapprove \nof his action. If Congress did not act, then the President's decision \nto cut those items would stand.\n  If Congress did pass a bill that disapproved of the President's \ncuts, the President could then use his veto power, which would require \na two-thirds majority of each House of Congress to overturn.\n\n  This is a powerful new tool in the hands of the President. That is \nwhy I have always held that we should experiment with the line-item \nveto--that we should set a date certain on which the legislation will \nsunset. This line-item legislation provides for an 8-year experiment, \nafter which it will terminate unless Congress agrees that the \nexperiment has produced more benefits than costs.\n  This is longer than I think is necessary--particularly if we discover \nunintended consequences--but it does provide for two Presidential \nadministrations over which to test the merits of this proposal.\n  I am more disappointed that the President's ability to cut special \ninterest tax breaks has been severely weakened in conference with the \nHouse. The remaining provision would apply to only a few tax items--in \nfact, with clever tax lawyers on the job, it could well apply to \nvirtually no tax breaks.\n  So, Mr. President, like so much legislation we consider and that \nbecomes law, this line-item veto bill advances a worthy cause--cutting \nout waste and special-interest spending--but not in the ways that all \nof us may agree with. As someone who has for years advocated the \nseparate enrollment method of line-item veto, I wish we had chosen that \nroute.\n  But there is a more fundamental question--Will we give the President \na power that will expose congressional spending to a higher level of \nscrutiny? Will we take an additional step to prevent the inclusion of \nspecial-interest spending in our appropriations bills? I am willing to \ntake that step, Mr. President, and will vote for the conference report.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the line-item \nveto bill before the Senate today, and urge my colleagues to pass this \noverdue measure. As a long-time opponent of pork-barrel spending, I am \nglad we are taking this first small step toward fiscal sanity.\n  When I attend a town meeting, or hold a briefing on the Federal \nbudget, I often hear a common sentiment: ``Why does Congress want to \nchange Medicare, or education, or whatever, when we are spending $5 \nmillion on Hawaiian arts and crafts?'' It is a question that cannot be \nanswered. Pork-barrel spending may constitute a relatively small \nportion of the overall budget, but it represents a very symbolic part \nof the budget. If Congress cannot cut the little spending items, how on \nEarth can we make the difficult decisions on the larger programs?\n  Will the line-item veto balance the Federal budget? Of course not. \nBut it will help restore discipline to our budget process. It is no \nsecret that special projects and narrow interest provisions are often \nincluded in large spending\n\n[[Page S2983]]\n\nbills. We often see $1 or $2 million projects tucked away in \nmultibillion budget measures. A Senator or Congressman will issue a \npress release about the wonderful project, and then feel compelled to \nvote for the overall bill. Slowly, but surely, the spending bills begin \nto add up and the problem becomes worse. The pork-barrel spending is \nthe grease that allows the budget process to move forward. And that \nbudget process has led this Nation to a $5 trillion national debt.\n  The line-item veto bill will give the President--who has a national \nconstituency with a national interest--the tool he needs to cut \nprojects that serve a narrow constituency with a special interest. The \nlegislation before the Senate today allows the President to veto \nappropriations, targeted tax provisions, and new entitlement spending. \nAny of these provisions, if passed separately, are now subject to a \nPresidential veto and a two-thirds override requirement. The line-item \nveto bill is a natural and simple extension of that constitutional \npower. Projects worthy of scarce Federal tax dollars should stand or \nfall on their own merit, not on the merit of a larger unrelated bill.\n  Mr. President, I have supported and cosponsored line-item veto \nlegislation for more than a decade. It has been a long and arduous \nfight. I, for one, am glad that the fight is finally over. I commend my \ncolleagues--Senator McCain and Senator Coats--for their hard work on \nbehalf of this landmark legislation. This line-item veto bill before \nthe Senate today will certainly stand the test of time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am a proponent of responsibly \nreducing the deficit, as are many of my colleagues. I, too, want to \neliminate wasteful spending. But this conference report on the line-\nitem veto bill is not the right way to ensure deficit reduction or \nresponsible fiscal management in my view.\n  As articulated so poignantly by my colleague from West Virginia, \nSenator Byrd, the line-item veto legislation raises many constitutional \nproblems and it substantially alters the balance of power devised by \nthe Framers of our Constitution.\n  Before supporting such a dramatic change in the balance of powers, we \nneed to examine it in light of what it really offers our country.\n  Giving a President broad power to cut discretionary spending concerns \nme in theory, but it troubles me even more to think about its potential \neffects in practice. A President may hastily veto substantive \nprovisions of a spending bill, which he considers wasteful, but which \nreally are essential programs for States or regions. One person's \nperception of waste or pork may be another person's funding for roads, \nschools, needed housing, or rural hospitals. Or a President could even \nwield a line-item veto as a political tool to intimidate a particular \nMember or groups of Members.\n  A specific example is the recent history of funding for the \nAppalachian Regional Commission [ARC]. Recent Republican Presidents \nsought to eliminate the Appalachian Regional Commission [ARC] from the \nbudget, but a bipartisan group within Congress maintained this \nimportant program to promote economic development in some of the \npoorest counties of our country. The ARC provides basic funding for \ninfrastructure and economic development.\n  In representing West Virginia's interest, I do not believe that \nCongress should give any President free range to cut discretionary \nspending. Under the line-item veto, a President could veto spending for \nthe ARC, or other discretionary programs ranging from highway projects \nto housing programs.\n  It is important to note that the present system already offers a way \nfor the President to express his dissatisfaction with provisions in \nspending bills, known as the rescission process. Although this process \nmight need to be streamlined and simplified, the President already has \nthe ability to call for the rejection of specific programs within \nspending bills. Through the rescission process, the President can call \non Congress to make more immediate cuts in areas which he thinks are \nwasting taxpayers' money. The President can single out items in \nspending bills that he opposes, and if Congress approves the budget \ncuts are made immediately.\n  I agree that Congress needs to chart a careful course for deficit \nreduction and economic growth, and I continue to vote for cuts in \nspecific programs where I believe Congress has wasted taxpayer money. I \ndo not, however, want to risk the careless elimination of critical \nprograms which benefit West Virginia and other States. And I do not \nwant to irrevocably alter the balance of power between Congress and the \nexecutive branch which was enshrined in our constitution over 200 years \nago. I think Congress has duty to be excruciatingly careful when \nfundamental rewriting of our Constitution is being considered. This \nconference report has not been given proper consideration and I \ndisagree with its intent on principle. I oppose passage of this \nconference report.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am proud to have this long awaited and \nunique opportunity to address the Chair about a successful conference \nreport on a line-item veto.\n  Some of us have spent much of our congressional careers fighting \nagainst wasteful spending. Under present law, the Chief Executive often \ncannot join in the battle against waste without the risk of destroying \nthe good along with the extravagant. This line-item veto conference \nreport succeeds in allowing a responsible Chief Executive to join our \nteam of responsible legislators. Indeed, the line-item veto will allow \na responsible President to join us in weeding the peoples' legislative \ngarden.\n  With this line-item veto, a responsible President can attack and \ncancel out entire dollar amounts in appropriation bills. He may not \nmerely reduce a dollar amount; He may only cancel it entirely. With \nthis line-item veto, a responsible President will attack and cancel out \nlatent direct-spending provisions that would increase future spending. \nThus, we will help prevent future deficit increases before they even \nbegin; first, by eliminating a wasteful provision, and second, by \ndedicating any savings from operation of the line-item veto to a \nspecial lockbox for deficit reduction.\n  In the area of tax expenditures, a responsible President can attack \ncertain flagged and frivolous tax legislation. This line-item veto will \ninstruct the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation to identify and \nflag any limited tax benefits that may exist in future conference \nreports of future tax bills. This conference report on the line-item \nveto defines limited tax benefits as any tax expenditures that would \nboth, lose revenue either in the first year or over the first 5 years, \nand benefit 100 or fewer persons Then, Congress would add a list of \nthese limited tax benefits to the conference report as a matter of law.\n  If the Joint Committee on Taxation looks, but does not see, any \nlimited tax benefits, then it may issue a clean bill of health upon the \nrelated tax legislation. If the Joint Committee on Taxation does not \nlook for any limited tax benefits, then the Chief Executive may himself \nlook for the limited tax benefits. He would use our same objective \nmeasure outlined in the conference report.\n  Having found waste, a responsible President may effectively take out \nhis ruler and draw a line through any offending legislation. After \noperating a line-item veto, the President would send a special message \nback to Capitol Hill outlining his actions. Both Houses of Congress \nwould refer the vetoed line items to the appropriate committees.\n  The operative Senate committees may then report out a disapproval \nbill containing the vetoed line items. The Senate would listen to only \n10 hours of debate and amendments before voting on a disapproval bill. \nThereafter, the President may again see the same legislation because \nthe process would simply start over. The President would then have the \nExecutive powers offered by this line-item veto conference report and \narticle I, section 7 of the Constitution.\n  Like the Constitution, this line-item veto conference report has many \nproud cosigners. I want to thank the chairmen and ranking members of \nthe Committees on Governmental Affairs and the Budget. I also want to \nthank Senators McCain and Coats for their efforts and commitment. \nEspecially for his attention to the line-item veto as it may affect \nfuture tax legislation. I want to thank Senator Roth, the able chairman \nof the Committee on Finance. Finally, I want to thank all those with \nwhom I have always joined\n\n[[Page S2984]]\n\nin our tireless efforts to stamp out the Government waste of taxpayer \ncapital.\n  This is a great day indeed. I urge all of my colleagues to join in \nsupport of this conference report on the line-item veto.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I take the floor to oppose the so-called \nline-item veto legislation before us today. I regret I cannot support \nthis conference report, but unfortunately this report is careless, \nhighly questionable and possibly unconstitutional. Mr. President, I \nsupport the line-item veto proposal submitted by Senator Byrd. His \nexpedited rescission proposal was well-written and made good common \nsense, but unfortunately, it was not accepted by the Senate.\n  I know all too well the abuse that can arise through broad, sweeping \nline-item veto authority. Mr. President, I served in the Washington \nState Senate prior to coming to the U.S. Senate. My home State arms its \nexecutive with line-item veto authority, and while serving in the State \nlegislature I witnessed, first hand, the horse trading that results by \ngiving the State's executive this authority.\n  In my home State, the line-item veto does not deter spending. Rather, \nit encourages more spending. It puts legislators in the position of \nhaving to accept the Governor's priorities in order to make sure their \nlegislative priorities are not vetoed by the Governor.\n  As you know, Mr. President, this debate essentially was spawned out \nof our desire to reduce Government waste and balance our Nation's \nbudget deficit. I do not think there is a single Member in this body \nthat does not want to reduce the Nation's budget deficit. However, I \nhave great difficulty turning over my responsibility and Congress' \nfiscal responsibilities to the executive branch. Mr. President, the \nline-item veto is a budget gimmick, and it simply passes the power of \nthe purse from Congress to the President.\n  Since 1993, we have cut the Nation's budget deficit in half. This is \ncommendable work. However, it was difficult work that required tough \ndecisions. Congress and the Clinton administration chose to reduce and \ncut hundreds of Federal programs. This was not easy, but it is what we \nwere elected to do. We will get our fiscal house in order once we set \nour minds to it. We do not need a line-item veto. We need courage. We \nshould not shrink from our constitutional responsibilities. We should \naccept the challenge.\n  Mr. President, earlier today I listened to the elegant words of \nSenator Byrd. Senator Byrd is a great orator, respected legislator and \nan excellent teacher--especially when it comes to the constitutional \nissues surrounding the line-item veto. I hope my colleagues listened to \nhis words, because there are some real constitutional issues that need \nto be addressed because of this legislation.\n  This legislation disrupts the delicate balance of powers laid out by \nour Founding Fathers. It shifts an enormous amount of power to the \nPresident of the United States--directly conflicting with Congress' \nconstitutional duties. And, as written, this legislation gives the \nPresident and a one-third minority in one House the power to veto \nlegislation a majority of Congress approved. It turns the idea of \nchecks and balances on its head.\n  Mr. President, I also have grave concerns with the language \npertaining to targeted tax benefits. This language is cleverly written \nin a way that ultimately prohibits the President from vetoing new \ntargeted tax benefits. If we want to grant the President a line-item \nveto, let us at least do it the right way. Let us at least let the \nPresident strike new tax expenditures.\n  Moreover, I urge all my colleagues from small States to read this \nlegislation carefully, because as it is written, the President has the \npower to strike very specific language including charts and graphs. For \ninstance, the President would have the power to strike funding for a \nsingle State if an appropriations bill or report includes a chart \nbreaking out spending per State. We know the President is not going to \nstrike funding from electoral-vote rich States. But, what keeps the \nPresident from cutting funds in smaller States?\n  Mr. President, this again reminds me of the horse trading I \nexperienced in my home State legislature. This legislation puts \nlegislators in the awkward position of having to protect \ncongressionally approved legislation from the President's veto pen--\nlegislation that was debated, considered and eventually agreed to by \nCongress--agreed to the way our Founding Fathers envisioned the process \nwould work, and the way our constituents expect us to govern.\n  In no way did our Founding Fathers expect the President to unravel \nlegislation that was crafted through compromise by both the majority \nand the minority.\n  Mr. President, there is a right way to craft this legislation. It \nshould be written clearly and carefully--without ambiguity. We should \ncraft legislation that doesn't exempt specific tax breaks, one that \ndoesn't allow a President to attack entitlements, and one that doesn't \nhold small States hostage.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this \nlegislation. The line-item veto is not the solution to our deficit \nproblems. We know what needs to be done to reduce the deficit, and we \nhave done it here on this floor over the past 3 years. We know the \nline-item veto is not the tool needed to accomplish that goal, but \nrather, just a feel-good gimmick that puts off the tough decisions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this issue is not simple, nor is it \neasy.\n  If it were, there would be a larger consensus on how we should \nproceed in this area, if at all.\n  I supported the version of S. 4 that passed this body--the so-called \nseparate enrollment approach. Though that legislation was flawed, I was \nwilling to support that experimental line-item veto authority to \nprovide the President with some additional authority to eliminate \ninappropriate spending.\n  I do not believe the line-item veto is the whole answer to our \ndeficit problem, or even most of the answer, but it certainly can be \npart of the answer.\n  The legislation before us today, too, is flawed, but I am willing to \ngive this new mechanism a chance to work, and to see it tested over the \nnext several years. Like the version of S. 4 that passed the Senate, \nthis measure also has a so-called sunset clause which terminates the \nexpanded veto authority unless Congress takes action.\n  If the Congress decides, which it may well do, that we have gone too \nfar in delegating authority to the President, the sunset clause will \nmake it much easier to terminate the experiment, if necessary. The \nburden will be on those who want to retain the authority.\n  Mr. President, in the end, that sunset clause allowed me to support a \nmeasure with which I am far from satisfied. Without a sunset clause, \nCongress would have to pass a bill to repeal the line-item veto \nauthority. It is likely that any President would veto such a bill, and \nunless two-thirds of the members of both Houses were to override that \nveto, the President would retain this extraordinary new power.\n  Mr. President, though the continuing Federal budget deficits justify \ngranting this temporary authority to the President on a trial basis, I \ndo have serious concerns about this proposal, which I want to \nhighlight, and will continue to monitor. Possibly my biggest concern is \nthe effective threshold of two-thirds vote in each House to overcome \nthis new expanded veto authority. That kind of threshold is provided in \nthe Constitution for entire bills, but extending that authority for \nindividual sections of a bill may be problematic. There are many \nuncertainties in this new authority that we are providing the \nPresident, and no one can anticipate all the potential abuses that \nmight flow from this new authority.\n  Though we have no experience at the Federal level, those Members who \nhave served in State government may have seen the use of line-item veto \nauthority at the State level. Indeed, much of the support for a Federal \nline-item veto stems from the State experience.\n  But, Mr. President, few other States, if any at all, have witnessed \nthe abuses of line-item veto authority that we have seen in Wisconsin. \nThat abuse has been bipartisan--Governors of both parties have used \nWisconsin's partial veto authority in ways it is safe to say no one \nanticipated when that authority was first contemplated. For example, \nMr. President, Wisconsin's current Governor, Governor Thompson, has \nused the veto authority not only to rewrite entire laws, but actually \nto increase spending and increase taxes.\n  The two-thirds threshold compounds the uncertainty about possible \nabuses\n\n[[Page S2985]]\n\nby making it that much more difficult for Congress to respond to that \npossible abuse.\n  Mr. President, another serious flaw in this measure are the \nprovisions relating to tax expenditures. They are far from adequate. \nThe language in the Senate-passed version of S. 4 relating to tax \nexpenditures has been weakened significantly, essentially blunting this \nauthority as a tool for restraining that area of spending that is among \nthe largest and fastest growing, and that includes unjustified \nsubsidies to some of the wealthiest individuals and corporations in the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, tax expenditures contribute greatly to pressure on the \ndeficit, and if any area should be subjected to the scrutiny of line-\nitem veto authority, it is this one. The failure of this proposal to \ntarget abuses in this area is a serious flaw, and I regret the special \ninterests that generated some of these abuses in the first place are \nexempt from this new Presidential authority.\n  Mr. President, I was disappointed, too, that the emergency spending \nreforms the senior Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] and I incorporated \ninto the Senate-passed version were dropped from this measure. That \nprovision limited emergency spending bills solely to emergencies by \nestablishing a new point of order against nonemergency matters, other \nthan rescissions of budget authority or reductions in direct spending, \nin any bill that contains an emergency measure, or an amendment to an \nemergency measure, or a conference report that contains an emergency \nmeasure.\n\n  The provision also featured an additional enforcement mechanism to \nadd further protection by prohibiting the Office of Management and \nBudget from adjusting the caps on discretionary spending, or from \nadjusting the sequester process for direct spending and receipts \nmeasures, for any emergency appropriations bill if the bill includes \nextraneous items other than rescissions of budget authority or \nreductions in direct spending.\n  As we consider ways to empower the President to veto unjustified \nspending through this new authority, it only makes sense to enact \nreforms that prevent those abuses from passing in the first place. The \nemergency spending reforms that Senator McCain and I included in S. 4 \ndid just that, and I regret they were not included in this proposal.\n  I understand, however, that commitments have been made to revisit \nthis provision in separate legislation. The emergency spending \nlegislation previously passed the House by an overwhelming vote and I \nam hopeful that we will soon be able to overcome the resistance to this \nprovision and have it enacted into law as well.\n  Mr. President, the basic structure of this particular line-item veto \nauthority also raises problems. Though it may be less cumbersome than \nthe so-called separate enrollment approach envisioned in S. 4 as it \npassed the Senate, the new enhanced rescission approach could provide \nthe President with more rescission authority than was intended.\n  In particular, the shift from Congress to the President in defining \nthe precise material to be vetoed is potentially significant. Instead \nof vetoing or approving individuals minibills, as under the separate \nenrollment approach, the President decrees certain actions in the \nnature of rescissions--actions which effectively are given statutory \nauthority because they are surmounted only by enactment of a \ndisapproval bill.\n  The scope of these Presidential decrees are limited by the \nrestrictions set forth in this bill, and though the intent of those \nproposing this new authority may be clear enough in their own minds, \nthere cannot be one hundred percent certainty about the true scope of \nthis new authority until it is actually put into effect. The unintended \nor even unimagined consequence of this new authority may be its biggest \nflaw.\n  This is just what happened in my own State. It is difficult to argue \nthat the original sponsors of Wisconsin's partial veto authority ever \nintended that a future governor would be able to veto individual words \nwithin sentences or even individual letters within words, yet that is \nprecisely what happened.\n  Successive court decisions gradually expanded the partial veto \nauthority for Wisconsin's Governors, to the point that whole new laws \ncould be created with the veto pen.\n  Mr. President, could the temporary authority which this measure \ngrants the President be abused in this fashion? Though I do not believe \nit will, we cannot be certain about what some court might rule in \ninterpreting the restrictions spelled out in the bill.\n  In some instances, the proposal before us allows the President to \nexercise his new authority based on committee reports or the statements \nof managers, neither of which have the force of law, and neither of \nwhich have ever been the subject of a vote in either House. That is \ntroubling.\n  I am disturbed, too, by the language in this proposal regarding so-\ncalled items of direct spending. In defining these items, the measure \nrefers to specific provisions of law.\n  Mr. President, this definition is not at all self-evident. Is a \nprovision of law a numbered section, or can it be an unnumbered \nparagraph as well? How small a unit of entitlement authority does the \nproposal intend to expose to the new Presidential authority? For \nexample, if a clause in a sentence defines new entitlement authority in \nsome way, can that clause be canceled without taking the entire \nsentence with it? Or, can new entitlement authority be limited by the \nselective cancellation of one word if doing so meets the other stated \nformal requirements of the measure?\n  The proposal does not address that issue. It only mentions the words \n``specific provision of law'' without further definition.\n  As someone who has seen just how creative a Governor can be with \npartial veto authority, this is a matter of serious concern to me.\n  Mr. President, there are a few safeguards built into this proposal \nthat provide some comfort in this regard. As I noted before, the new \nauthority sunsets in 8 years. We will have what amounts to an 8-year \ntrial period in which we can monitor this new Presidential authority, \nand we will. Eight years represents two complete Presidential terms of \noffice, and several election cycles within both Houses, ensuring a \ndiverse set of partisan combinations under which this new authority can \nbe tested, and enhancing the possibility that it will be used under \ndifferent circumstances and with different ideological intent.\n  Also, it should be noted that this new authority is established by \nstatute, not as part of the Constitution, thus the measure avoids \nmagnifying these potential problems by making a permanent change to our \nbasic law. To the extent that Congress can selectively control this new \nauthority in subsequent statutes, even prior to the expiration of the \nproposal before us, the statutory approach to the line-item veto or \nenhanced rescission authority is much less restrictive than a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Nevertheless, Mr. President, we cannot be certain how this proposed \nauthority will be used, no matter how carefully we draft the \nrestrictions on that authority. Those who support this measure bear a \nspecial responsibility in this regard. And to that end, should this \nmeasure become law, I intend to establish a regular review process to \nmonitor how the new authority is used, how it is misused, how much \ndeficit reduction is produced, and lost opportunities for deficit \nreduction.\n  Though temporary, this delegation of authority is significant, and \nclose and continuing scrutiny is warranted, even necessary.\n  Mr. President, the debate we have had on this issue for over a year \nhas been instructive for me. For some, the passage of a line-item veto \nauthority for the President will only mean they can scratch it off a \nlist, and move on to another issue.\n  But this issue does not end with our vote, it begins.\n  We are about to embark on an important experiment. Whether for the \nbenefit of the country and our democratic institutions remains to be \nseen, but I believe it is an experiment worth performing.\n  I congratulate the senior Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nNebraska [Mr. Exon] for their work on this measure. I thank them \nespecially for their past efforts on behalf of the amendment I offered \nto clean up the emergency appropriations process.\n\n[[Page S2986]]\n\n Though it was not included in the final version of this proposal, I \nvery much appreciated their courtesy, and I look forward to working \nwith them to find another vehicle for that worthy reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, our system of government is based \non a separation of powers and checks and balances. That is the way the \nFounding Fathers structured it, and it is a system that has fostered \nAmerica's greatness for over 200 years. Yet, this bill would \nfundamentally change and unbalance that system by transferring power \nfrom Congress to the President.\n  Some argue that this bill is unconstitutional. In a letter to \nCongress, L. Ralph Mecham, secretary of the Judicial Conference, stated \nthat he fears that this bill will violate the separation of powers. He \nwrites, ``The doctrine of separation of powers recognizes the vital \nimportance of protecting the judiciary against interference from any \nPresident. This protection needs to endure. Control of the judiciary's \nbudget rightly belongs to the Congress and not the executive branch.''\n  Furthermore, an article in today's New York Times stated that the \nline-item authority poses ``a threat to the independence of the \njudiciary because a President could put pressure on the courts or \nretaliate against judges by vetoing items in judicial appropriations \nbills.'' The article stated that Judge Gilbert Merritt, chairman of the \nexecutive committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States, \nstated that ``judges were given life tenure to be a barrier against the \nwinds of temporary public opinion. If we don't have judicial \nindependence, I'm not sure we could maintain free speech and other \nconstitutional liberties that we take for granted.''\n  It is not clear what the Supreme Court will find when this law is \nchallenged. But what is clear to me is that this bill is anti-\nconstitutional. It is counter to the philosophy of the Constitution. \nThe Constitution clearly separated each branch of government, giving \neach specific duties--and did so for a reason.\n  If one reads the Constitution, it is clear that the Framers \ndeliberately placed the power of the purse in the hands of Congress. \nArticle I, section 8 of the Constitution states, ``The Congress shall \nhave Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to \npay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of \nthe United States.''\n  Power over the purse has consistently rested in the hands of the \nRepresentatives and Senators of our country. This power is critical in \nmaintaining our system of checks and balances. The measure before us \ntoday would shift that power away from Congress and put it in the hands \nof the President. It allows the President to unilaterally change a law \nafter it is enacted--to cut off spending Congress has deemed necessary.\n  Moreover, this bill is contrary to its intended purpose: Deficit \nreduction. Some of my colleagues did not support the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution, but I did. I supported it because it \ncovers every dollar of spending and taxing. This bill does not. \nFurthermore, the balanced budget amendment did not upset the balance of \npowers between the branches. This bill does.\n  There is a cliche that to every problem there is a simple wrong \nsolution. Do we have a deficit problem? Yes. Will this bill solve our \nfiscal crisis? No. This bill is the wrong solution to our deficit \nproblems. It is almost solely aimed at discretionary spending, which is \nclearly not one of the major causes of the budget crisis the Federal \nGovernment is facing.\n\n  I served on the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. \nIf we do not act, by the year 2012 entitlement spending will outstrip \nrevenues. So discretionary spending could be cut to zero and still not \nsolve our problems. Domestic discretionary spending has not grown as a \npercentage of the GDP since 1969, the last time we had a balanced \nbudget. Domestic discretionary spending comprises only one-sixth of the \n$1.5 trillion Federal budget, and that percentage is steadily \ndeclining.\n  In practice this bill will have a minimal impact on the deficit. Yet \nthis bill will have a high impact on the level of the public's cynicism \nbecause it will not solve our country's budget crisis. Congress is \nalready having difficulty passing its 12th continuing resolution and \nthe American people already have doubts about Congress' ability to pass \nfunding measures. To reaffirm our commitment to the American people's \npriorities, we should remind ourselves of what we swore to do when we \nentered office: to uphold the Constitution. This line-item scheme \nviolates the philosophy of that document.\n  Spending authority rests primarily with Congress because our Nation's \nFounders thought that that was the best small ``d'' Democratic thing to \ndo. 535 Members of Congress by definition are closer to the people than \nthe President. Members of Congress are elected from all over the \ncountry reflecting their constituents' interests, be they urban or \nrural. Can one executive reflect the needs of our Nation's varied \nconstituencies better than a Member of the House who has to run every 2 \nyears? The President, as stipulated in the Constitution can only face \nthe people twice, and one of those times is before he takes office.\n  Part of our Nation's success is due to our healthy mistrust of the \ncentralization of authority. The Founding Fathers did not create a \nunitary system like in France. They built a country based on a union. \nAs Jefferson once said, ``the way to have good government is not to \ntrust it all to one, but to divide it among the many, distributing to \nevery one exactly the functions he is competent to perform.'' The \nFounders thought that Congress was competent to legislate our spending \nbills, not the executive. More than 200 years of success is hard to \nargue with.\n  As we all know, it can take several months of work to get a bill \nsigned into law. Under current law, the House and Senate can pass a \nbill and then send it to conference where the differences between the \nHouse and Senate versions of the bill are resolved. Oftentimes \nconferees spend hours, even days and weeks, working to resolve \ndifferences, so that both Houses can support the end product. This can \nbe a delicate proceeding, calling for compromise and flexibility.\n  Upon completion of conference the House and Senate vote on the \nconference report and send the bill to the President for signature. \nUnder this legislation, if the President decides to sign the bill, he \ncould then decide to strike out, for instance, specific spending \nprovisions in an appropriations bill. Under this bill, the President \nwould also have the power to line-item out items that are listed in \ngraphs, tables, charts, conference committee's statement of managers, \nor portions of a committee report not superseded by the conference \nreport. The scope of possible rescissions is enormous.\n\n  If Congress disagreed with the President's rescissions, they could \npass a disapproval bill which would have to be passed by both Houses, \nget through conference, and be passed again. Should the President \nproceed to veto to the disapproval bill, it would take two-thirds of \nthe Members in each Chamber to override the President's veto. Since we \nhave not even been able to pass a budget this year, I tremble to think \nwhat adding additional steps to the process will do to Congress' \nability to act.\n  Clearly this is the most significant delegation of authority to the \nPresident that we have seen in over 200 years. If Congress passes this \nconference report we will abdicate our authority guaranteed to us under \nthe Constitution, and give it to the President. Moreover, although this \nbill seeks to solve our fiscal problems, it could also serve to \nindirectly increase spending. For instance, if the Administration \nsought to increase spending for a mandatory program, he could lobby the \nMember to support his initiative by threatening to line-item out all of \nthe appropriations for projects in that Member's district. As my friend \nAb Mikva wrote in the March 25th edition of Legal Times, ``For those of \nus who think that the executive branch is strong enough, and that an \nimperial presidency is more of a threat than an overpowering Congress, \nthe current balance of power is just right.''\n  Mr. President, the Founding Fathers carefully wrought our \nConstitution to include the doctrine of separations of powers. I \nbelieve that this conference\n\n[[Page S2987]]\n\nreport goes against that philosophy and ultimately, will have little \neffect on solving our fiscal problems, for these reasons, I will not \nsupport this report.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \nconference report. There is a right way and a wrong way to provide the \nPresident with a line-item veto. This is the wrong way.\n  Mr. President, I have supported a line-item veto in the past. I \nbelieve that the President should have greater authority to weed out \nwasteful tax breaks and unnecessary weapon systems.\n  But this legislation goes too far.\n  I have three major objections to this conference report.\n  First, this legislation cedes too much power to the President. Under \nthis proposal, any President and one-third plus one in the House can \nstop any appropriated item. This legislation goes much further than the \nso-called separate enrollment bill that passed the Senate. The \nlegislation before us, in effect, allows the President to veto report \nlanguage and tables in Committee reports. This means that the President \ncan veto airport improvement funds for Newark but keep funds for \nKennedy and LaGuardia airports. And the only way to override this type \nof veto is to get two-thirds of the Members in both House to support an \nindividual item--which is highly unlikely.\n  The President of the United States already has awesome constitutional \npower. Look at what has happened in the past 6 months.\n  The President vetoed a Republican budget that made huge cuts in \nMedicare and Medicaid to pay for tax breaks for the rich. He stopped \nthis cold.\n  He also vetoed a welfare reform bill that would have doomed 1.5 \nmillion children to live in poverty.\n  Finally, he vetoed spending bills that made deep cuts in education, \nenvironment, and community policing.\n  Mr. President, the Congress was never able to override these vetoes. \nThis demonstrates how powerful the Presidency can be when it comes to \nvetoing unfair budget priorities. We should not provide the chief \nexecutive with this new power on top of the tremendous power he already \npossesses.\n  Second, this legislation makes a mockery of applying the line-item \nveto to tax breaks. The Senate bill originally allowed the President to \nuse the line-item veto to stop some tax breaks. These breaks were \ndefined far too narrowly. But even this language did not survive \nconference.\n  This conference report only allows the President to veto tax items \nthat affect fewer than 100 persons. This means that Congress can pass a \ntax break that only applies to people with incomes over $1 million and \nthe President could not single this out. Furthermore, the language also \nexempts other classes of persons from the tax provisions of the bill. \nOne such exemption is property. Therefore, if Congress passed a tax \nbreak for 99 owners of a certain type of yacht, the President could not \nveto this provision.\n  In summary, this legislation allows the President to use the line-\nitem veto to reject investments in education and the environment but \nnot to reject tax breaks for millionaires. This is preposterous.\n  Finally, I object to the Republican political hypocrisy that went \ninto choosing an effective date and sunset date for this legislation.\n  This bill was a part of the so-called Contract With America. The \nHouse passed its version of this bill on February 6, 1995. The Senate \npassed its version on March 23, 1995.\n  During debate on this legislation, I heard many Republicans in both \nHouses say that they were so committed to passing this legislation that \nthey were even willing to give this power to a Democratic President. \nThey argued how important the line-item veto was to cut out wasteful \nspending and unnecessary tax breaks.\n  Despite all of the clamoring by the Republicans, they began to drag \ntheir feet so that they would not have to give this power to President \nClinton. They delayed naming conferees on the bill. They stalled on \ncalling a meeting for the conferees. They kept dragging it out so that \nthey could pass the fiscal year 1996 appropriations bills before the \nline-item veto bill became law.\n  During this period of inaction, the Republican majority sent \nPresident Clinton a pork-laden Defense appropriations bill that spent \n$7 billion more than the Pentagon wanted. This is when President \nClinton really needed the line-item veto--so he could reject this $7 \nbillion in unnecessary spending. But he did not have this tool then. \nThe Republicans were simply playing politics with the line-item veto \nbill.\n  Now, we find ourselves with an entire new set of dates in this \nlegislation. This bill will now go into effect on January 1, 1997 and \nit will last 8 years.\n  Mr. President, this is so blatantly political. But this is not the \nreason why we should reject this conference report. We should vote this \ndown because it cedes too much power to the President and renders him \npowerless to fight tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 4, the conference \nreport on the Line-Item Veto Act. The Senate is now wrapping up a long-\noverdue and historic debate.\n  I note that two words in particular sound very good in this debate: \nconference report. There must be many Members in both the Senate and \nthe other body who have wondered if they would ever hear those two \nwords used in connection with the line-item veto.\n  I want to recognize and commend the leadership and longstanding \ncommitment that Senators McCain and Coats have shown on this issue, as \nwell as Chairman Domenici and Chairman Stevens, for their work in \nshepherding this legislation through committee, earlier passage in the \nSenate, and now, the conference process.\n  I also want to express my appreciation for the leadership of our \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, in bringing this vital \nreform to the floor. His name was at the top of this bill when several \nof us first introduced S. 4 on the first day of this 104th Congress, \nJanuary 4, 1995, and he has been solidly committed to passage of this \nlandmark legislation.\n  There are three principal reasons to enact this kind of reform:\n  First, a line-item veto will promote fiscal responsibility.\n  This is a major step on our way toward a balanced budget.\n  For more than 20 years, since the President was hamstrung by some of \nthe lesser provisions of the 1974 Impoundment Control and Budget Act, \ncongresses have ignored with impunity most of the Presidential \nrecommendations to rescind spending authority for individual items.\n  Now, at least some obnoxious, unwarranted spending will be struck \ndown.\n  Opponents of this bill have argued that it would lead to more \nspending, as Presidents use the leverage of the line-item veto to get \nmore spending for their pet programs, or as Congress loads still more \nspending into bills, in hopes that at least some of it will get by the \nPresident. Alternatively, they argue that Presidents will abuse this \npower and fundamentally distort the balance of constitutional power \nbetween the executive and legislative branches.\n  But the histories of the 43 States that have given their Governors \nthis veto authority do not bear out these dire--and purely \ntheoretical--warnings.\n  The experience of the States with the line-item veto, including that \nof my State of Idaho, has been uniformly favorable.\n  And, looking back over the last two or three generations, we see that \nState governments have increased spending and taxes at much lower rates \nthan the Federal Government.\n  It is an amazing concept for some in Washington, DC, but, when you \nassign someone responsibility--in this case, the responsibility that \ncomes to chief executives with line-item veto authority--they often \nlive up to high expectations. That has been the experience of the \nSates.\n  Alone, the line-item veto process is not going to be enough to \nbalance the budget.\n  What we really need is to take up the balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution once more, pass it, and send it to the Sates--send it \nto the people--for ratification.\n  I challenge President Clinton, who at least saw the light on the \nline-item veto, to support the balanced budget\n\n[[Page S2988]]\n\namendment as well, and help pass it through the Senate so we can attack \nthe cancerous Federal debt on a larger scale.\n  Second, the line-item veto will improve legislative accountability \nand produce a more thoughtful legislative process.\n  Starting when this act takes effect, Congress will be forced to \nreconsider questionable spending items and targeted tax breaks--items \nthat Congress would never pass in the first place if those items were \nconsidered on their own merits--items that just do not stand up under \nany amount of public scrutiny.\n  It would cast an additional dose of sunlight on the legislative \nprocess.\n  We are all familiar with the rush to get the legislative trains out \non time.\n  That means bills and reports spanning hundreds of pages that \nvirtually no one is able to read--much less digest--in the day or two \nthat they are before the body.\n  Moreover, any more it seems that virtually every appropriations \nbill--even the 13 regular bills--and virtually every tax bill, is a \nhuge bill.\n  Knowing that any individual provision may have to return to Congress \none more time to stand on its own merits will promote more responsible \nlegislation in the first place.\n  In short, embarrassing items will not be sneaked into these bills in \nthe first place.\n  Third, a line-item veto would improved executive accountability.\n  There is always some concern that the line-item veto would transfer \ntoo much power from the Congress to the President.\n  First, I suggest that is not such a bad thing. The Framers of the \nConstitution never envisioned 1,500-page, omnibus bills presented to \nthe President on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.\n  This is not a swipe at the constitutional system of checks and \nbalances--it is a correction. The system is broken. This is one of the \nfirst steps in fixing it.\n  The supposed blackmail that Presidents will exert over Congress as a \nresult of the line-item veto, is nothing, compared what kind Congress \nhas exerted for years on the President.\n  A President will rarely, if ever, risk closing down an entire \ndepartment in a mere attempt to take out a handful of earmarked, local \nbenefits.\n  But let me also differ a little with the presumption that a radical \nshift of power would take place.\n  Many of us on both sides of the aisle have suggested, at different \ntimes, that Presidents are not always serious about the rescissions \nmessages they send to Congress.\n  And, sometimes, the volume of rescissions they propose do not live up \nto tough talk about what they would do if they had the line-item veto.\n  It is time to call the President's bluff--and I mean every President, \nbecause this is a bipartisan issue.\n  For years now, we have seen groups like Citizens Against Government \nWaste and others come up with billions of dollars in long lists of pork \nitems.\n  Once the President starts using the line-item veto authority, he or \nshe will have to answer to the people if the use of that authority \ndoesn't match the Presidential rhetoric.\n  Congress would not lose the power of the purse--but the President \nwill soon be expected to use the power of the spotlight of heightened \npublic scrutiny.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. SNOWE). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote on the \nadoption of the conference report accompanying S. 4, the line-item veto \nbill, occur at 7 p.m. this evening, with the time between now and the \nvote to be equally divided between Senators McCain and Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I rise in support of the position of \nthe Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, on the line-item veto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields the Senator time?\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do I have under my control, I ask the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Twenty-five minutes. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, this matter is not about balancing the budget, it is \nnot even about the size of the deficit. This matter is about the \nrelative power of the Chief Executive of the United States and the \nCongress of the United States. Why this Congress, this Senate, would \nwant to give up its constitutional powers, which, by the way, I do not \nbelieve under the Constitution they have the right to do even if they \nwish to do that foolish thing, but why we would want to do that, I do \nnot know.\n  I am particularly surprised, Madam President, that some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle who fought so hard, for \nexample, for star wars, why they would want to give to the President \nthe right to veto star wars. I happen to have been an opponent through \nthe years of star wars, at least at the levels of expenditure--$33 \nbillion has been spent on star wars so far. I think that is a \ntremendous waste.\n  But, Madam President, I defend the right of this body and of this \nCongress to set those priorities. Why you would want to give it to the \nPresident to be able to change a bill already signed into law and just \nnit-pick that bill without taking out the whole bill, I do not know, \nMadam President.\n  Yesterday, there was an article in one of the Louisiana papers in \nwhich it said, ``Louisiana delegation gets piece of pork.'' They went \non to describe an appropriation that Congressman Livingston and I had \ngotten in the New Orleans area because we had a flood down there of \nbiblical proportions, over 20 inches of rain in a 24-hour period, seven \npeople killed, $1 billion in damage. We were able to respond to that \nissue.\n  They went on to define ``pork'' as that which was not in the \nPresident's budget. If the Congress exercised its power under the \nConstitution, the power of the purse, then that was pork, according to \nthis article and according to the National Taxpayers Union. But had it \nbeen in the President's budget, it would have been perfectly all right.\n  The idiocy of that kind of formulation, Madam President, is to me, \nabsolutely incredible. Coming from a newspaper article, it is not \nunexpected because that is the kind of thing that people like to read. \nBut coming on to the floor of the Senate and Senators saying it is the \nWhite House that knows best, it is--and we are not talking about the \nPresident; we are talking about the nameless, faceless gnomes in the \nWhite House who would be setting priorities, making policies, making \nthe decisions about our constituents.\n\n  Our constituents would be coming to us, as in the case of this 20-\ninch flood. You bet I was down there after the flood, as were my \ncolleagues, going through the homes, looking at the devastation, trying \nto sympathize with the people, they demanding in turn that we do \nsomething about this terrible tragedy. Our colleagues are saying, \n``Look, if it's not in the President's budget, it should not be part of \nthe bill. It is up to the White House to set those priorities.''\n  Madam President, there was nobody from the White House down in \nLouisiana to see that flood. They could not be. The Office of \nManagement and Budget does not have that kind of travel budget. They \ndid not go down and look at the individual problems of individual \nStates. That is the job for elected representatives. That is what the \nredactors of our Constitution had in mind. That is why they put the \npower of the purse in the Congress.\n  We are closest to the people, and we respond to them. To leave all of \nthat power in, as I say, not the President--maybe the President would \ndecide on star wars or some big item like that, but the accumulation of \nitems in that budget would be decided by OMB. And what would be the \npolicy of OMB? They would have to have broad policies, such as to say, \nif it is not in the President's budget, we are going to veto it. We are \ngoing to treat everybody alike.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. One additional minute.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, the shift in power which this would\n\n[[Page S2989]]\n\nbring out would be absolutely mind-boggling to me. You know, the whole \nfight would be, ``Can you get in the President's budget or not?'' It \nwould make total supplicants of all Members of Congress. You might like \nthat if you like the President. I think this President is going to be \nreelected. I like him. I must say I do not like him enough to turn over \nto him, and to all of his successors, the power of the purse when it is \nvested by the Constitution in this Congress.\n  Madam President, my colleague, Senator Byrd, and others, made a \npowerful statement about the unconstitutionality of this provision \nearlier today. They surely are right. If we do not stand up for the \nrights of the Congress under the Constitution, I hope the courts will. \nI will support the Senator from West Virginia.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I yield \nthe remainder of my time to Senator Sarbanes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Ten minutes?\n  Mr. BYRD. Ten minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Would the Senator from West Virginia give me 1 minute \nprior to the Senator from Maryland speaking and it not come off the \nSenator's time?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Sarbanes, but first 1 minute \nto Senator Bumpers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for a very powerful, \ncogent statement. No. 2, I want to say to my colleagues that, if by \nsome chance the Supreme Court does not rule this unconstitutional, you \nwill never be able to take this power back. Thirty-four Senators can \nkeep you from ever taking this power back. It will be gone forever.\n  When the Framers assembled in Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, in 1787, \nthe one thing they knew above everything else was they had had all the \nkings they wanted. They wanted no more kings. And they succeeded \nadmirably. We have had 43 Presidents and no kings--until now. We are \ndoing our very best to transfer kingly powers to the President of the \nUnited States. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I want to express my very deep \nappreciation to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator \nByrd, for the extraordinary statement which he made earlier today on \nthis issue. It is my prediction that, if this measure passes and is \nimplemented, history will look back on this moment and say that was a \ncritical turning point in our constitutional system and that it was the \nSenator from West Virginia, above all others, who stood on the floor \nand warned of what this would bring about; that it was the Senator from \nWest Virginia who understood our existing constitutional system the \nbest and saw the dangers inherent in this proposal.\n  Part of what is happening here is that we are engaged in symbolism, \nnot the reality of addressing important national problems. There is a \nskilled craftsmanship in addressing problems of public policy which \nmembers of a legislative body are supposed to bring to the task. Anyone \ncan get up and holler about problems. The question is, can you \nformulate an appropriate response?\n  As the distinguished Senator from Louisiana said, this proposal is \nnot really about balancing the budget. You balance the budget by tough-\nminded decisions on the budget, which the President and the Congress \nhave been making in recent years.\n  What is happening here is an enormous transfer of authority from the \nlegislative branch to the executive branch that completely contravenes \nand contradicts the Constitution, so much so that I believe when tested \nin the courts, this measure will be found wanting. I fervently hope \nthat will prove to be the case. This proposal gives the President the \npower, or purports to give the President the power, once he signs a \npiece of legislation into law, to then take out of that law various \nitems--actually, as many as he chooses to pick--by what is called \nrescinding appropriation items--that unmaking of existing law. The \nCongress then, in order to override that rescission, would have to pass \na disapproval bill which the President can veto. Once he vetoes the \ndisapproval bill it takes a two-thirds majority in both Houses to \noverride the President's rescission.\n  Thus, under the proposal before us, the President, as long as he can \nhold on to one-third plus one of either the Senate or the House--not \nboth bodies; either the Senate or the House--can determine every \nspending priority of this country. Think of that. The President and 34 \nSenators, or the President and 146 Members of the House--not ``and,'' \nbut ``or''--can determine every spending priority of this Nation. \nObviously this represents a fundamental reordering of the separation of \npowers and the check and balance arrangements between the legislative \nand the executive branch in our Nation's Constitution.\n  Unfortunately, there is a tendency to dismiss such broad-reaching \nconstitutional questions. They were, however, very much at the \nforefront of the thinking of the Founding Fathers when they devised the \nConstitution in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787; a Constitution that \nI might observe has served the Republic well for more than 2 centuries. \nAs the able Senator from West Virginia has observed a very carefully \nbalanced arrangement was put into place and it has served this Nation \nwell. Obviously, when we consider changing our Nation's basic charter \nwe need to be very careful and very prudent.\n  Now, I submit it does not take great skill or vision to have a strong \nexecutive. Lots of nations have strong executives. In fact, if a \ncountry's executive is too strong, we call it a dictatorship. If we \nreview history, even look around the world now, we can see clear \nexamples of this. It is one of the hallmarks of a free society to have \na legislative branch with decisionmaking authority which can operate as \na check and balance upon the executive. Another hallmark is to have an \nindependent judicial branch which can also operate as a check and \nbalance in the system. It should be noted that we have received a \nletter from the Judicial Conference of the United States expressing \ntheir very deep concern about this measure and indicating that they \nfeel it undermines the independence of the judicial branch of our \nGovernment.\n\n  That letter states in part:\n\n       The Judiciary believes there may be constitutional \n     implications if the President is given independent authority \n     to make line-item vetoes of its appropriations acts. The \n     doctrine of separation of powers recognizes the vital \n     importance of protecting the Judiciary against interference \n     from any President.\n\n  The Senator from West Virginia, to his enormous credit, is a great \ninstitutionalist. He believes in the institutions of our Nation and is \nconcerned with maintaining their strength and vitality and resists the \npolitical fad of the moment. Our founders established a balanced \nGovernment with independent branches, not only an executive with power \nand authority, but a legislative branch with power and authority, and a \njudiciary that is independent. This measure significantly erodes the \narrangement which has served the Republic well for over 200 years.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to stop and think for a moment about \nhow this proposal opens up the opportunity for the executive branch, \nfor the President, to bring enormous pressure to bear upon the Members \nof the Congress and therefore markedly affect the dynamics between the \ntwo branches.\n  The President could link--easily link, obviously will link, in my \njudgment--unrelated matters to a specific item in the appropriations \nbill. Suppose a Member is opposing the President's policy--perhaps \nsomewhere around the world or on some domestic policy; perhaps a \nnomination which the President had made--and the President receives a \nbill which contains in it an item of extreme importance to the Member's \ndistrict or State, justified under any criteria as serving the Nation's \neconomic interest; for example, the dredging of a harbor, or the \nbuilding of a road. The President calls the number and says he noticed \nthis item, he certainly hopes he does not have to rescind it. He does \nnot want to do so. He knows it is meritorious. But at the same time, he \nhas this other issue that he is very concerned about in which the \nMember is opposing him.\n\n[[Page S2990]]\n\n  My friend from Louisiana spoke of how the line-item veto power would \nbe used to directly neutralize congressional policy on a particular \nissue. A majority is in favor of a certain policy, the President pulls \nit out and negates it, holds on to one-third of one House, and that is \nthe end of it--even though a clear majority in both Houses of the \nCongress wanted the policy.\n\n  The next step beyond rendering the congressional opinion null and \nvoid on a specific issue itself, is to link that issue to some other \nunrelated issue on which the President is seeking to obtain leverage \nover the Member of Congress. In fact, in the hands of a vindictive \nPresident, the line-item veto could be absolutely brutal. I want to lay \nthat on the record today. In the hands of a vindictive President the \nline-item veto could be absolutely brutal. But you would not need a \nvindictive President for abuses. Presidents anxious to gain their way, \nas all Presidents are, will use this weapon to pressure legislators.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator is expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 2 additional minutes to Senator Sarbanes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator finds this \nparallel: In a conference report, when the Senate and the House go to a \nconference committee, there are bargains struck, and finally a bill put \ntogether. Would it not be somewhat like being able to strike a bargain, \nputting the bill together, signing off on it, and then after the bill \nis signed, have one House strike all the items that the other House \nwanted?\n  Mr. SARBANES. You could absolutely redo the legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed at the end of my remarks an \narticle written by Judge Abner Mikva on this very point, called \n``Loosening the Glue of Democracy.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, the Senator from West Virginia made a \nconstructive proposal, which was just tabled, which would have allowed \nthe President to propose rescissions to the Congress for consideration \non an expedited basis, with the Congress having to vote on the \nrescission and with a majority vote required to approve the rescission. \nThis would have enabled the President to spotlight those items of which \nhe disapproved and required a congressional vote on them but would not \nhave altered our basic constitutional arrangements.\n\n  The line-item veto tool contained in this legislation will not, in my \njudgment, become a way to delete appropriation items, but rather a tool \nand a legislative strategy used by the White House and executive branch \nto pressure Members on their positions on unrelated items. It will \nbecome a heavy, coercive weapon of pressure.\n  This is a dangerous departure from past constitutional practice, \ndrastically shifting the balance between the executive and legislative \nbranches. It will fundamentally alter our constitutional arrangement to \nthe detriment of a system of government which has served well our \nRepublic and been the marvel of the world.\n  Madam President, I close by again expressing my deep gratitude to the \nSenator from West Virginia for so clearly and eloquently setting forth \nthe severe problems connected with this proposal.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 [From the Legal Times, Mar. 25, 1996]\n\n                    Loosening the Glue of Democracy\n\n\n      The Line-Item Veto Would Discourage Congressional Compromise\n\n                          (By Abner J. Mikva)\n\n       There is a certain hardiness to the idea of a line-item \n     veto that causes it to keep coming back: Presidents, of \n     course, have always wanted it because the line-item veto \n     represents a substantial transfer of power from the \n     legislative branch to the executive branch. Government \n     purists favor the idea because the current appropriations \n     process--whereby all kinds of disparate expenditures are \n     wrapped or ``bundled'' into one bill so that the president \n     must either swallow the whole thing or veto the whole thing--\n     is very messy and wasteful. Reformer generally urge such a \n     change because anything that curtails the power of Congress \n     to spend has to be good.\n       My bias against the unbundling of appropriations and other \n     legislative proposals has changed over the years. When I \n     first saw the appropriations process, back in the Illinois \n     legislature, it seemed the height of irresponsibility to \n     bundle dozens of purposes into a single bill. It also seemed \n     unconstitutional since the Illinois Constitution had a \n     ``single purpose'' clause, under which bills considered by \n     the legislature were to contain only one subject matter. But \n     the ``single purpose'' clause had been observed in the breach \n     for many years by the time I was elected in 1956.\n       I first saw the bundling process work when a single bill, \n     presented for final passage, appropriated money for both the \n     Fair Employment Practices Commission and a host of other \n     commissions, including one to provide services for Spanish-\n     American War veterans (there were two left in the state at \n     the time) and one to study the size of mosquitoes that \n     inhabited the downstate portions of Illinois. If I wanted to \n     vote for the FEPC, I had to swallow all those other \n     commissions, which I thought were wasteful. So I invoked the \n     constitutional clause. To my dismay, the legislature favored \n     all the other commissions on separate votes, but the FEPC \n     went down to defeat. That is how I learned that there are \n     some pluses to the bundling process.\n       Bundling is very asymmetrical in effect and probably \n     wasteful. But it is also a legislative device that allows \n     various coalitions to form and thus moves the legislative \n     process forward.\n       Consider South America, where regional rivalries and \n     resentments in many countries make governing very difficult. \n     The inability to form the political coalitions that are \n     normal in this country creates enormous pressure on the \n     central government. This pressure is certainly one of the \n     causes of the mini-revolts that perpetually arise. The have-\n     nots feel excluded from the process, while the majority (or \n     the military regime) exercise their power without taking care \n     of the depressed areas of the country.\n       It is more difficult to ignore the have-nots in the United \n     States. First of all, members of Congress are elected as \n     representatives of geographic areas, rather than as \n     representatives of parties. Woe betide the congressman who \n     starts thinking too much like a national legislator and \n     forgets the parochial interests of his constituents.\n       Second, the separate elections of the president and \n     Congress creates the necessity for the two branches to \n     cooperate in setting spending priorities. Floating coalitions \n     that take into account the needs of all the sections and \n     groups in the country become essential. When urban interests \n     wanted to promote a food program for the cities, for example, \n     they formed a coalition with agricultural interests, and food \n     stamps were joined with farm subsidies.\n       It is true that bundling encourages the merger of bad ideas \n     with good ideas, and diminishes the ability of the president \n     to undo the package. A line-item veto, which would allow the \n     president to veto any single piece of an appropriations bill \n     (or, under some proposals, reject disparate pieces of any \n     other bill), makes the whole process more rational. But it \n     also makes it harder to find the glue that holds the \n     disparate parts of our country together. City people usually \n     don't care about dams and farm policy. Their rural cousins \n     don't think much about mass transportation or urban renewal \n     or housing policy. If the two groups of representatives don't \n     have anything to bargain about, it is unlikely that either \n     set of concerns will receive appropriate attention.\n       The other downside to the line-item veto is exactly the \n     reason why almost all presidents want the change and why, up \n     to now, most Congresses have resisted the idea. The line-item \n     veto transfers an enormous amount of power from Congress to \n     the president. For those of us who think that the executive \n     branch is strong enough, and that an imperial presidency is \n     more of a threat than an overpowering Congress, the current \n     balance of power is just right.\n       That has been the gist of Sen. Robert Byrd's opposition to \n     the line-item veto. The West Virginia Democrat has argued \n     that the appropriations power, the power of the purse, is the \n     only real power that Congress has and that the line-item veto \n     would diminish that power substantially. So far, he has \n     prevailed--although last year, the reason he prevailed had \n     more to do with the Republicans' unwillingness to give such a \n     powerful tool to President Bill Clinton.\n       But now the political dynamics have changed. The \n     Republicans in Congress can fashion a line-item veto that \n     will not benefit the incumbent president--unless he gets \n     reelected--and their probable presidential candidate, Senate \n     Majority Leader Robert Dole, has recently made clear that he \n     wants this passed. Chances for the line-item veto are vastly \n     greater.\n       There are some constitutional problems in creating such a \n     procedure. The wording of the Constitution suggests pretty \n     strongly that a bill is presented to the president for his \n     signature or veto in its entirety. It will take some creative \n     legislating to overcome such a ``technicality.'' I \n     reluctantly advised the president last year that it was \n     possible to draft a line-item veto law that would pass \n     constitutional muster. The draft proposal involved a Rube \n     Goldberg plan that ``pretended'' that the omnibus \n     appropriations\n\n[[Page S2991]]\n\n     legislation passed by Congress and presented to the president \n     actually consists of separate bills for various purposes. \n     This pretense was effectuated by putting language in \n     legislation to that effect.\n       President Clinton was not then asking for my policy views, \n     and I did not have to reconcile my advice with my policy bias \n     toward the first branch of government--Congress. But I was \n     uneasy enough to become more sympathetic to the late Justice \n     Robert Jackson's handling of a similar dilemma in one of his \n     Supreme Court opinions. He acknowledged his apostasy \n     concerning an issue on which he had opined to the contrary \n     during his tenure as attorney general. Quoting another, \n     Justice Jackson wrote, ``The matter does not appear to me now \n     as it appears to have appeared to me then.''\n       My apostasy was less public. My memo to the president was \n     only an internal document, and I didn't have to tell him how \n     I felt about the line-item veto. But now that I have no \n     representational responsibilities, I prefer to stand with \n     Sen. Byrd.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his excellent \nremarks.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I am going to yield 3 minutes of my leader \ntime to the distinguished Senator from Nebraska. First, I will take 30 \nseconds and then put my statement in the Record. I have a meeting in \nthe office.\n  I have been listening to some of the debate. I know the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia certainly understands this issue better than \nany of us. But we sometimes disagree. The one thing we should not do is \nelect a vindictive President. I do not think the present occupant is or \nthe one challenging the President is. So we will be safe for the next 4 \nyears, I tell the Senator from Maryland, and probably 8.\n  I understand what someone could do to abuse the power of the Office \nof the President. But we have been negotiating all afternoon in my \noffice. We have five appropriation bills, and we have been trying to \nfigure out how we can come together on those, taking a little out here \nand adding a little here. It is very, very complicated these days. We \nare working with the White House.\n  I think many of the fears and concerns expressed would be if you had \nsomebody in the White House who stiffed Congress on everything and \nrefused to negotiate. Right now, in my office we are negotiating with \nthe Chief of Staff, Mr. Panetta, and trying to come together on a big, \nbig appropriation bill so that we can pass it on Friday. We may not get \nit done because they have their priorities, and Congress has its \npriorities. But I believe the line-item veto is an idea whose time has \ncome.\n  I certainly thank all those involved, particularly the Senator from \nArizona, Senator McCain, and the Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats, \nwith the great assistance of the Senator from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, and the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens.\n  This is not a partisan measure. President Clinton supports the line-\nitem veto. I think it has support on each side of the aisle. I know the \nSenator from West Virginia wants to leave here by 7 o'clock.\n  Madam President, again I am proud that today the Senate is passing \nthe conference report on the Line-Item Veto Act of 1996. Giving line-\nitem veto authority to the President is a promise we made to the \nAmerican people in the Contract With America, and it is a promise we \nare following through on today.\n  Line-item veto seems to be the one thing that all modern Presidents \nagree on. All of our recent Presidents have called for the line-item \nveto--both Democrat and Republican Presidents alike. And for good \nreason. The President, regardless of party, should be able to eliminate \nunnecessary pork-barrel projects from large appropriations bills.\n  Most of our Nation's Governors have the line-item veto. Some States \nhave had line-item veto since the Civil War. There's a lot of \nexperience out there in the States that shows us this is a good idea; \n43 Governors have the line-item veto, and now--finally--the President \nwill, too.\n  President Clinton and I have talked about the Line-Item Veto Act. He \nwants the line-item veto and we both think it is a good idea.\n  Certainly, line-item veto is not a cure-all for budget deficits. No \none is pretending it is the one big answer to all of our budget \nproblems.\n  But it is one additional tool a President can use to help keep \nunnecessary spending down. It's one way for us to fulfill our pledge to \nAmerican taxpayers for less Washington spending.\n  Line-item veto has a lot of support in the Senate. We passed our \nversion of the bill in the Senate just about a year ago on March 17, \n1995 with the support of 69 Senators.\n  But I know some are worried that it shifts the balance of power away \nfrom Congress and to the President. Well, appropriations bills that go \non for hundreds of pages have already altered the dynamic between the \nPresident and Congress from what it was 200 years ago.\n  Even so, for those who aren't so sure line-item veto is the right \napproach, this bill has a sunset in it. We will try this experiment for \na few years and see if it works. I am confident it will. It is an idea \nwhose time has come.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Stevens, Domenici, McCain, \nand Coats for their work on this bill. It is thanks to them that we are \nabout to pass this important and historic legislation.\n  Madam President, I yield 3 minutes of my leader time to the Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, my colleagues know that I am an ardent \nsupporter of a line-item veto. I had one when I was Governor of \nNebraska and put it to excellent use. It was crucial to my success in \nbalancing the budget.\n  I am an original cosponsor of line-item veto legislation. I am proud \nof the leadership role I have taken. I fervently believe that the \nPresident of the United States should have at his disposal every \npossible means to strip away the pork from the Federal budget. The \nline-item veto should figure prominently in his arsenal.\n  Mr. President, I will vote for this conference report, but I will not \nconceal my keen disappointment at what has emerged after nearly a year \nof stalling, partisan games, and bickering. This is a classic case of \nwhat might have been. I was a conferee but as usual, the minority was \nshut out of the decisionmaking process. I also have some possible \nconstitutional questions and concerns.\n  Anyone who doubts the partisanship behind this legislation need look \nno further than its effective date--January 1, 1997. I have supported \nthe line-item veto under Republican Presidents and Democratic \nPresidents. Those of us who have long sought the line-item veto believe \nit is a good idea, regardless who sits in the White House.\n  So, we are in a big hurry to pass this legislation because it is a \npopular issue in an election year. But, there is no rush to make it \neffective. How strange. That can wait until after the Republican \nCongress has passed one last set of appropriation bills and perhaps, \nfor good measure, one last bill loaded with special interest tax \nbreaks.\n  I had great expectations for this legislation; so did many of my \ncolleagues on both sides. What we got was diminished returns. It now \nseems that those of us who fought the good fight will reluctantly have \nto accept an inferior product. We desperately need this line-item \nveto--as flawed as it may be.\n  Even the staunchest advocate of a line-item veto must confess that \nthe Senate bill did not age well in conference. We do not have a better \nbill today. The line-item veto before the Senate today is a half-\nmeasure. It only addresses one side of wasteful Government spending.\n  Madam President, there are different types of pork around here. There \nis what I call classic pork, but it does not belong in a museum. It is \nthe sweetheart awards, the bogus studies, the phony commissions, the \nmake-work projects that look good to the constituents back home.\n  Frittering away the taxpayers' dollars is an affront to middle-income \nAmericans who have been stretched and squeezed enough. This is where \nthe line-item veto can be a fierce instrument against waste. The \nPresident can slice out the pork with a slash of his pen. In this \nregard, the measure before the Senate should accomplish today what we \nset out to do, and I salute the managers of the conference.\n  But the special interests who benefit from pork always seem to be \none-step ahead of the deficit cutters. You might not find their pork on \nthe menu of an appropriations bill. But they are still dining a la \ncarte at the Finance or Ways and Means Committees, and yes, the Budget \nCommittee too.\n  They dress up pork in the latest fashion: special interest tax breaks \nor tax\n\n[[Page S2992]]\n\nexpenditures. That is right, Mr. President. It is still pork, but it \nwill be riveted onto a revenue bill or a budget reconciliation bill--\nlike the one the Republican majority passed last fall. Call it a tax \nloophole or whatever you want, it is still just as wasteful, and it is \nstill just as shameful as appropriated pork spending.\n  This problem of tax expenditures is not new. We have visited it many \ntimes, but with little resolution. The Budget Committee held hearings \ngoing back to 1993 on the budgetary effects of tax expenditures. OMB \nDirector Dr. Alice Rivlin testified, and I quote, ``Tax expenditures \nadd to the Federal deficit in the same way that direct spending \nprograms do.''\n  I believe, and many of my colleagues on both sides agree, that if we \nare serious about cutting wasteful spending, if we are serious about \nreducing the deficit, if we are serious about a credible line-item \nveto, we should include special interest tax loopholes in the list of \nwhat the President can line out.\n  What should shine forth from this conference report is an attack on \nboth wasteful appropriated spending and tax benefit pork. But the long \narm of the special interests reached into the conference and turned off \nthe lights when tax loopholes were put on the table.\n  From what I have seen of the conference report language, it could be \nvirtually impossible for the President to veto special interest tax \nbreaks, or as they are now called, limited tax benefits. There are so \nmany exceptions that any tax lobbyist worth his salt will be able to \nwrite legislation in such a way that they will not be subject to the \nline-item veto procedure. And mark my words, they will.\n  The conference report language defines a tax benefit as a revenue-\nlosing provision that does one or two things. It could provide a \nFederal tax deduction, credit, exclusion, or preference to 100 or fewer \nbeneficiaries. What is more, there are exclusions for tax breaks that \ntarget persons in the same industry, engaged in the same type of \nactivity, owning the same type of property, or issuing the same type of \ninvestment.\n  The exclusions do not end here; quite the contrary, they are \nexpanded. There are exceptions for individuals with different incomes, \nmarital status, number of dependents, or tax return filing status. For \nbusinesses and trade associations the exclusion could be based on size \nor form.\n  That is so limited, it does not exist. It is nearly impossible to \nthink of any provision that it would cover. In fact, I do not believe \nthat more than one or two of the more than dozens of tax provisions in \nthe last year's Republican budget reconciliation would be subject to a \nPresidential line-item veto under the report language. And that bill \nwas drafted before the lobbyists needed to draft their way around the \nline-item veto.\n  The exceptions are troubling enough, but it gets worse. Who defines a \ntargeted tax benefit for the purposes of the line-item veto? I was \nsurprised to learn that it will be the Joint Committee on Taxation. I, \ncertainly, do not intend to disparage the committee and its fine \nmembers, but this oversight duty strikes this Senator like the \nproverbial fox guarding the henhouse. This conference report would make \nAesop proud.\n  This is how it works. Under the provisions of the conference report, \nJoint Committee on Taxation will review every tax bill and decide \nwhether the bill includes any tax loopholes, called limited tax \nbenefits. The Joint Committee then gives its ruling to the conference \ncommittee, which gets to choose whether to include that information in \nits conference report. Recall that it is very often the staff of this \nsame Joint Committee on Taxation that drafts the tax loopholes in the \nfirst place.\n  Here is the kicker. If the JCT statement is included, the President \ncan rescind only, and I repeat, only those items identified in the \nlegislation as limited tax benefits. The JCT declaration is more than a \npiece of paper. It is a declaration of immunity for what could very \nwell be a limited tax benefit. It is an inoculation against a \nPresidential line-item veto. It is the magic bullet for tax lobbyists.\n  I do not believe that any of my colleagues fell off the turnip truck \nyesterday. We know how lobbyists work. I guarantee you that they will \nbe swarming over JCT like the sand hill cranes returning to the Platte \nRiver in Nebraska. JCT will be thick as thieves with tax lobbyists. And \nfor good reason, the committee will have the sweeping power to grant \nunprecedented immunity to any Tom, Dick, or Harry with a sweetheart tax \ndeal.\n  Madam President, I am disappointed by the final product the conferees \nbring to the floor today. It is a tarnished reflection of the hopes I \nbrought to the process. Yes; we should have done better. Yes; we should \nhave attacked pork in all of its guises, Yes; we should have been \ntougher. But I have my doubts that more time and more debate will \nproduce a different result--a superior result. I tell my colleagues \nthat giving the President at least some power to rein in wasteful \nspending is better than doing nothing. So today, I will cast my vote \nfor taking a small, but clear, step in the right direction. I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield my remaining time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Senator Thurmond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport accompanying S. 4, the Line-Item Veto Act. For many years, I \nhave been a supporter of giving authority to the President to \ndisapprove specific items of appropriation presented to him. On the \nfirst legislative day of this Congress, I introduced Senate Joint \nResolution 2, proposing a constitutional amendment to give the \nPresident line-item veto authority.\n  Presidential authority for a line-item veto is a significant fiscal \ntool which would provide a valuable means to reduce and restrain \nexcessive appropriations. This proposal will give the President the \nopportunity to approve or disapprove individual items of appropriation \nwhich have passed the Congress. It does not grant power to simply \nreduce the dollar amount legislated by the Congress.\n  Madam President, 43 Governors currently have constitutional authority \nto reduce or eliminate items or provisions in appropriation measures. \nMy home State of South Carolina provides this authority, and I found it \nmost useful during my service as Governor. Surely the President should \nhave authority that 43 Governors now have to check unbridled spending.\n  It is widely recognized that Federal spending is out of control. The \nFederal budget has been balanced only once in the last 35 years. Over \nthe past 20 years, Federal receipts, in current dollars, have grown \nfrom $279 billion to more than $1.3 trillion. In the meantime, Federal \noutlays have grown from $332 billion in 1975, to more than $1.5 \ntrillion last year, an increase of greater than $1.1 trillion. Annual \nbudget deficits have reached $200 billion, with the national debt \ngrowing to more than $5 trillion.\n  Madam President, it is clear that neither the President nor the \nCongress are effectively dealing with the budget crisis. The President \ncontinues to submit budgets which contain little spending reform and \ncontinue to project annual deficits.\n  If we are to have sustained economic growth, Government spending must \nbe significantly reduced. A balanced budget amendment, which I am \nhopeful will still be passed this Congress, and line-item veto \nauthority would do much to bring about fiscal responsibility.\n  Madam President, it would be a mistake to fail to pass this measure. \nIt is my hope that this Congress will now approve the line-item veto \nand send a clear message to the American people that we are making a \nserious effort to get our Nation's fiscal house in order.\n  Madam President, I congratulate the conferees for their work on this \nbill. This conference report provides the President with a very narrow \nauthority to cancel specific appropriations, direct spending, or \nlimited tax benefits. Under this provision, the Congress retains its \nlegislative power of the purse in that the Congress may enact a bill \ndisapproving the President's previous cancellation. This bill, of \ncourse, would be subject to a Presidential veto and subsequent \ncongressional override.\n  Madam President, the conference report also requires that any \ncanceled budget authority, direct spending, or tax benefit be applied \nto deficit reduction. Canceled funds would not be available to offset \nadditional spending.\n\n[[Page S2993]]\n\n  Madam President, the line-item veto will introduce a new level of \ndiscipline in the Federal budget process. It will bring an additional \nlevel of scrutiny to items of Federal spending. The line-item veto, \ncombined with a balanced budget amendment, true reforms in entitlement \nspending, and restraint in Federal appropriations, will put us back on \nthe track of fiscal responsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. \nAgain, I congratulate him for the extraordinary effort he has made to \ntry to make us pay attention to the underlying issues here. The bill \nbefore us says that, notwithstanding certain provisions, bills which \nhave been signed into law can be canceled by the President.\n  Never in the history of this body has the Congress attempted to give \nto the President the power on his own to cancel the law of the United \nStates. The process is the President signs the appropriations bills. It \nis then the law of the land. Those words should have a certain majesty \nin this body. This appropriations bill now signed by the President is \nthe law. But under the approach before us, the President would then \nhave 5 days in which he can cancel a part or all of that law without \ncongressional involvement. Yes, the Congress could vote to override the \ncancellation, but if the Congress does not, the cancellation action of \nthe President canceling the law of the land stands.\n  Never in the history of Congress has there been an effort to hand to \na President that kind of power. We are told the President of the United \nStates supports this. Of course he does. Every President would love \nCongress to hand part of its power to the President. Every President \nwould love a piece of the power of the purse. But the Constitution will \nnot let us do it, and we should not try.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In fact, the Constitution says:\n\n       Every Bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a \n     Law, be presented to the President of the United States; if \n     he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, \n     with his Objections . . . .\n\n  I do not see how constitutionally a President can sign a bill, make \nit the law, and then undo the law through a procedure that would not \nhave been permitted by the Constitution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Supreme Court has said it precisely in the Chadha \ncase. I am going to read these words again. I read them earlier this \nafternoon.\n\n       Amendment and repeal of statutes no less than enactment \n     must conform with article I.\n\n  The Supreme Court has told us what the Constitution tells us, as the \nSenator from Maryland just read:\n\n       Amendment and repeal of statutes no less than enactment \n     must conform with article I.\n\n  This conference report comes up with a new procedure which does not \nconform with article I and says that the President may cancel--that \nmeans repeal, void--the law of the land of the United States of \nAmerica. He can with his pen on day 1 create a law by signing our bill, \nand on day 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 cancel what is then already the law of the \nland.\n  Madam President, the Constitution will not tolerate that. We should \nnot even attempt to do such a thing. There have been many reasons given \nfor why the line-item veto in one version or another would be useful in \nterms of deficit reduction. There are ways constitutionally of doing \nit. The Senator from West Virginia made that effort earlier this \nafternoon. The current conference report before us simply cannot stand \nmuster.\n  Again, I thank my friend.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 22 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 11 minutes to the Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I thank my colleague for yielding. I \nappreciate the debate that we have had. It has been a long and \ndifficult and sometimes tortuous road to this particular point.\n  It was in the early or late 1800's that the first attempt to provide \nthe line-item veto power to the executive branch was offered in the \nCongress. There have been 200 attempts subsequent to that. So it has \nbeen a long effort.\n  The question was raised: Why would Congress cede its independence? \nWhy would Congress cede its power of spending to the executive \nbranch?--because it is an extraordinary effort; it is a historic \neffort. But I would say that the reason this is happening and the \nreason this will pass very shortly with a pretty substantial bipartisan \nvote is that there has been an extraordinary abuse of the power of \nspending. Despite every legislative effort and every promise and pledge \non this floor, the egregious practice of blackmailing the President by \nattaching to otherwise necessary spending bills pork barrel projects, \nprojects spending that does not have any relevance to the particular \nbill and would never probably stand the light of day in debate on that \nparticular issue or receive a majority vote has been passed into law.\n\n  I would just say in response to the Senator from Michigan that we \nhave had constitutional lawyers pour over this legislation for years \nand years. The Chadha decision does not apply to what we have done \nhere. Constitutional lawyers from each end of the spectrum and in \nbetween have told us that the legislation that we are presenting is \nconstitutional.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank some people for their \nextraordinary work on this. I acknowledge Senator Byrd's articulate and \nworthy opposition to this message throughout the years that we have \nbeen debating line-item veto. I want to thank Senator Domenici and \nSenator Stevens for helping us at a critical time. They were key to a \nstrong, workable compromise on the issue. Senator Dole's leadership, \nhis decision to make this happen, to break the impasse and achieve a \ncompromise, was absolutely critical to our success. Particularly, it is \na privilege for me to thank my friend and colleague, John McCain from \nArizona, for his efforts in this regard. I deeply respect his \ndetermination. He has been tireless in his fight against the current \nsystem and the status quo. He has persevered in long odds, in the face \nof what often looked like a losing battle. We joined together 8 years \nago in a commitment to pass a line-item veto, and it has been my \nprivilege to partner with him in this effort.\n  Madam President, this measure, in my opinion, is the most important \nGovernment reform that this Congress for many Congresses has addressed. \nYes, a line-item veto will help reduce the deficit. Yes, a line-item \nveto will eliminate foolish waste. But our ultimate objective is \ndifferent. Our current budget process is designed for deception. It \nrequires the disinfectant of scrutiny and debate.\n  When we send spending to the President that cannot be justified on \nits merits, it is attached more often than not to important \nappropriations bills. This has tended, first, to tie the President's \nhands, leaving him with a take-it-or-leave-it decision on the entire \nbill.\n  Second, it is used as a means of obscuring spending in the shuffle of \nuncounted billions of dollars of appropriations.\n  When we hide our excess behind a shield of vital legislation, our aim \nis plain. We do it to mask our wasteful spending by confusing the \nAmerican taxpayer. We have created a system that avoids public ridicule \nonly because it consciously attempts to keep our citizens from knowing \nhow their money is spent. This is not a rational process. This is a \ndeception. It is a trick, and it must stop. It is more than abuse of \npublic money; it is a betrayal of public trust.\n\n  But now we have an opportunity to end that abuse and restore that \ntrust. We have a chance to pass legislative line-item veto in a form \nthat has gained support from both parties and in both Houses of \nCongress. We have the power to make our goal of budget reform a \nreality. It is not all that we need to do, but it is a huge leap \nforward.\n  The line-item veto is designed to confront our deficit and to save \ntaxpayers' money. We have shaped this legislation to accomplish that \npurpose through a lockbox, ensuring that all\n\n[[Page S2994]]\n\nthe savings canceled by the President go forward toward deficit \nreduction.\n  The line-item veto is not a budgetary trick. Unlike the \nappropriations possess that currently exists and has existed from the \nbeginning of this legislation, nothing is taken off budget. No pay \ndates are altered. It is a substantive change aimed at discouraging \nbudget waste by encouraging the kind of openness and conflict that \nenforces restraint.\n  The goal is not to hand the Executive dominance in the budget \nprocess. The goal is the necessary nudge toward an equilibrium of \nbudget influence strengthening vital checks on excess. But I think it \ndoes something more. I think the real benefit of the line-item veto is \nthat it exposes a process that thrives on public deception. It is a \nlasting, meaningful reform--changing the very ground rules of the way \nthis legislature has operated.\n\n  We have reached a historic decision, a historic moment. The first \nline-item veto, as I said, was introduced 120 years ago, interestingly \nenough, by a Congressman from West Virginia, Charles Faulkner. It died \nthen in committee, and since then nearly 200 line-item veto bills have \nbeen introduced, each one buried in committee, blocked by procedures or \nkilled by filibusters.\n  Today we have not been blocked. Today we have not been killed. And \nthis issue will no longer be ignored or no longer be denied. The House \nand the Senate are in agreement. The President is in agreement. The \npublic is in agreement. And now just one final vote remains.\n  This measure is a milestone of reform. It is the first time that the \nCongress will voluntarily part with a form of power it has abused. That \nis the result of a public that no longer accepts our excesses and \nexcuses. But it is also evidence of a new era in Congress, proof of a \nsea change in American politics. This vote will prove that Congress can \novercome its own narrow institutional interests to serve the interests \nof the Nation. That will be something remarkable, something of which \nevery Member who supports this legislation can rightfully be proud.\n  With this vote, let us show the American people we are serious about \nchanging the way this Congress works. Let us show them a legislative \nprocess conducted without deception and without the embarrassment we \nalways feel when it is exposed. Let us show them that their tax money \nwill no longer be wasted on favors for the few at the expense of the \nmany. Let us show them that business as usual in Congress is finally \nand decisively over.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I yield back any additional time \nthat was yielded to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I yield myself the remaining time.\n  Madam President, a number of comments and statements have been made \nabout this legislation, and due to a shortage of time I would not be \nable to respond to them. With the help of my friend and colleague from \nNew Mexico, we will submit a long statement for the Record tomorrow in \nresponse to some of the comments and statements that were made about \nthe impact of the line-item veto. I think it is important that the \nrecord be clear in response to some of those statements as I think in \nfuture years historians may be looking at the debate that took place in \nthe Chamber today.\n  Madam President, we have nearly arrived at a moment I have sought for \n10 years. In my life, I have had cause to develop a very keen \nappreciation for the value of time, and that appreciation has made it \nunlikely that I will soon enjoy a reputation for abiding patience. I \nconfess my great eagerness for this day's arrival. The line-item veto's \nelusiveness has encouraged in me if not patience, then certainly \nrespect for those who possess it in greater quantity than I.\n  Ten years may be but a moment in the life of this venerable \ninstitution, but it is a long time to me. In a few minutes, the issue \nwill be decided. I am gratified beyond measure that the Senate is now \napparently prepared to adopt S. 4, the line-item veto conference \nreport, that its adoption by the other body is assured, and that the \nPresident of the United States will soon sign this bill into law.\n  I am deeply grateful to my colleagues who have worked so hard to give \nthe President this authority. I wish to first thank my partner in this \nlong, difficult fight, my dear friend, the Senator from Indiana, [Mr. \nCoats]. His dedication to this legislation has been extraordinary and \nits success would not have been possible absent the great care and \npatience he has exercised on its behalf.\n  I would like to thank Mark Buse on my staff and Sharon Soderstrom and \nMegan Gilly on Senator Coats' staff.\n  Madam President, I am grateful to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, and the chairman of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, Senator Stevens. There have been moments in our \nconference when my gratitude may not have been evident, but I would not \nwant this debate to conclude without assuring both these Senators of my \nrespect for them and my appreciation for their sincere efforts to \nimprove this legislation. We may have had a few differences on some \nquestions pertaining to the line-item veto, but I know we are united in \nour commitment to the success of S. 4.\n  I also wish to thank the assistant majority leader, Senator Lott. As \nhe often does, amidst the confusion and controversies that often define \nconferences, he managed to identify the common ground and bring all \nparties to fair compromises and broad agreement.\n  Finally, let me say to the majority leader, Senator Dole, all the \nproponents of the line-item veto know that without his skillful \nleadership, without his admonition to put differences over details \naside for the sake of the principle of the line-item veto, we would not \nnow stand at the threshold of accomplishing something of real value to \nthis Nation. He is, as former baseball great Reggie Jackson once \ndescribed himself, ``the straw that stirs the drink'' around this \nplace.\n\n  The rules and customs of the Senate are not revered as inducements to \naction but, rather, for their restraining effect on ill-considered \nactions. Few things of real importance would ever occur here without \nSenator Dole's leadership. The advocates of this legislation have cause \nto celebrate his leadership today, but I think even the opponents of \nthis particular measure could refer to the many occasions when all \nSenators have had cause to celebrate Senator Dole's leadership of the \nSenate.\n  Madam President, the support of my colleagues for the line-item veto \nhave made this long, difficult contest worthwhile and an honor to have \nbeen involved in, but even greater honor is derived from the quality of \nthe opposition to this legislation. And every Senator is aware that the \nquality of that opposition is directly proportional to the quality of \none Senator in particular, the estimable Senator from West Virginia, \nSenator Byrd.\n  Madam President, I would like to indulge a moment of common weakness \nof politicians. I wish to quote myself. I wish to quote from remarks I \nmade 1 year ago when we first passed the line-item veto. I said at that \ntime that ``Senator Byrd distinguished our debate, as he has \ndistinguished so many of our previous debates,'' as he has \ndistinguished today's debate, ``with his passion and his eloquence, his \nwisdom and his deep abiding patriotism. Although my colleagues might \nbelieve I have eagerly sought opportunities to contend with Senator \nByrd, that was, to use a sports colloquialism, only my game face. I \nassure you I have approached each encounter with trepidation. Senator \nByrd is a very formidable man.''\n  Madam President, I stand by that tribute today. If there is a Member \nof this body who loves his country more, who reveres the Constitution \nmore, or who defends the Congress more effectively, I have not had the \nhonor of his or her acquaintance. Should we proponents of the line-item \nveto prevail, I will take little pride in overcoming Senator Byrd's \nimpressive opposition but only renewed respect for the honor of this \nbody as personified by its ablest defender, Senator Robert Byrd.\n  Senator Byrd has solemnly adjured the Senate to refrain from \nunwittingly violating the Constitution. As I said, his love for that \nnoble document is profound and worthy of a devoted public servant. I, \ntoo, love the Constitution, although I cannot equal the Senator's \nability to express that love.\n\n[[Page S2995]]\n\n  Like Senator Byrd, my regard for the Constitution encompasses more \nthan my appreciation for its genius and for the wisdom of its authors. \nIt is for the ideas it protects, for the Nation born of those ideas \nthat I would ransom my life to defend the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  It is to help preserve the notion that Government derived from the \nconsent of the governed is as sound as it is just that I have advocated \nthis small shift in authority from one branch of our Government to \nanother. I do not think the change to be as precipitous as its \nopponents fear. Even with the line-item veto authority, the President \ncould ill-afford to disregard the will of Congress. Should he abuse his \nauthority, Congress could and would compel the redress of that abuse.\n  I contend that granting the President this authority is necessary \ngiven the gravity of our fiscal problems and the inadequacy of \nCongress' past efforts to remedy those problems. I do not believe that \nthe line-item veto will empower the President to cure Government's \ninsolvency on its own. Indeed, that burden is and it will always remain \nCongress' responsibility. The amounts of money that may be spared \nthrough the application of the line-item veto are significant but \ncertainly not significant enough to remedy the Federal budget deficit.\n  But granting the President this authority is, I believe, a necessary \nfirst step toward improving certain of our own practices, improvements \nthat must be made for serious redress of our fiscal problems. The \nSenator from West Virginia reveres, as do I, the custom of the Senate, \nbut I am sure he would agree that all human institutions, just as all \nhuman beings, must fall short of perfection.\n  For some years now, the Congress has failed to exercise its power of \nthe purse with as much care as we should have. Blame should not be \nunfairly apportioned to one side of the aisle or the other. All have \nshared in our failures. Nor has Congress' imperfections proved us to be \ninferior to other branches of Government. This is not what the \nproponents contend.\n  What we contend is that the President is less encumbered by the \npolitical pressures affecting the spending decisions of Members of \nCongress whose constituencies are more narrowly defined than his. Thus, \nthe President could take a sterner view of public expenditures which \nserve the interests of only a few which cannot be reasonably argued as \nworth the expense given our current financial difficulties. In \nanticipation of a veto and the attendant public attention to the vetoed \nline-item appropriation, Members should prove more able to resist the \nattractions of unnecessary spending and thus begin the overdue reform \nof our spending practices. It is not an indictment of Congress nor any \nof its Members to note that this very human institution can stand a \nlittle reform now and then.\n\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support the line-item veto \nconference report and show the American people that, for their sake, we \nare prepared to relinquish a little of our own power.\n  I am very pleased to be here on this incredibly historic occasion.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I think of an old fable about two frogs. \nThey both fell into a churn that was half filled with milk. One of the \nfrogs immediately turned over, gave up the fight, and perished. The \nother frog kept kicking until he churned a big patty of butter. He \nmounted the butter, jumped out of the churn, and saved his life.\n  The moral of the story is: Keep on kicking and you will churn the \nbutter.\n  Madam President, I say this in order to congratulate Senator McCain \nand Senator Coats especially, for their long fight and for their \nsuccess in having gained the prize after striving for these many, many \nyears. They never gave up. They never gave up hope. They always said, \n``Well, we will be back next year.''\n  So I salute them in their victory and, as for myself, I simply say, \nas the Apostle Paul, ``I have fought a good fight, I have finished my \ncourse, I have kept the faith.''\n  I thank all Senators.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator yield, if I could just respond to that?\n  First of all, that is a high compliment and I am sure I speak for \nboth Senator McCain and myself in thanking you for that.\n  But, second, I leave here, after this vote, with the vivid picture in \nmy mind that the Senator from West Virginia is still kicking in the \nchurn on this issue, and that the final chapter probably is not written \nyet.\n  I admire his tenacity also, and I think he has gained the respect of \nSenator McCain and I and everyone else for his diligence in presenting \nhis case.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport on the line-item veto.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MUSKIE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. On behalf of myself, Senator Dole, Senator Cohen, and \nSenator Snowe, I send a resolution to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the resolution.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 234) relative to the death of Edmund \n     S. Muskie.\n       Whereas, the Senate fondly remembers former Secretary of \n     State, former Governor of Maine, and former Senator from \n     Maine, Edmund S. Muskie,\n       Whereas, Edmund S. Muskie spent six years in the Maine \n     House of Representatives, becoming minority leader,\n       Whereas, in 1954, voters made Edmund S. Muskie the State's \n     first Democratic Governor in 20 years,\n       Whereas, after a second two-year term, he went on in 1958 \n     to become the first popularly elected Democratic Senator in \n     Maine's history;\n       Whereas, Edmund S. Muskie in 1968, was chosen as Democratic \n     Vice-Presidential nominee,\n       Whereas, Edmund S. Muskie left the Senate to become \n     President Carter's Secretary of State,\n       Whereas, Edmund S. Muskie served with honor and distinction \n     in each of these capacities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate has heard with profound sorrow \n     and deep regret the announcement of the death of the \n     Honorable Edmund S. Muskie, formerly a Senator from the State \n     of Maine.\n       Resolved, That the Secretary communicate these resolutions \n     to the House of Representatives and transmit an enrolled copy \n     thereof to the family of the deceased.\n       Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns today, it adjourns \n     as a further mark of respect to the memory of the deceased \n     Senator.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in the earliest days of our Nation, \nGeorge Washington said it was the duty of public servants to ``raise a \nstandard to which the wise and the honest can repair.''\n  In his more than five decades as a public servant, Senator Edmund \nMuskie not only raised the standard of wisdom and honesty in public \noffice. On many occasions and in many ways, he set the standard.\n  Today I join my colleagues and, indeed, all of America, in saying \ngoodbye to this extraordinary American.\n  Senator Muskie served two terms as Governor of Maine--something of a \nminor political miracle in such a rock-ribbed Republican State.\n  He also served with great dignity and distinction as our Nation's \nSecretary of State under President Carter.\n  But it was his service in this Chamber, and as his party's candidate \nfor Vice President, for which Senator Muskie will be best remembered--\nand rightly so.\n  In 1974, I came to Washington as a Senate staffer. Senator Muskie had \nalready served 15 years.\n  What first impressed me about him was his compassion, and his \nunshakable belief in the infinite possibilities of America. It was a \nbelief he learned from his immigrant father, a belief that animated his \nentire life.\n  Ed Muskie knew that government cannot guarantee anyone the good life. \nBut government has a responsibility to help people seize possibilities \nto make a good life for themselves, their families and their \ncommunities.\n  He held other beliefs deeply as well.\n  Ed Muskie believed that we have an obligation to be good stewards of \nthis fragile planet.\n  He was an expert on air and water pollution, and he served as floor \nmanager for two of the most important environmental laws ever--the \nClean Air Act of 1963 and the Water Quality Act of 1965.\n  Ed Muskie believed that more was needed to solve the problem of \npoverty than money from Washington. Thirty years ago, he called for a \nnew creative federalism.\n  ``No matter how much the Federal partner provides,'' he said, ``no \nFederal legislation, no executive order, no administrative \nestablishment can get to the heart of most of the basic problems \nconfronting the state governments today.''\n  Ed Muskie believed that politics ought to be a contest of ideas, not \nan endless series of personal attacks.\n  In 1970, Ed Muskie was the presumptive front-runner for his party's \n1972 Presidential nomination. In that role, he was the victim of \nmalicious and false attacks.\n  Rather than counter-attack, Senator Muskie appealed for reason and \ndecency and truth. I want to quote from a televised speech he made back \nthen, because I think it bears repeating today.\n  ``In these elections * * * something has gone wrong,'' he said.\n\n       There has been name calling and deception of almost \n     unprecedented volume. Honorable men have been slandered. \n     Faithful servants of the country have had their motives \n     questioned and their patriotism doubted. . . .\n       The danger from this assault is not that a few more \n     Democrats might be defeated--the country can survive that. \n     The true danger is that the American people will have been \n     deprived of that public debate, that opportunity for fair \n     judgment, which is the heartbeat of the democratic process. \n     And that is something the country cannot afford.\n\n  Senator Muskie went on to say:\n\n       There are only two kinds of politics. They are not radical \n     or reactionary, or conservative and liberal, or even \n     Democratic or Republicans. They are only the politics of \n     fear, and the politics of trust.\n\n  Senator Muskie believed in the politics of trust.\n  And he believed in honest negotiation. Testifying before the Senate a \nfew years ago, Senator Muskie said, ``There's always a way to talk.''\n  There is always a way to talk.\n  In his later years, Senator Muskie helped found an organization \ncalled the Center for National Priorities to find new ways to talk in a \nreasoned manner about the big problems facing our nation.\n  Today, we mourn Ed Muskie's death. But let us also celebrate his \nextraordinary life. And let us re-dedicate ourselves to the beliefs \nthat shaped that life.\n  The belief that America is and must remain a land of possibilities--\nfor all of us.\n  The belief that we must protect our environment.\n  The belief that it takes more than money alone to solve our problems. \nIt takes hard work and personal responsibility, and people working \ntogether.\n  Let us rededicate ourselves to Senator Muskie's belief the politics \ncan and should be a contest of ideas, and\n\n[[Page S2997]]\n\nthat we have a responsibility to talk straight to the American people.\n  And let us remember that we have a responsibility to talk straight to \neach other. There are many great and urgent issues facing this chamber.\n  There must be a way we can talk.\n  Ed Muskie is gone. But we can keep his spirit alive in this chamber. \nThe choice is ours.\n  In closing, I offer my deepest condolences to Senator Muskie's widow, \nJane, to their children, and to his many friends the world over.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the resolution is \nagreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 234) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S2996-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2997-S3004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AGRICULTURAL MARKET TRANSITION ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it is a privilege to bring before the \nSenate H.R. 2854, the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act. \nThe farm bill that we are to pass after this debate will make the most \nsweeping changes in agricultural policy since the days of the New Deal. \nThese changes begin a new era in which markets rather than Government \nwill dominate farm decisions.\n  H.R. 2854 offers farmers more freedom to plant crops without \nGovernment constraint than they have had in decades. This legislation \nturns farm programs from an uncontrollable entitlement to a system of \nfixed and declining income-support payments. From now on, the Federal \nGovernment will stop trying to control how much food, feed, and fiber \nour Nation produces. Instead, we will trust the market for the first \ntime in a long while to direct those signals.\n  Farmers during this time will not be left unprotected in a sometimes \nunforgiving world marketplace. H.R. 2854 provides new protection \nagainst export embargoes, ensuring that the United States will be a \nreliable supplier of agricultural products. The bill also strengthens \nour successful export credit programs, placing new emphasis on high-\nvalue exports that now constitute more than half of our overseas sales.\n  Back at home in this country, where resource conservation is \nincreasingly important not only to producers but to all citizens, this \nbill offers new incentives to manage natural resources wisely. The \nEnvironmental Quality Incentive Program will share the cost of measures \nthat enhance water quality and control pollution. The Conservation \nReserve Program will be renewed through the year 2002, extending the \nmany environmental benefits of that historic program.\n  This legislation will require more responsible use of taxpayer money. \nFor example, until now, the Farm Services Agency has been compelled by \nlaw to make new loans to borrowers who are already delinquent. This \nbill will end that practice and other abuses of our lending programs.\n  H.R. 2854 reauthorizes food stamps and other important nutrition \nprograms. It consolidates and streamlines rural development programs. \nIt repeals dozens of outdated or unfunded Federal programs and \nrequirements.\n  The President's spokesmen have stated that the President will sign \nthis legislation with reluctance. I am not at all reluctant in my \nsupport. This is the best farm legislation I have seen in my \ncongressional career.\n  Farmers who grow so-called program crops--wheat, feed grains, upland \ncotton, and rice--will be able to sign a 7-year production flexibility \ncontract. They will receive 7 years of declining income support \npayments. These payments differ from the so-called deficiency payments \nnow made under current law because the contract payments are unrelated \nto market price levels.\n  Farmers will be required to maintain their farm in agricultural use, \nto comply with some limitations on the planting of fruits and \nvegetables and to meet conservation requirements. The Federal \nGovernment will no longer tell them how many acres to plant or \nrigorously control their planting choices. This bill deregulates U.S. \nproduction agriculture.\n  As we approach the day when this bill will become law, I wish to \nsalute the ranking Democratic member of the Agriculture Committee, \nSenator Patrick Leahy of Vermont. When he was chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee, I worked with him in a bipartisan way whenever I \ncould. He has extended the same courtesy to me. H.R. 2854 is a better \nbill because of that partnership.\n  At the same time, I also want to praise the chairman of the House \nAgriculture Committee, Mr. Pat Roberts of Kansas. His tenacity led to \nreforms that a short time ago were clearly unthinkable.\n  However, those who most deserve this salute are the agriculture \nproducers of the country that we all serve. They are the reason this \nNation exceeds all others in the productivity of our agriculture system \nand in the abundance of our food supply. I am proud to be one of them. \nThey deserve a Government that stands behind them without standing in \ntheir way. They want a farm bill that is designed for the new century. \nWe have given that to them. That is what this bill represents. It \nheralds a future of opportunities, a future not without risk but full \nof challenge, and a future in which American farmers can compete, \nexcel, and prosper.\n  Mr. President, the FAIR Act is, in fact, good for farmers for these \nreasons. First of all, flexibility. Under the FAIR Act, the act that we \nare debating this evening, farmers will be able to plant the mix of \ncrops that best suits their climate, agronomic conditions, and market \nopportunities. That is extremely important. That is at the heart of \nthis bill.\n  The United States stands at a remarkable point in history in which we \nhave opportunities to supply markets all over the world if we are \ncapable of fulfilling demand. Indeed, we will be more capable under \nthis legislation. The opportunities for farmers to make money under the \nFAIR Act have never been better. That is a major reason why farmers \nsupport this legislation.\n  Simplicity: Farmers can enter into a 7-year contract and, in many \ncases, will not need to visit the United States Department of \nAgriculture again. Much of the endless rulemaking and many of the \ncostly regulations that accompany today's farm programs will be \neliminated. Certainly, farmers will know all the program parameters and \nthe payment rates for the next 7 years at the time of signing. That \nsigning, Mr. President, will occur in the 45 days following signature \nof this legislation by the President of the United States.\n  Under current programs, payment rates often change after program \nsignup, and payments in future years are unknown. A known stream of \npayments, guaranteed by this legislation, will provide certainty to \nfarm lending and all manner of farm business decisions.\n  Let me mention the factor of opportunity. Farmers will be able to \nadjust planting decisions to take advantage of market opportunities as \nthey occur. Current programs force farmers to follow old planting \npatterns and U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations rather than \nprofit opportunities.\n  Let me mention profitability. According to the Food and Agricultural \nPolicy Research Institute, under FAIR, the act that we are discussing \ntonight, gross farm income will expand by 13 percent; net farm income \nwill expand by 27 percent over the next 10 years. This occurs while \nGovernment payments to farmers decline by 21 percent during that period \nof time.\n  Growth: Farmers will be able to adjust plantings and take advantage \nof growth in the high-value processed product markets. Current programs \noften force farmers to limit plantings and plan for stagnant low-value \nbulk markets in order to qualify for the payments under the current \nprograms.\n  The legislation that we are talking about is a revolution of \nconsequence, perhaps the greatest in 60 years. I say that, Mr. \nPresident, because we are now in a situation in which the market-\ndistorting target price system is replaced by one of certainty to \nfarmers--but also to taxpayers, also to budget writers.\n  Let me explain for just a moment, Mr. President, how this works. In \nthe\n\n[[Page S2998]]\n\npast, we estimated in the last farm bill--a 5-year farm bill, as \nopposed to the 7-year bill in front of us today--that the cost of this \nin terms of the outlays for the program crops of corn, wheat, cotton, \nand rice, would be $41 billion, or a little over $8 billion a year for \nthose crop deficiency payments. But, in fact, Mr. President, it turned \nout that the bill cost $57 billion--$16 billion more. Taxpayers have \nasked Members of the House and Senate, ``How could you have missed the \nmark and estimated $41 billion, and it came out $57 billion?''\n  Well, Mr. President, the weather intervened, and various other \nlegislative emergencies intervened. All sorts of things intervened. \nThey always do in agriculture, given world conditions. Mr. President, \nwe went out confidently from the last farm bill discussion in 1990 with \na $41 billion item in mind, and it turned out to be $57 billion.\n  In this particular case, Mr. President, we define precisely the \ndollars that are going to be spent for these programs at the beginning, \nand they decline each year for 7 years. They are known to Congressmen \nand the press, and they are known to farmers at the time of signup. The \nfarmer signs a contract and knows exactly what the payments are going \nto be for 7 years if he or she continues to farm, makes agricultural \nuse of that land, complies with conservation requirements, and does not \nplant fruits or vegetables. Those are the only stipulations. That is a \nlarge difference, as I mentioned before. Having signed up, that is the \nlast visit the farmer may need to pay to the CFSA office, or any other \nUSDA office. That is a big change in the life of agricultural America.\n  Let me simply point out that the Government will no longer tell \nfarmers which crops to plant. I have mentioned that before, but let me \nhighlight that again.\n  Since the time that my father, Marvin Lugar, who was farming in \nMarion County, IN, in the 1930's, was forced to destroy a portion of \nhis corn crop and a good part of the hogs that he had on the farm, \nunder what were supply and control dictates of the New Deal--and I will \njust explain that again, Mr. President. The thought then was that if \nyou left farmers to their own devices, they would always produce too \nmuch corn, too many hogs, too much of everything and that, in essence, \nsupply would be overwhelming and the price would go down and farmers \nwould fail. Therefore, the philosophy of the 1930's was that you have \nto control these farmers, you have to dictate what they can do and how \nmuch of it is permissible.\n  That has been our policy for the last 60 years. I must say, Mr. \nPresident, there is still, as farmers approach this bill, a certain \namount of anxiety. If you have been in that straitjacket for 60 years, \neven if you did not like it, and you rebelled against the Federal \nGovernment and you gave speeches about how Washington ought to stop \nmeddling in farming and you stood up at the county Farm Bureau and \nsaid, ``I want to get rid of the Federal Government altogether,'' \nstill, when the moment of truth often came, people said, ``Where is the \nsafety net?'' And will, in fact, people produce too much if there are \nno limitations?\n  One of the great ironies, as we approached this farm bill and debated \nit throughout 1995, and now into 1996, was that in 1994, we had a \ngreat, enormous corn crop in the country--10 billion bushels. Arguably, \nthat is the first or second largest crop in the history of the country. \nImmediately, agricultural economists--including those of the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture--said we have to control this situation or \nthe price of corn will plummet given this overhang of supply. And so \nthey did. As a corn farmer, I experienced this on my farm, the same one \nI inherited from my father, Marvin Lugar, whom I cited. In my \ngeneration, in 1995, I was told I could not plant 7.5 percent of my \nnormal corn historical acreage, to literally lay it aside--nothing \nthere--in order to qualify for the farm program. Farmers were told that \nall over the country, deliberately, as Government policy. We curtailed \n7.5 percent of the acreage of corn that normally would have been \nplanted.\n  Well, Mr. President, USDA was dead wrong. The year 1995 brought \nunparalleled demand in this country. People were feeding livestock \naround the world with our corn. It also brought demand for our soybeans \nand for our wheat and, in many months, for our cotton. The whole \nsituation in China changed remarkably. We debate these issues as if the \nonly thing that counts is our domestic economy. But we know, as a \nmatter of fact, that the foreign policy implications for agriculture \nare profound, and the most profound one in 1995 was that the Chinese no \nlonger exported. They sent strong signals that they would be importers. \nThe markets they were servicing became importers from us.\n  So, as a result, Mr. President, as we have this debate this evening, \nthe price of corn is approaching historical all-time highs, largely \nbecause the carryover from the 1995 crop, which was a short one, as it \nturned out, aided and abetted by a deliberate decision of the USDA to \ncut corn plantings, turned up short. The price of corn is approaching \n$4 a bushel.\n  In the past, we had big arguments on the floor, whether it be that \nthe target price of $2.75 was too high--but that is not even in play, \nMr. President. The price of corn right now is in the $3.80's, $3.90's. \nThere are elevators all over this country--as a matter of fact, Mr. \nPresident, if you were a corn farmer, you could sell your entire crop \nthat you do not even have in the ground yet for something well above \nthe target price; namely, the price that is used to establish the \ndeficiency payment, the subsidy for corn. You could sell it all. You \ncould even reach ahead another year and sell that crop, if you were \nconfident of the number of bushels that you could produce. That is what \nmarket signals are all about.\n  Mr. President, I have no doubt that during the course of this debate, \nSenators will come on the floor, being unacquainted with agricultural \neconomics, and not having any corn of their own in the situation, and \nwill talk about the ``destruction of the family farm,'' and about a \ndecline of income.\n  Mr. President, I hope that, as an antidote for those arguments, \nSenators will simply take a look at the price quoted in the newspaper \ntomorrow morning for cash corn and take a look at the futures markets \non down this trail. They will notice a very substantial situation in \nour country for people who are farmers and who understand markets and \nwho understand what we are about.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that it is so important that we adopt \nthis idea of looking toward markets. This hallmark of the bill really \nmust be preserved. It is integral to the change that must occur if \nthose of us who are farmers are to thrive in this coming economy.\n  Mr. President, I come before this body, as all Members know, as one \nwho has 604 acres of land--about 250 acres, average, in corn; about 200 \nacres, average, in soybeans, each year. It is not a hobby farm. It is a \nproductive farm, a profitable farm. It is a farm that has made a profit \nfor many, many years. I come to this debate not as someone who is \narguing on behalf of constituents entirely--although my constituents \nproduce a lot of corn and beans in Indiana--but as somebody who has \nactually filled out the forms every year, who has had to comply with \nthe rules of the game, who understands how farms might be more \nprofitable, who attends every meeting of the Indiana Farm Bureau \nannually and, in the counties, talks to farmers to understand precisely \nwhat is at hand.\n  And I say, Mr. President, after 20 years in this body of debating \nfarm legislation, this is the first time that I can go home to Indiana \nand say the future of agriculture is bright. We have an opportunity in \nterms of our upside potential for something magnificent for our \ngeneration of farming for those to whom we pass it along. I think that \nis critically important.\n  Mr. President, while we have tried to deal with this basic issue of \nfreedom to farm we have also in both the House and the Senate attempted \nto deal meticulously with issues that are of importance to farmers all \nover this country county by county and locale by locale.\n  In the conference between the House and the Senate, staff identified \nclose to 500 items in disagreement. In some cases the disagreement came \nbecause one House or the other did not even mention the item and, \ntherefore, it was\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\nnew and we had to try to resolve it. But there was common interest. In \nthe course of 2 days, Mr. President, because of the urgency of this \nlegislation, Members resolved all of these issues.\n  This is why we were able to come tonight. The hour is late and we \nwill not complete our work until tomorrow. But I want to give hope to \nfarmers that tomorrow will be the day in the Senate in which freedom to \nfarm comes to pass because that will be a great day for agriculture in \nthis country.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to lay before the Senate tonight the \nessence of this legislation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The distinguished Democratic \nleader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Senator Leahy, the ranking member of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, had to attend to a family emergency and \nis therefore not able to participate in the debate tonight. I know that \nI speak for the Senate, Mr. President, in wishing him well as he \nattends to his personal business, and we look forward to hearing from \nhim on this bill tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I want to take just a few moments tonight. Let me \nbegin by making a couple of general points.\n  First, let me commend the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee for his work on this effort. He and I may not \nagree on the final product. We certainly may not agree on how we ought \nto enact farm policy in this country. But I have no disagreement with \nhim in the manner with which he has conducted his responsibilities as \nchairman. He is an extraordinary leader and a Senator who has earned \nprofound respect on both sides of the aisle. And his skill and \ndiligence in shepherding this bill to the floor again demonstrates why \nhe is held in such high esteem.\n  I would like to draw attention tonight to how late in the season this \nbill is being considered. I hope that regardless of the outcome we \nwould all agree that we should never allow legislation this important \nto be considered so late in a Congress.\n  We are dealing with the 1995 farm bill in March of 1996. It is almost \nApril. There is no excuse for that.\n  I do not fault the distinguished chairman of the Committee. But I \ncertainly fault the fact that in both houses of the Congress there \nappears to have been little priority given among our Republican \ncolleagues to get this legislation to the floor in time to allow us to \nadequately consider all of these very controversial issues or in time \nto provide more certainty to farmers than they have been given.\n  There is no excuse for this delay. This legislation should have been \npassed--or at least considered--at a much earlier date.\n  I also take issue with the title ``Freedom to Farm.'' Farmers have \nhad the freedom to farm--to do whatever they wish--for decades.\n  There is no requirement that farmers sign up for the farm bill. They \nare not compelled to live under the confines of whatever farm \nlegislation we pass.\n\n  In every farm bill passed since legislation of this kind was enacted \nfarmers have had the freedom to farm. Regardless of what happens to \nthis legislation, they will continue to have the freedom to farm.\n  Permanent law guaranteed the freedom to farm. If people did not want \nto be required to comply with the regulations and the legislation as it \nwas enacted, they had the right not to do so. There was no requirement.\n  So now those who have opposed farm programs are saying to farmers, \nyou do not have the right to advantage yourself under farm legislation \nat the end of 7 years because we are going to take away your options \nwith regard to freedom to farm or anything else. We are going to phase \nout the partnership the government has had with agriculture. I believe \nthat is something that merits a great deal of debate. We ought to be \ndiscussing with a lot more care.\n  Regardless of whether or not this legislation passes--I assume it \nwill--I have every expectation we will be back again next year dealing \nwith this issue of the phaseout of farm programs.\n  I come to the floor tonight with the realization that there are some \ngood things in the bill. I want to address those briefly. But first \nthere are a number of things I find to be most difficult to accept, \nmost problematic as I consider the advantages and disadvantages of this \nlegislation.\n  Perhaps the most significant disadvantage I find in the legislation \nbefore us tonight is that it fails to provide the safety net we have \nalways guaranteed farmers in those times when they found themselves in \nextraordinary circumstances, whether they be economic or natural.\n  Loan rates are capped. There is no opportunity for loan rates to go \nup. We all know what an important financial and economic tool the loan \nrate system has been in farm legislation for a long time. There is no \nopportunity now for loan rates to go up. They can go down. They will \nnever go up.\n  The opportunity we provided farmers to store their own grain on their \nown farms--the freedom to store their own grain, if you will--is now \ndenied farmers. The farmer-owned reserve has been eliminated. Why that \nis the case I am not sure. Why we do not give farmers the freedom to \nfarm when it comes to storing their own grain is something that I will \nleave to others to explain.\n  We have eliminated the Emergency Livestock Feed Program. South Dakota \nhad 10 inches of snow this weekend. Everything was shut down, while \nlivestock producers are calving all through my State. The Livestock \nFeed Program is an extraordinarily important tool in times of disaster. \nThis may not qualify. But there have been times just like this when it \ndid, and farmers availed themselves of the Emergency Livestock Feed \nProgram. But as a result of the passage of this legislation it is no \nmore.\n  There is some flexibility but not for all. Vegetable producers are \ntreated differently. Supposedly there is a signal from the market--not \nthe Government. But I must say there is not a freedom to farm in all \ncases. Potato producers are not given the freedom to farm. Other \nproducers that are still working under many of the same constraints \nthey have had to work under in past years, and they are going to \ncontinue to be confronted with constraints in the future. We do not \nhave the freedom to farm in all cases for all commodities under this \nlegislation. So let no one be misled in that regard.\n  The deficit increases the first 2 years under this legislation by $4 \nbillion--$4 billion in increased costs to the Federal Treasury. In \nlarge measure the reason for that is very simple. We will be paying \nfarmers regardless of price. We will see record prices for wheat, \nperhaps record prices for corn, and we may actually also see record \npayments from the Federal Government to the same producers.\n  The ultimate effect of that will be very simple--somebody is going to \npay. The taxpayers could be billed more than $4 billion in the next 2 \nyears alone as a result of that.\n  Research programs are shortchanged. As one who had the good fortune \nto chair the research subcommittee in past Congresses, I am very \nconcerned about sending exactly the wrong message on research--to say 2 \nyears from now we will decide it is not enough. Research programs take \nlonger than that. The clear blueprint we must lay out through research \non what we intend to do in agricultural production, especially on the \napplied side of research, needs to be addressed. So to say that for \nsome reason we will deal with that later, we will deal with that in a \nyear or two, is just unacceptable.\n\n  Nutrition programs also are treated in the same manner. Food stamps, \nas everyone now knows, will only be reauthorized for 2 years in a 7-\nyear bill. We are going to pay farmers for 7 years whether or not the \nprice is warranted, but people on food stamps will only have the \ncertainty of getting whatever assistance we can provide in this \nlegislation for 24 months. After that, who knows. We did not say that \nabout farmers, but we are going to say that about recipients of food \nstamps. You have kids out there who are getting less consideration than \nproducers who may not even plant a crop.\n  Finally, Mr. President, of all the flaws, the one that I have alluded \nto in a couple of my comments tonight, the fact that producers, \nregardless of price, regardless of need, regardless of production, will \nreceive a payment is something that I think is just unconscionable. We \nshould not be in the business of doing that. It will come back to haunt \nus. It will come back to undermine the credibility of farm programs in \nthe long run.\n\n[[Page S3000]]\n\n  Nobody ought to be misled about that. It is wrong. Call it what you \nwill--a transition payment, a deficiency payment--it is a welfare \npayment. It is wrong. Farmers are not comfortable with that. I do not \nblame them for rolling the dice, taking this legislation, with every \nexpectation that Congress will come back at some point with clearer \nheads and a much better understanding of the importance of the \npartnership between our Government and our agricultural industry and \nrecognize that some continuation of farm programs is necessary.\n  So if I were a farmer, I would say, ``Well, look, if I am going to \nget a good price and I am also going to get a good payment, why not \ntake it? Why not accept it?''\n  If I were a farmer, as pressed as they are today, I would take it, \ntoo. I would not argue against it. But that does not make it right. \nEconomically and financially, it is right for every farmer. If they \nhave the chance legally to do it, they should do it. But as \npolicymakers, it is not right for us, if we are providing huge payments \nto farmers at times when farm prices are as high as they are.\n  So, Mr. President, for all those reasons, I intend to oppose this \nlegislation. I will vote against it tomorrow. I hope that we will come \nback and recognize that we can do better than this. We need to do \nbetter than this. While that may not happen in 1996, I hope it does \nhappen early next year.\n  I commend the chairman and others for the balance they have shown in \nother areas. The fact that we continue the Conservation Reserve Program \nis a good aspect of this legislation, and I support it. I am pleased \nthat people recognize the importance and the tremendous contribution to \nconservation the CRP now has made for many years.\n  I am pleased that the Fund for Rural America has been provided for in \nthis bill, ensuring that we address the needs of rural America. One of \nthe key opportunities for us in rural areas now is the one I hope this \nlegislation provides in creating new value-added product development. \nValue-added product development is our long-term future in agriculture. \nHopefully, through the Fund for Rural America, value-added processing \nfacilities of all kinds can be considered, financed and built.\n  I also believe that the increased flexibility this legislation \nrepresents is something we ought to applaud. Simplification is \nsomething that I think is more uncertain, but I do believe the goal \nintended in this legislation to simplify our current program is \nsomething everyone supports.\n  Perhaps, of all things, retaining permanent law is one of the most \nimportant aspects of this legislation that I am very enthusiastic about \nand certainly appreciate having.\n\n  This farm bill, Mr. President, is long overdue. It did not happen in \n1995. It will now happen in 1996. 1995 is wasted. It was tied to the \nbudget--the first time this has happened since 1947. Unfortunately, it \nhas taken too long. Unfortunately, we are now at a time when farmers \nneed certainty more than ever. It is too late to start over. The winter \nwheat crop will soon be harvested. Southern crops are already in the \nground. Midwestern farmers are already beginning to plan their planting \nfor this year. They do not know what the farm programs will be until we \nenact them into law.\n  The time for action is long overdue. The President has indicated he \nwill sign the farm bill. He is forced to sign a bad bill because of the \nlate date. He, as I do, has deep concerns about the safety net and the \ndecoupling this represents. He has pledged to propose new legislation \nnext year. I believe the public will demand it in less than a year's \ntime.\n  The bottom line is we have to go back and make improvements, do a \nbetter job in a constructive way of addressing the deficiencies that I \nhave pointed out tonight. To paraphrase a famous actor in a popular \nmovie, ``We will be back.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Washington [Mr. Gorton].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has been yielded \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, the Senator from Indiana, has spent much of his \ntime over the course of the last year as a candidate for President of \nthe United States. He traveled about the country, speaking calmly, \nwithout invective, with common sense to the American people.\n  The American people in large measure did not listen to that message, \nthoughtful as it was. In his usual gracious fashion, the Senator from \nIndiana, when that became apparent, withdrew, and endorsed the \ncandidacy of our joint good friend, the majority leader of this Senate.\n  I must say that in some sense the loss of the people of the United \nStates in that candidacy directly resulted in the great gain to the \npeople of the United States in the construction of this farm bill, the \nmost dramatic change in agricultural policy since the 1930's, one of \ngreat thoughtfulness and great promise not only for our agricultural \ncommunity but for the people of the world in providing for them more \nand better food prospects.\n  So I express my deep gratitude to the Senator from Indiana for the \njob he has done for the people of the world, the people of the United \nStates, and most specifically the farmers and agricultural businesses \nof the State of Washington.\n  I cannot let this part of my remarks go without also remarking on the \nactions of the Acting President of the Senate, the Senator from Idaho. \nI believe he is the only western member of the Agriculture Committee \nwho specifically directed his attention at the needs for various \npolicies for the farm community of the Pacific Northwest. We share \nextensive wheat ranching, and his attention to the problem of those \nranchers is a matter for which I am most grateful. But particularly the \nSenator from Idaho was an eloquent advocate of the so-called Brown \namendment during the conference over the farm bill. That was an issue \nof great importance, not just to people in agriculture but to people in \ncities and towns and communities all over the West.\n\n  The President of the United States, in his State of the Union \nAddress, repeatedly spoke about a smaller and less intrusive \nGovernment. But agency after agency in his administration in \nWashington, DC, has been busily attempting to aggrandize more and more \ncontrol over the lives of the people of the United States and most \nparticularly over their lives in the West, where water is such a great \nnecessity. This aggrandizement was particularly evident as the \nadministration's Forest Service has been attempting to require water \npermit holders, some with permits more than 100 years old, in many \nWestern States literally to donate to the Forest Service a significant \nportion of their water rights as a condition for the issuance or \nreissuance of their permits.\n  Led by the Senator from Idaho, the conferees agreed at least to an \n18-month moratorium on these Forest Service demands. They agreed to \ncreate a water task force to study Federal water policy and water \nrights across Federal lands, and no later than 1 year after the \nenactment of this bill to submit recommendations to the Congress on how \nbest to resolve the controversy.\n  Obviously, I would have preferred, as the Senator from Idaho would \nhave preferred, to see language that would have permanently prohibited \nthe Forest Service from this practice. But at least this gives us \nrelief for the time being and an opportunity to take an objective look \nat these demands and to deal with them at length in the Congress later. \nSo I must say that Washington State agriculture thanks the Senator from \nIdaho for his magnificent work in that connection.\n  Overall, the 1996 farm bill is a wonderful step forward. As a member \nof the Senate Budget Committee, I am delighted it makes a contribution \ntoward a balanced budget both, as the Senator from Indiana said, in \nallowing us precisely to determine how much money will be spent with \nrespect to income support and in the promise of a significant \ncontribution toward a balanced budget within a 7-year period.\n  Even more significant is the fact that this bill is a dramatic step \ntoward a free market economy in agricultural policy. Farmers and \nranchers all across\n\n[[Page S3001]]\n\nour country have asked for freedom from Government regulation, for the \nright to farm to the market rather than to particular programs, and to \nbe able to respond to the demands of emerging world markets. No longer \nwill farmers be told by the Federal Government what crop to plant, when \nto plant it, and how much to plant. These decisions ought to belong to \nthe farmer, and now they will belong to that farmer.\n\n  One other detail: I am delighted to see the conferees agree to \nauthorize the Market Promotion Program, I believe now called the Market \nAccess Program, at $90 million. This program is vitally important to \nall agricultural exports. It is particularly important in Washington \nState. In the last decade, for example, we have seen an increase in \napple exports from 4.3 million cartons to 25.1 million cartons, an \nincrease of more than 500 percent, enriching growers in the State of \nWashington and making a real contribution to lower our trade deficit. \nThe Market Promotion Program has made a significant contribution to \nthat increase.\n  With the implementation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \nand the North American Free-Trade Agreement, we will see an increased \ndemand for agricultural exports. I believe that both will successfully \nopen new worldwide markets for United States agriculture. As a \nconsequence, we need to provide our farmers with the ability to \ndevelop, maintain, and expand commercial export markets, and the Market \nAccess Program will help us do exactly that.\n  As does the President, I believe in a smaller and less intrusive \nGovernment. The 1996 farm bill represents that less intrusive \nGovernment, a Government with faith in its farmers, its ranchers, and \nits local communities to make decisions for themselves. Simply put, \nthis farm bill puts the decisionmaking process back into the hands of \nthe farmer and gets the Federal Government significantly out of the \nbusiness of telling our farmers how to farm. I enthusiastically support \nits adoption and its transmission into the law of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes off the time \nallotted to the minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, all my life, before and during my last \nquarter of a century of continuous high service as either the Governor \nof Nebraska or the last 18 years as a Member of the U.S. Senate, having \nthe great honor of representing the great State of Nebraska, there can \nbe no question--and the record will show--that I have been an outspoken \nsupporter of farm legislation, farmers, and what is good for rural \nAmerica. With that background, I simply want to say about the farm bill \nthat will pass tomorrow, without my support--it will pass, the die is \ncast, it is all over--but we cannot allow this to go forward without \nreviewing once again many of the concerns that myself and others from \nthe Farm Belt have with regard to this legislation.\n  No. 1, if you remember back last year when we were having the budget \ndebate--and I happened to be the ranking Democrat, the lead Democrat on \nthe Budget Committee--we heard all these wonderful things about how we \nare going to take that farm program and we are going to help balance \nthe budget in the year 2002 by reducing it. There were the magnificent \nfigures bantered about as to how much we could save by the farm bill \nthat the Republican majority was going to pass.\n  Obviously, I say, as a farm supporter all my life, this conference \nreport is a sham as far as sound agricultural policy is concerned, and \nit is a sham as far as the taxpayers are concerned. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, this conference report which we will vote \non tomorrow will cost $3.2 billion more than the current law for 1996 \nand $1.4 billion more than current law in 1997. There is no savings, as \nthe chief of staff of the Republican Budget Committee has said \npublicly.\n  So if anyone thinks that this measure contributes anything to \nbalancing the budget, the opposite is true. That would not be so bad if \nwe were taking this money and applying it as a safety net. That is what \nthe farm programs have always been about, providing a safety net, not \ndishing out money to farmers for doing nothing.\n  This conference report is also a sham to farmers. The so-called 7-\nyear contract with the transition payments stick out like a sore thumb. \nIn future budget negotiations and allocations, reductions, in my view, \nare all but inevitable, when everyone finds out what this ill-advised \nbill does. Once again, let us have a thorough understanding that there \nwere those of us who offered legitimate, reasonable proposals that gave \nthe farmer all the flexibility that the farmer has under the so-called \nFreedom To Farm Act and allowed the farmers basically to plant what \nthey want and get away from all that redtape, but that was not good \nenough.\n\n  This conference report, in addition to all its other shortcomings, \ngoes right at the safety net. And the safety net, I should explain, is \nsomething that has been inherent in farm policy as long as we have had \nfarm policy, and that is to provide a safety net for family-size \nfarmers when the prices of the product that they raise, for whatever \nreason, was drastically low.\n  Those of us who understand agriculture, and I might say that there \nare people on both sides of the aisle, people who are for this program \nand people who are against it, who probably are very well-intentioned, \nbut I am very fearful that this Freedom To Farm Act, or its successor, \nwhatever you want to call it, is built around transition payments that \nare supposed to phase out in 7 years, the year 2002, when the budget is \nsupposed to be balanced.\n  There were also those of us who have advanced policies to balance the \nbudget in year 2002 with a workable farm program, which I think this \none is not. Example: The conference report retains a cap on loan rates. \nLoan rates are historically what the farmer used as his safety net. He \ncould borrow money at so much a bushel and store that commodity and \nsell it at a later date if the price went up. He had that option. Or if \nthe price stayed the same or went down, he would forfeit the crop.\n  These levels are inadequate in this bill: $1.89 for corn and $2.58 \nfor wheat. For all practical purposes, that is the end of the farmer-\nowned reserve which was always a major portion of stability and the \nsafety net that has served us, not perfectly, but well.\n  The conference report is bad particularly, I suggest, for beginning \nfarmers. Older farmers who have their land paid for will cruise toward \nretirement with a large amount of a hefty taxpayer-financed billions of \ndollars. I do not think there is any question but what we will hear \nmore and more about these welfare payments to farmers because that \nsimply is what it is. But this is only good for 7 years, we should \nunderstand.\n  This may be very good news for dad, but it sure is bad news for the \nson or daughter who may want to take over the farm after dad retires in \nthe year 2002, because then, I assure you, that when this program and \nthe cost of the program is fully explained to the people, the well will \nbe so poisoned that we will never have the votes for a workable farm \nprogram.\n  All my public life, in defending and protecting farmers and rural \nAmerica, I and others of us on both sides of the issue before the \nSenate, I might add, have fought continually to explain the need for a \nsound agricultural policy in America.\n\n  How sound is it? Pretty good. Most of the people do not understand \nthat while they might think food costs are too high, the facts of the \nmatter are, Mr. President, that the people of the United States of \nAmerica have reaped the benefits of a sound farm program. We in the \nUnited States of America have the cheapest food costs of any nation in \nthe industrialized world.\n  I simply say that this particular Freedom To Farm Act, with its hefty \npayments from taxpayers to the farmers of America, is sure not good for \nthe farmers who want to take over after that 7-year period.\n  How good is it? Well, Mr. President, there has been talk on the floor \ntonight about, I believe one speaker said this bill is a chance for a \nfarmer to make more money than ever before--I tend to agree with that--\nin many instances, maybe for doing nothing.\n  This particular measure authorizes an expenditure over 7 years of $47 \nbillion. Do you know what, Mr. President,\n\n[[Page S3002]]\n\n$36 billion of that $47 billion will go out for payments that another \nspeaker in this regard said is good, because then we will know exactly \nhow much money will be spent for price support programs. We sure do, \nand we know what it is going to be for 7 years--$37 billion.\n  That $37 billion will go out under a formula that has nothing to do \nwith what the price of the commodity is that the farmer raises. It will \nhave nothing whatsoever to do with the price that the farmers receive \nfor the products of their labor in the marketplace. He or she will be \nmaking his own decisions. But I say to you, Mr. President, I do not \nthink it is fair, I do not think it is reasonable.\n  The old farm program that a lot of people have criticized--and there \nare reasons to criticize it--the old program basically provided a \nsafety net, and we did not pay the farmers anything if they were \ngetting a fair and decent price for their product.\n  Most farmers will agree that if you are a corn farmer making $3.50 a \nbushel, you should not receive any money from the taxpayers or the \nGovernment of the United States of America. But most farmers would \nagree that if the corn would not be at $3.50 or $3.10 or $2.75, maybe \ndown to $2, certainly somewhere in that framework, should be a trigger \nmechanism that would kick in as a safety net to help the farmers when \nthey need help and not help the farmers when they do not need help.\n  Mr. President, as I said when I started out, the die is cast, and a \nweek ago when some of my colleagues who were against this bill said \nthey would request that the President veto it because it was so bad, I \nsaid I was not going to request the President to veto this farm bill. \nWe have fought the good fight. We have had a chance at least to make \nthe case that some of us very firmly believe in. But the facts of the \nmatter are, we are the latest ever in passing a farm bill, and that is \nhurting the farmers because we are in the planting season.\n  So, as bad as this bill is, I do not suggest that the President veto \nthe bill because with all of the other partisan battles that we have \ngoing on right now with regard to the budget, we could get ourselves in \nthe position where we would have the same inefficient manner of \nmanaging the farm programs as we do in managing the overall Government \nof the United States, with a series of continuing resolutions, and \nevidently we are going to have the 11th and 12th continuing resolutions \nto fund this fiscal year, and this fiscal year is already halfway over. \nPretty bad record. We should do things the right way.\n  I talked a few moments ago, Mr. President, about how I thought this \nprogram was wasteful. I cited the figures that are available with \nregard to what this is going to cost. The total cost of $47 billion; \n$36 billion of that will go directly to farmers, as another speaker \nsaid, with a chance to make more money than they ever made before.\n  I think it is wonderful. I support the concept of the marketplace. \nWhen the farmer can make a good living, an outstanding living, by \nrelying on the price of the marketplace, that is fine with me. That is \nthe way it should work. But what this particular measure overlooks is \nthat there is no safety net, and there will not be after 7 years when \nthe price goes down.\n  If I might, Mr. President--and I yield myself what additional time I \nmight need under the time reserved for the minority leader--I would \nlike to explain to the Senate just how bad this program is and how I \nthink the well will be poisoned so that we can never ever again muster \nthe votes in the House or the Senate for a workable farm program.\n  Under the freedom to farm bill, with its transition payments--let us \ntalk about what those are. I would like to give you a specific or two. \nUnder the act that was passed, let us take a 500-acre corn farm--that \nis not small; that is not big; that is probably somewhere near the \naverage--a 500-acre corn farm that has a yield of 120 acres per \nbushel--and that is not a high or a low yield; that would be somewhere \nin the middle, somewhere in the average--and the cash market price that \nthat farmer received for growing 120 bushels on a 500-acre farm, you \nmultiply that by a cash price in the marketplace of $3.10--and it is \nnear $3.40 today, so this is just an approximation--you take the 500 \nacres at 120 bushels per acre, that is 60,000 bushels, and you measure \nthat 60,000 bushels by the cash price of $3.10, Mr. President, and you \nfind that that particular farmer would have a gross cash income of \n$186,000 for 1 year. That is not net; that is gross.\n\n  Under the transition payments that are embodied in this particular \nmeasure, that same farmer would receive an additional check, which I \ncan only say is probably welfare, of $22,000 from the Government on top \nof the $186,000 of gross cash income, obviously for a gross income of \nwell over $200,000.\n  There is nothing wrong, Mr. President, with the present situation of \na good price in the marketplace for corn. But it is terribly wrong, in \nmy view, when we are trying to cut down the costs of Government and \nwhen we are attacking welfare payments that have to be cut, to \nenvision, as has been described on the floor of the U.S. Senate, that \nthese transition payments will continue regardless of what happens.\n  That means, Mr. President, that even if the farmer does not plant a \ncrop under the example that I just gave, if he did not do anything, he \nwould receive the $22,000 payment, I guess, for owning the land.\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned about this bill. I will not take \nany further time of the Senate tonight because, as I said, the die is \ncast. I will vote against this bill tomorrow for the reasons that I \nexpressed tonight. If anyone should ever be interested in the further \ndetails, I would make reference to the Congressional Record of March \n12, 1996, when this Senator went into great detail and cited background \nmaterial from many others who understand farm policy and why we are \nvoting against this measure.\n  It is bad farm policy. It is bad Government policy. But I certainly \nagree, Mr. President, that it is good for the established farmer over \nthe next 7 years. Let me put it this way: If you are a 57-year-old \nfarmer today, with your land paid for, you are going to have not only a \ngood income, but a handsome income for the next 7 years. If you are 57 \nor 58 years old, which the average farmer in the United States is \ntoday, and you accept this program, you are going to be in pretty good \nshape, I would suggest, for the next 7 years.\n  But what about the son or daughter who wants to take over the farm? \nThis measure, I emphasize once again, in my opinion, will so poison the \nwell that we might never be able to have the stability that is \nnecessary, because farming is a risky and expensive business, to \nprovide the safety net that I think is absolutely essential for the \nstability of our farms after the year 2002.\n  I do not want to be overcritical of many of my friends that I have \nworked with on farm policy for a long, long time. They may have--I am \nsure that they do have--sincere beliefs that this is a good farm \nprogram. My experience and my study of the bill indicates that that is \nnot the fact. But I also realize and recognize that the majority in the \nHouse and the majority in the Senate do not agree with me. I think the \nPresident has no option, given the late date that we are finally \ngetting around to passing a farm bill, that this measure, against my \nwishes, will become the law of the land. We will see how it works out \nfor the next 7 years. I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me say in partial response to my \ndistinguished friend from Nebraska, I appreciate his gracious comment, \neven though he is in opposition. I agree with him when he points out \nthat farmers who are 57 years of age and older will find this farm bill \nto be an exceptionally generous farm bill. That includes, as the \nSenator from Nebraska has pointed out, a large number of farmers in \nthis country.\n  As the distinguished Chair was also a farmer, I understand, this is \none of the points of concern for us in farming, the maturity of that \ngroup. But we are in agreement that this bill is good news for a \nmajority of farmers in this country who are out there and who have some \nage and have had some experience.\n  The issue the Senator from Nebraska raises is, what about their sons \nand\n\n[[Page S3003]]\n\ndaughters? What will happen to them? Here, honest Senators will \ndisagree. My own view, having four sons, and trying very hard to make \ncertain that the farm can be passed along to them, as my dad passed \nalong the farm that I now farm to me, I have a lot of optimism for \nthem.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that the income that will come to farmers \nin the next 7 years will lead to an increase in land values. I believe \nthe Lugar farm will be worth a great deal more in 7 years. I believe \nthere will be income throughout that 7-year period of time which will \nmake it even stronger than it is now. That is the legacy we pass along. \nWe do so, I think, as farmers, as Senators, as people trying to deal in \ngood farm policy.\n  Let me just point out that the Senator from Nebraska is correct that \nthe loan rate for corn at $1.89 does not change in this bill. It is \ncapped. Mr. President, we have already discussed the fact this evening \nthat the cash price of corn in some elevators around the country \napproaches $4. The Senator from Nebraska pointed out, using perhaps an \naverage price predicted for 1996, $3.10, which is well above both the \ntarget price and the loan rate. The loan rate simply is irrelevant with \nthe price of corn at $3.10 or $3.90. It does not come into play.\n  The Senator might remind me what goes up comes down, and cycles \ncurve. I understand that, Mr. President. This is one reason why a \nsafety net is pertinent. The distinguished Senator has pointed out the \nsafety net is gone, but, in fact, the safety net is alive. We are \narguing maybe about the size of it. The Senator from Nebraska gently \nreminds us the safety net is very large in the coming year, citing the \n500-acre corn farm at 120 bushels an acre and $3.10 per bushel. There \nwill be a payment to that farmer, and it does not come because of \nmarket conditions; it comes because of this bill. It comes 7 years in a \nrow because of this bill. That is quite a safety net. It is there \nbecause we are in transition, Mr. President, from whatever we have now \nto the market, to the unknown, to risk. We are mitigating that risk by \nhaving a very substantial safety net.\n  The Senator raises the correct question: What, after the safety net, \nhappens after 7 years? Mr. President, as a part of this farm bill, the \ndistinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle, pointed out this \nevening one of the things he likes best about the bill we are \nconsidering is that permanent farm law is continued.\n  That means, Mr. President, that the Agriculture Committees of the \nSenate and the House must return to this subject at some point prior to \nthe end of 7 years. The reason why maintenance of current law forces \nthat is because that law is totally irrelevant to current conditions. \nIt would be terrible legislation, wreaking great hardship on many \nfarmers. Many have felt that is why you leave it there to force the \nSenate and the House to reconsider, again and again, the pertinent \nconditions and the timely conditions.\n  So we will do that for better or worse. We will do that. We will take \na look at the conditions as they pertain before the end of 7 years are \nover.\n  Mr. President, we have had a good debate this evening, and I will not \nprolong it. I did want to make those comments as I have listened \ncarefully to my colleague.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we are finally drawing to a close on \nwhat has been an exhausting, often contentious, but extremely rewarding \n18-month process of deciding the future of American agriculture. Our \nefforts culminate today in final passage of the 1996 farm bill, \nappropriately titled the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform \nAct. Mr. President, the title of this legislation is appropriate, \nbecause I truly believe we have improved our agricultural programs, \nwhile making the reforms necessary for American farmers to compete in \nan increasingly global market. The most important aspect of this bill \nis that we have accomplished reform without jeopardizing our fragile \nrural economies in the process. As an active member of the Agriculture \nCommittee, I can attest that we have been very careful to allow for \neconomic adjustment in these communities, and have allowed our farmers \nthe opportunity to participate in the decisionmaking process. This is \nDemocracy at its finest.\n  The new farm bill is benevolent in its flexibility and in maintaining \nestablishing a traditional safety net for producers. No longer will \nfarmers in my home State of Georgia be required to simply plant for the \nprogram. These farmers can now evaluate the market conditions and plant \nthe crops that will allow them to reap the greatest profit. This \nliberation of our hardworking farmers will, I believe, also lead to \ngreater export potential as production levels for the higher-demand \nproducts will rise. The bill, most importantly, will protect farmers by \nmaintaining standard marketing loan structures while providing market \ntransition payments. This framework will promote economic stability in \nmany of our poorest counties. In addition to these basic farm programs, \nwe reauthorize important discretionary programs under the Trade, \nNutrition, Conservation, Rural Development, Research, Promotion and \nCredit titles. These programs are vital to the State of Georgia. They \nwill allow for continuing research efforts at our university system, \nwill provide nutritious meals for Georgia schoolchildren, will keep \nGeorgia soil on Georgia fields, will maintain active rural lending \nalong with an array of other integral functions. In sum, this farm bill \nis simply good for Georgia and the Nation.\n  I would like to commend my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee in \nboth the House and Senate who helped develop and guide this legislation \ncarefully through both bodies. They have performed rural America a \ngreat service. Too often, it seems, agriculture is overlooked and \ncriticized by the public, and some in Congress, who have limited \nknowledge of its importance to our national security. A strong \nagricultural sector is imperative to a strong America. We in the farm \nsector must take this message from the fields to the kitchen tables to \ncommunicate what agriculture really means to our citizens. Foremost, we \nmust challenge ourselves to build our agricultural communities through \nincreased trade and industry, and work with our farmers to develop ways \nto maximize their returns both on the farm and at the bank. This will \nbe our ultimate test over the next 7 years of this bill.\n  I would especially like to thank those producer groups in Georgia who \nwere so very helpful in our efforts to craft programs most important to \nmy State. Producer-based reforms were the key to this legislation, and \nthose in the peanut, cotton and dairy sectors were extremely helpful to \nme and my staff in these efforts. Congratulations to the University of \nGeorgia, the Georgia Farm Bureau, the Georgia Peanut Commission, the \nGeorgia Peanut Producers Association, the Georgia Milk Producers \nAssociation, the Georgia Cotton Council, the Georgia Cattlemen's \nAssociation, and the Georgia Pork Producers Association for their \ntireless efforts. While many other Georgia organizations contributed, \nthese were the people most involved with my office in this process, and \nthis is their victory. Each of these groups made the tough decisions \nnecessary to achieve the bill's budgetary savings of approximately $2 \nbillion and create more market and budget competitive programs for the \nfuture of agriculture. I have relied upon these groups' collective \ncounsel in the crafting of the 1996 farm bill and look forward to our \ncontinued work together as we confront the many new challenges \nagriculture will face in the 21st century.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this bill makes significant reforms of \nour Nation's longstanding agricultural policy. Farmers will no longer \nbe forced to plant the same crops year after year to receive \nassistance, allowing for greater crop rotation and flexibility. Farmers \nwill be able to make planting decisions which are in their own economic \ninterest.\n  I am pleased that this farm bill retains the same operating \nprovisions of the successful Marketing Loan Program which were \ncontained in current law. This program has proven to be greatly \nbeneficial for commodities such as cotton and rice. The Marketing Loan \nProgram continues to achieve the objectives of minimizing forfeitures, \nthe accumulation of stocks, and government costs while promoting \ncompetitive marketing in domestic and international markets. In order \nto maintain consistency in the operation\n\n[[Page S3004]]\n\nof this program, it is the intention of the managers of this conference \nreport that the Secretary of Agriculture extend the provisions of \ncurrent regulations governing entry into the marketing loan and \nestablishment of the repayment rate. Also, it is the intention that the \nSecretary of Agriculture continue to establish the prevailing world \nprice for upland cotton in the same manner utilized for the 1991 \nthrough 1995 crops.\n  This farm bill preserves and enhances many of our successful \nenvironmental and conservation programs. For example, the Conservation \nReserve Program is reauthorized and existing participants are eligible \nto reapply upon expiration of their contracts. The Wetlands Reserve \nProgram is reauthorized with modifications to allow for non-permanent \n30-year easements. I am very pleased that a program which I introduced \nto enhance our Nation's wildlife population was included in the \nconference agreement. The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program is a new \ncost-share program for landowners, which will promote the \nimplementation of essential management practices to improve wildlife \nhabitat.\n  Failure to pass this farm bill conference report would cause a great \ndeal of confusion and economic hardship for many of our Nation's \nfarmers. This outcome will not be acceptable for farmers, consumers or \ntaxpayers. Our farmers are ready to go to work now, but they need to \nknow what the programs are going to be so they can make rational and \nthoughtful decisions. The Government's role in providing stability and \nan orderly transition to a market economy in agriculture is very \nimportant, and our commitment to this goal can be seen in this farm \nbill conference report.\n  This farm bill ensures our commitment to protecting and building upon \nour public and private investments in agriculture and rural America. \nMr. President, it is time to act and I urge my colleagues to support \npassage of the farm bill conference report.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I point out that these Senators, Senator \nCoverdell and Senator Cochran, are distinguished members of the \nAgriculture Committee and have contributed substantially to the \nlegislation we have before the Senate.\n  I point out, Mr. President, that the CBO budget scoring for this farm \nbill for the conference agreement on H.R. 2854 comes in at a savings of \n$2.143 billion under the December 1995 CBO baseline. I simply state \nthat as a matter of fact, because there has been argument as to whether \nthere is a budget implication. I am simply pointing out there is. It is \ndown $2.1 billion, and the baseline of December, 1995, as the Chair \nknows, is significant, because that came after this abundant year of \ngood farm pricing that we have had.\n  Those farm prices meant a savings to the taxpayers of about $8 \nbillion. If we had been scoring this, as the Chair knows from his \nservice on the Budget Committee--and on this very subject, he authored \nlegislation to try to make certain savings at least were reasonable--as \nI calculate it, the savings during the year through the market were \nabout $8 billion, and $2 billion more is going to occur in this 7 \nyears. That is substantial change in terms of the budget of the United \nStates. I think that is important to introduce.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield myself off the time of the minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Indiana knows my \nhigh respect for him. We have worked together on many occasions over \nthe years. I happen to think that he was one of the better qualified \nRepublican candidates for President of the United States, and I saw the \ngentlemanly type of campaign that he ran. I was rather surprised that \nhe did not catch on more than he did, but then, gentlemen do not always \nwin.\n  We are at odds under the present bill. My point is, I want to drive \nit home once again, the Senator from Indiana indicated that the \nAgriculture Committee will monitor and look at this program as we go \ndown the road. My point is--and I might be wrong, and I hope I am--but \nthe farm program that is initiated with this freedom-to-farm act and \nthe transition payments that go therewith, will so poison the well that \neven if the Agriculture Committee of the House and Senate think changes \nshould be made, the public mood at that time will be to say, ``What are \nyou telling us? You have been giving this money away, chunks of \nbillions of dollars, whether corn is $3 a bushel or $4 a bushel, and \nnow you want to change it.''\n  The main difference of opinion on this whole matter between the \nSenator from Indiana, my friend, and myself is that I do not think the \nconcept that he is outlining, while it sounds like a better scenario to \nme than what this bill is intending to do, I am simply afraid there \nwill not be the votes in the Senate or the House to make changes that \nthe Senator from Indiana has at least indicated might be made and might \nbe recommended at some further date. That is the crux, I think, of the \ndifference between the point of view being expressed by the Senator \nfrom Indiana and the Senator from Nebraska.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask for the amount of time that remains \nunder the control of the three Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana controls 84 minutes; \nthe Democratic leader controls 138 minutes; and Senator Leahy from \nVermont controls 60 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S2997-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \nPropane Education and Research Act.\n  Mr. President, North Carolina depends heavily on the use of propane \nas an energy source. As a matter of fact, our State ranks as the sixth \nlargest consumer of propane fuel in the country--consuming over 500 \nmillion gallons in 1994 alone.\n  Propane is a low-cost energy source. For this reason, residential and \nfarm use is abundant throughout our State.\n  The propane industry has recognized that consumption is on a steady \nrise. To respond to the increased demand on the industry, producers and \nmarketers have recognized a real need to launch a research and \ndevelopment program of their own. They know that a strong research and \ndevelopment program would increase the safety of propane, create \ngreater efficiency in its use. and assist them in exploring the endless \nopportunities of new usages.\n\n[[Page S3005]]\n\n  But to truly understand propane, you must take a hard look at the \nmakeup of the industry. The industry is only 165 producers strong with \nabout 5,000 retail marketers. The resources necessary to implement a \nstrong research and development program for this industry are limited.\n  That's where the Propane Education and Efficiency Act comes into \nfocus. PERA provides the propane industry an opportunity to establish a \ncheckoff program that would collect one-tenth of one cent per gallon of \nthe wholesale cost of propane. The proceeds would go toward a fund \ndesigned for research and development, education and safety.\n  Propane is the only energy source that is not supported by Federal \nresearch dollars. This industry-financed program gives an industry with \nlimited resources the opportunity to enhance their product without \ncoming to the Federal trough for help.\n  I commend the leadership of propane industry in North Carolina and \nthe Nation as a whole for recognizing their needs and taking the \ninitiative to find a solution that will work without an increased \nburden on taxpayers.\n  As an original cosponsor of this bill, I thank Senator Domenici for \nhis willingness to introduce this important piece of legislation. I \nstand ready to assist my good friend from Arizona in any way to see \nthat this bill moves forward.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nRules and Administration, and as a proud Virginian, it is my pleasure \nto commend a fellow Virginian, Mr. John Kluge of Charlottsville, VA, \nfor his contribution to the Library of Congress.\n  Born in Chemnitz, Germany, Mr. Kluge came to America when he was 8 \nyears old and has become one of the Nation's most successful and highly \nregarded businessmen and one of its most generous humanitarians.\n  In 1990, John Kluge became the first chairman of the James Madison \nCouncil of the Library of Congress. The Madison Council, the Library's \nfirst private-sector support group in its 190-year history, plays a \nvital role in raising the visibility of the Library and promoting \nawareness and use of its collections. Its members include leaders in \nbusiness, society, and philanthropy from across the Nation who are \nknown for their commitment to education and scholarship. In its short \nhistory the Madison Council has funded over 50 programs, including \nfellowships for young scholars, publications and television programs, \npublic exhibitions, scholarly conferences, centers of excellence that \ndraw top thinkers to the Library to use and enhance its collections, a \nspecial acquisitions fund, and much more. Just recently, the council \nreached its goal of 100 founding members, set by John Kluge 6 years \nago.\n  John Kluge has been the foremost private donor in the Library's \nhistory, personally giving nearly $8 million to the Library. His \nbiggest single contribution was $5 million for the National Digital \nLibrary, which is the brainchild of the Librarian of Congress, James \nBillington. Launched in 1994 with commitments of support from the \nCongress and private donors like Mr. Kluge, the National Digital \nLibrary is providing free unique content for the information \nsuperhighway opening new gateways to education for all Americans. Other \nprojects to which John Kluge has contributed generously include the \nmagnificent Vatican Library exhibition, the Leadership Development \nProgram, an exhibition of heretofore unseen documents from the Soviet \nstate archives, and purchase of a major collection of sound recordings.\n  By personally working on behalf of the Library of Congress, arranging \nmeetings with potential supporters, giving of his own personal time, \nand bringing together an outstanding group of distinguished individuals \nwho truly care about their national library and support it with their \ntime, ideas, and financial contributions, John Kluge has made the \nMadison Council what it is today--a model of how the private sector can \nfocus its resources within a public institution and make an important \ndifference.\n  Because of John Kluge, millions more Americans know about our \nNation's great Library which Congress has built and supported for \nalmost 200 years, and they understand its importance in the history of \nour Nation.\n  John Kluge is one of the great philanthropists in America today. His \ncontributions to the Library of Congress and the Nation have been \nimmense. It is my privilege to commend him for his achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S3004-4", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3005-S3006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \ndisappointment that the Republican leadership will not allow a straight \nup-or-down vote on legislation to increase the Federal minimum wage. \nThe Congress is long overdue in acting upon legislation which would \nestablish a more realistic wage standard for the American worker and I \nwould hope that the Senate has the opportunity to express its will on \nthis matter--one so critical to working families--in the near future.\n  It would seem to me that the issue is a relatively simple one. As \nmany of my colleagues will recall, under the Bush administration, the \nSenate voted overwhelming to enact an increase similar to the one being \nproposed today. In 1989, by a vote of 89-8, the Senate approved \nlegislation which raised the minimum wage by 45 cents in 1990 and again \nin 1991 to bring it to its current level of $4.25 per hour. The \nproposal being put forth by myself and others would enact the same \nincrease--45 cents this year and another 45 cents in 1997--raising the \nminimum wage to $5.15. It is my strongly held view that such an action, \nlike that taken in the 101st Congress, would appropriately reflect the \nvalues and beliefs at the very core of our society--the idea that if \nyou work hard and play by the rules, you deserve the opportunity to get \nahead.\n  In my own State of Maryland, the city of Baltimore has been at the \nforefront of efforts to assure hard-working Marylanders receive a \ndecent living wage. Just last year, Baltimore's Mayor Kurt Schmoke \nsigned the Nation's first prevailing wage law which stipulates that all \nnew or renegotiated contracts with the city of Baltimore must provide a \nminimum wage of at least $6.10 per hour. Baltimore's ground-breaking \npublic policy initiative should serve as an example to cities across \nthe Nation and, in my view, provides an ideal model for the U.S. \nCongress.\n  As we all well know, the real value of the minimum wage has \ndeteriorated markedly since 1979. At its current level of $4.25 per \nhour, the minimum wage will fall to its lowest real value in 40 years \nif Congress fails to take action. In the late 1950's the real value of \nthe minimum wage was worth more than $5 per hour by today's standards \nand in the mid-1960's it peaked at $6.28. However, Congress' failure to \nrespond to inflation over the past 20 years has resulted in a 27-\npercent decline in the real value of the minimum wage since 1979 and a \n50-cent drop since 1991. Since April 1991, the cost of living has risen \n11 percent while the minimum wage has remained constant at $4.25.\n  The decrease in the value of the minimum wage has served to widen the \ngulf between the wealthiest and the poorest of our society. In an \neffort to offset this decline, I strongly supported President Clinton's \nexpansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit [EITC] which raised the \nincome of 15 million households--helping many rise above the poverty \nline. However, this is not enough. Even with the EITC expansion, a \nfamily of three with one full-time wage earner working year round at \nthe current minimum wage brings home $8,500 and could receive a tax \ncredit of $3,400 for a total annual income of $11,900. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office [CBO], the poverty level for a family of \nthree in the United States stands at approximately $12,557. Therefore, \nat the current minimum wage, workers can work full-time for an entire \nyear, qualify for the EITC and still fall some $657 below the poverty \nline. While the EITC is a critically important public policy initiative \nto assist low-income families, it should not be viewed as a substitute \nfor a consistent, decent wage.\n  Opponents of increasing the minimum wage frequently argue that the \ntypical minimum wage earner is a teenager simply working after school \nor on the weekends to earn a little extra spending money and that the \nGovernment should not be supplementing the incomes of this\n\n[[Page S3006]]\n\ngroup of temporary, part-time workers. The truth, however, is that more \nthan 70 percent of all minimum wage earners are adults over 19 years of \nage and the vast majority--58 percent--are women. Clearly, these are \nhard-working individuals trying to make a living and support a family \non a wage that fails to allow them to even meet the poverty standard, \nlet alone surpass it.\n  At a time when salaries of CEO's of major companies have increased by \nmore than 20 percent and the congressional leadership is talking about \ngiving tax breaks to some of the most well-off in our Nation, I find it \ncompletely unreasonable that an attempt to increase this basic standard \nfor the working poor would be resisted.\n  Some argue that the economy cannot afford an increase in the minimum \nwage; that an increase in the minimum wage would ultimately rob the \neconomy of jobs and income as businesses would be forced to pay fewer \nworkers more. This is simply not true. A close review of recent \nevidence clearly demonstrates that a reasonable increase in the minimum \nwage does not result in huge job losses. A frequently cited 1992 study \nin which Princeton economists David Card and Alan Krueger examined the \neffects of a minimum wage increase in New Jersey found ``no evidence'' \nthat a rise in New Jersey's minimum wage reduced employment \nopportunity. In fact, just the opposite was true. In comparing \nemployment trends in New Jersey with those in Pennsylvania, Card and \nKrueger found the employment trends to be stronger in New Jersey, the \nState with the higher minimum wage. Similarly, Harvard economist \nRichard Freeman found in his 1994 study that ``moderate legislated \nincreases did not reduce employment and were, if anything, associated \nwith higher employment in some locales.''\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the American economy cannot only \nafford a reasonable rise in the minimum wage, but could actually \nbenefit from such an increase. In fact, it stands to reason that more \nmoney in the pocket of the American worker means that more money is \nbeing spent and purchasing power is increased. The minimum wage \nproposal now before us would give the American worker an additional \n$1,872 in annual income. In Maryland alone, it would mean an increase \nin income for more than 131,000 workers. It may not sound like much to \nsome in this Chamber, but it can make all the difference to a family \nstruggling to heat their home, pay for groceries, or provide adequate \nhealth care for their children.\n  While economic considerations are an important aspect of this debate, \nneglecting to recognize the fundamental value of ensuring a living wage \nfor American workers would compromise principles I believe to be \nintegral to the fabric of our society. Historically, Congress has acted \nto guarantee minimum standards of decency for working Americans. \nMeasures to protect workers from unsafe and unfair working conditions \nwere enacted under the belief that, as a society, we should support a \nbasic standard of living for all Americans. It is in this spirit that \nminimum wage laws have been updated through the years.\n  As long as we in Congress fail to act, we send the message to working \nfamilies across the country that hard work and sound living are not \nenough. Nearly two-thirds of minimum wage earners are adults who are \nstruggling to achieve a decent standard of living for themselves and \ntheir families. The objective of the minimum wage is to make work pay \nwell enough to keep families out of poverty and off Government \nassistance. An hourly rate of $4.25 is not enough to cover the average \nliving expenses of a family of three. It is unthinkable that in what is \narguably the wealthiest Nation in the world, there are families out \nthere right now having to choose between food for their children and \nheat for their homes. If a family of three can barely get by on $4.25 \nan hour, how can a single mother--trying to stay off welfare--be \nexpected to be able to provide food, clothing, shelter, medical care \nand child care on the current minimum wage? Instead of maintaining \nbarriers to self-sufficiency, we should be helping to tear them down.\n  Mr. President, Americans want to work. They want to be able to \nadequately provide for themselves and their families. But they are \nworking harder for less and are becoming increasingly frustrated in the \nprocess. It is critical that we recognize the reality of minimum wage \nearners and take steps to help them rise above poverty. President \nRoosevelt once called for ``a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.'' \nThe American worker deserves no less. Many of those who supported the \nminimum wage increase in 1989 are here today and I would urge them to \njoin me in calling for vote on this important measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S3005-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3006-S3009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNITED STATES/FRANCE AVIATION RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the important \nissue of United States aviation relations with the Government of \nFrance. Although the immediate crisis concerning the upcoming schedule \nfor the summer season apparently has been resolved, I remain very \nconcerned about the state of U.S./French aviation relations.\n  As a result of France's decision in 1992 to renounce the bilateral \naviation agreement that existed between our two countries, France \ncurrently is our only major aviation trading partner with whom we do \nnot have an air service agreement. In the absence of such an agreement, \nU.S. and French carriers continue to fly between our two countries, but \nthey do so solely at the pleasure of each government and without the \nnecessary flexibility to increase or change service when market demand \nwarrants. Essentially, U.S./French air service is frozen as if the \nclock stopped in 1992.\n  In a speech before the International Aviation Club of Washington last \nmonth, I spoke at some length about the fires of air service \nliberalization burning brightly on the European continent. In hailing \nthe enormously important U.S./German open skies agreement signed \nseveral weeks ago, I noted that nearly 40 percent of U.S. travel to \nEurope will now go to or connect through open skies markets. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the speech to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Although this wave of air service liberalization \ntouches France on three of its borders, France stands seemingly \noblivious to the competitive air service forces besieging it. The fact \nof the matter is while its European neighbors are reaching out to \nembrace the future of global aviation with the enlightened view that \nthe economic benefits of an open skies relationship with the United \nStates are a two-way street, France continues to cling to the past. \nThis choice is not without significant adverse consequences for \nFrance's economy.\n  So what precisely is France's air service policy with respect to the \nUnited States? It appears that policy can be best described as \n``managed stagnation.'' In an attempt to rebalance the market share of \nstate-owned Air France vis-a-vis the highly competitive U.S. carriers, \nFrance has made the unfortunate decision to forego the tremendous air \nservice growth other European countries are experiencing in their air \nservice relationships with the United States. Ironically, some of the \nlucrative new air service opportunities European countries now enjoy \nare the direct result of traffic that France's restrictive air service \npolicy has driven away to other countries.\n  According to a recent statement by Anne-Marie Idrac, the French State \nSecretary for Transport, France ``is not any worse off'' for its \ndecision to renounce the U.S./French air service agreement. Economic \nanalysis, however, paints a far different--and quite sobering--picture. \nIn fact, this analysis shows France's policy of managed stagnation is a \nrecipe with a very bad aftertaste for the French economy. Let me \nexplain.\n  First, the adverse economic consequences of France's air service \npolicy is best illustrated by a comparison with the recent experiences \nof the Netherlands. In 1991, both the U.S./French and U.S./Dutch air \nservice markets experienced tremendous growth. Scheduled passenger \ntraffic grew 21 percent and 14 percent respectively. In 1992, however, \naviation relations with France and the Netherlands turned abruptly in \nopposite directions. Around\n\n[[Page S3007]]\n\nthe same time France renounced the U.S./French bilateral aviation \nagreement, the Netherlands opted to enter into an open skies agreement \nwith the United States.\n  What has resulted from these decisions? The U.S./Netherlands \npassenger market has grown at a rate over 10 times faster than the \nU.S./French market. Between 1992 and 1994, scheduled passenger service \nbetween the United States and the Netherlands grew 38 percent. In stark \ncontrast, France's decision to renounce the U.S. air service agreement \ncaused passenger growth in the U.S./French market to abruptly halt. \nScheduled passenger traffic in the U.S./French market grew a measly 3 \npercent during that period, compared to 21 percent in 1991 the year \nimmediately prior to renunciation.\n  The net effect of these vastly different policies also is illustrated \ndramatically by the aggregate size of both country's passenger market \nwith the United States. In 1991, the U.S./French passenger market was \n100 percent larger than the U.S./Dutch market. By 1994, it was just 60 \npercent larger. What a difference two air service policies with the \nUnited States can make!\n  Importantly, this trend of France foregoing tremendous air service \nopportunities is reflected elsewhere in Europe as well. For instance, \nbetween 1992 and 1994 scheduled passenger traffic between the United \nStates and Switzerland grew 30 percent--ten times faster than it did in \nthe French market. Amazingly, this tremendous growth does not reflect \nthe U.S./Switzerland open skies accord signed last year. As was the \ncase in the Netherlands, the U.S./Switzerland open skies agreement will \nlikely cause that rate of growth to accelerate. The more mature U.S./\nBritish air service market also experienced strong growth--10 percent--\nduring this same period.\n  Unquestionably, France has succeeded at stagnating the U.S./French \npassenger service market at a time when new transatlantic air service \nopportunities for European countries with the United States abound.\n  Second, at a time when revenue from connecting passenger traffic is \nincreasingly important, France's air service policy is drying up U.S. \nconnecting traffic at Paris' two key international gateway airports, \nParis-Charles de Gaulle and Orly. Between 1992 and 1994, connecting \ntraffic carried on U.S. airlines fell 55 percent at the Paris airports. \nLet me repeat this astonishing fact. Connecting traffic carried on U.S. \nairlines fell 55 percent at the Paris airports between 1992 and 1994.\n  Where did this connecting traffic go? One need look no further than \ncompeting airports on the European continent. During the same period, \nU.S. airline connecting traffic grew 24 percent at Frankfurt and an \nastounding 329 percent at Amsterdam's Schipol Airport! The recent U.S./\nGerman open skies agreement, as well as open skies agreements the \nUnited States signed last year with neighboring countries including \nBelgium and Switzerland, will surely cause the rate of ongoing \nconnecting passenger traffic diversion away from Paris airports to \naccelerate. In particular, I fully expect German airports will press \nFrance hard in this competition for connecting passenger traffic.\n  Third, Air France, the intended beneficiary of France's decision to \nrenounce the U.S./French air service agreement, has on-balance suffered \nas a result of France's policy of managed stagnation.\n  It is true that state-owned Air France has increased its share of the \nU.S./French market from 29 percent in 1992 to 37 percent in late 1995. \nHowever, this rebalancing of market share, which in large part resulted \nfrom U.S. carriers routing connecting passengers to international \ngateway airports in other continental European countries, has come at \nan inordinately high price.\n  As a direct result of France's decision to tear up its air service \nagreement with the United States, Air France is isolated as the only \nmajor European carrier that does not have an alliance with a U.S. \ncarrier. Quite correctly in my view, our Department of Transportation \nhas indicated it will not approve any code-sharing alliance between Air \nFrance and a U.S. carrier until France agrees to enter into a \nsufficiently liberal air service agreement with the United States.\n  What is the practical consequence for Air France? Every major \nEuropean carrier has access to feed traffic from the very lucrative \nU.S. domestic market except Air France. To make matters worse for Air \nFrance, if the United Airlines and Delta Air Lines alliances with \nEuropean carriers are granted antitrust immunity, in combination with \nthe Northwest/KLM alliance, nearly 50 percent of passenger traffic \nbetween the United States and Europe will be carried on fully \nintegrated alliances. Without a doubt, France's air service policy with \nthe United States has placed Air France at a severe competitive \ndisadvantage in the transatlantic and connecting service markets.\n  A recent paper by the Commission of the European Communities on U.S./\nE.C. aviation relations made this point well. According to the E.C., \n``the commercial advantages of strategic alliances are such that it \nwill be difficult for a major European carrier with the ambition to \nbecome (or remain) a global player, not to enter into an alliance with \na U.S. partner.'' The E.C. is absolutely correct. France's decision to \ncontinue to forgo an air service agreement with the United States is \nthreatening Air France's long-term future as a global player.\n  Mr. President, France's aviation policy with the United States is not \nonly inconsistent with the trend of air service liberalization sweeping \nEurope, it also is badly out of step with France's own domestic air \nservice policy. Earlier this year, France opened its skies to domestic \ncompetition thereby ending the virtual monopoly of Air Inter, the \ndomestic wing of Air France. This forward looking domestic policy came \nabout because France realized it needed to better position Air Inter to \ncompete next year in the deregulated intra-European air service market.\n  Unfortunately, France has failed to apply this same vision to its air \nservice policy with the United States. In marked contrast, France \ncontinues to cling to the past and it uses government restrictions to \nprotect Air France from competition in the increasingly liberalized \ntransatlantic market.\n  The huge economic costs the French economy is bearing as a direct \nresult of France's misguided air service policy with the United States \nreminds me of an editorial I read earlier this year shortly after \nThailand abandoned its economically disastrous experiment with \nrenunciation of its air service agreement with the United States. That \nJanuary 26, 1996, editorial from the Bangkok Post astutely called \nThailand's decision to renew formal aviation relations with the United \nStates ``a victory for common sense.''\n  Let me add Thailand's decision was also a victory for forward looking \neconomic policy. In condemning the economic folly of Thailand's failed \nexperiment, the Bangkok Post added ``every airline that comes here or \nincreases its frequency is investing more in the country, providing \nmore jobs, bringing more tourists. Restricting those operations \nnecessarily has the reverse effect.'' I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the editorial from the Bangkok Post to which I have referred be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying I hope France \nwill recognize its air service policy with the United States is an \neconomic failure that is exacting a very high cost in terms of lost \njobs and other commercial opportunities. To remedy this situation, I \nhope France will renew its formal aviation relations with the United \nStates by agreeing to a liberal air service agreement. As the \nCommission of the European Communities recent study on EC/US aviation \nrelations recently warned, countries such as France with a restrictive \nair service policy place themselves at great economic risk as the wave \nof air service liberalization continues to sweep across Europe.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Remarks of Senator Larry Pressler, Before the International Aviation \n               Club of Washington, DC, February 14, 1996\n\n       Bruce, thank you for your kind introduction. I am pleased \n     to join the long list of outstanding speakers who have been \n     privileged to share their views on international aviation \n     policy with this distinguished group.\n       Let me also thank the distinguished individuals who \n     graciously accepted invitations to join me at the head table \n     today. My friend\n\n[[Page S3008]]\n\n     Ambassador Chrobog and I met through our mutual love of \n     opera. We also share a belief that the economic benefits of \n     liberalized trade between nations is a two-way street. Mr. \n     Ambassador, I am pleased that our two nations are on the \n     brink of signing an open skies agreement of truly historic \n     magnitude. Such an agreement will be momentous for both \n     nations and will be a catalyst for fully liberalizing the \n     enormous U.S./E.U. air service market. In pursuing this \n     initiative, I believe Germany is providing outstanding \n     leadership for all of its European Union partners.\n       Carol and Charlie, I am also pleased you are able to be \n     here today. Carol and I share a common challenge. We each are \n     trying to make U.S. air carriers realize that good things can \n     happen to them when they work together as an industry. Robust \n     competition and long-term economic vision need not be \n     mutually exclusive. In fact, I would argue they can, and \n     indeed should, go hand-in-hand. Charlie, as you will \n     unfortunately experience firsthand, much work remains to be \n     done in this regard.\n       For Valentines Day I had considered making sugar-coated \n     remarks extolling the numerous benefits of a U.S./German open \n     skies agreement. I decided, however, to save that speech for \n     another day. The bitter sweet reality of U.S. international \n     aviation policy is that every step taken--even major leaps \n     forward such as a possible U.S./Germany open skies \n     agreement--is met by parochial infighting among our carriers. \n     Regrettably, I fully expect efforts to finalize the U.S./\n     German open skies agreement will not escape this plague.\n       Let me say that I firmly believe pernicious infighting \n     among our carriers is the single greatest barrier to the \n     United States' efforts to open and expand global air service \n     markets for U.S. carriers. It is a sad story which is played \n     out time and time again.\n       As leaders in the aviation community, I come to you today \n     with a challenge. I challenge you to broaden your vision of \n     the significance of new international air service \n     opportunities for our carriers. To me, these opportunities \n     conjure up images of tremendous trade benefits which buoy the \n     U.S. economy. I see significant economic benefits derived by \n     our airline industry and aircraft manufacturers. I think of \n     consumers benefiting by enhanced choice and competitive \n     prices. I also see new jobs for American workers and new \n     commercial opportunities for our States and communities.\n       I urge you to have the vision to look beyond which carrier \n     has positioned itself to benefit most from new international \n     air service opportunities. Simply put, I challenge you to \n     make your focus the American flag on the tail of airplanes \n     providing new service opportunities, not the name on the side \n     of the plane.\n       With that challenge in mind, let me now turn to my specific \n     remarks. Today I want to focus on exciting developments and \n     old challenges in Europe. Of course, I speak of Germany and \n     the United Kingdom respectively. However, since your last \n     three speakers discussed U.S./Japan aviation relations--a \n     subject in which I have a very keen interest--I cannot resist \n     making a few points.\n       First, I am deeply troubled the Government of Japan \n     continues to refuse to respect the beyond rights of our so-\n     called 1952 carriers. Those rights are guaranteed by the \n     U.S./Japan air service agreement. International agreements \n     between countries are sacred trusts and nothing short of full \n     compliance is acceptable.\n       Second, I am also very concerned about the Kyoto Forum \n     which the Japanese organized recently. By excluding the \n     United States and other Western country members of APEC, I \n     believe the Government of Japan acted contrary to the spirit \n     and intent of the Bogor Declaration.\n       Third, the Government of Japan's appeal for the United \n     States to ``equalize'' aviation opportunities between our \n     countries is misdirected. Market forces, not the U.S./Japan \n     air service agreement, has tilted transpacific market share \n     advantage in favor of U.S. carriers.\n       As I have said in the Senate numerous times, the disparity \n     in transpacific market share is due to the fact that Japanese \n     carriers--which labor under heavy government regulation--\n     cannot compete with our more efficient carriers whose \n     operating costs are substantially lower than their Japanese \n     counterparts. If equality of transpacific market share is \n     what the Government of Japan seeks, it should look no further \n     than to itself to take steps which will enable Japanese \n     carriers to compete more effectively with U.S. carriers. It \n     is critical we not forget that just 10 years ago, under the \n     very same bilateral agreement that the Government of Japan \n     now criticizes, Japanese carriers had a larger market share \n     on transpacific routes than U.S. competitors.\n       Fourth, complaints by the Government of Japan regarding the \n     limited Fifth Freedom opportunities of our carriers must be \n     put in proper context by considering the enormous offsetting \n     Sixth Freedom opportunities Japanese carriers are exploiting \n     between the Asia-Pacific market and the United States. Viewed \n     from this perspective, Japan's criticism is without merit. In \n     fact, I regard it as somewhat remarkable when one considers \n     it comes from a major trading partner with whom the United \n     States has a trade deficit of more than $65 billion!\n       Finally, in a floor speech on October 27th, I called on our \n     so-called MOU carriers to come forward with economic analysis \n     supporting their position that the cornerstone of our \n     negotiating strategy with Japan should be to trade away the \n     beyond rights of our 1952 carriers. Having seen no such \n     study, today I renew my call for the MOU carriers to make \n     their case with numbers, not rhetoric. I find it a bit odd \n     that MOU carriers who criticize DOT for not doing adequate \n     prenegotiation economic analysis are now pushing DOT to rush \n     into passenger talks, even though these carriers have yet to \n     provide economic analysis which supports their position.\n       Turning to Europe, let me first say that if the identity of \n     the author of Primary Colors is the best kept secret in \n     Washington, my support for an open skies agreement with \n     Germany is one of the worst. I am delighted Secretary Pena \n     and German Transport Minister Wissmann have agreed on the \n     framework for an open skies agreement between our countries. \n     I am also pleased a formal round of talks will be held in \n     Washington next week to iron out textual details. I \n     enthusiastically support swift completion of a formal U.S./\n     German open skies agreement.\n       How is it that a U.S./German open skies agreement is within \n     reach? Secretary Pena had the vision to recognize that \n     competition is always the best ally to open restrictive \n     markets. He built on the vision that President Bush and the \n     Dutch government both showed when the United States and the \n     Netherlands signed an open skies agreement in 1992. At that \n     time, it was a very bold move, one for which Jeff Shane, who \n     is here today, should be commended.\n       Jeff created a model on the European continent by which all \n     neighboring countries could see firsthand the tremendous \n     economic benefits that are produced by a liberalized aviation \n     relationship with the United States. Last year, Secretary \n     Pena built on that foundation with the nine European country \n     open skies initiative. Then, he reached out to our excellent \n     friend and great trading partner, Germany.\n       The timing could not have been better. Minister Wissmann--\n     himself a man of great vision--recognized the time was right \n     to secure for the German economy and German consumers the \n     great benefits that unquestionably would result from an open \n     skies agreement with the United States. As I said earlier, in \n     pursuing this initiative, Germany has provided outstanding \n     leadership for its partners in the European Union.\n       Before I discuss why I believe this tide of liberalization \n     will reach the shores of the United Kingdom, let me address \n     an issue that has come to my attention recently regarding the \n     framework of the U.S./German open skies agreement.\n       I understand a question has been raised about the timing of \n     when the U.S./German open skies agreement would take full \n     force relative to a final decision on an application for \n     antitrust immunity which is expected to be filed by the \n     United Airlines/Lufthansa alliance. I do not consider this to \n     be a problem. I have total confidence in Secretary Pena's \n     ability to fully and fairly discharge his statutory duty in \n     considering that application when it is filed, regardless of \n     when the agreement goes into effect. I feel compelled to add \n     I am somewhat mystified that some of our carriers continue to \n     sell Secretary Pena so short, at the same time they reap the \n     benefits from his excellent leadership in international \n     aviation policy.\n       Last week in London, Malcolm Rifkind, the U.K. Secretary of \n     State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, gave a very \n     important speech in which he advocated nothing less than \n     transatlantic free trade. He called for ``political will and \n     vision'' to bring this goal about. Pledging that ``Britain \n     will be a champion of greater economic liberalization across \n     the Atlantic,'' Minister Rifkind noted the United Kingdom has \n     been leading the way and said Britain would continue to do \n     so.\n       The United Kingdom deserves great credit as a shining \n     beacon for liberalizing trade in the U.S./E.U. market \n     generally. However, its policy in the area of transatlantic \n     air services is far out of step with the principles of free \n     trade.\n       Let me share two truly remarkable facts which dramatically \n     make my point. Last year, British Airways had a larger share \n     of the U.S./U.K. passenger market than all U.S. carriers \n     combined! Also, data shows that in terms of U.S./U.K. market \n     share, two of the top three carriers are British airlines! \n     Without question, market forces are not controlling the \n     distribution of air service opportunities between the United \n     States and Britain.\n       How will competitive forces unleashed by a U.S./German open \n     skies agreement pressure Britain to reassess its outdated \n     aviation policy which tarnishes an otherwise very impressive \n     record on liberalizing transatlantic trade? The answer lies \n     at two levels: heightened competition by continental European \n     airports for connecting passenger traffic and enhanced \n     competition by U.S. carrier alliances against British \n     airlines.\n       London always will be a popular destination for passengers \n     originating in the United States. That is not to say, \n     however, that in this era of global networks, connecting \n     passengers will continue to feel a compelling need to use \n     Heathrow rather than airports such as Amsterdam's Schipol, \n     Frankfurt or the new one planned at Berlin-Brandenburg. \n     Connecting passengers look for convenient schedules and \n     competitive fares. Due to the lack of European gateway \n     opportunities, Heathrow once was the connecting airport of \n     necessity, not choice, for passengers originating in the \n     United States. Times have changed.\n\n[[Page S3009]]\n\n       Liberalization of air service markets on the European \n     continent have created new connecting service options. \n     Evidence already clearly shows connecting traffic is being \n     diverted away from London. Statistics dramatically illustrate \n     this point. Between 1992 and 1994, connecting traffic carried \n     on U.S. airlines grew just 3 percent at Heathrow. During the \n     same period, U.S. connecting traffic grew 24 percent at \n     Frankfurt and an astounding 329 percent at Schipol! An open \n     skies agreement with Germany will greatly accelerate the rate \n     of this connecting passenger diversion.\n       These statistics are very interesting but should they \n     matter to a British policymaker? Absolutely. This trend \n     should raise serious concerns considering that last year \n     alone connecting traffic accounted for more than 1 billion \n     pounds of export earnings for the United Kingdom.\n       A U.S./German open skies agreement will also make U.S. \n     alliances with European carriers even more formidable \n     competitors in the U.S./Europe air service market. This will \n     not be a welcome development for British carriers. If the \n     United and Delta alliances are granted antitrust immunity, in \n     combination with the Northwest alliance, nearly 50 percent of \n     passenger traffic between the United States and Europe will \n     be carried on fully integrated alliances.\n       Will this pose a competitive challenge for British \n     carriers? Investors in British Airways sure thought so. \n     According to a Financial Times article last week, despite a \n     quarterly pre-tax profit of 30 percent, British Airways \n     shares fell on the news of the ``preliminary `open skies' \n     deal struck between Germany and the U.S.'' British Airways' \n     public attack on antitrust immunity last month at an ABA \n     conference also is very telling on this point. Privately, \n     British Airways has made no secret they very much covet \n     antitrust immunity for their alliance with USAir.\n       So where do we go from here? I think U.S./U.K. negotiations \n     should resume, but not on the terms of the October offer \n     which was highly conditioned and essentially allowed the \n     British to pick which U.S. carriers competed against British \n     carriers in what markets. Instead, I encourage the British to \n     come to the table with a ``bigger, bolder and braver'' \n     approach like Sir Colin Marshall, Chairman of British \n     Airways, called for last November.\n       First, to help clear the way for more ambitious \n     negotiations, I am announcing today that I plan to introduce \n     legislation to increase to 49 percent the level of \n     permissible foreign investment in U.S. airlines. I am already \n     working with the Administration to determine a formulation to \n     maximize the benefits of this tool. One thing is certain, the \n     limited, highly conditioned October offer would not trigger \n     the benefits of the bill I intend to introduce.\n       Second, I am also calling today for U.S. carriers to stop \n     being ``pennywise and pound foolish'' with respect to Fly \n     America traffic. As a taxpayer, I want the U.S. government to \n     pay the most competitive price for government travel. As a \n     policymaker, I find nothing in the legislative history of the \n     Fly America statute even suggesting Congress intended to \n     guarantee U.S. carriers a monopoly profit for government \n     travel. I see no good reason the opportunity for British \n     carriers to competitively bid through their U.S. carrier \n     partners for Fly America traffic should not be on the table \n     if British negotiators pursue a ``bigger, bolder and braver'' \n     approach.\n       Third, as far as Heathrow access is concerned, I call on \n     the British to muster up the ``political will and vision'' \n     Minister Rifkind spoke of to change the runway operations at \n     Heathrow. On this side of the Atlantic, we are constantly \n     told by the British Ministry of Transport that additional \n     Heathrow access is impossible because there are no additional \n     take-off and landing slots. What the British fail to tell us \n     is a number of U.K. airport capacity studies, including one \n     issued as recently as August 1994, have concluded the British \n     could potentially create an additional 100 daily takeoff \n     slots and an additional 100 daily departure slots at Heathrow \n     if they switched its runways to more efficient mixed-mode \n     operations.\n       I am keenly aware this is a sensitive political issue for \n     the British government. Not long after I suggested this last \n     July in London, I received a letter from the Heathrow Noise \n     Coalition politely telling me to mind my own business. One \n     thing is clear, however, the British do not have a monopoly \n     on political problems relating to Heathrow. I need not tell \n     this audience that Heathrow access is a hot button political \n     issue in the United States and, quite frankly, an issue that \n     is straining relations between our two countries.\n       Let me close by saying an open skies agreement with Germany \n     unquestionably would be the product of vision by both \n     countries. I hope the same long-term economic vision will \n     prevail in our aviation relations with the Japanese and the \n     British. Again, thank you for the opportunity to join you \n     today.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n              [From the Bangkok Post, Fri, Jan. 26, 1996]\n\n           U.S.-Thai Aviation Deal a Victory for Common Sense\n\n       After five years of going eyeball to eyeball, the US and \n     Thailand finally concluded an aviation agreement last January \n     19. Who blinked first? By all indications, Thailand. It had \n     to, the policy of getting US airlines to reduce their \n     frequencies between Northeast Asia and Thailand was working \n     so brilliantly that it had to be scrapped and reversed. After \n     all, Delta had pulled out of Thailand, both Northwest and \n     United Airlines had reduced their frequencies. Lest anyone \n     forget, that was the original intention for scrapping the \n     agreement in November 1990. When the impact of that hit the \n     tourism industry between the eyes, the backlash was \n     instantaneous. In barely four rounds of informal and formal \n     talks, an agreement materialized where about seven previous \n     rounds had all failed.\n       There are many reasons for this agreement, and the speed at \n     which it was pursued. But most important among them is that \n     it risked becoming a serious political liability for \n     Thailand's aviation negotiators who were running out of \n     reasons for maintaining their hardline stand. The blast from \n     the Association of Thai Travel Agents and its independent \n     study on the aviation industry was one facet of the mounting \n     pressure. Then there was all this talk of open-skies and \n     aviation liberalization being pursued under the ASEAN and \n     APEC umbrellas.\n       Thailand was being increasingly isolated as the US patched \n     up its aviation differences, one by one, with other Asian and \n     European countries. On the cargo front, the US-Filipino \n     aviation agreement had opened a window of opportunity for \n     Federal Express to develop Subic Bay as a regional cargo hub, \n     a move that would leave Thailand's own Global Transpak \n     project wallowing in the water. The American Society of \n     Travel Agents annual convention is to be held in Bangkok in \n     November, bringing 10,000 agents who would wonder how they \n     are supposed to promote tourism to Thailand when the tourists \n     can't fly here.\n       Moreover, the void was preventing the full consummation of \n     the United Airlines-Thai International alliance. Both of \n     Thailand's key aviation negotiators, the director-general of \n     the aviation department and the permanent secretary of the \n     ministry of communications, sit on THAI's board. By \n     continuing to stall on the agreement, they were effectively \n     hampering the progress of THAI. And soon coming to town as \n     keynote speaker of the PATA conference in April is Garry \n     Greenwald, the chairman of United Airlines who, lest anyone \n     forget, recently tongue-lashed Japan's restrictive aviation \n     policy and who would have no doubt have delivered a similar \n     riposte at Thailand's had an agreement not been reached by \n     then.\n       There was simply no way that Thailand could have won this \n     battle. But neither is this agreement a victory for the \n     United States. It is a victory for public pressure and the \n     power of the Thai tourism, industry, especially groupings \n     like the Association of Thai Travel Agents and people like \n     Anant Sirisant who had the gumption to stand up and be \n     counted, at considerable risk to himself and his own company, \n     the East-West Group. While many other operators serve on \n     committees and use their positions for personal \n     aggrandizement, Mr. Anant stuck his neck out, and won.\n       Several months ago, this newspaper, too, called Thai \n     aviation policy, ``a national outrage.'' Suddenly, things \n     began moving.\n       It has been said before, and it needs to be said again, \n     global aviation is administered by archaic and backward 50-\n     year-old rules that governments are having extreme difficult \n     dismantling. There is no logical explanation for the \n     structure any more; it's just the way it's done, especially \n     in the absence of an alternative. Every country has to take \n     its own course of action. In Thailand's case, every airline \n     that comes here or increases its frequency is investing more \n     in the country, providing more jobs, bringing more tourists. \n     Restricting those operations necessarily has the reverse \n     effect.\n       Foreign airlines serving Bangkok now need to forge stronger \n     relationships with Thai hotels and tour operators, work with \n     them, and use their political and economic strength to get \n     what they want. This approach must, under no circumstances, \n     be adversarial or aggressive, but always rational and \n     constructive. If THAI is in the dumps, and likely to remain \n     there for at least a few years as it seeks to regain its \n     erstwhile prestige, there is no reason why other airlines \n     should be hampered from raising their frequencies and \n     bringing more tourists to spend their money in Thailand.\n       The U.S.-Thai deal is a clear victory for the concept of \n     conducting the aviation business in an open and competitive \n     manner. Because no matter what happens, it should always be \n     the public that should benefit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S3006-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3009-S3010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO EDMUND S. MUSKIE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the remarkable \nlife of Edmund S. Muskie.\n  He was a great American, a true statesman, and I'm proud to say, a \ngood friend.\n  Mr. President, I am the first woman of Polish heritage ever elected \nto the Senate. Ed Muskie took great pride in my election, since we \nshared a common heritage and a common set of values. He was gracious in \nhelping me to learn the ways of the Senate. He was a\n\n[[Page S3010]]\n\nstrong mentor, and I have always been appreciative of the sound advice \nand concrete suggestions he offered to me.\n  He offered all of us a model of what a Senator should be. He stuck to \nprinciples, never afraid to take on the powers that be. He fought hard \nfor what he believed in, but he bore no grudges. Edmund Muskie \nbelieved, as I do, that programs must deliver what they promise.\n  He made change his ally, and was never wedded to the past. If what we \nhad been doing wasn't working, he fought to fix it. And he sought \nalways to build consensus, to serve as a voice of moderation and \npracticality--in keeping with his New England roots.\n  I was proud to be a national co-chair of his campaign for the \nPresidency in 1972. It still strikes me as a great injustice that this \ngood and decent man never had the opportunity to hold the highest \noffice in the land. What a wonderful President he would have been.\n  Although he never realized his dream of becoming President, his \ncontributions to our Nation were immense.\n  Edmund Muskie deserves the thanks of all Americans for his decades of \npublic service. All of us who cherish our wilderness areas owe him a \ndebt of gratitude for his steadfast defense of our environment as a \ndistinguished Senator for 21 years. He was the father of the Clean Air \nAct and the Clean Water Act. The air we breathe is cleaner and the \nwater we drink more pure because of Senator Muskie's dedication to \nenvironmental protection.\n  Those of us who care about fiscal responsibility--about making sure \nthat America's hardworking taxpayers get a dollar's worth of services \nfor a dollar's worth of taxes--owe him thanks for his stewardship of \nthe Senate Budget Committee. As Chairman of the Committee, Senator \nMuskie fought to curb excessive Federal spending, while also ensuring \nthat the Government did not turn its back on those seeking a helping \nhand.\n  We owe him thanks for his service as Secretary of State under \nPresident Carter. He undertook that important responsibility at a \ndifficult and sensitive time--while the President was working to free \nAmerican hostages being held in Iran. And he fulfilled his duties with \nhonor and wisdom.\n  Those of us who are Democrats also owe him a special debt. Virtually \nsingle-handedly he revitalized a dormant Democratic party in his \nbeloved state of Maine. He became Maine's first Democratic Governor in \n20 years.\n  Without him, the Senate might never had been honored by the service \nof our former Majority Leader, George Mitchell, and the United Nations \nmight never had benefitted from the enormous contributions of Madeline \nAlbright. He mentored them both, providing them with some of their \nfirst experiences in government.\n  Mr. President, America is a better place because of the dedicated \npublic service over many decades of Edmund S. Muskie. I thank him and \nhonor him for his service to our country.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Jane, his children and \nthe entire Muskie family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S3009-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3010-S3011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE PASSING OF WILLIAM JENNINGS DYESS\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, William Jennings Dyess, a long-time \nForeign Service officer and State Department official, passed away \nrecently at his home here in Washington. He was buried in his hometown \nof Troy, AL. An alumnus of the University of Alabama, where he received \nhis B.A. and M.A. degrees and earned a Phi Beta Kappa key, Bill Dyess \nserved for 25 years in the Foreign Service.\n  The University of Alabama National Alumni Association recently \nannounced that a scholarship endowment had been established in his \nmemory. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the announcement be \nprinted in the Record. It tells the story of a remarkable public \nservant whose achievements in his field will long serve as benchmarks \nfor those who follow him into diplomatic service.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       William Jennings Dyess Memorial Scholarship Endowment Fund\n\n       Adopted and raised by a local barber and his wife, Tommie \n     J. and Leota Mae Dyess, Billy--as he was affectionately known \n     to his friends--started a ten-year career at The Troy \n     Messenger, at age nine. He began first as a newspaper carrier \n     and progressed through the ranks, to sports editor, and \n     finally, city editor. Educated in the public schools of Troy, \n     his senior year in 1947 he edited the Troy High School \n     newspaper, which took five national honors.\n       Bill's passion for journalism found him at the University \n     of Missouri, making Phi Eta Sigma honors, but an out-of-state \n     tuition increase forced a return to his home state. Enrolling \n     at the University of Alabama to train as a political \n     scientist, he earned Phi Beta Kappa honors and graduated with \n     a B.A. in 1950 and an M.A. in 1951. Although poor eyesight \n     precluded his playing football, Bill's time at the University \n     fueled his love for the sport. A Rotary International \n     Scholarship, awarded by the Troy Chapter, took him to post-\n     graduate work at Oxford University (St. Catherine's College). \n     Later, he studied at Syracuse University's Maxwell School.\n       After college, Bill began a career that would take him far \n     away from his hometown roots in Troy. One of his first stops \n     would be a tour with U.S. Army Intelligence in Berlin from \n     1953-1956. In 1958, Bill left his Ph.D. studies at Syracuse \n     to enter the foreign service of the U.S. Department of State. \n     Serving primarily as a political officer in Belgrade, \n     Copenhagen, and Moscow, and as chief of liaison in Berlin, he \n     soon became a European specialist. In Washington, DC, he \n     served tours as both the Czech and Soviet desk officer.\n       No matter where Bill was based, his central mission was \n     meeting the Soviet challenge confronting the United States \n     and its allies. He grappled with the Soviets mostly over \n     bilateral affairs, maritime matters, and the status of a \n     divided Berlin. Persona non grata in Moscow, Foreign Minister \n     Gromyko attacked him by name before a group of U.S. Senators; \n     Moscow denied him a visa and they seriously harassed him \n     inside the Soviet Union, claiming he was an intelligence \n     agent, which was false. Bill acknowledged, ``Their real gripe \n     was that as Soviet desk officer, I knew how to make life in \n     Washington difficult for the KGB, and I did.'' In November \n     1974, Bill escorted Lithuanian-American Seaman Simus Kudirka \n     and his family to freedom.\n       Bill left Soviet affairs in late 1975, ``partly in order to \n     lift my nose from the US-USSR bilateral grindstone and to see \n     better the issues worldwide,'' he said. He then served as \n     Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, and in 1980, \n     was appointed by President Carter as Assistant Secretary of \n     State and later as interim spokesman. Drawing on his Soviet \n     expertise, Dyess delivered dozens of talks before diverse \n     audiences, using these occasions not merely to present \n     Department views on such issues as nuclear deterrents, the \n     grain embargo, and SALT (Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty) \n     but also ``to listen closely to what American citizens where \n     saying. The State Department has learned that any foreign \n     policy that lacks broad public support cannot be long \n     sustained.''\n       Over the years, Bill's duties frequently brought him into \n     contact with the U.S. Congress, where his work on inter-\n     agency committees made him well-known in the executive levels \n     of government. He received the State Department's Superior \n     Honor Award and Meritorious Honor Award. White House contacts \n     extended over several Republican and Democratic \n     administrations and in 1981, President Reagan appointed Bill \n     as Ambassador to The Netherlands.\n       As Ambassador, Bill was responsible for every phase of U.S-\n     Dutch relations, including military installations. He was \n     credited with persuading Dutch officials and Parliamentarians \n     to reexamine their positions on fulfilling NATO goals after \n     the peace movement's protests stirred strong public anti-\n     American sentiment. Bill enjoyed strong ties with the Dutch \n     business community, then the largest direct investor in the \n     U.S. from abroad. Before his retirement in 1983, The \n     Netherlands awarded him the Grand Cross in the Order of \n     Orange-Nassau, the highest decoration given to foreigners.\n       For Bill, retirement from government service meant another \n     exciting beginning as he started his own consulting business, \n     WmDyess Associates, Inc., in Washington, DC. Clients--he did \n     not work for foreign governments--were in publishing, \n     manufacturing, shipping and oil explorations.\n       Aside from running his own business, Bill was able to \n     devote much of his time to the alumni activities of both \n     Oxford University and the University of Alabama. He was \n     particularly active with his local Alabama alumni chapter, \n     the National Capital Chapter, where he promoted scholarship \n     fundraising events. Serving as honorary scholarship chairman, \n     on one such occasion, he organized a scholarship dinner for \n     former University of Alabama President Dr. Frank Rose. On \n     another occasion, Bill brought in Pulitzer Prize winner, Dr. \n     Edward O. Wilson. Bill was a generous contributor of his time \n     and money to the Alumni Associations' efforts.\n       An avid college football fan, Bill was a loyal supporter of \n     the Alabama Crimson Tide. He read a book a week and was \n     devoted to the subject of astrophysics. Bill was fluent in \n     German, Russian, and Serbo-Croatian.\n       After a long bout with prostate cancer, at 66, Bill passed \n     away on January 6, 1996 at his home in Washington, DC, and \n     was buried with full military honors at Green Hills Cemetery \n     in Troy, Alabama, next to his parents. His son, Chandler, and \n     his beloved Jack Russell terrier, Pistol Ball, live in \n     Washington, DC.\n\n[[Page S3011]]\n\n       In memory of Bill's dedication to public service, his \n     friends, with his family's support, have established a \n     scholarship endowment at the University of Alabama National \n     Alumni Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S3010-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3011-S3012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NEAL BERTE'S 20 YEARS AT BIRMINGHAM-SOUTHERN COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Dr. Neal R. Berte recently celebrated his \n20th year as president of my undergraduate alma mater, Birmingham-\nSouthern College. He has been, and continues to be, an outstanding \nspokesman, administrator, and scholarly leader of one of the Nation's \nvery best liberal arts colleges.\n  A native of Ohio, Dr. Berte and his wife, Anne, have four grown \nchildren and two grandchildren. He obtained his bachelor's, master's, \nand doctoral degrees all at the University of Cincinnati. A member of \nPhi Beta Kappa honor society, he also holds honorary doctoral degrees \nfrom Birmingham-Southern and Cincinnati. He served as an associate \nprofessor at the University of Alabama from 1970 through 1974 and as \nthe university's vice president for educational development from 1974 \nuntil 1976. He also served as dean of the university's New College from \n1970 until 1976 when, on February 1, he became president of Birmingham-\nSouthern College.\n  Dr. Berte is recognized as one of the most accomplished, successful \neducational professionals of our time. Under his stewardship, \nBirmingham-Southern's endowment has increased from $14 million to $82 \nmillion and its student population, made up of some of the brightest \nhigh school graduates in the State and Nation, has more than doubled. \nAcceptance of its graduates to medical and law schools is among the \nhighest in the South and its outstanding faculty has increased by 66 \npercent during his tenure as president. He has also overseen the \nconstruction of eight new campus buildings.\n  The campus of Birmingham-Southern, known as The Hilltop, has an \natmosphere of learning and of intellectual achievement. This atmosphere \nis reflected in the fact that the school is consistently recognized as \none of the top national liberal arts colleges by such prestigious \npublications as U.S News and World Report, National Review, Money \nMagazine, the Insider's Guide to the Colleges, Southern Magazine, and \nthe Princeton Review.\n  The National Review's College Guide has said, ``An ambiance of \ngraciousness, a tradition of academic excellence, and close student-\nfaculty relations have made Birmingham-Southern College one of the \nstandout liberal arts colleges in the South * * * '' U.S. News calls it \na ``  * * * trailblazer for higher education of the future.'' These \nkinds of accolades are a direct reflection of the school president's \nstrong commitment, total dedication, and superb leadership skills.\n  Birmingham-Southern College's graduates of all ages speak often of \nthe deep pride and affection they have for their alma mater. Indeed, \nthe school enjoys an uncommonly strong level of support among its loyal \nand generous alumni. Even those of us who were students there long \nbefore Dr. Berte's arrival 20 years ago have enjoyed a renewed sense of \npride in Birmingham-Southern since he became president.\n  Birmingham-Southern does not have a football program, but its \nbasketball team has won two National Association of Intercollegiate \nAthletics [NAIA] championships in the past 7 years, most recently in \n1995. Its baseball team has advanced to the NAIA World Series on three \noccasions.\n  Dr. Berte's many honors and awards include his induction into the \nAlabama Academy of Honor; his selection as Birmingham's Citizen of the \nYear; his selection as one of the 100 Most Effective College Presidents \nby the Council for Advancement and Support of Education; and his \nrecognition as one of America's Leaders in Higher Education by the \nAmerican Council on Education.\n  Birmingham's morning newspaper, the Post-Herald, carried a front-page \nfeature on his life and career on February 6 and an editorial on his \ntenure at Birmingham-Southern the next day. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of these articles be printed in the Record.\n  I want to commend and congratulate Dr. Neal Berte for his impeccable \nleadership, clear vision, and total dedication to the field of higher \neducation in general and to Birmingham-Southern in particular. As a \nproud alumnus of the college, I have no doubt that his next 20 years \nthere will be just as productive and vibrant as his first. It could not \nbe in more capable hands.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\n            [From the Birmingham Post-Herald, Feb. 6, 1996]\n\n                    Berte Looks to the Future at BSC\n\n                         (By Michaelle Chapman)\n\n       When you ask Neal R. Berte about his future, expect him to \n     talk about his goals for Birmingham-Southern College.\n       Berte celebrated his 20th anniversary as president there \n     Thursday.\n       He has had plenty of opportunities to go elsewhere but \n     said, ``I feel sort of content.''\n       That's not to say Berte has no goals for the small liberal \n     arts school he helped build into one of the best of its kind \n     in the nation.\n       But he really can't envision a job offer good enough to \n     persuade him to leave the Hilltop and the city he has come to \n     call home.\n       At 55, Berte is a slim and energetic man who puts those in \n     his company at ease with his friendly but earnest manner.\n       While many college presidents confine their interests to \n     campus, Berte's voice is heard far beyond the gates of \n     Birmingham-Southern.\n       Berte is an example to his students, whom he expects to get \n     involved in the community.\n       He's chairman of Leadership Birmingham and the Birmingham \n     Business Leadership Group, made up of the chief executive \n     officers of 45 of Birmingham's largest businesses.\n       His past positions have included chairman of the Birmingham \n     Area Chamber of Commerce and campaign chairman and president \n     of the United Way of Central Alabama. He's also been \n     Birmingham's Citizen of the Year and been inducted into the \n     city's Distinguished Gallery of Honor.\n       Birmingham-Southern students follow in Berte's footsteps in \n     their amount of community involvement. ``Every year, over \n     half of our students and faculty are out in service to \n     others,'' Berte said.\n       ``We've been here long enough that I've seen them go out \n     and make a difference in terms of their careers but also make \n     a difference as far as their civic involvements, in the life \n     of the communities where they live, in the life of their \n     churches.''\n       Berte said he gets to know the names of most students. ``We \n     work at trying to treat each student as an individual. . . . \n     I think somehow knowing someone's name does make a \n     difference, so I work at it,'' he said.\n       Students who get up early to exercise can find Berte in the \n     college's old gym at 6 a.m. either running or doing weight \n     training. He's in his office by about 8:15 a.m. and spends \n     many evenings at on-campus functions or events around town.\n       Ed LaMonte, a Birmingham-Southern professor who is on leave \n     while serving as interim superintendent of Birmingham \n     schools, said Berte is an excellent example of leadership.\n       ``He has simply stepped forward time after time to play a \n     very important role in what is in the best interest of the \n     city. ... He has, on occasions, played a role that has cost \n     the college a bit in terms of support but has served the \n     community well,'' LaMonte said.\n       ``He's the personification of the word `leader,' '' said \n     Don Newton, president of the Chamber of Commerce. ``I have \n     never seen him tackle anything that he didn't complete the \n     task.''\n       Herbert A. Sklenar, chairman of the Birmingham-Southern \n     Board of Trustees, believes Berte's involvement in the \n     community is part of the reason why the school is doing so \n     well.\n       ``He took an institution that had a great tradition and \n     history but was faltering somewhat and has turned it around \n     and, by all kinds of measurements, turned it into a \n     success,'' Sklenar said.\n       Twenty years ago, Berte said, ``There were some large \n     problems . . . that probably were reflective of many colleges \n     and universities across the country. . . . We had a declining \n     enrollment. We were operating on a deficit budget. I think \n     it's fair to say the general public did not have a real \n     positive attitude about the value of liberal arts \n     education.''\n       But the trustees were committed, the faculty was \n     outstanding and the students were capable, he said.\n       Berte pulled all those forces together and began improving \n     the school, which had abut 827 students. Today, 1,562 \n     students are enrolled at Birmingham-Southern.\n       Other things are changing at Birmingham-Southern as well--\n     much of it as part of the Toward the 21st Century Campaign, a \n     $64 million fundraising effort that began last May. Pledges \n     for $46 million have been received so far.\n       Berte is proud that the endowment has grown to $82.2 \n     million from $14 million.\n       In the past few years, Birmingham-Southern has gotten \n     considerable national recognition from magazines, \n     publications and foundations that rate colleges and \n     universities.\n       ``That is good for Birmingham-Southern . . . but I'd like \n     to believe it also is good for Birmingham and for Alabama,'' \n     Berte said.\n\n[[Page S3012]]\n\n\n\n            [From the Birmingham Post-Herald, Feb. 7, 1996]\n\n                         20 Years of Leadership\n\n       Twenty years ago, the future looked dim for many small, \n     private liberal arts colleges. Declining enrollments and \n     troubled financial conditions forced many such schools out of \n     existence. Others survived by abandoning much of their \n     distinctiveness through merger into other colleges and \n     universities or becoming taxpayer-funded institutions. People \n     were even questioning whether a liberal arts education still \n     had any value.\n       Among the colleges in trouble was Birmingham-Southern \n     College. Enrollment was down significantly, the college had a \n     budgetary deficit and the college presidency had changed \n     hands several times in a very short period.\n       Then, on Feb. 1, 1976, Neal Berte became college president. \n     Under his leadership, the Methodist institution enhanced what \n     were still strong academic programs, rebuilt its finances and \n     reversed the erosion of a tradition of community involvement.\n       If Berte had done nothing more in the past 20 years than \n     restore Birmingham-Southern's standing as one of the best \n     liberal arts colleges in this part of the country, he would \n     deserve high praise. But as anybody who follows public life \n     in this community must know, he has done much more.\n       There is hardly a facet of civic life that has not been \n     affected--for the better--by Berte. He holds or has held \n     chairmanships in several organizations. But even more \n     important has been his ability to bring other leaders and \n     potential leaders together in ways that improve Birmingham \n     for all of us. He has been a much-needed catalyst for change.\n       Anybody seeking an example of what being a leader means \n     need look no farther than the Birmingham-Southern hilltop \n     campus and the office of Neal Berte.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S3011-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE RADIATION CONTROL FOR HEALTH AND \n SAFETY ACT FOR CALENDAR YEAR 1994--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 135\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with section 540 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360qq) (previously section 360D of the Public \nHealth Service Act), I am submitting the report of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services regarding the administration of the Radiation \nControl for Health and Safety Act of 1968 during calendar year 1994.\n  The report recommends the repeal of section 540 of the Federal Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act that requires the completion of this annual \nreport.

Ch. 228. 49 Stat. 1207.\n       ``Said legislation is applicable to Puerto Rico since 1900, \n     when, upon the approval of the first organic act (Foraker \n     Act), the Congress provided that the coasting trade between \n     Puerto Rico and the United States shall be regulated in \n     accordance with the provisions of law applicable to such \n     trade between any two great coasting districts of the United \n     States. Furthermore, Puerto Rico constitutes, according to \n     federal coasting trade laws, one of the `great coasting \n     districts' of the United States. Upon the approval of the \n     Jones Act in 1917, Congress provided that the `laws on \n     tariffs, customs and taxes on imports to Puerto Rico \n     prescribed in the Act (Foraker) would continue in effect.' \n     Ch. 145, Section 58, 39 Stat. 968 (1917). This provision \n     maintained the effectiveness of the coasting trade laws, \n     which are still in force.\n       ``Due to our geographic condition as an island, the \n     significantly higher costs of maritime transportation in \n     ships of North American registration and the juridical \n     impossibility of using foreign flag ships, Puerto Rico has \n     always been deprived of the advantages of free competition in \n     the maritime transportation market.\n       ``In the United States, there is a growing awareness that \n     the coasting trade legislation is very inefficient and to a \n     certain extent, obsolete. The benefits derived by the limited \n     maritime sector are comparably inferior to those that would \n     be derived by the total United States economy, through a new \n     scheme of free competition in maritime transportation. \n     Important sectors of the government of the United States have \n     proposed the elimination or modification of coasting trade \n     laws as part of their efforts to eliminate those areas in \n     which there is a waste of resources, bureaucracy and \n     inefficiency.\n       ``In an increasingly interdependent world, Puerto Rico \n     needs greater flexibility to take advantage of the options \n     offered in the international market. To attain greater \n     economic development, it is essential to reduce the \n     dependency on federal transfers and tax privileges which \n     diminish the dignity of the People, individually and \n     collectively, and which represent an undue burden on the \n     government and taxpayers of the United States. One way of \n     achieving this objective is through the exclusion of Puerto \n     Rico from the scope of application of the federal coasting \n     trade laws. This would not be the first time that the \n     Congress excludes a territory from said legislation. In 1936, \n     the Congress excluded the Virgin Islands to stimulate the \n     economy of said territory. See American Maritime Association \n     vs. Blumenthal, 590 F. 2d 1156, 1166-69 (D.C.

A bill to authorize and facilitate a program to enhance \nsafety, training; research and development, and safety education in the \npropane gas industry for the benefit of propane consumers and the \npublic, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n             the propane education and research act of 1996\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am very happy to \nintroduce the Propane Education and Research Act of 1996. Propane is an \nextremely important source of clean-burning, domestically-produced \nenergy in the United States providing fuel for cooking, heating, and \nhot water in over 7.7 million homes, half of all farms, and in millions \nof recreational applications. Even though propane is the fourth most \nused fuel in America, no Federal funds are spent on propane research. \nMy legislation keeps it that way and simply provides a mechanism that \npermits, not requires, industry to fund its own research and \ndevelopment [R] program for propane.\n  This act would allow the propane industry, composed of over 165 \nproducers and 5,000 marketers, to vote to establish a checkoff program \nto fund much needed R modeled after the many checkoff programs \nalready established in Federal law. Collected from the industry at an \ninitial rate of \\1/10\\th of 1 cent per gallon of odorized--propane \ndestined for the retail market--propane sold, these funds would support \nR, educational, and safety activities. Propane producers and \nmarketers, who would bear the cost of the checkoff programs, have \nindicated broad support for the legislation.\n  Propane has traditionally served rural and suburban citizens who are \nbeyond reach of most natural gas lines. The propane industry consists \nof mostly small businesses that individually cannot afford the \nnecessary R, safety, and educational activities that result in \nenormous benefits to consumers. Some of these benefits include \nincreased efficiency in propane appliances, safer handling and \ndistribution, and an improved environment for Americans from this \nclean-burning fuel. Small businesses have not historically received \ndirect benefits from federally sponsored energy R This legislation \ndoes not fit the traditional heavy-handed approach to energy research \nand development, but gives the propane small business community the \nflexibility and the framework to pursue research, safety, and education \non their own.\n\n  There are similar programs in energy industries, however, such as the \nGas Research Institute, the Electric Power Research Institute, the \nTexas Railroad Commission propane checkoff, and similar State programs \nin Louisiana, Missouri, and Alabama. These programs have enjoyed \nconsiderable success, for example, the Gas Research Institute boasts a \n400-percent return for each dollar collected and invested. Their work \nprimarily benefits urban and suburban natural gas consumers, the \npropane legislation will benefit rural and suburban consumers, as well \nas urban and suburban propane consumers.\n  The agricultural industry, for example, which accounts for 7 to 8 \npercent of all propane consumed in the United States, will see \nsubstantial benefits from propane research and development. With even \nmarginal increases in equipment efficiency, the agricultural propane \nusers will reap large returns. More efficient uses of propane in other \nbusinesses, such as home construction, will further increase the value \nof the return on investment.\n  The legislation I am introducing will not actually establish the \npropane checkoff, but calls upon the propane industry to hold a \nreferendum among themselves, to authorize establishment of the checkoff \nbefore it can go into effect. If the industry, propane producers, and \nretail marketers, vote to establish the checkoff, then the Propane \nEducation and Research Council consisting of industry representatives, \nwill be formed to administer the program. The legislation also looks \ndown the road and allows the industry to terminate the program by a \nmajority vote of both classes, or by two-thirds majority of a single \nclass.\n  A companion bill, H.R. 1514, was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives and currently enjoys broad bipartisan support. This \nenthusiasm underscores the wide, regional appeal of this innovative \napproach to meeting our domestic energy research needs. Moreover, my \nbill foster industry's efforts toward efficient, clean fuels that \nbenefit consumers and producers alike without Federal dollars and with \nminimal governmental involvement.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1646\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Propane Education and \n     Research Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) propane gas (also known as liquefied petroleum gas) is \n     an essential energy commodity that provides heat, hot water, \n     cooking fuel, and motor fuel, and has many other uses to \n     millions of Americans;\n       (2) the use of propane is especially important to rural \n     citizens and farmers, offering an efficient and economical \n     source of gas energy;\n       (3) propane has been recognized as a clean fuel and can \n     contribute in many ways to reducing pollution in cities and \n     towns of the United States; and\n       (4) propane is primarily domestically produced, and the use \n     of propane provides energy security and jobs for Americans.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Federal Land Policy and Management Act \nof 1976 to provide that forest management activities shall be subject \nto initial judicial review only in the United States district court for \nthe district in which the affected land is located, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  THE FEDERAL LAND AND POLICY MANAGEMENT ACT OF 1976 AMENDMENT ACT OF \n                                  1996\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nbring some common sense to the judicial review of land management \nactivities. In 1995, every single proposed timber sale in the Black \nHills National Forest was challenged by extreme environmental groups. \nWas this necessary? No. My legislation would prevent environmental \nactivists from ``court shopping'' when they challenge Federal timber \nsales and other land management activities. Is this necessary? Yes.\n  The Black Hills National Forest in western South Dakota, famous for \nits enormous stands of ponderosa pine, is an essential part of South \nDakota's economy. The Black Hills forest products industry includes 18 \nsawmills and 12 secondary manufacturers producing a full spectrum of \nlumber products, from housing quality lumber to particleboard and wood \npellets. The list is endless. The industry sustains nearly 2,000 jobs. \nPreserving these South Dakota jobs and the future health of the forest \nrequires careful management--both by the Forest Service and by the \ntimber industry.\n  Mayor Drue Vitter, of Hill City, SD, said it best:\n\n       Good management of the forest by the Forest Service helps \n     sustain a good cut for the timber industry. If we groom the \n     forest well and keep it healthy, then we will have a healthy \n     economy.\n\n  Mr. President, the very first Federal timber sale in the Nation took \nplace in the Black Hills near Nemo, SD, in 1899. That same area has \nbeen harvested twice since then. Today, a new generation of healthy \nponderosa pine stands tall and strong--a testament to the proper \nstewardship of our national forests.\n  Recently, however, proper forest management has been hindered by \nlengthy court challenges of Forest Service timber sales. Environmental \nextremists challenge almost every proposed Federal timber sale--not \njust in South Dakota but across the country.\n  In the past 10 years, the number of Federal timber sales has \ndecreased dramatically. In 1990, the Forest Service issued nine timber \nsale decisions in the Black Hills National Forest. In 1994, the Forest \nService issued only four timber sale decisions on the Black Hills.\n  Why the decline? Mainly it is due to the never-ending court \nchallenges. These reductions threaten the health of the forest, cause \nsawmills to go out of business, and cause loggers and other workers to \nlose their jobs. This is bad for the forests. This is worse for South \nDakotans.\n\n  Angie Many, founder of the Black Hills Women in Timber organization, \ndescribed the situation in a poignant letter to the editor of the Rapid \nCity Journal newspaper. ``When less timber is harvested, the dangers of \nlosing major portions of the Black Hills National Forest to wildlife or \ninsect infestations are increased . . . local mills shut down or \ndecrease shifts, disemploying real people with effects that trickle \ndown to many other businesses . . . families like mine are torn apart \nas loggers and mill workers travel to other areas to find work . . .'' \nSadly, Angie's description is accurate.\n  Often, when environmental extremists contest a Federal timber sale, \nthey shop around for courts that will be most sympathetic to their \nenvironmental concerns and where they can get the longest delays. They \nseek court action in metropolitan areas--courts that frequently are \nbusier and tend to be more liberal. Is this fair to loggers? Of course \nnot.\n  Court-shopping is a sad fact of life right now in South Dakota. \nHere's an example: Two years ago, the Forest Service prepared the so-\ncalled Needles timber sale--a sale 6.77 million board feet in the \nNorbeck Wildlife Reserve. The Needles sale was aimed at thinning the \nstands of ponderosa pine which had become so dense from lack of \nmanagement that wildlife no longer could survive there.\n  This presented the Forest Service with an opportunity--an opportunity \nto achieve a balanced approach to forest management. By thinning the \nforest, the Forest Service intends to create new habitat areas that \nwould encourage the return of wildlife to the area. That's good sense--\na plan that would result in both economic and environmental benefits.\n  The Needles sale also was needed to ensure the long-term health of \nthe forest within the Norbeck Wildlife Preserve. The Preserve is \ndeteriorating rapidly and poses a severe fire risk. A fire in this area \nwould be devastating. It could destroy the forest and could cause \npermanent damage to the faces of the Mount Rushmore National Monument \nwhich lies within the Norbeck Wildlife Preserve. The Needles timber \nsale would reduce drastically the risk of fire and insect destruction.\n  Like almost every Federal timber sale in the Black Hills, the Needles \ntimber sale was challenged almost immediately by a coalition of \nenvironmental extremists. For the past 2 years, this case has been \npending in the Denver court system--with no hope of receiving any \nfurther attention. This just is not right.\n\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Denver court system is currently \none of the busiest in the Nation. The Needles timber sale is not a high \npriority for this court, particularly now that the Oklahoma bombing \ntrial has been moved to Denver. But, this is what environmental \nextremists want. They wanted a delay. They got a delay. My bill would \nput an end to that.\n  My legislation would require that Federal land management \nactivities--including timber sales--be subject to initial judicial \nreview only in the U.S. District Court in which the affected Federal \nlands are located. Under my bill, the Needles timber sale could have \nbeen heard in South Dakota--where there is no caseload logjam, so to \nspeak.\n  That means no more court shopping. No more court backlog. No \nunnecessary delays. No lost timber revenue. And most important, no lost \njobs. A court in South Dakota will understand the needs of South \nDakota's forest and rangelands better than a remote big city, Federal \ncourt with a clear liberal bias.\n  Maurice Williams, the General Manager of Continental Lumber in Hill \nCity, SD, agrees that South Dakotans are best equipped to determine how \nto manage the Black Hills:\n\n       The proof is on the ground. The Black Hills National Forest \n     represents more than a hundred years of solid management. A \n     judge who never has seen the Black Hills just isn't qualified \n     to decide how the forest should or should not be managed.\n\n  Mr. President, I agree with Maurice. I believe it is time to give \nStates and conscientious timber harvesters the home court advantage. \nAlready this legislation has been cosponsored by several of my \ncolleagues, including Senators Craig, Lott, Bennett, Simpson, Stevens, \nMurkowski, Inhofe, Kyl and Thomas. I ask unanimous consent that a \nletter of support from the Black Hills Forest Resource Association be \nprinted in the Record. I hope all my colleagues will take a close look \nat this bill and support its eventual passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3023]]\n\n                                S. 1647\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Larry Pressler,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pressler: We have reviewed your draft \n     legislation requiring that lawsuits involving forest \n     management activities be filed in the United States district \n     court in which the national forest is located.\n       We strongly support this legislation. Too often plaintiffs \n     have ``shopped'' for courts that are backlogged or for the \n     judges most inclined to offer favorable judgments. In our \n     view, the public's interest is best served by keeping trials \n     as local as possible to facilitate appearances by witnesses, \n     other participants, and observers, as well as providing the \n     best opportunity for local citizens to be fully informed.\n       Clearly, local decisions should be made locally, and the \n     public's interest is not well served by allowing cases to be \n     heard in far away courts with only a tangential stake in the \n     outcome.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue.\n                                                       Tom Troxel,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join Senator \nPressler, my friend and colleague, as one of the original cosponsors \nfor his timber sale proposal. This responsible legislative solution \nwould cut court cost and remove delays which plague legitimate efforts \nto harvest timber from Federal lands.\n  Those who oppose any and all timber activities go to great lengths to \nobstruct the process. Frequently, they shop around for a court which \nsupports their agenda. This usually creates a situation where the court \nmaking the ruling has neither a geographical connection nor a genuine \nfirst-hand understanding of the case and its consequences. Does this \nmake judicial sense to any of my Senate colleagues?\n  Senator Pressler's proposal is direct and straightforward. It simply \nrequires that the court which conducts the judicial review and renders \nthe decision must include the land in question within its district. Why \nis a Denver court more qualified to review a Black Hills timber sales \nthan one in South Dakota? Common sense says the opposite would be true.\n  Senator Pressler's approach will not prevent groups from challenging \nthe timber sales on Federal lands. This proposal will not roll back any \nenvironmental statutes. To the contrary, it actually means the judicial \ndecisions will be made more promptly. Why would any of these groups not \nwant their court challenges acted upon promptly?\n  Senator Pressler's plan also would cover other public policy issues \nlike grazing permits and resource management plans. It makes sense that \nthese judicial decisions, like timber sales, are made by those who will \nbe directly affected, and who have the most knowledge of the \nsituations.\n  Senator Pressler's approach can be characterized as a focused and \nprecise fix to the underlying statues. It is in keeping with the \nadministration's ``rifle-shot'' procedure. The fundamental law is left \nin place and mere fine tuning occurs.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to give serious examination to this \nlegislative proposal. It has merit and deserves both your support and \nyour cosponsorship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nsupporting the efforts of the U.S. Soccer Federation to bring the 1999 \nWomen's World Cup tournament to the United States.\n  Soccer is one of the world's most beloved sports, and its popularity \nin the United States has grown rapidly over the past 20 years. The \nWomen's World Cup tournament, held every 4 years, is the single most \nimportant women's soccer event; the 1995 Women's World Cup was \nbroadcast to millions of fans in 67 nations. Hosting this event will \ncontribute to international goodwill and be a clear signal that America \nis serious about encouraging female participation in sports. Indeed, \nthis tournament would serve as a showcase of the best female soccer \nathletes in the world, and something to which girls and young women \ncould aspire.\n  Already, girls' soccer has experienced an explosion in popularity. On \nthe high school level, it is reported that 41,119 girls played soccer \nin 1980, while 191,350 played in the 1994-95 school year. That's a \nremarkable increase of over 400 percent.\n  This increase is reflected on the collegiate level as well. In 1981, \n77 schools sponsored women's soccer. By 1995, that number had swelled \nto 617. And a recent national survey indicates that of all the \nAmericans who played soccer at least once during 1994, 39 percent \npercent were women.\n  These are very encouraging numbers. They demonstrate that soccer is a \nvery appealing sport to women, and they demonstrate that soccer is an \nexcellent way to get girls and women excited about participating in \nsports.\n  We all know that sports are just as important an activity for girls \nand women as they are for boys and men. Through sports, girls and women \ncan get a feel for the positive competitive spirit which was, until \nrecently, almost exclusively the property of boys and men.\n  Women and girls who participate in sports develop self-confidence, \ndedication, a sense of team spirit, and an ability to work under \npressure--traits which enhance all aspects of their lives. In fact, 80 \npercent of women identified as key leaders in Fortune 500 companies \nhave sports backgrounds.\n  Having the United States host the Women's World Cup in 1999 would be \nan inspirational way to highlight the excitement of participation in \nsports, and the heights of greatness which women can reach in \nathletics. Indeed, it would give Americans the chance to see their own \noutstanding female soccer players in action. The U.S. National Team won \nthe inaugural title in 1991, and finished third in last year's event \nbefore sold out crowds.\n  The success of the 1994 Men's World Cup Soccer tournament in the \nUnited States showed the world that we were ready to be the center of \nthe soccer universe. Indeed, I think we all felt justifiable pride in \nproviding the world with excellent venues as well as first-class \ntransportation, security, communication, and accommodations.\n  In order for the U.S. Soccer Federation to submit a formal bid to the \nFederation Internationale de Football Association [FIFA] to host the \nWomen's World Cup, it must show Government backing. In 1987, a similar \nresolution was agreed to demonstrate support for the U.S. bid to host \nthe 1994 Men's World Cup. By agreeing to this resolution, we will \nofficially recognize their efforts and request that the President of \nthe United States designate appropriate Federal agencies to work with \nthe U.S. Soccer Federation to meet FIFA's requirements for the 1999 \ntournament's host country.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this worthwhile \neffort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S3024-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3024-S3025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 234--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF EDMUND S.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nacknowledge the passing of a truly admirable woman, Laura Toliver \nJefferson, known affectionately and respectfully as Mother Jefferson. \nShe was a tireless advocate for her community as well as a source of \ninspiration to those who knew her. Mrs. Jefferson will be remembered by \nall as the woman who fought over the course of nearly 30 years to get \npublic sewer service for her community of Arthurtown, Little Camden, \nand Taylors. This was the area of South Carolina in which she was born, \nraised 10 children, and where she died at the age of 93. She will be \ngreatly missed.\n  Mother Jefferson came to my attention when she was lobbying for a \nsewage system to be built in her community. To say that this \ndevelopment was long overdue would be an understatement. We tried \nseveral different avenues year after year, but the funding kept getting \ndenied or held up. Over the many years, the citizens of Arthurtown, \nLittle Camden, and Taylors found themselves caught in a complicated and \noften frustrating bureaucratic process. Where another person might be \nenraged by the redtape, Mrs.\n\n[[Page S3030]]\n\nJefferson remained undaunted, focused, and incredibly polite. Without \never complaining, she voiced the concerns of herself and her community. \nA local newspaper, the State, captured her humility and humor in an \ninterview in 1985, ``It ain't no disgrace to be poor. It's just \ninconvenient.''\n  After nearly three decades of fighting, the community finally \nreceived $3.9 million in Federal and State grants, and the construction \nbegan. On July 12, 1995, the people of Little Camden, Arthurtown, and \nTaylors got a sewage system. They also got the opportunity to thank \nMother Jefferson, in the form of a celebration at her house. As the \ncrowd squeezed into her bathroom to share the communities' very first \ntoilet flush, She said ``I'm so grateful that I'm lost for words.''\n  Mother Jefferson was one of the more articulate, gracious, determined \npeople I have met. She was a truly good woman who participated in \ncommunity affairs and made an enormous difference in people's lives. \nHer involvement and her spirit serve as a lasting lesson to us all. \nWhen writers or politicians talk about what makes America great, they \nare talking about people like Mother Jefferson. I send my sincere \ncondolences to her family and friends. Like them, I will not forget \nher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S3029-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET CUTS AND EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. SIMON. On March 12 the Senate voted to restore $2.6 billion in \nFederal funding for education. While this would still leave Federal \nsupport for education below 1995 levels, I was pleased to see the \nSenate take bipartisan action to at least partially reverse what was \nclearly an unwise decision. Senator Harkin, Senator Specter, and the \nother Senators who have shown strong leadership on this issue deserve a \ngreat deal of credit for their efforts.\n  Recently, the Chicago Tribune published an article on the effect that \nFederal education cuts would have for the State of Illinois and the \ncity of Chicago. The article gave a compelling account of what such \ncuts would mean for the millions of students. I strongly urge the \nSenate to maintain its position in conference to prevent the harmful \nimpact that the House-proposed cuts would have on Illinois and on the \nNation.\n  I ask that the Chicago Tribune article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Feb. 13, 1996]\n\n                U.S. Budget Cuts Impact Chicago Schools\n\n                      (By Nathaniel Sheppard, Jr.)\n\n       Three years ago, at least two fights a day broke out at \n     Ravenswood Elementary School in Chicago's rough and tumble \n     Uptown community.\n       That number is down to about two per month, according to \n     school officials, largely due to a Peer Leadership project \n     that is part of a nationwide program known as Safe and Drug \n     Free Schools and Communities.\n       Despite the program's success at Ravenswood and other city \n     schools, it is at risk of becoming a casualty in the battle \n     between Congress and President Clinton over the Federal \n     budget.\n       It is one of several programs that could be crippled by \n     cuts of $54 million in Illinois' share of Federal funds under \n     the Title I program for the Nation's neediest children.\n       The cuts are incorporated in a temporary spending bill, \n     known as a continuing resolution, that is keeping the \n     government functioning during the budget crisis.\n       Under the stopgap measure, Federal funding for Title I \n     programs in the State is cut from its $317.2 million level in \n     the 1995 fiscal year to $263 million in fiscal 1996.\n       The cuts could lead to substantial layoffs of teachers--as \n     many as 600 in Chicago alone, according to Department of \n     Education estimates--and could hobble programs that have \n     become the centerpiece of national and State efforts to make \n     schools safe, drug-free and internationally competitive by \n     the year 2000.\n       The 30-year-old Title I program is the largest run by the \n     Department of Education.\n       It provides remedial aid to more than 50,000 under-\n     performing students in public and private schools, including \n     two-thirds of all elementary schools.\n       The program also funds salaries for thousands of teachers \n     and aides.\n       Congress passed the temporary spending bill in December to \n     keep agencies running after parts of the government were shut \n     down twice last year in the budget dispute.\n       Clinton has agreed to Republican demands to balance the \n     budget in 7 years using economic assumptions of the \n     Congressional Budget Office. But Democrats and Republicans \n     still disagree over how deep some budget cuts should be.\n       Republicans argue that Democrats exaggerate the harm the \n     cuts will cause and say that in several areas, their reforms \n     will lead to increased funding for education programs.\n       Nationwide, cuts in the Title I program total $1.1 billion \n     or 17 percent over last year, under the current continuing \n     resolution.\n       That reduces spending to $7 billion for individualized \n     instruction, smaller classes, after-school study programs, \n     computers, projects to encourage parental involvement in \n     schools and other strategies some educators say are critical \n     to meeting the federally mandated year 2000 goal.\n       ``The cuts are a serious problem that threatens the safety \n     and well-being of 40 million children and nearly every public \n     school teacher, principal, and support staff member in \n     America,'' said Secretary of Education Richard Riley.\n       Nationwide, safe and drug-free school and community \n     programs would be slashed $107.8 million, Education \n     Department officials say. That, they add, is enough to pay \n     for 400,000 hand-held metal detectors, hire 3,300 security \n     officers, keep 3,600 schools open for 3 hours of extra-\n     curricular programs, hire 2,000 teachers for conflict-\n     resolution courses and train 50,000 teachers and \n     administrators in drug and violence prevention and education.\n       ``For us, the impact will be devastating,'' said Patricia \n     McPhearson, manager of the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program \n     in Chicago. Its budget is cut 25 percent to $4.3 million in \n     Chicago under the stopgap funding.\n       Statewide, cuts in the program total $4.7 million. Under \n     even larger cuts proposed by House Republicans, the State \n     would lose $10 million from the program.\n       Popular projects such as those at Sauganash and Ravenswood \n     schools, and Amundsen High School could become skeletal \n     programs, McPhearson said.\n       The program at Amundsen seeks to change the climate of \n     community violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S3030-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOTLINE\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE.

There is also a TDD number for the hearing \nimpaired, 1-800-787-3224.\n  Mr. President, roughly 1 million women are victims of domestic \nviolence each year and battering may be the single most common cause of \ninjury to women--more common than auto accidents, muggings, or rapes by \na stranger. According to the FBI, one out of every two women in America \nwill be beaten at least once in the course of an intimate relationship. \nThe FBI also speculates that battering is the most under-reported crime \nin the country. It is estimated that the new hotline will receive close \nto 10,000 calls a day.\n  I hope that the new national domestic violence hotline will help \nwomen and families find the support, assistance, and services they need \nto get out of homes where there is violence and abuse.\n  Mr. President, once again, the toll free number is 1-800-799-SAFE, \nand 1-800-787-3224, for the hearing impaired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S3030-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3030-S3033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  OPERATION SAFE HAVEN AND THE ASSETS OF EUROPEAN JEWS IN SWISS BANKS\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue of great \nemotion and importance to Holocaust survivors and their families. The \nissue at hand is an inquiry into the return, by Swiss banks, of assets \ndeposited by European Jews and others in the years preceding the \nHolocaust.\n  From the 1930's until the onset of the Holocaust, European Jews and \nothers deposited funds and other assets in Swiss banks for safekeeping. \nIn doing so, they were trying to avoid what some inevitably saw as the \nwriting on the wall, namely the coming Nazi onslaught. Others did so, \nsimply for business reasons. At the end of the war however, a great \nmany Swiss banks denied holding these assets.\n  Throughout the intervening years, the victorious Allies made several \nrequests of the Swiss Government for cooperation in finding these \nassets. Several organizations, in addition to the Allies made repeated \nand determined efforts to persuade the Swiss to examine their banks and \nto find these missing assets.\n  For the Swiss though, the matter was simple, they did all that they \ncould to\n\n[[Page S3031]]\n\navoid any type of examination of their banking system, despite clear \nevidence of very deep cooperation with the Nazis. The Swiss hid behind \ntheir 1934 Bank Secrecy Act, claiming that they could not divulge the \nidentity of their account holders. This is quite ironic in view of the \nfact that the 1934 Act was designed to protect the identity of the \naccount holders from the Nazis. Now, they were using this same law to \nshield the assets from the survivors and the victims' rightful heirs.\n  Finally, in a series of agreements and treaties with the Allies \nfollowing the war, Switzerland reluctantly agreed to search their \nbanks' files for these assets. Finally, in 1962, the Swiss Bankers \nAssociation undertook a search through their records to find what \nassets, they denied holding in the first place. At the conclusion of \nthis search, they found approximately 9 million Swiss francs, or some \n$2 million, belonging to 961 claimants. Nevertheless, some 7,000 \nclaimants were turned down.\n  Numerous sources have questioned the validity of this search, but \nnothing was done beyond this until another search was performed in \n1995. In this new search, according to the Swiss Bankers Association, a \ntotal of 893 accounts, holding $32 million were found. These accounts \nwere said to have been dormant for at least 10 years and were opened \nbefore 1945. These numbers have been criticized, by a variety of \nsources, as vastly too small.\n  It is in this vein, as Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, I \nhave begun an inquiry into this situation. The inquiry will examine the \nprocedures by which Swiss banks calculated the amount of assets in \ntheir possession. In these post-war searches, in 1962-63, and most \nrecently in 1995, the Swiss banks used different criteria to conduct \ntheir examinations. Therefore, the Banking Committee will evaluate how \nthe banks searched their accounts, and what kind of accounts might have \nbeen missed. The Committee will try to discern if the searches were \ncomprehensive enough to find all assets.\n  While in the early stages of the search, my staff has found \ndeclassified military intelligence documents that detail a variety of \nfascinating facts vital to this inquiry. In ``Operation Safe Haven,'' a \nprogram of the Joint Treasury Department-Justice Department-State \nDepartment operation to locate and identify Nazi assets and looted \nassets in Europe, Military Intelligence officers filed a series of now-\ndeclassified reports on these topics. One such document, dated July 12, \n1945, details a list of 182 separate bank accounts held by Societe \nGeneral de Surveillance S.A. of Geneva. These holders of these bank \naccounts were from Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Croatia, Moravia, \nSlovakia, France, Holland, and Denmark.\n  This important document is vital to understanding the issue of \nHolocaust assets in Swiss banks. More importantly, we must compare it \nto the declarations of the Swiss that they had no real assets in their \npossession, and to later fulfillment of some claims made with them. To \nstart, I would like to know if these accounts are among those found in \nthe post-war, 1962, and 1995 searches, and if not, where is the money \nnow?\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask that the above mentioned document \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Mr. President, this document proves vital to countering the claim \nthat there were no assets, or very little. With the help of the \nCongressional Research Service, I would like to list the amount of \nassets, held in the various currencies reported, converted into dollars \nat the 1945 rate. Additionally, I will list the value of those assets \nin 1995 dollars accounting for inflation, as well as what the accounts \nwould hold today with 3 percent, 4 percent, and 5 percent interest \nrespectively. The amounts are as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Currency                1945 amount     1995 amount       1945+3%           +4%             +5%     \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSwiss Francs....................      $2,214,915     $18,738,181      $9,989,266     $16,390,371     $26,667,577\nFrench Francs...................           4,925          41,665          22,261          36,396          59,297\nBelgian Francs..................             713           6,034           3,223           5,269           8,585\nBritish Sterling................          71,488         604,790         323,126         528,296         860,716\nCanadian Dollars................             264           2,233           1,193           1,951           3,179\nU.S. Dollars....................         119,020       1,006,915         537,970         879,557       1,433,009\nDutch Florin....................             227           1,923           1,026           1,678           2,733\n                                 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total.....................       2,411,552      20,401,741      10,878,065      17,843,518      29,035,096\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. President, as you can see, these amounts are of an incredible \nmagnitude. If they are accurate numbers, there is a real problem and \nthe Swiss banks have a lot of questions to answer, and I plan to pose \nquestions to them today. I plan on actively pursuing this matter until \nI achieve an authoritative, accurate and final accounting of all assets \nthat numerous Swiss banks continue to hold from this time period and to \nwhich the survivors and rightful heirs are entitled.\n  The document follows:\n\n [USG-SWI-105; Secret: No. 12100; Bern, Switzerland, Reference: SH No. \n                        74, Date: July 12, 1945]\n\n                            Safehaven Report\n\n     Subject: Supplementary Report on Funds Held for Others by \n         Societe General do Surveillance S.A., Geneva.\n\n       Reference is made to SAFEHAVEN Report No. 4 of April 9, \n     1945.

The \n     attached list, which contains more detailed information \n     relative to the property held than the earlier one, is said \n     to be a complete list of all persons who are nationals and \n     also residents of the countries named who have balances with \n     S.G.S., except that for practical reasons later compilations \n     omit balances below Swiss francs 10,000. Furthermore, it may \n     be noted that we are advised that we now have a complete list \n     of all accounts held by S.G.S. for all persons who are \n     nationals and residents of countries which are of interest \n     except Germany.\n       While we have been advised that S.G.S. holds no balances \n     for persons in Germany, this statement has been questioned on \n     the basis of an admission that advances were made to a German \n     resident of Switzerland out of funds due Mr. Siepmann, the \n     former Manager of the Hamburg Control Company which was \n     formerly affiliated with S.G.S., and it is possible that an \n     additional report will be submitted if additional information \n     is obtained at a later date.\n       In SAFEHAVEN Report No. 4 it was stated that:\n       ``. . . It is reliably reported that since 1941 S.G.S. also \n     has acted in a banking or fiduciary capacity by holding funds \n     representing profits realized by its Balkan customers on \n     shipments of merchandise to neutrals and to enemy territory. \n     The transactions which resulted in the accumulation of \n     profits involved over invoicing consignees, shipment of the \n     merchandise against payment in Switzerland in Swiss francs, \n     and withholding by S.G.S. of the excess payments or balances \n     . . .\n       ``It is stated that the aforementioned funds and other \n     property are beneficially owned principally by Jewish persons \n     who are nationals of and residents of the abovementioned \n     countries and who were endeavoring (1) to profit from black \n     market operations in local currencies of the Balkan \n     countries; (2) to move funds out of their home countries; or \n     (3) to insure that the funds would be safe from confiscation \n     by their local authorities''.\n       During the present investigation, however, a question was \n     raised as to whether or not the above statement also were \n     true for balances held for persons who are nationals and also \n     residents of France, Holland, and Denmark and in reply the \n     following memorandum dated June 18, 1945 was received:\n       ``The only countries for which we hold financial accounts \n     are Romania and to a very\n\n[[Page S3032]]\n\n     limited extent Bulgaria. We have never transacted such \n     business for people in other countries.''\n       From the foregoing it would appear that our earlier remarks \n     do not hold for nationals and residents of Hungary, Croatia, \n     Moravia, Slovakia, France, Holland, and Denmark. This \n     conclusion seems to be correct since at our request the \n     Genova Consulate discussed the memorandum of June 18, 1945, \n     further with the S.G.S. and on July 2, 1945 advised in part \n     as follows:\n       The memorandum of June 18 from S.G.S. is correct. On the \n     French list all but the last two entries have been held since \n     before the war. The last two were acquired from a bank in \n     free exchange for the account of the persons mentioned. The \n     Hungarian gold (as also the French gold) was deposited with \n     the S.G.S. without its having any knowledge as to how it had \n     been acquired.''\n       For your further information, we are advised by the Geneva \n     Consulate in their letter of July 2, 1945, that all dollar \n     balances are deposited in blocked accounts except one of \n     $4200 held for Maurice Moiso Rothmann, Bucharest, which is in \n     the form of currency.\n       With regard to the balances held in French francs, the \n     following was reported in the Geneva Consulate's letter \n     referred to above:\n       ``There is only one case involving a balance in French bank \n     notes (S.A.R. DE TRANSPORTURI EGER on the Rumanian list \n     involving 250,000 French francs) and those were declared to \n     the French Consulate here by the S.G.S.\n       ``Holdings shown on the French list should supposedly be \n     declared by the owners. S.G.S. has no obligation to declare \n     anything in these cases. It is not known for sure, but the \n     presumption is that the French owners have not made any \n     declarations in order to avoid taxation.''\n       This information is reported to Washington and London for \n     whatever further action may be desired.\n       We should like to request again that this information be \n     regarded as extremely confidential and be so handled that it \n     will not be disclosed to Swiss or other sources. The request \n     is for the protection of our informants who appear to have \n     been very cooperative.\n       Enclosures: 3 Lists\n       850.3/711.2\n       DJR/KRH/EGR/eb\n       Original and hectograph to the Department\n       Two copies to American Embassy, London\n       One copy to American Embassy, Lisbon\n       One copy to American Embassy, Madrid\n       Two copies to British Legation, Bern.\n       Reproduced by London Office, US Group CC. 2 August 1945.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Soldes   \n               Roumanie                      Currency        crediteurs \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nM.

This is not a perfect farm bill, but I \nfind it somewhat ironic that some of my colleagues are voting against \nit, yet, urging the President to sign it, and then going out and \ncriticizing it. It would be better to improve it and to be \nconstructive.\n  Our farmers need a farm bill passed now. Many of them have already \ngone to the fields in our Nation. In South Dakota, they are meeting \nwith their bankers, making their plans. It is time for us to pass a \nfarm bill.\n  Mr. President, for years, we have had all this regulation and \npaperwork in agriculture. I come from a farm. I am a farmer. Last year, \ndeficiency payments were sent out to the farmers. Then the commodity \nprices were high enough that the deficiency payments were sent back to \nthe Department of Agriculture. All this requires a great deal of \npaperwork, and it costs the taxpayers a lot.\n  Let me commend Senator Lugar and the managers of the farm bill, and \nSenator Grassley and others, who have brought us a farm bill that will \nnot only save taxpayers money, but will also help our Nation's farmers \nand ranchers.\n  Mr. President, let me say that I think the most important farm bill \nbesides this is a balanced budget because, if we have a balanced \nbudget, we will be able to export our commodities and the commodity \nprices will be high enough. Because of a balanced budget we will have \nlow interest rates and a stable dollar and high exports. That is what \nfarmers and ranchers really want. They do not seek handouts. They want \ngood prices on the world market. And they are there for us if we take \nadvantage of it.\n  So there are many improvements we could make in this farm bill the \nnext year or the year after. But let us pass it now. This is the best \ndeal we can get at this time. If somebody had a better one, they should \nhave brought it up.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness for 3 minutes for the purpose of introducing a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lugar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Pressler pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1647 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague \nfrom Iowa and Indiana and congratulate both of them for their work on \nthe farm bill which was very outstanding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first, just one sentence to compliment \nthe now Presiding Officer, the Senator from Indiana for his leadership \non getting the farm bill passed. I am going to speak tomorrow on the \nfarm bill. This evening, in morning business, I am speaking on the \nsubject of the drug problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S3034-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3034-S3035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE CIRCLE OF HURT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have heard a great deal on this floor \nabout the problem of drugs in this country. Senator Hatch, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Moynihan, and others, have spoken eloquently about \nthe personal and societal costs that we bear because of illegal drug \nuse. Add in the abuse of legal drugs in this country and the costs are \nstaggering.\n  The record of the harm done is clear. The facts accumulate in \ndepressing measure, detailing the damage done to individuals, to \nfamilies, to communities, and to our civic life. Drugs destroy a \nperson's capacity to live a decent life. They contribute to a widening \ncircle of hurt that goes far beyond any individual choice to use drugs.\n  Like a stone dropped into a pond, the ripples move outward in an \never-widening circle. The result is an arc of pain and loss that is no \nrespecter of social position, education, age, race, or location. \nNothing brought this home to me more forcefully than a letter I \nreceived recently from a constituent. A constituent whose family has \nborne the brunt of what illegal drug use truly means. We can pile up \nfacts and figures. We have the numbing statistics. But these cold, \nsterile numbers do not bring home to us the true meaning of what is \ninvolved. In order to understand the circle of hurt, let me share with \nyou this story. As the dismaying figures on family violence, crime, and \ndrug-addicted babies only too clearly show, this record is not unique.\n  Although is it not unique, it is, nevertheless, a story whose very \nprevalence is part of the harm done everyday by illegal drug use.\n  Kay and Jim Degrado of Marshalltown, IA, a community of 25,000, know \nfirsthand what the facts and figures mean. Some years ago, their son \nbegan experimenting with drugs at 9 and was an addict by 13. Nothing \nthat these good people could do made a difference. They watched as \ntheir son slowly sank into addiction and a world of violence, drug \ndealing, and abuse. As with many families, they were unprepared to deal \nwith the problems. Their son became an addict and a dealer.\n  At 26, during his second treatment episode, he met a 22-year-old \nprostitute and crack addict. They subsequently moved in together after \nthey were expelled from the treatment program. In addition to living \ntogether, they also began dealing together. They had an 800 number, \nbeepers, and a separate apartment to deal from. Sales helped them \nmaintain a $1,500 a day habit. This in a town of only 25,000. It was at \nthis time that the couple learned that they were to have a baby, the \nwoman's second. The first child was raised in a drug-addicted \nhousehold, with all the emotional scars that involves. The second \nchild, Tomi, now four, suffered a worse fate. She was born addicted.\n  As the Degrado's learned, drug use damages the unborn child in \nprofound ways. In ways that endure for a lifetime. Their granddaughter, \nyoung Tomi, was born with multiple problems. She has difficulty \nsleeping. She is averse to being touched. She's irritable and has a \nshort attention span. In addition, she has difficulty swallowing, a \ncommon feature of drug-affected children. At four, she still must \nreceive supplemental food and medication through a feeding tube in her \nabdomen. She is unable to use a spoon, lacking the coordination. The \ngrandparents have adopted the child--after years of effort--and can \ngive Tomi a loving home. But they can never heal the hurt. And there \nare many Tomis in this country.\n  According to some estimates, as many as 100,000 or more such babies \nare born every year to addicted mothers. The disabilities are lifelong. \nTomi requires constant medical attention. And she has learning \ndisabilities that will affect her as long as she lives. But this is not \nthe end of the story. As with Tomi's parents, many addicts have more \nthan just one child. These children are born addicted. Or they come \ninto drug-using homes where physical and sexual abuse are common. Tomi \nhas an older half-sister, and her mother is pregnant again.\n  Fortunately, the Degrados' son is in treatment, again, after two \nsuicide attempts and numerous relapses. He visits his daughter but has \nnot taken an active role in her life. It is still unclear if he will \nstay clean and sober. If he does, and I wish him well, it will come at \ngreat effort, one that will occupy him for the rest of his life.\n  And the cost? The monetary costs, of course, have been enormous. But \nthat is only a small part of the expense. From the seemingly individual \nchoice to use drugs, the Degrados' son, destroyed his own life. He \nbrought pain and suffering to his family. It is a pain that still \nremains. In addition, he also fathered a child born with lifelong \ndisabilities. Pushed drugs to others. And engaged in numerous crimes. \nFrom his one act, a decision to use drugs, the circle of hurt spreads \noutward in ever-widening arcs. That is the reality of drug use. The \ndamage and harm are personal, immediate, and enduring.\n  Yet, what we hear from many these days--from some of our cultural and \npolitical elite--is that we should legalize such drugs. That we should \nmake\n\n[[Page S3035]]\n\nthem widely available. The common argument is that we should not \ninterfere with a personal choice. A choice which is, according to the \nargument, a victimless crime. No one is harmed. What a cruel and \ninsensitive lie that is. No wonder so many decent people like the \nDegrados feel like the country, or its culture leaders, has taken leave \nof its senses.\n\n  And one finds the argument and its logical consequences increasingly \nprevalent. Recently, a member of my staff learned that a bookstore \nright here in the Washington area had a whole display on how to process \nyour own drugs at home. The display was full of books on how to start \nyour own drug business in the comfort of your living room. This in a \nstore in a suburban shopping mall frequented by teenagers and families. \nThis is reminiscent of the 1960's. That was the last time we flirted \nwith the ``drugs-are-OK-for-everybody'' theme. But this is not the \n1960's and I had hoped that we had learned something from our past. \nSeemingly not. At least not some.\n  Turn on MTV or listen to much of the popular music these days and you \nget the drugs-are-OK message. First, leading political figures and \ncultural gurus openly discuss the idea of making drugs readily \navailable at over-the-counter prices. Second, newspaper editors flirt \nwith the idea of legalization. Third, movies and TV shows are once \nagain introducing drugs as okay into their plots. Fourth, many of our \npolitical leaders are sending confusing messages. So far, the most \nnotable comment from the President on drug use was, ``I didn't \ninhale.'' Just think of the unfortunate signal that sends, however \ninadvertent. And fifth, one of the most remembered policy \nrecommendations from this administration was the call by the Surgeon \nGeneral for legalization.\n  Lately we have William F. Buckley, Jr., repeating the legalization \ntheme. And he is in good, or rather, bad company. Some newspapers, \nmagazines, and a variety of pundits have picked up the theme. This does \nnot mean, however, that this is an idea whose time has come. All of \nthis fulminating over the virtues of drugs or the harm caused by \npreventing people from self-administering deadly substances, is limited \nto a few, if well-financed, individuals. But their voice has a \ndisproportionate access to the media. A media that then broadcasts and \nenlarges on the theme, making it seem more influential than it really \nis. Unfortunately, this posturing encourages young people to dismiss \nnot only the harm that drugs cause but to question whether it is wrong \nto use drugs. And so, the hurt goes on.\n  After years of decline, after years in which teenage attitudes toward \ndrugs was moving in the right direction, we now see dramatic reversals \nin teen drug use, heading back up. More disturbing, we see a decline in \nnegative attitudes to drug use. We have not yet returned to the 1979 \nlevels of abuse, but we have made notable gains in that direction. As \nrecent studies show, an increasingly large percentage of high school \nkids now report frequent marijuana use. The age at which use is \nbeginning is also dropping. Experts now recommend that we must begin \nour antidrug prevention message in grade school.\n  Meanwhile, the casualties mount. The most recent data, released by \nthe drug czar's office, confirm--as if more confirmation was \nnecessary--that drug use is on the rise, especially among kids. This is \nparticularly true of marijuana use. As we learned to our regret, \nmarijuana is a gateway drug for further substance abuse. Heroin use is \nalso on the rise. And much of the West and Middle West face a growing \nproblem of methamphetamine use--the so-called workingman's cocaine. \nThis drug is responsible for dramatic increases in family violence, in \nviolent crime, and in hospital emergencies. What the numbers tell us is \na depressing story of returning drug abuse.\n  We are still dealing with an addict population created by the drugs-\nare-OK argument from the 1960's and 1970's. Our current hardcore \naddicts were the 15-, 16-, and 17-year-olds of then. Today we are \nputting our 12-, 13-, and 14-year-olds at risk. We are mortgaging their \nfutures and the lives of everyone they touch. We are exposing them to a \ncycle of hurt and suffering. I can imagine few more irresponsible acts. \nThe last time we did it unconsciously or by inattention. If we do this \nagain, we can make no claim to ignorance. We cannot appeal to our \ninnocence. What we do now, we do with full knowledge. We simply cannot \nlet this happen again.\n  I would like to ask my colleagues to look at my remarks from the \nstandpoint of it portraying the problem of drugs that a family in Iowa \nhad, the Kay and Jim Degrado family of Marshalltown, IA. It tells a \nstory about how early drug use of a child leads to greater and greater \nproblems. It talks about crack babies, and in the case of this family a \ncrack grandchild that has been adopted by this family--the problems \nthat families get into down the road of time in prison; all the crime \nthat comes from illicit drug use.\n  I compliment this family for sharing their story with me and the \ngranting of permission to me to discuss this issue on the floor of the \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S3034-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3035-S3036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE TRICKLE DOWN DEFECT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have had a number of things to say \nlately about leadership and moral posture. I have mentioned these \nissues several times on this floor in the past few days. I wish to draw \nthe attention of my colleagues to an example of what a void in clear \nleadership and guidance means. It illustrates what we might call the \ntrickle down defect.\n  When there is uncertain leadership, when leaders are unclear on their \ntrue intent, their irresoluteness trickles down. Nowhere is this effect \neasier to detect than in this administration's drug policy. From almost \nthe first day of this administration there have been mixed signals and \nmuddled directions about our drug policy. While the words have pointed \nin one direction, actions have gone off in every direction. The only \nthing that has been constant has been inconsistency.\n  One of the best examples of that was the President's move to fire \nmost of the people in the drug czar's office just after his \ninauguration. That office was then not supported. The drug issue fell \noff the agenda. The President called ``time out'' in the war on drugs.\n  Lately, the administration is moving to restore personnel to the drug \nczar's office. I am sure there is no connection between that move and \nthe fact that this is an election year. Miraculously and suddenly, the \nPresident has learned what the American people have known all along. \nOne of the most important tools in fighting drug abuse among kids is to \nprovide consistent leadership--to have a consistent message. At one \ntime, we had that. The most remembered phrase from the years before Mr. \nClinton was ``Just say no.'' Unfortunately, we lost that message.\n  The most remembered phrase of this administration is, ``I didn't \ninhale.''\n  Today, a mixed and muddled message has trickled down through the \nbureaucracy. We have seen a falling off in effort. We have seen \nconfused priorities. We have seen a decline in interagency \ncoordination. We have not seen much in the way of leadership. What we \nhave seen is rising drug abuse.\n  And, this lack of consistency has consequences. The latest example \ncomes from just the past few days. The Centers for Disease Control, a \nFederal agency based in Atlanta and paid for by the taxpayers, \ncosponsored a conference this past weekend. The conference was held \nunder the innocent enough title of ``harm reduction.'' Unfortunately, \nthat mild phrase conceals a bleak reality. Things are not always what \nthey seem.\n  Many of the other cosponsors of the conference, such as the Drug \nPolicy Foundation and the Lindesmith Center, are among the largest drug \nlegalization lobbies in this country. The press release announcing the \nconference put out by the Drug Policy Foundation ends with a call, and \nI quote, ``End the Drug War''. The stated goal of these organizations \nis to get drugs legalized. The CDC, perhaps unknowingly, have \nassociated themselves with this position. A position that is supposedly \ndirectly opposite of the administration's stated policy. What you have \nis a Government agency charged with dealing with controlling epidemics \ncollaborating with those who want to legalize drugs, which would cause \na major epidemic. This is a masquerade. But, it is clear that the CDC \nis confused about what our policy\n\n[[Page S3036]]\n\nis. Confused about their role in supporting that policy. But it should \nnot come as a surprise.\n  Mixed up and muddled. Confused signals and uncertain direction. \nActions that belie statements. This has been the recent legacy. No \nwonder people are confused.\n  When these things happen, who is responsible? Who do we look to? You \nhave to look to the people who set the course. Remember that the CDC \ncomes under the Public Health Service, which works for the Surgeon \nGeneral. And who was our last Surgeon General? Joycelyn Elders. Recall \nthat she was the one who sounded the call for legalization in the first \ndays of the Clinton administration. There was never any meaningful \nresponse. Certainly the decimated Drug Czar's office could mount no \nconvincing reply. Unfortunately, Dr. Elders' remarks remain fixed in \npublic memory. Everyone remembers her, who remembers anything said by \nthe Drug Czar? Or the President?\n  We have seen lately a born-again drug policy from the administration, \nthe message is still unclear. Evidently, the CDC is still confused. But \ntheir confusion is no orphan.\n  When the message broadcast from the top is contradictory. When it is \nhedged with qualifiers. When the guidance is unclear, it should come as \nno surprise to find bungling at the bottom.\n  Here we have the Centers for Disease Control, part of our national \neffort to fight the war on drugs, lending its name and prestige against \nthe war of drugs. The right hand of this administration does not know \nwhat the left hand is up to. Lack of leadership trickles down. Is it \nany wonder that teenage drug use is on the rise? Is it any wonder that \nkids are unclear on why it is both harmful and wrong to use drugs? When \nyou do not know where you are going, is it any wonder that you get \nlost? The failure of leadership demands a high price.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/27/senate-section/article/S3035-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
