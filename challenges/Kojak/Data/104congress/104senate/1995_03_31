Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment which \nI will formally introduce later on today or next week depending on flow \nof the business in the Senate. I filed the amendment at the desk. I \nwill call it up later on during the consideration of the matters after \nwe resume at 10 o'clock today per order of the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment which is \nintended to clarify Federal law regarding Federal funding for abortion. \nEssentially, this is a States rights issue. As my colleagues know, the \nHyde amendment has long been in place to restrict the use of Federal \nfunds to pay for abortions under Medicaid. Originally, the only \nexception was for when the life of the mother would be endangered if \nthe fetus were carried to term. Congress passed a modification, one I \nhad long supported, effective October 1, 1993, \n[[Page S4962]] which expanded the exception to pregnancies that were \nthe result of acts of rape or incest. I believe that it was the intent \nof Congress that that modification be permissive and not mandatory on \nthe States.\n  The administration responded to the change in the Hyde amendment by \nissuing a directive dated December 28, 1993, sent to all of the States \nmandating that they pay for abortions resulting from rape and incest as \nwell as involving the life of the mother. The administration, in my \nopinion, used a strained analysis to create such a mandate. It \nstretched the medically necessary justification covering the life of \nthe mother to cover rape and incest, citing what it thought was \ncongressional intent.\n  The issue of payment for abortions to save the life of the mother has \nbeen basically settled. The issue of payment for abortion for rape and \nincest or other reasons has not. Numerous States are in the midst of \nthat debate now. Prior to the administration's Medicaid directive, most \nStates prohibited the use of public funds for abortion with the\n only exception being for the life of the mother, and that includes my \nhome State of Nebraska. Only a handful of other States already paid for \nabortions that were the result of rape and incest. Now several States \nare under the threat of losing their Medicaid funding because they are \nbalking at complying with the Federal directive. States have been \nforced into the position of implementing the directive, often in direct \ncontradiction of their State law, or risk losing much-needed Medicaid \nfunding or carry the argument into court.\n\n  My amendment will give the States the option of using Federal funds \nfor abortion in cases of rape and incest but will not mandate it as the \nadministration and courts are doing as a result of a questionable \ninterpretation of congressional intent.\n  This language was adopted on this bill in full committee in the \nHouse, but was jettisoned by the Rules Committee. As we know, there is \nno comparable committee in the Senate, and any Senator has the right to \ngenerally bring any amendment on this floor. As a result, I offer this \namendment which I believe will clarify the intent of Congress in this \nmatter. This is also a matter of fundamental States rights and the \ndebate should not be preempted by a Federal directive.\n  Finally, here is an appropriate opportunity to clarify and limit the \nscope of a Federal mandate and to respect the role of States and their \nlaw.\n  No lengthy debate is necessary. The issue is simple and \nstraightforward. We make no changes in Federal law requiring States to \nfund abortions under Medicaid when the life of the mother is \nendangered. We would allow the States, at their discretion, to not fund \nabortions for rape and incest.\n  At a proper time I will call up the amendment and urge its adoption.\n  In addition, let me briefly say in the closing time allotted to me, \nMr. President, that at a time when we are hailing the fact that very \nrecently we eliminated by an overwhelming vote in the U.S. Senate and \nin the House of Representatives the matter of mandates to the States, \nhere is a clear case where we can put our votes where our voices have \nbeen in the past. Certainly, we all know that the States pay about 46 \npercent of all the Medicaid bills. It seems to me that this is a clear \ncase that, if we are against mandates, if we are against continued \nfunding required by the States without full compensation as a result of \nthose laws by the Federal Government, that this is a case where I think \nwe should return to what I believe was the intent of the Congress when \nwe expanded the formally known Hyde amendment to allow States--but not \ndirecting them--to fund through Medicaid cases of rape and incest.\n  I think that was a very important step in the right direction when \nthey provided that, as I have long held. But it seems to me that the \nadministration in this case has misinterpreted a principle, a principle \nwhich I thought was very appropriate.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish first to commend the able Senator \nfrom Nebraska for the fine statement he has just made. We have to \nrealize that under the Constitution States do have rights. The Federal \nGovernment has only the authority which has been delegated to it in the \nConstitution. States have the balance of the rights, and we must not \nforget that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Exon amendment. \nLet there be no mistake. This is not a narrow question about whether \nabortions in the case of rape or incest should be funded under \nMedicaid. This is instead a question whether the Clinton administration \nwill succeed in a clever but dishonest stealth campaign to override \nState restrictions on abortion funding and to require Americans to fund \nabortion on demand. That is what is at stake here. Anyone who says \notherwise either doesn't understand the issue or is trying to pull the \nwool over the eyes of the American people.\n  Mr. President, let me explain in some detail the mischief that the \nClinton administration has engaged in for the last year and a half or \nso with respect to the issue of Medicaid funding of abortion. Remember, \nthis is an administration that claims that it wants abortion to be \nrare.\n  In 1993, both Houses of Congress, by impressive margins, passed into \nlaw an expanded version of the Hyde amendment.\n  This Hyde amendment forbids Federal taxpayer funding of abortion \nthrough Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest, or danger to the life \nof the mother. The very purpose of the Hyde amendment was to respect \nand accommodate the decisions by 40 or so States to restrict taxpayer \nfunding of abortion.\n  No one in Congress intended that the Hyde amendment would become a \nvehicle for overriding State restrictions on abortion funding. But this \nis exactly the campaign that the Clinton administration, through the \nactions of its bureaucrats in the Department of Health and Human \nServices, has waged over the past 18 months. In State after State, the \nClinton administration, in concert with pro-abortion groups, has \nattempted to override State restrictions on abortion funding and to \nrequire State taxpayers to fund abortion on demand.\n  Take, for example, what has happened in my State of Utah. On December \n28, 1993, a Clinton administration bureaucrat sent a form letter to the \nState of Utah's Medicaid Director claiming that the Hyde amendment \nrequired Utah to fund abortions in instances where Utah law prohibited \nfunding. In a response dated January 13, 1994, Mr. Rod Betit, the \nexecutive director of the Utah Department of Health, complained about \nthe ``unconscionable catch-22'' that HHS was putting Utah and other \nStates in. Mr. Betit pointed out, among other things, that the HHS \npronouncement ``ignored longstanding principles of cooperation and \nconsultation,'' adopted ``a questionable mandatory interpretation of \npreviously permissive language,'' and ``issue[d] reporting and \ndocumentation requirements that have no basis in Federal law.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of Mr. \nBetit's letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    Utah Department of Health,\n\n                                 Salt Lake City, January 13, 1994.\n     Mr. Bruce C. Vladeck,\n     Administrator, Health Care Financing Administration, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bruce: I appreciate your taking the time to explain \n     Sally Richardson's December 28, 1993 letter during our recent \n     phone conversations. Your assurances that HCFA intends to \n     follow the compliance process with regard to the new abortion \n     mandate in an orderly, nonconfrontational manner is welcome. \n     Nonetheless, I hope that after considering the points in this \n     letter you will agree the prudent course of action would be \n     for HCFA to rescind Sally Richardson's order, and reissue it \n     as an optional policy change after appropriate consultation \n     with the State Medicaid Directors in the form of a true \n     Executive Order.\n       I share Ray Hanley's concerns about how this policy was \n     announced. HCFA's method of issuing their interpretation of \n     the 1993 Hyde Amendment ignored long standing principles of \n     cooperation and consultation between HCFA and the states and \n     threatens to seriously undermine this cooperative \n     relationship. Not only did HCFA assume the responsibility to \n     issue a questionable mandatory interpretation of previously \n     permissive language, HCFA also took upon itself to \n     [[Page S4963]] issue reporting and documentation requirements \n     that have no basis in federal law. Further, HCFA completely \n     ignored the box that this preemptive mandate immediately \n     created for Utah and many other states. While HCFA has agreed \n     to give the states time to resolve the dispute, your mandate \n     has left the states vulnerable to legal action from other \n     parties. Why HCFA would knowingly place states in this \n     unconscionable catch-22, completely escapes me and leaders in \n     other states.\n       Based on research to this point and careful consultation \n     with local and national legal advisors, I continue to believe \n     that HCFA's interpretation of congressional intent may be \n     unsound. The Supreme Court has not decided this issue, having \n     explicitly reserved judgment in William v. Zbaraz, 448 U.S. \n     358, 363 n.5 (1980). The Court has indicated that the intent \n     to mandate abortion coverage should not be presumed, absent \n     clear proof of that intent. Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. 438, 446-47 \n     (1977). Contrary to popular belief,\n      passage of a new federal law does not in and of itself \n     trigger federal supremacy. There has to be clear evidence \n     that Congress intended to override the laws of the 50 \n     states. Sally Richardson's letter indicates that HCFA's \n     interpretation regarding medical necessity is ``(b)ased on \n     the language of this year's Hyde Amendment and on the \n     history of Congressional debate about the circumstances of \n     victims of rape and incest.'' Your assistance in providing \n     specific information to support this assertion is \n     respectfully requested as Utah cannot locate any evidence \n     to support Sally Richardson's claim.\n       In fact, I have reviewed the language of the Hyde Amendment \n     for each year from 1976 through 1993. I see nothing \n     distinctive about the 1993 language that addresses \n     congressional intent to change a permissive policy to a \n     mandatory one. The State Medicaid Manual indicates that the \n     States ``may choose not to fund abortions to the extent they \n     deem appropriate.'' State Medicaid Manual, Part 4, Section \n     4430. This has been federal policy from 1981 through 1992. I \n     fail to see anything in the language of the 1993 version that \n     dictates a change in that policy.\n       Further, I have reviewed the legislative history \n     surrounding the adoption of the 1993 version of Hyde and find \n     nothing conclusive there either. Comments from congressional \n     leaders and their staff in the last 2 weeks would also \n     suggest that no clear proof of intent exists. I am therefore \n     persuaded that a permissive interpretation remains consistent \n     with congressional intent. I also fail to see how that \n     interpretation frustrates national policy in the Medicaid \n     program.\n       Your January 5, 1994 letter to Ray Hanley argues that the \n     absence of Bauman Amendment language since 1983 forces a \n     mandatory interpretation. If this is so, why has the \n     permissive language in the State Medicaid Manual remained \n     unchanged? Further, your interpretation that the Hyde \n     language preempts state law absent an express exception, is \n     in direct conflict with the standard set forth by the Supreme \n     Court in Beal. Have you any case law to support this \n     position?\n       The legislative history surrounding the adoption of the \n     Bauman Amendment in 1981 makes it very clear that it was \n     intended to clarify congressional intent that abortion \n     coverage was permissive. Our research to date, has not \n     uncovered any explicit indication of why it is absent after \n     1983. Your conclusion that its absence automatically compels \n     an interpretation that coverage is mandatory is highly \n     suspect. It can be plausibly argued, and case law supports \n     the interpretation in appropriate cases, that the failure to \n     repeat such language does not appear after 1983, we would \n     appreciate your assistance in resolving this important \n     question.\n       As I indicated to you on the phone, and as the media has \n     publicized, the Utah Department of Health is clearly caught \n     between HCFA's mandate and very explicit state statutes. Utah \n     Code Ann. Sec. 26-18-4(2)(1989) limits coverage to causes \n     where the mother's life is threatened. Violation of this \n     restriction by a public employee is a Class B misdemeanor and \n     could include forfeiture of office. Utah Code Ann. Sec. 26-\n     18-5(3)(1989) anticipates situations where changes in federal \n     law mandate modifications to state law and rule. However, the \n     last clause in this statute says ``providing, the provisions \n     of this section shall not apply to department rules governing \n     abortion.'' I believe the Utah Legislature has clearly \n     indicated that a change, such as coverage for rape and incest \n     related abortion, can only be made after public debate and a \n     decision by that body. This is especially true in this case, \n     where our legal analysis indicates that federal preemption of \n     state law is ambiguous.\n       Your response to the issues raised in this letter will be \n     very helpful to our Legislature. Our session begins on \n     Monday, January 17, 1994 and runs through March 2, 1994. I am \n     sure that this issue will be discussed. We would like to be \n     able to share your response as part of that discussion.\n       I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rod L. Betit,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. The State of Utah, to its credit and to the credit of its \nfine Governor, Mike Leavitt, has refused to acquiesce in the Clinton \nadministration's bureaucratic abuses. Predictably, the Clinton \nadministration has even threatened to cut off Utah's participation in \nMedicaid unless Utah violates its own laws restricting abortion \nfunding. On December 28, 1994, an HHS bureaucrat cited Utah for \nsupposed noncompliance with Medicaid requirements.\n  Another key component of the administration's stealth campaign to \nrequire taxpayer funding of abortion on demand has been to work hand-\nin-hand with pro-abortion groups to file lawsuits against States that \ncontinued to enforce their restrictions on abortion funding. In January \nof this year, a pro-abortion group sued to void Utah's restrictions on \nabortion funding. Similar lawsuits have already succeeded in a number \nof other States.\n  Mr. President, Congress did not intend through the Hyde amendment to \noverride State restrictions on abortion funding. Yet the administration \nhas been using the Hyde amendment in pursuit of its agenda of funding \nabortion on demand. The administration's arguments have, admittedly, \nbeen clever. Clever but mischievous. Clever but dishonest. Clever but \nunfaithful to the clear intent of Congress. Clever but contemptuous of \nthe right of the people in each State to determine whether and when to \nfund abortion.\n  To my colleagues, I say that the question on the Exon amendment is \nclear. If you believe that a policy of requiring States to fund \nabortion on demand should be imposed by stealth, then vote with the \nClinton administration and against the Exon amendment. But if you \nbelieve that the rights of State taxpayers and the clear intent of \nCongress in passing the Hyde amendment should be respected, then join \nSenator Exon and me and others in voting for his amendment.\n  I commend the distinguished Senator from Nebraska for this amendment. \nIt is a good amendment. He is a good man. He is doing what is right \nhere, and I support him. I hope that the Clinton administration will \nback off and realize that the Senator from Nebraska is right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to address the future of \nthe Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 and its impact on U.S. \nnational security. In my view, the administration's policy toward the \nABM Treaty is fundamentally flawed and should be reconsidered. By \nseeking to perpetuate and expand the coverage of a treaty that is \nfundamentally outdated, the administration has created a number of \nproblems. Let me briefly discuss these and offer an alternative \napproach.\n  The ABM Treaty was intended to be the central feature of an arms \ncontrol regime that would balance and stabilize the United States-\nSoviet strategic relationship. This agreement, as much as anything \nelse, symbolizes the cold war doctrine of mutual assured destruction, \nor MAD--a belief that if the United States and the Soviet Union remain \nequally vulnerable to massive nuclear retaliation, neither side will \nhave an incentive to attack the other.\n  Today the cold war is over. And while the United States and Russia \nstill differ over a variety of issues, there is no reason to perpetuate \nan adversarial relationship. Unfortunately, many government officials \nin Russia and the United States continue to cling to fundamentally \noutdated, cold war attitudes and policies.\n  The way the administration has handled the ABM Treaty is a glaring \nillustration of this problem. Rather than seeking to define a new \nUnited States-Russian strategic relationship, the administration has \ndecided to reaffirm a relationship based on mutual vulnerability and \nthe threat of retaliation.\n  Instead of seeking to replace or evolve the ABM Treaty regime, the \nadministration is committed to preserving and even expanding the core \nprinciples of the ABM Treaty. It has sought to extend the philosophy of \nmutual vulnerability in two ways--by agreeing to multilateralize the \ntreaty, and by attempting to extend its limitations to theater missile \ndefense systems, which the treaty does not cover.\n  By multilateralizing the ABM Treaty, the United States is not only \nendorsing the continuation of mutual vulnerability, but is also \ninserting this concept into its relationship with several of the New \nIndependent States of the former Soviet Union. Moreover, by including \nthese countries in the ABM Treaty, we would give them a significant \nvoice in, if not a veto over, key U.S. decisions on missile defense.\n  [[Page S4964]] This is even more troubling when viewed in the context \nof what the administration is doing to capture theater missile defense \nsystems under the ABM Treaty. The administration has shown a \nwillingness, if not an eagerness, to include detailed performance \nlimitations on theater missile defense systems. Under the guise of \nclarification, the administration has come up with nothing short of a \nnew treaty regulating theater missile defenses.\n  The administration's overall approach to the ABM Treaty poses three \noverlapping problems, which might be viewed as near-term, mid-term, and \nlong-term problems. Let me address each of these in turn and offer what \nI believe to be logical and achievable solutions.\n  In the near-term, the United States must respond to an expanding \narray of theater ballistic missile threats by developing and deploying \nhighly effective theater missile defenses. These threats are an \nundeniable and salient part of the new security environment. Thanks to \nthe efforts of U.S. industry and our military\n services, we are well positioned to acquire highly effective theater \nmissile defenses and to allow these capabilities to grow along with the \nthreat.\n\n  Unfortunately, the administration's current approach threatens to \npreclude promising theater missile defense options and establish an \nartificial technological ceiling on the growth of those systems that we \ndo deploy. This approach is strategically unwise and legally \nunnecessary.\n  The solution to this problem is relatively straightforward. The ABM \nTreaty simply states that non-ABM systems may not be given capabilities \nto counter strategic ballistic missiles and may not be tested in an ABM \nmode. Nothing in the treaty talks about the performance of non-ABM \nsystems and it would be very unwise for us to get into the business of \nregulating these systems now.\n  The answer is simply to define what a strategic ballistic missile is \nand to establish as a matter of U.S. policy or law that theater missile \ndefense systems comply with the ABM Treaty unless they are actually \ntested against a strategic ballistic missile. A commonly used \ndefinition of a strategic ballistic missile, which the United States \nand Russia have already agreed upon, is a missile that has a range \ngreater than 3,500 kilometers or a velocity in excess of 5 kilometers \nper second. If this definition were used, the United States and Russia \nwould be free to develop and deploy a wide range of highly effective \ntheater missile defense systems without having fundamentally altered \nthe letter or intent of the ABM Treaty.\n  Even if we take this step, however, we will still be faced with a \nmid-term problem. U.S. territory will inevitably face new ballistic \nmissile threats, which our theater missile defense systems are not \nbeing designed to counter. North Korea already has an ICBM program in \ndevelopment and other countries will almost certainly be able to \nexploit readily available technology in order to acquire such \ncapabilities. The administration is simply not preparing adequately for \nthis threat.\n  If the United States is to deal with this problem in an effective \nmanner, the ABM Treaty will have to be altered to allow for the \ndeployment of a robust national missile defense system. While we can \nbegin immediately with the development of a national defense system \nthat is in compliance with the ABM Treaty, eventually we will need \nrelief from the treaty. This will be necessary in order to cover all \nAmericans adequately and equally. Deployment of several ground-based \nmissile defense sites, perhaps supplemented by enhanced mobile systems, \ncould provide a limited, yet comprehensive defense of the United \nStates. This could be achieved with relatively modest changes to the \nABM Treaty, changes that would not undermine United States or Russian \nconfidence in their deterrent forces.\n  But even if we accomplish this goal, we would still be left with a \nlong-term problem having to do with the fundamental purpose of the ABM \nTreaty. Ultimately, if the United States and Russia are to establish \nnormal relations and put the cold war behind them, they will have to do \naway with the doctrine of mutual assured destruction, which lies at the \nheart of the ABM Treaty. This can and should be a cooperative process, \none that leads to a form of strategic stability more suited for the \npost-cold-war world. Such a form of stability might be called mutual \nassured security and should be based on a balance of strategic \noffensive forces and strategic defensive forces. We must once and for \nall do away with the notion that defense is destabilizing and that \nvulnerability equals deterrence.\n  If the United States and Russia are serious about reducing their \nstrategic nuclear forces to levels much below those contained in the \nSTART II agreement, we must be able to fill the void with missile \ndefenses. We can do this cooperatively with Russia and other concerned \nparties, but we must make it clear that the United States is intent on \nevolving away from an offense-only policy of deterrence. We will \nundoubtedly require strategic nuclear forces for the foreseeable future \nto deter a broad range of threats, but in a world of diverse and \nunpredictable threats, we can no longer rely on these exclusively.\n  Mr. President, I hope the administration will reconsider the range of \nproblems I have discussed today. I believe that there are reasonable \nsolutions within reach, if only we seek them. An incremental approach \nthat deals with these problems in phases may facilitate cooperation and \nhelp wean both sides away from the comfortable yet outdated patterns of \nthe cold war.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the need for legal \nreform in America. Our civil justice system is broken. The changes in \nour tort law system that were introduced 30 years ago had merit, but \nlike many other aspects of our society, what began as a good idea has \nbeen the subject of ceaseless expansion and is now totally out of hand. \nWe are now by far the most litigious country on Earth, and we are \npaying a huge price as the result.\n  Mr. President, I come to this issue from a different perspective than \nmost of my colleagues. I am not a lawyer. I am a doctor. I have seen \nfirsthand day in and day out what the threat of litigation has done to \nAmerican medicine. I have watched my colleagues every day order \ndiagnostic tests--CT scans, blood tests, MRI scans, \nelectrocardiograms--that were many times costly and unnecessary for the \ngood of the patient. They were ordered for one simple reason--to create \na paper trail to protect them in the event a lawsuit would ever be \nfiled. It is called defensive medicine, and it happens every day in \nevery hospital throughout America. It alters the practice of medicine \nand drives the cost of health care higher and higher.\n  Mr. President, I have also treated patients who were injured by \nallegedly defective products or in automobile accidents, and I have \nwatched as their families were contacted by lawyers, urging them to sue \nbefore anyone knew the real facts of the accident.\n  Mr. President, I know we will face stiff opposition, but changes must \nbe made in our legal system. It is costing us billions of dollars each \nand every year and, perhaps more importantly, it is turning us into a \nnation of victims.\n  Our product liability laws are a particular area in need of reform. \nOur present system costs this Nation between $80 and $120 billion a \nyear. A 1993 Brookings Institution survey found that pain and suffering \nawards alone cost American consumers $7 billion each year.\n  Mr. President, 50 to 70 percent of every dollar spent on products \nliability today is paid to lawyers.\n  What really is the problem? It is fashionable to talk about the big \nverdict cases, cases like the customer at McDonald's who spilled hot \ncoffee in her lap, or the fleeing felon in New \n[[Page S4965]] York who was shot by police, only to recover a $4 \nmillion verdict against the police department.\n  But those cases are just symptoms of the illness. The heart of the \nproblem is that our civil justice system does not effectively weed out \nspecious claims that lack merit.\n  Our judicial system has built in rules that are meant to do that, but \nthey simply do not work well. The summary judgment mechanism is one and \nrule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is another. \nUnfortunately, if you ask most defense lawyers, they will tell you that \nsummary judgments are rarely granted, and rule-11 sanctions are almost \nnever imposed.\n  As a result, almost any case that is filed today stands a good chance \nof getting to the jury. And, Mr. President, given the unpredictable \nnature of juries, not to mention the staggering cost of defense, \nbusinesses and insurance companies simply make the decision to settle \nthe case rather than play Russian roulette with the jury. Day after day \nin this country, insurance companies and businesses pay $25,000, \n$50,000, $75,000, or more, to plaintiffs who have filed cases which \nlack merit, either factually or legally.\n  So who pays for all this? The American people do. Insurance companies \nsimply pass the costs along in higher premiums and businesses pass the \nhigher premiums along in higher product costs. We spend five times more \nof our economy on tort claims than our Japanese or German competitors. \nThis makes our American products more expensive, and eventually it \nchases American products from the marketplace.\n  One example that I am personally familiar with is a device called the \nleft ventricular assist device, essentially a type of artificial heart. \nThe product is housed in a clear polyurethane cover. Without it, many \npatients would die as they waited for a transplant.\n  The device allows them to live for weeks and sometimes months as they \nawait a donor heart. Unfortunately, because of the rash of recent \nlawsuits involving medical devices which contain polyurethane component \nparts, the polyurethane manufacturers are simply threatening to pull \ntheir product from the marketplace saying they cannot afford to produce \nthe product anymore. That means it will not be used in a broad range of \ndevices.\n  Mr. President, if that happens, who will the makers of this device \nturn to for that polyurethane housing? And if they are unable to find a \nsupplier, the device simply cannot be made and, I can tell you, based \non firsthand experience, that patients will die because they will not \nhave that bridge to transplantation available. I have transplanted \nthese patients before. Without it, they would not be alive today.\n  Mr. President, to those who say that litigation costs are not the \ncause of products vanishing from the marketplace, just ask Cessna \nAircraft Corp. They quit making small planes 9 years ago because of \nliability concerns. But thanks to last year's legal reform that limited \nan aircraft manufacturer's liability for planes over 18 years old, they \nannounced on March 15 of this year that they would, once again, start \nmaking planes.\n  Mr. President, tort reform will make a difference. The real problem \nis that our juries are taking the place of our legislatures in \ndetermining which products offer enough utility that they should remain \nin the marketplace, despite their risk. We now trust juries to redesign \nairplane engines, to rewrite product warnings, to second-guess medical \ndiagnoses, and even to place values on the price of a human life.\n  It is because of runaway jury verdicts that you no longer see many \nAmerican manufacturers of football helmets, or diving boards at pools \nof motels, and you can no longer get a money-back guarantee if your \npizza is not delivered within a specified time. And maybe--just maybe--\nthose things are good. But the point is that they should not be decided \nby juries. They should be decided by people through their elected \nrepresentatives, not by those juries in courtrooms where the rules of \nevidence are confining and, in so many instances, the real story is \nnever told.\n  So who stands in the way of legal reform? Who will attack us over the \nnext several weeks as this is introduced? Unfortunately, that great \ntriumvirate of federalism--the plaintiffs' bar, the consumer groups led \nby Ralph Nader, and President Clinton. In a recent article in the \nWashington Times, Judge Robert Bork pointed out the fallacy of this \nnewfound federalism argument that has been floated by the plaintiffs' \nlawyers. Our Framers valued local decisionmaking, and they wanted to \navoid a centralized government that would control every aspect of our \nlives, but they also recognized that Federal regulation can be \nimportant.\n  One important factor that the Framers considered in drafting the \nConstitution was the need to have centralized control over commerce and \ntrade. Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist No. 11, wrote about his \nconcern that diverse and conflicting State regulations would be an \nimpediment to American merchants. But today, we have a similar threat: \nOur unrestrained and unpredictable civil justice system.\n  Today, placing an article manufactured in Tennessee into the stream \nof commerce will be enough to subject a Tennessee merchant to suits in \nall 50 States. Aside from the obvious inconvenience, the laws of each \nof these States may, and in all likelihood will, be different from \nthose laws in Tennessee--laws with which the merchant is familiar and \nwhich he may have used as a guideline in manufacturing and selling his \nproduct.\n  If we are going to allow the merchant to be hauled into court in any \nof the 50 jurisdictions in which this product may eventually be \npurchased, should we not try to provide some predictability, some \ncentralized manner over the methods by which the dispute will be \nresolved? Should we not bring some predictability and some common sense \nto the issue? I think we should, and I think the federalism argument, \nin this case, is, at best, a red herring.\n  I fully anticipate that the President of the United States will \noppose our legal reform efforts at every turn. But it will not be \nbecause he believes the effort is wrong or because he has suddenly \nfound the 10th amendment. Instead, it will likely be because of his \ncozy relationship with the plaintiffs' trial bar. The American Trial \nLawyers Association said in 1992 in a fundraising letter that President \nClinton would, and I quote, ``never fail to do the right thing where we \ntrial lawyers are concerned.'' And so far, they have been right, but it \nis time to change that.\n  The real victims of our failing justice system are the would-be \nplaintiffs, the victims themselves. The legislation which has been \npassed in the House and which will soon be discussed in this body will \nnot prevent a plaintiff with a meritorious claim from suing and \nrecovering. In fact, it will improve his or her chances. The courts \nwill be clogged with fewer spurious lawsuits, and cases that now lag \nfor 2, 3, or 4 years will move more quickly. Plaintiffs' lawyers will \nno longer be able to disregard reasonable settlement proposals and let \ncases sit for years. They will be required to evaluate the case in a \ntimely manner and act in a manner that is in the best interest of their \nclient. They will be less likely to simply roll the dice, hoping for \nthe big hit.\n  The family which has suffered and which has medical expenses and lost \nwages and which really needs help is at the mercy of plaintiffs' \nlawyers who have plenty of cases and can afford to gamble. If they lose \nand they take nothing, they move on to the next case. But their clients \nhave only 1 day in court.\n  Mr. President, legal reform will not hurt anyone, except perhaps the \nplaintiffs' trial lawyers, but they have had their way for too long. \nSimply put, it is time that we stop letting the tail wag the dog.\n  I look forward to these legal reform hearings, and I truly hope that \nwe will enact meaningful reforms which will make our civil justice \nsystem more responsible, more accessible, more predictable and, most \nimportantly, more equitable.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/31/senate-section/article/S4964-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4965-S4966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     REGISTRATION OF MASS MAILINGS\n\n  The filing date for 1995 first quarter mass mailings is April 25, \n1995.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle], for himself, \n     Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. \n     Kohl, proposes an amendment numbered 445.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have had a good debate now for the \nlast couple of days on the issue of rescissions and the need to provide \nsupplemental funding for the Federal Emergency Management \nAdministration, FEMA.\n  What we have not had a good debate about, however, is about \npriorities, and about values, what it is we ought to do with the \nresources, as limited as they are, that we have available.\n  It is our view we ought to have a debate of that kind, and we ought \nto consider where it is we want to put resources, how it is we want to \ndirect those resources to affect the greatest number of people and do \nthe most good.\n  That is what this amendment intends to do. This amendment recognizes \nthat there really is a twofold purpose in what it is we are trying to \ndo with this bill.\n  We are obviously trying to ensure that FEMA has the adequate \nresources necessary to continue the extraordinary job that they do in \nproviding emergency assistance to communities all over the country. But \nwe are also very sensitive to the need to continue to move ahead with \nmeaningful deficit reduction.\n  This session of Congress has been devoted in large measure to \nprocedural questions about how it is we bring down the debt. I am very \ndisappointed by the fact that, frankly, our best procedural effort to \ndo that in a meaningful way, a budget resolution, which is required \nfrom the Budget Committee tomorrow, will not occur at the time required \nby law.\n  While we talked about procedure, the majority has been unwilling so \nfar to use the procedure we already have to do exactly what we say we \nneed to do.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I am disappointed that we have failed to \nproduce the budget resolution necessary to accomplish what we say we \nreally need here.\n  Mr. President, the issue of priorities, as we consider deficit \nreduction, brings Members to the floor on many occasions. Again, it \ndoes this morning. We recognize while we need to reduce the deficit, we \nalso recognize that the long-term deficit is going to be determined in \npart by the needs of Americans who may depend upon the Federal \nGovernment, and by the ability they have to go out and become \nmeaningful, productive, taxpaying citizens.\n  The only way we can ensure working families have the capacity to be \nproductive, taxpaying citizens, is that we invest in their future with \nwhat limited resources we have.\n  The amendment that I am proposing this morning--and supported, I \nwould say, by the overwhelming majority if not all of our colleagues on \nthe Democratic side--is an amendment that simply says ``Whatever else \nwe do to reduce the deficit, the one thing we ought to do is to be \ncognizant of how important it is that we protect our children and the \ninvestment that we need to make in children.''\n  This amendment would simply allow Members to tell 1 million children \nacross the country that it is our intention to help them, that it is \nour commitment to them and to deficit reduction, both, that we hope to \narticulate in this amendment.\n  Our legislation would provide protection for 5,000 children when it \ncomes to child care. We want to tell working families that we want them \nto go out there and do the best they can to generate the income that \ntheir talents will allow, and we will try to assist where it can be \nprovided with the child care needs they have, in order to be a \nproductive and an involved working citizen.\n  Child care is the first installment of a multiple array of tools that \ncan help working families do their job better. The same in Head Start. \nWe want to protect 9,000 children in the Head Start Program who \notherwise will be cut off, who otherwise will not have the opportunity \nto begin their early childhood development in a meaningful way, and to \nensure that when the time comes they can become good students, good \nworking people and good family members. That is what Head Start does. \nAnd we are hoping to protect the 9,000 people who otherwise will be cut \nout, without the advantages of this amendment.\n  We are also telling those young adults, those young Americans who \nwant very much to be able to go to college and at the same time help \ntheir country, that we remember them as we change our deficit \npriorities. We want to tell 36,000 young people that it is important to \ngo out through national service and develop the capacity they need, to \ngo to college, to learn skills, to do the things necessary to become \nimportant and taxpaying citizens in this country.\n  No one denies the incredible impact that the Women, Infants, and \nChildren Program has. We will tell 70,000 mothers and children that we \nwill help them as well, not by increasing the deficit.\n  I emphasize here that this amendment is completely paid for by \nshifting priorities to allow Congress to reduce the deficit but protect \nwomen, infants, and children in the program that has demonstrated a \nremarkable capacity to assist young families as they begin to meet the \nchallenges of life.\n  We also recognize that school is critical. If we are going to invest \nproperly in families, in working families, we have to ensure that our \ninvestment in education is adequately provided.\n  Aid to schools, impact aid, is of critical importance. And under the \npending bill, $16 million overall will be lost. In my State of South \nDakota, over one-half million dollars would be lost. The impact that \nwill have on schools that rely upon this funding, as I indicated \n[[Page S4967]] over the last couple of days, would be devastating.\n  We want to say, without equivocation, when it comes to priorities, \neducation is at the top of the list. Only the educated are free. Only \nthe free can participate adequately in democracy. Only if we ensure \nadequate educational investment can we ensure the freedom that we so \ndearly love in this country. Aid to schools, and providing better \nschools for almost 1 million students is what this amendment does as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, I will have much more to say about the amendment and \nabout what we are attempting to do later on this morning.\n  Let me emphasize how important this amendment is. How important it is \nthat we provide adequate funding for FEMA. How important it is that we \nprovide meaningful deficit reduction, but at the same time that we meet \nthose two objectives. It is critical that we protect 1 million children \nwho otherwise would be cut out of needed assistance.\n  Mr. President, I will return to the floor shortly to say more about \nthe amendment and about our intentions with regard to this investment. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I want to commend our \nleader, Senator Daschle, for the work in developing this amendment \nwhich he has proposed, and which I welcome the opportunity to \ncosponsor. I find this a compelling amendment, and as Senator Daschle \nmentioned yesterday, I believe that we will develop bipartisan support.\n  Basically, the focus of this amendment is on children and education. \nWe have some other features in there with such as the national service \nprogram, but it is primarily an amendment that reflects our priorities \non education and children.\n  What it is saying regarding these programs included in those \nrescissions is there were appropriations which went through the \nlegislative process, went through the House and Senate, and were signed \nby the President of the United States. The programs include Head Start, \nchapter 1, school reform programs, and day care programs. There are \nfamilies out there across America that were depending on those \nprograms. There are mothers and fathers who believed that their \nchildren were going to be involved in the Head Start Program and they \ncould count on it. There are mothers and fathers who thought that their \nchildren would participate in the chapter 1 program, a program \nredeveloped and redesigned, refashioned with strong bipartisan support \nlast year to improve it. There are parents who had believed they might \nbe able to improve themselves and the lives of their children because \nday care programs would now be available to them.\n  I looked forward to the debate on this amendment. The amendment \nitself was responsible in terms of its offset, although I think it is \ncommendable in any respect. I think it would have been important for us \nto debate this issue. It has been in the works for some period of time. \nThe leader had indicated yesterday that we were going to offer this \namendment. We had heard last night from the majority leader--after \nthere was a whole debate on matters that were not directly related to \nthese rescissions all day long, after many of us had been on the floor \nin the early afternoon looking for the opportunity to debate this \namendment--that we could debate these amendments. Where are the \namendments? When are we going to deal with them? Can we get a time \nagreement?\n  Now we are notified that that particular measure is going to be \npulled, withdrawn, effectively denying us the opportunity to debate \nthis particular measure. As I understand it, in its place is going to \nbe a conference report. I will have more to say about that report, and \nI think other Members will have more to say about later in the morning \nabout how it treats a handful of individuals who are trying to escape \npaying their fair share of the tax system and escape all kinds of tax \nresponsibility.\n  I think one of the key elements of where we are as a Congress has \nbeen the issue of priorities and where we are going as a Congress. We \nhad, over the period of this past week, in our committee, our Human \nResource Committee, the repeal of Davis-Bacon legislation which had \nbeen in effect for some 60 years. This repeal will diminish the \neconomic power of construction workers whose average income is $27,000 \na year. We are in the middle of an economic assault on working \nfamilies.\n  We have also had the assault on the President's proposal which would \nensure that we were not going to further and encourage the whole \nstriker replacement worker phenomenon that has been taking place across \nthis country, weakening the economic rights of working families.\n  We have seen the purchasing power of average workers in this country \ndecline dramatically over the period of recent years. Many of us have \nbeen pointing out that we ought to consider those particular measures \nagainst what is happening to the other members of their families, to \ntheir children in this instance, to the care of their children and the \neducation of their children. We expected to have that opportunity now \nto make that case in terms of the Head Start programs, which have been \ntried and tested and reshaped and supported by Republicans and \nDemocrats, by funding for the chapter 1 programs, by the return of the \nsummer job programs, the voluntary service programs, the President's \nnational service program.\n  We have seen these programs cut at a time where we see, over in the \nHouse of Representatives, the leadership talking about using these cuts \nto provide tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals and corporations in \nthis country. These are legitimate public policy issues and questions \nthe American people ought to have an opportunity to express their views \non through their elected representatives.\n  I think these are the questions being put to the U.S. Senate today to \ndebate and discuss in this amendment that had been worked by the \nminority leader. We had heard earlier today, if he offered this \namendment, there were going to be parliamentary maneuvers to try to \nsecond-degree it so we could not have, effectively, the debate and \ndiscussion on it.\n  Mr. President, we know there is the power to be able to do that. But \nI, for one, would certainly have urged the leader to continue to offer \nthis particular proposal in form after form until he was at least given \nthe opportunity for an up-or-down vote on his amendment, a position \nwhich has the strong support from many on this side and, hopefully, \neven from some on the other side.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to just make very clear I am very hopeful \nwe will come back to this measure and that we will debate the \nrescissions here in the U.S. Senate, that we are going to come back and \nwe are going to have an opportunity at that time to talk about this \namendment. It affects $42 million in Head Start programs, $2.5 million \nin Healthy Start programs that will help 8,000 to 10,000 low-income \nchildren who lose nutrition assistance during their preschool years; \n$8.4 million in child care funds that will deny 5,000 children of \nworking families the support they need for day care.\n  There are only about 4 or 5 percent of our working families that are \nable to afford decent child care. We have a program to try to provide \nassistance to working mothers for child care programs. These funds had \nbeen appropriated, and this rescission cuts $8.4 million in that child \ncare program and $1.3 million in children's mental health. It \neliminates services in 11 sites and 11 States to children with mental \nand emotional disorders. The amendment would have restored the funding \nunder chapter 1 for 70,000 educationally disadvantaged children who \nhave special needs, the $55 million in the Goals 2000 that would have \nprovided help and assistance to 13,000 school districts across this \ncountry, to try to strengthen, at the local level, academic achievement \nand accomplishment; the support for safe and drug-free schools.\n  Those particular funds provide a combination of resources for safety \nin schools. I will bet there are a score of politicians making speeches \nright now about the importance of safety in schools. Well, here we had \nan opportunity to do something about it. We have an opportunity to \nrestore some funds for safety in schools, and $100 million that had \nbeen actually appropriated is being withdrawn. We want to put that \nback.\n  We have the $30 million School-to-Work Program. The School-to-Work \n[[Page S4968]] Program is going to be the basis of a major overhaul of \ntraining programs, the concept of which has been basically accepted by \nRepublican leaders in the House and the Senate as being a key element \nin revamping of youth training programs. School-to-Work has strong \nbipartisan support to provide some opportunity for the 70 percent of \nthe children who do not go on to higher education, to move them from \nschool into work, the partnership between the private and the public \nsectors. There was $30 million that would have been eliminated for \nthem.\n  The amendment would have restored the TRIO Program, $11 million for \nthe TRIO Program which has been one of the most successful programs for \nthe disadvantaged students, to give them the help and assistance in \nterms of education support and health support.\n  Education technology--$5 million for education technology. What you \nlearn in the schools is directly related to what you are going to earn. \nWe have a deficiency in terms of technology in the schools across this \ncountry and a very significant imbalance in technology availability \nbetween the wealthier schools, both private and public, and the most \ndisadvantaged schools. We have developed a small technology program. \nThat program had been cut back.\n  There is also a cutback in the national service program, even though \nthe service program had been worked out with Republicans and Democrats \nalike, and we had agreed to phase in the funding--$300, $500, $700 \nmillion over 3 years. Yet we see a significant reduction in funding for \nthat program.\n  We have already seen some positive returns from the national service \nprogram, as well as other programs that are related to youth and youth \ntraining, programs designed to do something about young people, with a \nnumber of them having dropped out of school. We lose about 400,000 \nyoung people a year. In many instances, they are individuals who do not \nhave a sense of hope or a sense of opportunity or a sense of future, \nand they are the ones who fall into trouble in their local communities \nand are a source of trouble in terms of the law. We have been revamping \nand reshaping and improving many of these programs. Yet they are being \ncut.\n  So many work force training programs are being effectively \neliminated, and this eliminates an opportunity to do something for the \neducation and training and employment of young people. The Daschle \namendment shows a sensitivity to these programs by restoring them.\n  Mr. President, I think we should have had a discussion about where \nthe priorities are in this body. We should have been given an \nopportunity to debate these questions. The Daschle amendment had been \nthought through, and its shaping had been given a good deal of \nattention.\n  It is a thoughtful, responsive amendment that restores many of the \ncuts that are going to be particularly harsh on children and education. \nThose are not areas that we ought to be cutting back. Those are areas \nin which we ought to be investing more. Certainly, just throwing money \nat problems is not the answer, but how we allocate resources is a \npretty clear indication of what our Nation's priorities really are.\n  What we know is that when you have decent, good, effective education \nprograms and you cut back on them, what is happening is that you are \nbasically increasing social costs and decreasing revenues in the long \nterm for this country. It makes no sense at all.\n  We, I think, deserve an opportunity to debate these issues. When the \nmeasure comes back, we will have an opportunity to do so, not only in \nthis amendment but also in follow-on amendments that will target \neducation and target children's issues. So we will have a chance to \nspeak to these issues.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with the leader and the \nscore of other cosponsors of this amendment in debating these issues \nlater.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last week Republicans in the other body \npassed a bill that pokes huge holes in the social safety net for \nAmerica's children. Their welfare reform bill guts the School Lunch \nProgram and other programs that kids rely on for nutritious meals. Now, \nin the Senate, we are debating a rescissions bill that will slash \nanother set of programs that are so critical to these very same \nchildren.\n  I am talking about Head Start, the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant Program, and Summer Jobs for Youth, among others.\n  The rescissions bill cuts Head Start by $42 million, even though the \nHouse did not cut funding for this program at all. As a result, 9,000 \nchildren will lose the chance to get a head start on learning. Head \nStart is a comprehensive child development program, addressing a wide \nrange of critical needs: health, nutrition, social. Perhaps most \nimportant, it puts a premium on parent involvement and helps to forge a \nbond between parents and their children's education.\n  The Child Care and Development Block Grant Program was cut by $8.4 \nmillion. Again the House bill had not cut. This 20 percent reduction \nmeans that 5,000 fewer kids will qualify for child care assistance. \nThere are an estimated 21 million children who live below 200 percent \nof the poverty line in this country. About 8 million of them live with \na single parent who works at least part time or with two parents who \nboth work at least part time. These 8 million children are members of \nworking families whose income make them eligible for child care \nassistance. In fiscal year 1993, only about 750,000 of these kids \nactually got assistance.\n  Now, we are considering a bill that will drop another 5,000 children \nfrom the program. Some of these kids live in homes where, without \nassistance, their mothers will not be able to afford to work. Low-\nincome families already pay 27 percent of their income on child care--\nit is ridiculous to think that they can afford to spend more than that.\n  S. 617 cuts all funding for the 1996 Summer Jobs for Youth. This \nmeans that about 615,00 young men and women--1,300 in North Dakota--\nwill not work. According to a 1995 Labor Department report, the program \ngreatly increases the summer employment rates for participating youth. \nResearchers estimate that, for every three jobs provided under the \nprogram, two young people worked who otherwise would not have.\n  I just do not understand why some would want to slash successful \nprograms like these. I agree with my colleagues that we should pay for \nwhat we appropriate for disaster assistance. However, this bill asks \nthat children and low-income families pay a disproportionate share of \nthe check.\n  I support the Daschle amendment to restore much needed funding for \nthese programs. It channels resources where they belong, in our \nchildren. It supports nutritional assistance, training and education, \nand housing, and it is fully paid for.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Daschle \namendment to H.R. 1158, supplemental appropriations and rescissions \nbill, that would restore funding to many important programs that aid \nchildren and support housing programs. This amendment restores valuable \nfunding for several programs that support and educate our children. Few \nprograms are as important to the future to our country as the program \nthat assists our Nation's children.\n  Mr. President, the Daschle amendment also preserves $36 million of \nfunding for the Community Development Financial Institutions [CDFI] \nFund. This amount falls short of the original $125 million, however, I \nbelieve it is a good first step to address the critical problems that \nexist in our economically distressed communities.\n  I have long been committed to empowering disadvantaged and minority \ncommunities to help themselves and to invest in their own communities. \nWhile I recognize the need to cut the Federal deficit, I believe it is \nimportant to achieve the national policy goals of revitalizing \ncommunities, increasing access to credit and investment capital, \npromoting entrepreneurship, and rebuilding private markets in \ndistressed neighborhoods.\n  As in other States, Colorado's cities have neighborhoods which lack \naccess to resources for business and economic development. I know that \nmany rural communities in Colorado have never had proper access to \ncredit and banking services. Many of them have no \n[[Page S4969]] lender who wants to give them a chance or give them \nhope. But, in fact, there are many creative entrepreneurs in our rural \ncommunities who are idea rich, but resource poor.\n  Mr. President, I believe community development financial institutions \nwill open new markets for conventional lenders while giving borrowers \naccess to previously unreachable sources for capital and credit. \nCommunity development financial institutions are specifically dedicated \nto revitalization. They possess specialized expertise in community \ndevelopment and are successful in tailoring loan products and services \nto meet the needs of low-income and minority communities.\n  In the case of native American communities, reservations generally \nare among the most disinvested and poor areas with weak economies. \nThese communities, in particular, are in desperate need of creative \nbanking and financial services. I believe the CDFI fund is a first step \nand an important step in addressing these critical needs.\n  The CDFI fund is a next generation Federal initiative that combines \nprivate entrepreneurship, extensive leveraging of Federal dollars and a \nstrong commitment to self-help credit. I believe the CDFI fund will \nfill market niches that banks and other conventional lenders are not \nserving, especially in native American communities, and provide bridges \nbetween unconventional borrowers and conventional lenders.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment offered \nby the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader's amendment is the pending \nbusiness.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 446 to Amendment No. 445\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole] for Mr. Ashcroft, for \n     himself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Gregg, and \n     Mr. Nickles, proposes an amendment numbered 446 to amendment \n     No. 445.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, I am not certain how \nmuch longer this bill will be on the floor, because it is pretty \nobvious to this Senator that what we have here is a political exercise \nby the other side.\n  If the President of the United States does not want this bill, it is \nall right with me. But he is not going to get the other bill, either, \nthe one on defense.\n  So I would just say to the White House, if they are serious about \nreducing spending, as the President indicates he is from time to time, \nand if they really want the first supplemental, the defense \nsupplemental that passed that is now in conference, then I think they \nhad better go to work on what has become nothing but a political \nexercise. And that is what we are about to engage in here today. That \nis certainly the right of every Senator.\n  But my view is that if there is all this concern about children, I \ndid not see it expressed when we had the balanced budget amendment up \nhere. Some of the speakers voted for the balanced budget last year and \nagainst it this year. I do not know why they forgot about the children \nfor the next 10, 15, or 20 years if we do not balance the budget and \nmake tough choices. But some never make tough choices. They make tough \nspeeches, and then they want to come back and add some here, add some \nhere, and add some here.\n  I must say, in every case in the so-called Daschle amendment, there \nare already additions in spending in all of these programs. But they \nwant to add just a little more so they can come to the floor and make \nthis political argument that somehow they are going to protect the \nchildren and we are going to destroy the children of America. I mean, \nit is nonsense. It is preposterous. It is ludicrous.\n  So the amendment we have offered will give Senators in this body who \nwant to have real spending cuts the opportunity to vote ``aye''--real \nspending cuts.\n  IRS, $100 million--that ought to be a favorite of everybody; \nAmeriCorps, $206 million; foreign operations, $91 million; Corporation \nfor Public Broadcasting, $47 million--all the President's budget cuts, \n$337 million. Surely the Democrats will vote for that.\n  Legal Services Corporation, about $6 million; Radio Free Europe, $98 \nmillion; youth bill, $38 million, for a total of $927 million in real \ncuts. It does not devastate any of these programs, but they are real \ncuts.\n  I want to congratulate my colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, the \nSenator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, and the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Santorum, for their initiative.\n  I guess I did miss a couple. The actual total would be $1.3 billion, \nwhich will be discussed by my colleagues from Arizona, Missouri, and \nPennsylvania.\n  We would like to have a time agreement on this amendment. We would \nlike to make some progress on this bill, and we would like to also vote \non the Daschle substitute, although there could be additional second-\ndegree amendments to it.\n  Then at 12 o'clock or shortly thereafter, we would take up the \nconference report dealing with self-employed. It is very important we \ndo that today because April 15 is not far away and, hopefully, the \nPresident--I am certain he would--sign it as quickly as he receives it, \nso that we will be reinstating the 25-percent deduction. Many people \nare waiting to file their tax returns.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts indicated he might want to discuss \nthat at length because of a Senate provision which was dropped in \nconference. We put the provision in. I feel strongly about the \nprovision, about those who leave the country to avoid paying taxes.\n  We also put in the committee report, at my suggestion, that any \nadditional legislation would be effective on February 6--February 6. \nNot next week or not last week, but February 6. So when we address this \nissue again in the tax bill--it will probably be in the reconciliation \npackage--when we have additional hearings and make certain that we are \nfollowing the correct procedure, I expect that provision to be in the \nnext package. It was in the Senate package. We did have hearings on the \nSenate side, but only 1 day of hearings.\n  There were some serious questions raised. The report will be due in \nJune, so that will give us adequate time to address that issue. So, \nhopefully, we can pass the conference report with a very brief time \nagreement. There will be a record vote on the conference report. \nHopefully, we will have record votes on the other material.\n  I say to my colleagues, there will probably be at least two or three \nvotes today and, depending on the White House response--if they do not \nwant this rescission bill or anything in it--then we can continue to \nhave this turkey shoot out here with everybody offering amendments to \nmake a few political points. We already had 8 or 10 on the other side. \nI assume they have 30 or 40 more. That is fine with me. If we want to \nmake this a turkey shoot, then the White House should understand, that \nis it and that they are not going to get either bill.\n  So I will just say to the Chief of Staff at the White House and the \nPresident of the United States that if he is serious, we are serious; \nif he is not serious, that is fine with us.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to speak in strong support of \nthe amendment of the majority leader which will have the effect of \nrestoring $1.3 billion in disaster assistance for \n[[Page S4970]] California. It will have the effect of reducing \nadditional spending from last year's budget in the form of rescissions, \nincluding, for example, $337 million in budget cuts that were requested \nby President Clinton but are not in the rescission package as it exists \nright now. It further rescinds several other programs to levels near to \nor the same as the House rescission package. For example, as the \nmajority leader says, it cuts $100 million from the IRS bureaucracy, \nand makes other changes.\n  The specific areas in which the rescissions are increased are the \nAmeriCorps Program, which I will speak to in a moment, the IRS, as I \nmentioned, some foreign operations matters, which you will be \naddressing, Mr. President, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting--as \nI said, $337 million in cuts that were requested by President Clinton--\nthe Legal Services Corporation and a program called youth bill, and \nsome others. The total, as the majority leader said, is over $1.3 \nbillion, close to $1.4 billion.\n  The majority leader has indicated an interest in having a time \nagreement and, as a result of that, I think we will begin by being \nrelatively brief on a few of these items. But if it is the desire of \nthose in the minority to debate this at length, then we will be \nprepared to do that. It is our hope that the majority leader's will is \nreflected in an agreement by the minority as well.\n  So let me begin this debate by focusing on the first item on this \nparticular amendment, and that is the AmeriCorps Program, the so-called \nvoluntarism program in this country, which is not voluntarism at all \nbut rather has the Federal Government taking taxpayer dollars to pay \npeople to work as volunteers.\n  Obviously, that is an oxymoron. You are not a volunteer if you are \nbeing paid for your volunteer activity by the U.S. Government. But that \nis the nature of this program, and that is obviously one thing that is \nwrong with it.\n  I think perhaps one of the most important things I will say here, Mr. \nPresident, is as follows: This amendment is similar to the amendment \nthat the House passed by a vote of 382 to 23. So the House made the \ndegree of rescissions that we are talking about in this amendment by \nthe overwhelming majority of 382 to 23.\n  If the Senate cannot reflect that significant consensus of the House \nof Representatives in a similar number, then I think those who are \nwatching us today may wonder what this body can do. Clearly, we can \nreflect the same consensus that was generated from the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  What this would mean in dollars is that AmeriCorps funding for fiscal \nyear 1995 would total almost $159 million. During a time of severe \nbudget constraints, we are asking of our programs that are currently \nfunded at one level, can those programs be reduced in their funding to \nreflect the fiscal position that the United States is in right now? We \ncannot afford all of these programs, at least to the degree they are \nbeing funded.\n  As a brandnew program, AmeriCorps cost American taxpayers $367 \nmillion last year. Now the President wants to increase the cost to over \n$800 million for 1996. What we are suggesting is, we do not shut the \nprogram down, but we reduce the funding of the program to the same \nlevel that the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to fund.\n  AmeriCorps is not an effective jobs or education program. We submit \nthat it will not increase voluntarism in our country.\n  Mr. President, students of history will recall that one of the most \nprofound observers of the American scene, as this country was getting \ngoing in the early 1800's, was a French historian by the name of Alexis \nde Tocqueville. Alexis de Tocqueville came to this country to see what \nmade it so dynamic, why we were seeming to do so well just 50 years \nafter our Revolution, and what experience he could take back to France \nto tell his fellow citizens how they might improve their society as \nAmericans seemed to be doing.\n  One of his chief findings was that Americans banded together in all \nsorts of voluntary arrangements to help each other in their local \ncommunities. They banded together in groups with names and just as \nneighbors helping neighbors--to put up a barn, to help a family, to \nwork in a community, to work in the churches or the synagogues.\n In one way or another, he observed, Americans volunteered to help each \nother, and that was one of the significant differences between America \nand the old Europe from which he came. In fact, he reflected on this by \nsaying, ``America is great because America is good.'' And if America \nshall ever cease to be good, America will cease to be great. One of \nthose elements of goodness to which he was referring was this dynamic \nconcept of voluntarism that characterized the American society.\n\n  That voluntarism has continued until this day. But I submit that the \nAmeriCorps Program--U.S. Government paid volunteers--undermines the \nconcept of voluntarism, as Alexis de Tocqueville had observed. Groups \nsuch as the Salvation Army, Arizona Clean and Beautiful Project, the \nCrime Victim Foundation, St. Mary's and Andre House food bank, and \nothers all around this country, commit millions of hours to voluntarism \nevery year. Today, Americans, age 18 and up, volunteer, without pay, \nalmost 20 billion hours of their time. That is a 50-percent increase in \nhours since 1981. Turning voluntarism into a wide-scale public job \nprogram, I submit, will undermine public and private philanthropy. It \nstands the concept of voluntarism on its head.\n  A final point, Mr. President. It is not just that it undermines \nvoluntarism, and that it is costly. But it is taking money away from \nother programs which really could be of assistance to America's youth.\n  The AmeriCorps project is not based on need, as you know. It does not \npromote voluntarism based upon the need of the people who participate \nin it. Students are paid $7,400 for work and given $4,750 toward \neducation costs for 2 years. In addition, recipients are guaranteed \nhealth and child care benefits, and in some localities, other benefits. \nFor the average $20,000 to $30,000 cost per year, per student in the \nAmeriCorps Program, eight needy students could receive Pell grants at \n$2,400 apiece. So we could educate eight needy students in this country \nfor the same thing that it costs us to pay for one ``volunteer'' under \nthe AmeriCorps Program.\n  This $20,000 stipend is worth more than the individual income of \nnearly 40 million working Americans.\n  So, Mr. President, it seems to us that given the fact that it does \nnot promote real voluntarism; that it is costing a tremendous amount of \nmoney; that the House voted overwhelmingly to reduce the funding to the \nlevel that we are proposing here; that it takes money away from \nprograms which could really assist needy students who need funding to \ncontinue their education, we should adopt the amendment of the majority \nleader, thus reducing the amount of funding for the AmeriCorps Program.\n  I am going to yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania in a moment. I \nhave one final point here. Over 2,800 volunteers--20 percent of the \n20,000 AmeriCorps volunteers--are assigned to Federal agencies. This is \na volunteer program designed to help people in local communities, but \n20 percent of these people are assigned to the Department of \nAgriculture, Department of the Interior, National Endowment for the \nArts, and others. The federally funded Legal Services Corporation for \nexample has been awarded funding for 44 AmeriCorps volunteers, costing \ntaxpayers almost a million dollars.\n  This is not voluntarism, Mr. President. This is just one of the \nprograms that we would reduce the spending for in order to achieve the \n$1.3 billion-plus in rescissions that make up the amendment of the \nmajority leader.\n  At this time, let me yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania to \nfurther discuss this point.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. What I would like to do is talk \nabout what this amendment does. The first thing it does is restores \nPresident Clinton's request for $1.3 billion in disaster assistance for \nCalifornia earthquake victims, and disaster relief in numerous other \nStates. The minority leader's proposal would remove that funding that \nis needed for the victims of natural disasters, and our amendment seeks \nto restore that money. That was the principal reason this bill was \nbefore us--this is a disaster relief supplemental. That is the reason \nthis bill is here. The rescissions has turned into, maybe as the \nmajority leader said, a \n[[Page S4971]] ``turkey shoot,'' with a lot of other amendments being \nthrown on. The House decided to do more rescissions, as we are doing \nhere. But the underlying purpose, the reason this bill is here, is that \nthis is a supplemental appropriation bill to provide for disaster \nassistance. What the minority leader has done is take away the \nunderpinnings for the bill and reduce what the bill is for in the first \nplace and to fund a whole lot of other programs that are in the bill.\n  Our amendment pays for this $1.3 billion to be put back in, by \nrescinding some of the provisions here to equal the House level. The \nHouse went through and rescinded certain programs. What we do is match \ntheir rescissions. The Senator from Arizona talked about one such, the \nAmeriCorps Program, which I will touch on, and the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting was another.\n  In addition to those rescissions, what we also did was to adopt some \nof the President's suggested rescissions. The President came forward in \nhis rescission package with $337 million in additional budget cuts. \nThese are things requested by the President. I have taken the \nopportunity, while sitting here, to examine these rescissions and to \nfind out what these were all about. What I see is really almost a \nprecursor to the line-item veto. These are a bunch of line items that \nwere put in by the Appropriations Committee here in the House, and in \nthe Senate, earmarks--earmarks being things that are put in by certain \nMembers for demonstration projects in your State or in your district, \nwhich takes money that is not authorized by the House or Senate and \nsigned by the President, things that are nice little projects for back \nhome. And we have here $337 million worth of these projects that the \nPresident, rightfully, said these projects are really the definition in \nthe sense of pork. Let us go after these projects. I agree with the \nPresident.\n  So we put these $337 million of projects in this rescission amendment \nto restore the money back to California and other States. So this is an \nattempt not only to try to get some comity with the House and try to \nreduce the levels of funding to what they have wanted but also to reach \nout to the President and say we are going to put your disaster \nassistance money back in, but we are going to adopt your rescissions.\n  A lot of criticism is made around here of not being bipartisan and \nplaying Presidential politics. We are here with this Republican \namendment, offered by our leader, acceding to the wishes of the \nPresident. I would be interested to see what the folks in the \nPresident's party react to try to do what the President wants to do. \nThat is what we are doing here today. We are trying to work in a \nbipartisan fashion to craft a good supplemental appropriations bill and \nrescission package.\n  Here are a couple things we are not doing in this amendment. We are \nnot eliminating the Summer Jobs Program, and that is almost $900 \nmillion. We keep the funding levels up. We are going to get in a fight \nwith the House on that. We keep the LIHEAP Program, which the Senator \nfrom Arizona was going to offer an amendment on and deeply wanted to \nput it in this bill. We kept that fully funded because we feel that low \nenergy income assistance is important. That is another $1.3 billion. So \nthat is about $2.2 billion of additional rescissions which the House \nrequested that we did not because we have set priorities.\n  Some of our priorities that just did not quite make the grade are \nthings like the AmeriCorps Program. The Senator from Arizona did an \nexcellent job in discussing how the nature of voluntarism is being \ncorrupted by paying volunteers $20,000 a year to volunteer. I wish I \ngot paid that to volunteer my time. That is what this program does. It \nis a $7,400-per-year stipend to volunteer, plus a $4,750 tuition credit \nper volunteer, plus medical benefits and child care. All that totals \nabout $20,000 a year. That is not counting the roughly $15,000 a year \nit takes for administrative and overhead costs per volunteer. It almost \ncosts as much for overhead as it does to pay them.\n  This is not an efficient program. Roughly half the money being \nsiphoned off here to Washington or other places around the country in \nbureaucratic payments and the money--hard-earned taxpayer dollars--that \ncould be used to support families and put food on the table is going to \npay bureaucrats and people, many of whom in this program are wealthy.\n  The AmeriCorps Program is not a means-tested program. I am sure a lot \nof people will find that to be shocking. This AmeriCorps Program is not \nfor the poor. We have doctors, we have people who are spouses of \ndoctors, and children of wealthy people. They all qualify. This is not \nfor young people. Do not think of this as a youth corps of \ndisadvantaged youths that are out there doing the public service. No, \nno, no, no, no.\n  I think it is up to 60 years of age, irrespective of income. They can \ncome in, get the stipends, and get up to 2 years of educational grants. \nWe have the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who said we could \ntake one of the grants and turn them into five people for Pell grants \nfor every one volunteer we have on AmeriCorps.\n  No, we will put them to work. Who will they work for? We have 1,200 \nfor the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1,200 AmeriCorps volunteers; \n525 for the Interior Department; 210 for the Department of Justice; 135 \nfor the Environmental Protection Agency; 60 at the National Endowment \nfor the Arts. This is not out there in the community doing the kind of \nwork that this program has been sold as.\n  Again, administrative costs are high. This is not means tested. \nAnybody qualifies, irrespective of income, and they get a benefit which \nis actually even greater than the GI bill. I had the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps talk to me and tell me that recruitment is being hurt in \nthe Marines and other branches of the service because of the AmeriCorps \nProgram, because they can have a nice job here stateside, doing nice \nthings, maybe doing good kinds of things, and get paid, not only as I \nsaid before, their stipends, but $4,725 per year in educational grants, \nup to 2 years of service, while the GI bill provides not $4,725, what \nthe AmeriCorps bill does provide for, but $4,800, $75 more, for putting \n3 years into the Marine Corps.\n  Now, think about that. No wonder it is hurting recruitment. No wonder \nit is causing a problem. This is just do-goodism of Government, \nthinking they can do everything for everybody and pay them at the same \ntime. It is a complete distortion of what I think most people see as \nthe role of voluntarism in America.\n  We believe that this is a prime target for rescissions. I think we \nare very generous. We leave the program at least running. We do it at \nreduced levels. The present level of funding is $370 million, and it is \nsupposed to go up next year to $610 million. We cut that back to \nactually about $157 million. I think that is awfully generous for a \nprogram that clearly is out of step with where America wants to take \nthis country, as far as its allocation of resources and spending.\n  The other area that I wanted to touch on very briefly, if this debate \ndoes go on longer, we will come back and talk about it further, but I \nknow the Senator from Missouri wants to talk on some of the foreign \naid/foreign operations matters, the other area is the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting.\n  I have, and I am sure every Member of this body has received numerous \nletters and phone calls about protecting ``Barney'' and Big Bird making \nsure that we do not cut out money for Public Broadcasting.\n  I cannot say it any more plainly. If it comes, and I look at the \nchart of the Senator from South Dakota about helping children and the \nthings that we need to do to provide money for WIC Programs and food \nstamps and other things that are so important and essential, if we \ncannot cut $47 million out of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, \nthen we have no business standing up here and saying we are serious \nabout reducing the deficit.\n  That is just amazing to me. We talk about corporate welfare. I hear \nso much talk over there about we have to get rid of corporate welfare. \nThis is the most outrageous of corporate welfare, for programming and \nfor things that can simply and easily be provided by \n[[Page S4972]] the public through public contributions, or with \nassistance, as we already do.\n  These are nonprofits. And they already get, in a sense, a Government \nsubsidy. They already get breaks in having to pay for their rights of \ncommunication. We already provide certain benefits. To throw additional \nmoney at that when they do not take advantage, as they do not, of the \nroyalties available to them from programs like ``Barney'' and ``Sesame \nStreet'' and others, they get virtually nothing back in royalties if \nshowing these programs on their public television stations.\n  If they are not going to take advantage of the opportunities that are \nbefore them to help fund their programming, then why should the \nAmerican taxpayers, working hard to put food on their families' tables, \npay to support Public Broadcasting, when, at least in our area in \nPennsylvania, the corporate salaries are similar to those of some of \nthe chief executive officers of some of the major corporations in \nPittsburgh.\n  I think it is, again, I cannot stress strongly enough, if we do not \nhave the courage to stand up and cut funding for a program like the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting, when we have some people getting \n100-some stations, many of them learning-type stations, educational \nstations, with the onset, as we will see in bringing up the \ntelecommunications bill next week, of almost the irrelevancy in future \nyears of cable and a lot of other mediums because of direct satellite \ncommunication into your home--it will happen very shortly--if we cannot \nget rid of a dinosaur of a program like funding for the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting, then we do not have the right to say we are a \nSenate that is on the verge of entering the 21st century with setting \nour priorities.\n  I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the majority leader. This amendment is critically important, \nand serves as a continuing demonstration of our willingness to curtail \nexpenditures which we cannot afford.\n  Much has been said today about the children of America, but the best \nway to ensure their future is to make sure that we are fiscally \nresponsible. It is important to make the hard choices for the right \nreasons. That, Mr. President, is the number one investment that we can \nmake in the children of America.\n  Last night, late at night, this House made a mature and difficult \ndecision about a substantial number of courthouses across the country \nthat we simply could not afford. Mr. President, $1.4 billion was cut, \nand in the process, a commitment to the next generation was kept.\n  I rise today, Mr. President, in support of a particular aspect of the \nmajority leader's amendment. Specifically, an additional $91.6 million \nfrom the foreign operations budget. I think when we are talking about \nthe children of America, and the future of this country, we all \nunderstand that there is going to have to be some sacrifice made on \ntheir behalf. To take 1.4 percent out of the foreign aid budget is not \nasking for too much. It is simply saying that when we are considering \nsacrifice, when we are considering restraint, people around the world \nwill need to share in that sacrifice.\n  Some might ask, ``Is this not isolationist?'' I hardly think a 1.4-\npercent rescission makes an isolationist out of the United States of \nAmerica. It simply does not, it will not, and it should not. And to \nargue as such is to fundamentally mislead the American people.\n  The point is we are going to have to ask our allies abroad to share \nin the kind of restraint needed to move toward a balanced budget. But \nof equal importance, Mr. President, I would argue that it may be that \nthe best kind of foreign aid we could ever provide to countries \noverseas is the kind of benefit they would receive from a stable, \nfiscally sound U.S. economy.\n  Mr. President, we are looking at a major restructuring of the way in \nwhich we deal with foreign entities. As part of that, it is important \nthat we begin to send a signal, to friend and foe alike, that we are \nmoving to put our fiscal house in order.\n  It is important to note that all of the funds that were recommended \nto be rescinded in the House were unobligated funds. The Senate number \nwas $100 million, theirs was $191.6 million. Now, if the House could \nmake those reductions without really impairing priority programs, I \nthink we ought to match their efforts. We are talking about an \nadditional .0067 multiplier, which would provide the additional $91.6 \nmillion.\n  Mr. President, we have spent almost half a trillion dollars over the \nlast 45 years to increase peace and prosperity abroad. Unfortunately, \nin many cases, there is very little to show for our efforts. We need to \nthink carefully about how we deploy resources and what a strong \nAmerica, economically, means to the rest of the world. I cannot \nremember anyone cornering me in a coffee shop in Camdenton, MO, and \nsaying, ``You have to support more funding for U.S. peacekeeping,'' or \n``To be sure I am firmly on board when the next AID package comes \nbefore the Senate.''\n  It is time we start to look at our foreign aid budget and begin \nallocating funds only in those areas in which America has vital \nnational interests at stake. The American people are a generous people, \nbut they want a return on their investment.\n  Mr. President, when we talk about fiscal belt-tightening and the \nresponsibility associated with it, a minimal reduction in foreign aid \nmust be part of that mix. The House bill cuts foreign aid accounts by \nnearly $200 million. Our bill only has $100 million. The addition of \nthe $91.6 million would, again, move us in the right direction.\n  As I mentioned earlier, last evening we started. We started a \nconstructive effort by cutting $1.4 billion in an essential function of \nGovernment. The judicial process is one of the most fundamental \ncomponents of American government. Courthouses are important. But our \nchildren and the next generation of Americans are also important. Mr. \nPresident, we cannot afford to spend what we do not have. This package \nrepresents a small, reasonable step in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have been trying to understand the \nsubstitute amendment versus the underlying Daschle amendment. I would \nlike to say what I believe, based on about 10 minutes of study, this \ndoes.\n  As I understand it, what the amendment of Senator Daschle, the \nminority leader, does is it takes $1.3 billion from FEMA, fiscal year \n1997, and it restores certain cuts that have been recommended for \nchildren and educational programs.\n  What I understand the majority leader's amendment to have done is it \nrestores fiscal year 1997 FEMA funds, $1.3 billion, and it cuts even \nmore deeply. It cuts the children's and the education programs, plus it \ncuts a whole series of programs including Radio Free Europe, legal \nservices, foreign operations, the biological survey, libraries, the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting, airport and airway trust fund, \nhighways, AmeriCorps, and the youth bill. So, essentially, as I \nunderstand it, we have two rather clear choices on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate, one of which is the Dole approach which is much deeper, \nand the Daschle approach that says let us make cuts but what we cut, \nlet us not cut the most vulnerable in our society, the future of our \nsociety--children and education.\n  I want to take a couple of minutes and speak to that because I think \nit is a worthy attempt, even as rescissions are being made, to take a \ngood look at what we are doing and saying as we talk about investment \nin the future. As we talk about investing in economic infrastructure, \nshould we also invest in our human infrastructure of which the most \nimportant part is our children? In order to secure the future of our \nchildren, the most important part is their education.\n  I would like to speak specifically to the Dole amendment. We all know \nthat, regardless of what version it is, there is going to be welfare \nreform in this session of Congress. We all desire it. And so to people \nin this Nation, as \n[[Page S4973]] has so often been said by Senator Gramm of Texas--the \ntime has come for people to get out of the cart and help push it.\n  In order to push it, it means go to work. But if you are poor, if you \nare female, if you have children, and if you are on welfare, you are \ngoing to need child care to go to work.\n  So, does it make sense as we talk about investment in our future to \ncut child care? I think it does not because we just complicate the \nproblem downstream. So I believe that rescission, that cut, is not a \nprudent investment in our future.\n  Head Start--what is Head Start? Head Start is a concept. We have 16 \nmillion youngsters in this Nation growing up in poverty. The concept is \nthat if we can get children young with their parents to come in at a \nvery early age, if we can counsel with those parents--these are poor \nparents, poor children--if we can counsel with them, if we can begin \nearly on to teach them the discipline and structure of learning that \nwhen they get into the grade they will be able to keep up with their \nclass instead of what so many know happen, that there is an emotional \ndropping out followed by an intellectual dropping out, followed by a \nphysical dropping out of children in the elementary school years--guess \nwhat? What has been found is that, if you apply the Head Start concept \nwell, not sloppily but well--which involves bringing in the family--\nchildren do better. They graduate with higher grades. Guess what? By \nthe age of 19 they are much more likely to get a job. That is the \ninvestment in the future. That is what Head Start speaks to. Properly \ncarried out it works.\n  So I ask the question: Does it then make sense in this rescission \npackage to cut back on Head Start? I answer that question by saying no, \nit does not. Let us take another one that has been bandied with on the \nfloor. AmeriCorps. I have just heard AmeriCorps is not just for people \nwho are struggling. It is not for the middle class, it has youngsters \nand adults in it, and it has youngsters whose parents are doctors, or \nso on. It is my understanding that over 75 percent of those admitted to \nAmeriCorps thus far have incomes of under $50,000. Do I believe that \n100 percent of the parents of the youngsters going into AmeriCorps \nshould have incomes of under $50,000? The answer is, yes, I do. But the \nvast majority of participants come from moderate- to low-income \nfamilies, and AmeriCorps is clearly a worthy program.\n  Let me speak as a mayor who more than a decade ago took $1 million of \ncommunity development block grant money in San Francisco and began a \nnew program, the first urban conservation corps in this Nation. It has \nsince been replicated by 22 big cities. You can imagine the pride I had \nwhen I had Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles come up to San Francisco to \nlearn from us how we took youngsters age 16 to 23, very fragile \nyoungsters with no work ethic, with a background of juvenile \ndelinquency and began to teach them a work ethic and put them to work \nbuilding bike paths, restoring park areas, painting over graffiti, \ndoing public works projects, repairing places in housing authority \nprojects. And those youngsters learned a work ethic. They went out at \nthe end of the year and could get a job. I think it was the most \nsuccessful program I did.\n  This is what AmeriCorps is built on. It is built on the concept of a \nconservation corps where you take young people, where you teach them a \nwork ethic and whereas they work, they can earn, and in this case earn \na college scholarship. It is a vital program. Again, is it as important \nan investment in our economic infrastructure as free trade may be? I \nthink it is. Because again, it is teaching our young people a skill \nwhich they are able to use and then further their education.\n  Let us take WIC, the Women, Infants, and Children Program. When I was \nmayor I used to go down to where food was given out in San Francisco. I \nwould see pregnant women come in, again many of them undernourished, \nagain many of them troubled, many of them not able to provide a \nnutritious meal. Sure. They would go out and buy a bag of potato chips. \nThey would eat high-fat food. But they were not nutritious meals.\n  What WIC has done is offer an opportunity to develop a cost-effective \nbirth system for people who are poor and deprived in this Nation \nbecause they are able to get some foods that are nutritious during the \nterm of pregnancy and produce youngsters who come into this world with \na chance. In a way, it is a cost-effective investment in our future.\n  Let me talk about cuts in education. Today, all across the United \nStates of America we graduate kids from schools that cannot read or \nwrite, multiply, divide or add, recognize China on a map, fill out an \nemployment application, or follow a bus schedule. These are actual \nexamples. They are not made up. They are true. It is called the failure \nof American public education.\n  Where American public education fails the most is in the elementary \nschool. That is where Head Start and that is where chapter 1 comes in.\n  Chapter 1 again are funds that go to States for basic remedial and \nprimary education. It is reading, it is writing, it is arithmetic, and \nit goes to those school districts that have poor children in them. It \nis a very big ticket item for California, the largest State in the \nUnion.\n  For me this cut for California schools means a loss of $8.7 million \nof the anticipated $729 million in fiscal year 1995. If these \nrescissions are cut, the county of Los Angeles loses $2.5 million for \nreading and writing and arithmetic for poor children. That is what \nchapter 1 does.\n  One of the things that I have believed in is that we should go to a \ndecentralized public education system. We should allow schools to float \nfree. We should provide standards of education for young people. What \nis the degree of proficiency you should have in reading, in writing, in \nmath for promotion? What is the knowledge of social service? What is \nthe knowledge of science programs that you should have to promote? What \nGoals 2000 did was provide a voluntary mandate to schools to establish \ntough curriculum standards. Is that an investment in our future in \nterms of building a young work corps of youngsters that are able to get \na job in an economy that is becoming more and more high-technology, \nwhere you have to understand computers to work in factories?\n  I think the answer clearly is yes, this is the future. So Goals 2000 \nspoke to that, spoke to tougher education standards. Chapter 1 talks to \nbasic reading skills. I think these cuts are not necessary.\n  The bottom line is, as I look at the majority leader's amendment and \nthe minority leader's amendment, what I see is the possibility of \nputting together an amendment that is bipartisan, that could achieve \nadditional cuts, if that is what people are looking for, and not impact \nchildren and not impact education.\n  Now, there are those who believe that education and children are the \nfuzzy issues in our society. I am not one of them. I speak as a former \nmayor. I speak as somebody who has seen a lot of trials and a lot of \ntribulation, who knows the streets. I think the future of America is \nour kids. I think it is wrong to cut from our kids at this point in \ntime.\n  Pick up a newspaper today and see where another youngster in Los \nAngeles is shot in the head standing at the side of his home. That kind \nof thing must stop. Drug-free and safe schools are cut in this \nrescission package. If there is anything we should be doing it is \nending drug use at school, it is making schools safe. To do it, you \nhave to start early. If you start late, it is too late. If you start in \nthe middle school, it is too late. You must start in the elementary \nschool.\n  Mrs. Reagan said, ``Just say no to drugs.'' And guess what? If kids \nbelieve that early enough, it works. If you wait until it is too late, \nit does not work. So why at this point in time do we cut drug-free and \nsafe schools? Is that a prudent investment in the future? I think not.\n  So what I say in a summary sentence or two, just having heard what \nhas happened on this floor this morning, there are things in the \nsubstitute amendment that I could buy. There are things in the \nrescission package that many of us cannot buy. Why not sit down and try \nto put together a package that protects our future, protects our young \npeople, and protects our education? I think it can be done if there is \na will in this body to do so.\n  I thank the Chair.\n   [[Page S4974]] Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

I now ask that the Chair lay before the Senate the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 831, the self-employed health care \ndeduction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to proceeding to the \nreport?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I am just wondering--and \nI do not intend to object--I am just wondering. We had been involved in \na debate on the rescission bill. Senator Daschle had introduced a \nmeasure which he had announced that he was going to introduce. And we \nhad another amendment that was in the second degree and debate was \ntaking place. Many of us had planned to talk and debate.\n  Could the chairman of the Finance Committee indicate to those of us \nwho were involved in that debate and discussion whether those measures \nnow are being withdrawn and whether we will come back and address them \nat another time, just as a point of information so that we have some \nunderstanding what the matters are before the Senate?\n  Many of us thought we were going to be proceeding with the \nrescissions bill. We were given that indication again last night by the \nmajority leader. We came over this morning intending to debate it. Then \nwe had an amendment in the second degree. And now we are going on to a \ndifferent matter.\n  I do not intend to object to moving to a different matter, although I \nwould want to be able to speak to the conference report. I am just \nasking as a matter of information so that we have some understanding \nabout where we are on the amendment of the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. It is our intention to simply lay them aside. We will \ncome back to them as soon as we are done with the conference report. We \nhad suggested, although it has not been cleared I think on your side \nyet, a half an hour time limit on the conference report, 15 minutes \nequally divided, so that we would be back to it quite soon.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could continue, I understand then that the request \nis just to move to the conference report?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would indicate just as one Member, I know the \nimportance and the timeliness of the matters which are included in the \nconference report and the importance of achieving that. But I do want \nto indicate that there is a matter that has been raised in the \nconference report that with regard to the special tax provisions for \nsome of the wealthiest individuals in the country. I know the Senator \nis familiar with this, and I wish to indicate to the leader that I have \nevery intention of submitting a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on this \nmatter before we reach a final decision. I am more than glad to work \nout the details with the chairman of the Finance Committee or with the \nmajority leader, but I wish to at least indicate at this time my \nintention of proposing such a sense-of-the-Senate resolution when the \nmatter does come before the Senate and at an appropriate time after the \nchairman of the Finance Committee or the members of conference \ncommittee have had an opportunity to explain the conference report.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I ask for the yeas and nays on the conference report.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not in order to object at this point.\n  Is there objection to proceeding to the conference report?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the conference report by \ntitle.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     831) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \n     permanently extend the deduction for the health insurance \n     costs of self-employed individuals, to repeal the provision \n     permitting nonrecognition of gain on sales and exchanges \n     effectuating policies of the Federal Communications \n     Commission, and for other purposes, having met, after full \n     and free conference, have agreed to recommend and do \n     recommend to their respective Houses this report, signed by a \n     majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of March 29, 1995.)\n  Mr. PACKWOOD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I think the Senate is very familiar with this bill. We \nhave debated it thoroughly on the Senate floor. We have debated it in \ncommittee.\n  The bill will allow self-employed individuals to deduct 25 percent of \nthe cost of health insurance premiums this year and 30 percent starting \nnext year. This bill makes the deduction permanent. We would like to \nraise the deduction even more. But this is the first time we have ever \nmade it permanent.\n  The reason this is so timely is people need to know this to prepare \ntheir tax returns. The deadline for filing 1994 tax returns is now only \n2 weeks away.\n  So I hope the Senate would not spend a lot of time on this bill. I \nthink everyone understands the bill, and I would be prepared to vote on \nthe conference report.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was wondering if the chairman of the \ncommittee would be willing to describe exactly the circumstances that \ntook place in the conference committee in relationship to what tax \npayments would be expected from expatriates. A story was included in \ntoday's Washington Post and in other newspapers about the tax break \nthat has allowed billionaires to renounce their U.S. citizenship, leave \nthe country, and escape taxes on their profits.\n  The story reads:\n\n       A Senate proposal to tax such wealthy expatriates was \n     dropped in a tax bill during a House-Senate conference \n     Tuesday night, at least partly because of the pressure from \n     lobbyists . . .\n\n  I am wondering if the chairman of the committee could review for the \nmembership exactly what took place in the conference in relationship to \nthat particular measure, and if he could review with us what the \nconsiderations were and why a judgment was made in the conference to \nprovide for the elimination of that particular provision which had been \naccepted and approved in the Senate.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I would be happy to do that, Mr. President.\n  What happened was this: We added this provision in the Senate Finance \nCommittee without any hearings.\n  From time to time, we pass things for which we do not know all the \nconsequences. I do not think we know if this unfairly affects American \ncitizens, or how it affect aliens or nonresidents that are living here.\n  The House had on the floor a motion to instruct its conferees to not \naccept the expatriate tax provision. That instruction was accepted. So \nthe House was proceeding as they were instructed.\n  Chairman Archer and I agreed to have the Joint Tax Committee study \nthe expatriate provision and report back to us by June 1. The Joint Tax \nCommittee is instructed to study the \n[[Page S4975]] ramifications and implications and who is affected, and \ndoes it adversely affect American citizens vis-a-vis aliens or illegal \nimmigrants or legal immigrants. The report is due by June 1. After we \nreview the report, any legislation that we consider will have an \neffective date of February 6 of this year. This is the same date as the \namendment that was offered in the Finance Committee. Everyone is on \nnotice--if and when the expatriate legislation becomes law, it will be \neffective February 6, 1995.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. There may be reasons for study of this particular \nprovision by the Joint Tax Committee. But I fail to understand the \ncompelling need for study when we are talking about, as I understand \nit--perhaps the Senator wants to explain exactly what is at risk here.\n  As I understand it--and I think all of us were surprised when we read \nabout it this morning--we are talking about the fact that individuals \nwho are able to accumulate very substantial amounts of money, capital \nresources, would be able to, by renouncing their citizenship, escape \nwhat other citizens who did not renounce their citizenship would have \nto pay.\n  I am trying to understand exactly what is involved here and who \nexactly is involved. Could the Senator explain?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. The Senator asks a very good question. At this point, \nwe don't know who would be affected by the provision and who would not \nbe. That is precisely the reason why it should not be considered today. \nThe provision applies to citizens who renounce their citizenship. Maybe \nthey have moved to another country for reasons that have nothing to do \nwith tax avoidance purposes. They are subject to the tax. There is a \npossibility of double taxation. There is also the question of what \nhappens to people who come to this country and never become citizens. \nThey make a fortune here but they never become American citizens and \nthey go back to their country of origin. Do they get a tax preferential \ntreatment that an American citizen does not get?\n  These are questions that ought to be answered and will be answered. \nIf and when we pass a bill, that bill would be retroactive to February \n6. But it would be unwise to act when we do not fully understand the \nconsequences.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I say to the Senator, why was the provision \naccepted initially by the Finance Committee and why was it accepted \nhere on the floor if there were all these questions about it? Evidently \nit was supported by the members of the Finance Committee. It was not \nchallenged during the floor debate, at least not to my memory. We had a \nvery short debate on the legislation, in any event.\n  I am just wondering why the Finance Committee felt that this was a \nsufficient loophole that ought to be addressed and accepted the \nprovision, and then in the conference committee the provision \neffectively was dropped.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Minnesota in \na moment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wonder if I could ask the Senator to yield, and I \nwonder if the Senator from New Jersey might want to respond as well.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could the Senator maybe explain to me what was the \nrevenue gain expected from closing the loophole? I understand that the \n5-year revenue gain was $1.359 billion, that in the next 5 years it was \n$2.274 billion, and the total in 10 years, $3.633 billion; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. The revenue estimates have jumped around. The \nadministration estimated its proposal would raise $2.2 billion. Joint \nTax estimated it would only raise $1.7 billion. The proposal that was \nincluded in the Finance Committee bill was estimated to raise $1.359 \nbillion. The $3.6 billion figure is a 10-year estimate of the Finance \nCommittee proposal.\n  We also asked Treasury how many people would be affected by the \nadministration's proposal. They said, ``Well, between a dozen and two \ndozen.'' Now, Treasury is not sure about this number.\n  This is the problem. We do not know who they are. We do not know if \nthey are American citizens. We do not know if they are illegal \nimmigrants or legal immigrants. We do not know if they are leaving for \nthe purpose of marriage or other legitimate reasons or leaving not to \npay taxes.\n  I admit, I think we adopted this in haste, with no hearings, not \nfully understanding the consequences of the provision. I apologize for \nus having done it in this way.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the Senator's response. I understand that \ntax measures are always complex and they are difficult. But, as I \nunderstand it, we are talking about somewhere between, as the Senator \nhas mentioned, $1.4 and $3.6 billion. Your own estimate, as I \nunderstand it, about the number of expatriates each year is about 12.\n  What is the estimated net worth of each of the 12 people? Could we \nget some idea about that?\n  We had just been debating children's programs, education programs. \nThe total value of the programs that we are trying to restore is less \nthan $1.4 billion. Now we are talking about a dozen people who have \nmade a great deal of money here in the United States--and no one has \nanything against them for making it in the United States--but these \npeople are prepared to renounce their citizenship. They are prepared to \nreject what every working family in America is committed to--having to \npay their taxes--by denying their citizenship and going someplace else.\n  I commend the Finance Committee for addressing this issue earlier. \nBut I must say that I find it exceedingly difficult to understand why \nin that conference, the provision closing that loophole was effectively \ndropped and the loophole failed to be closed.\n  In particular, I think what this is saying very clearly is, you have \none set of rules and regulations for the wealthiest individuals--in \nthis instance the very wealthiest--who are prepared to turn their back \non this country, and you have another set of rules for everyone else. \nWe closed that loophole, and now we have opened it up again.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  I intend, if the Senator would yield for the purposes of sending--I \nsee the Senator seated.\n  I ask for recognition, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send to the desk a resolution. It is a \nresolution on tax avoidance by certain American citizens.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Congress of the United States should act as quickly \n     as possible to amend the Internal Revenue Code to end the tax \n     avoidance by United States citizens who relinquish their \n     United States Citizenship; and\n       (2) the effective date of such amendment to the Internal \n     Revenue Code should be February 6, 1995.\n\n  I send that to the desk on behalf of myself and Senator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  On this conference report, is this in order?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I cannot hear the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent to take up the \nresolution at this point.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I object.\n  Mr. KENNEDY and Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection was heard.\n  The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the presence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue to \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing objection, the clerk will continue to \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued to call the roll.\n   [[Page S4976]] Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we will be filing cloture on the conference \nreport momentarily. There will be a pro forma session tomorrow, a \ncloture vote on Monday.\n  I think it is--I do not know how to describe it. So many self-\nemployed States like Minnesota, Massachusetts, Kansas, New York, \nOregon, wherever--wait until you file tax returns. April 15 is very \nclose.\n  We are playing games. We are playing little games here. We have \nalready said it will be effective the 6th of February. So we will do it \nthe hard way. We will file a cloture motion.\n  Mr. President, there are 3.2 million people waiting for two Senators \nto let them file their tax returns--3.2 million. They ought to be dealt \nwith fairly.\n  The only way I can think to do it is to file cloture. There will be \nno more votes today, and the cloture petition will be filed. Then we \nwill go out.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to make it very, very clear that I \nwas prepared to move toward a final resolution on this legislation for \nthe reasons that have been outlined by the majority leader.\n  I think it is a travesty for this body not to express itself in more \nthan general statements and comments, and not to state its position \noverwhelmingly about the outrageous tax provisions that benefit not a \nsmall group of people but just a handful of very wealthy people who \nhave renounced their citizenship here in the United States.\n  The best estimates of revenue from this provision are $1.3 billion--\nthat happens to be the same amount that is included in the amendment of \nthe Senator from South Dakota, in terms of funding.\n  Now, the fact of the matter is the House Republicans had their way \nwith this provision the last time they went to conference. I want to \nmake sure that our conferees, when they go back after the unanimous \nvote of the Senate--and there is no reason that it should not be \nunanimous--understand our position. That is why I would urge that the \nSenate reach a final judgment on the conference report at a time set by \nthe majority leader, but prior to that time that there be an \nopportunity for this Senate to express itself about this loophole, so \nthat we can, Republican and Democrat alike, speak to that issue,\n and indicate that we are firmly in support of addressing that loophole \nin the way that my sense-of-the-Senate resolution suggests.\n\n  I do not think that is asking a great deal. This provision that \ncloses the loophole was good enough to be accepted by the Finance \nCommittee and accepted by the U.S. Senate. All we are trying to do is \nmake sure that this provision is going to prevail in the end. We are \ndenied that opportunity because of the parliamentary situation--that \nthe conferees of the House have adjourned.\n  If there is any time when the rules ought to be adjusted it is in \nthis kind of egregious situation. All our resolution says is that the \nCongress should act as quickly as possible to amend the Internal \nRevenue Code to end tax avoidance by U.S. citizens who relinquish their \nU.S. citizenship, and that the effective date of such an amendment to \nthe Internal Revenue Code should be February 6, 1995.\n  Let us have a unanimous vote on that, and let us have the vote on the \nconference report. That is what this is about. And we are prepared to \ndo that at whatever time is convenient--on Monday next, at a time \ndesignated by the majority leader.\n  That is not an unreasonable request, and I hope that will be the way \nwe proceed because this issue is not going to go away.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I do not wish to speak at length but I \nwant to make two points.\n  The first is that the Finance Committee fully intends to close this \nloophole, if that is the way it is to be described, to collect these \ntaxes that are being avoided. But we would wish to do so and we will do \nso as of the date the Treasury, in the budget, the executive branch, \nproposed doing so as part of the President's budget: February 6. But I \nwould like to say something that may not be wholly welcome here. And \nthe Senator from Oregon will recognize it.\n  When we held hearings on this matter, professors of law and \nprofessors of international law came to us and they said: Have a little \ncare in what you are doing. Prof. Robert F. Turner, who is the Charles \nH. Stockton Professor of International Law at the U.S. Naval War \nCollege, gave us a paper called, ``International Law and the Exit Tax. \nDoes section 203 of the Tax Compliance Act of 1995 violate the right to \nimmigrate, recognized in the U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political \nRights and other U.S. and international instruments?''\n  You may recall, Mr. President, that the U.S. Assistant Secretary \nShattuck and the Assistant Attorney General have been in the United \nNations just this week talking about our compliance with this law.\n  The Senator from Oregon will recall the observation that human rights \nand legal rights are most to be attended to when the group involved is \ndespised. That is the test. Nobody much likes a billionaire who \nrenounces his or her citizenship for money. But if there are rights \ninvolved they are rights, and we ought to be careful how we proceed. \nThat is the test, not whether these people are popular or whether they \nare not popular.\n  We are going to proceed in that way. We are going to have a report. I \noffered this on behalf of the Democratic Members as a part of a general \npackage, this provision. When it failed, as things do, in a committee \ndivided, the Senator from New Jersey offered it as a freestanding \nprovision, just to raise money for deficit reduction.\n  It passed. It will pass again. I just wanted to say that, sir.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, my good friend from New York, I think he \nhas yielded the floor, but I would like to congratulate him on what he \nsaid.\n  And then recall--it is funny how time revolves--20 years ago on this \nSenate floor we were excoriating the Soviet Union for taxing their \ncitizens who wanted to leave as a violation of the most fundamental \nhuman liberty. And they were practically confiscating the income of \ntheir people, mainly Jews, who wanted to leave because of repression. \nAnd we said that was terrible.\n  We already have on the books now--it is existing law--a provision \nthat says if an American citizen renounces his or her citizenship and \nleaves the country to avoid taxes, we can tax them for 10 years. That \nis the law now.\n  What we did not know, I apologize to the Senate, when we acted in \nhaste--I have made these mistakes before and I will probably make them \nagain--when we acted in haste we probably did not understand the full \nconsequences, or maybe just two or three. If a person comes to this \ncountry from Italy, from Poland, from Germany, from Hong Kong, and \nbecomes a legal immigrant, works and is prosperous, and reaches a \ncertain age and the tug of the old home country is strong and that \nperson goes back home, since he or she has never become a U.S. citizen \nthis bill does not touch that person. Those people are free to leave \nwith all their millions or billions or whatever they have because they \nhave never become U.S. citizens.\n  Now you take exactly the same type of person who leaves Poland or \nGermany, comes here, becomes a citizen, and the tug of the old home \ncountry when they reach close to retirement is such that they leave--\nthey are taxed. We did not grasp that when we passed this. We did not \nknow it. We did not know there was a statute on the books, when we \npassed this, that you are taxed for 10 years if you leave for tax \nreasons.\n  What do you do about the thousands of Cubans, Cuba Libres who came \nhere in the exodus of the 1960's to become American citizens, good \ncitizens, in many cases prosperous citizens? And one day I think many \nof them would hope to return to a free Cuba. It is an understandable \ntug. They are now American citizens. They are not leaving to avoid \ntaxes, they are leaving to go home. This bill would tax them. I do not \nthink we intended that. We did not realize it.\n  So all we are asking--I find it amazing this bill is being attacked \nand this provision is being attacked by the very \n[[Page S4977]] people who were attacking the Soviet Union for doing the \nsame thing 20 years ago. We made a mistake. There is no harm in \nadmitting that. Unfortunately, God has not endowed any of us with \nperfection, despite what some of us may think. And we need to review it \nand look at it and see where the errors are. I say again, for those \npeople who now leave the country to avoid taxes, we can tax them for 10 \nyears.\n  So I am disappointed that the self-employed this weekend, when they \nare now meeting with their accountants--let us face it, most people do \ntheir taxes a week or two prior to April 15. I see one of my young \nstaffers nodding who used to be a practicing tax lawyer. He said yes, \nthis is the 2 weeks. They are not going to know what we are going to \ndo. That is unfortunate, because now we will not get to vote cloture on \nthis until Monday. I hope we would pass this Monday night--but I guess \nthere is nothing else we can do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent that \na full statement I have prepared be printed in the Record, and a draft \nof a proposed amendment be printed immediately after my remarks for the \npurposes of public notice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to just make two points. I \nagree with the point that has just been made by the Senator from \nOregon, that the matter as it was passed out of the Finance Committee \nand by the full Senate was deficient in that it did not reach those \npersons who have been permanent residents of the United States and who \nthen leave the United States and are able to avoid the tax on the \nsubstantial increase in their wealth which they achieved while they \nwere in the United States. It was my intention to offer an amendment to \ndo that on the floor when this matter was presented several days ago. \nHowever there was a unanimous-consent request, based on the urgency of \npassage, that precluded any amendments to the legislation at that time \nand so, in deference to the urgency of passage, I deferred.\n  I am filing in the Record the amendment that I would have offered so \nthere can be public notice and comment on what I intend to propose at \nthe appropriate time to close the loophole by extending this to \npermanent residents as well as citizens.\n  The second point that I would like to make relates to a concern about \nhow this matter was suggested to be handled within the conference \nreport. That was that any additional income that would have been \nderived from this loophole would have been used to increase a deduction \nin the underlying bill.\n  We have had on several occasions, including within the last 36 hours, \nstatements by which the Senate has committed itself to the proposition \nthat, if we reduce spending, the benefits of that reduced spending \nshall be used for deficit reduction. It is my feeling that we ought to \nadopt the same principle as it relates to closing tax loopholes. After \nclosing the tax loophole, the primary purpose of those funds ought to \nbe for deficit reduction, not to be added for another tax reduction on \na bill that just happens to be coincident with the consideration of the \nclosing of the tax loophole.\n  So in some ways we have been saved from what I think would have been \nan inappropriate policy, whatever the merits of the specific proposal, \ninappropriate policy that funds saved from closing a tax loophole would \nbe shifted to other purposes within the same matter before the \nconference committee. It is my hope that we will, as a further \nindication of the seriousness of our intention to reduce the Federal \ndeficit, adopt the same principle for tax loophole closing as we have \nalready done for spending reduction; that is, our priority is to reduce \nthe deficit.\n                       i. enact expatriation tax\n\n  I must express disappointment that Congress has chosen to exclude \nfrom this bill a provision that would have imposed a tax on individuals \nwho renounce their citizenship. Bolstering the Treasury's ability to \nexact Federal income tax from millionaires and billionaires who leave \nthe country is long overdue.\n  The proposed legislation would have brought the taxation of \nindividuals who renounce their citizenship more in line with the way \nthe Federal Government taxes Americans who remain in the United States. \nAmericans who are fortunate enough to experience significant \nappreciation in the value of their property usually are taxed twice: A \n28-percent capital gains tax when the asset is sold and an estate tax \nof up to 55 percent upon death.\n  Even if the Congress had enacted this expatriate tax, individuals \nleaving the country would be subject to only one tax--at a maximum rate \nof 39 percent.\n  In short, the tax burden on departing millionaires would still be \nless than we currently impose on loyal American taxpayers.\n                        ii. noncitizen residents\n\n  In fact, the provision passed by the Senate did not go far enough. \nThe tax that the Senate passed applied to citizens, but failed to \ninclude long-term residents who depart from the United States. \nExcluding long-term residents would result in the United States \ntreating noncitizen residents more favorably than we treat American \ncitizens. Such inequity cannot be justified.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I submit for the Record an amendment to the \nversion of the expatriate tax passed by the Senate and dropped by the \nconference committee. The amendment would extend the tax to departing \nindividuals who are lawful permanent residents and have been taxed as \nresidents for at least 8 of the past 15 years.\n  Equity dictates that such an individual be taxed on the appreciation \nof his or her assets. I submit the text of this amendment for the \nRecord and invite my colleagues to review and analyze the proposal.\n  There being no objection, the amendment was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       On page 13, strike lines 7 through 18, and insert:\n       ``(a) General Rules.--For purposes of this subtitle--\n       ``(1) Mark to market.

I would remind my colleagues that we are not debating a \ntax on immigrants who come to the United States with little or no \nassets and who, through hard work, find a way to provide for their \nfamilies.\n  Neither are we talking about taxing each and every resident alien who \nsucceeds in establishing a business or making profitable investments \nwhile here in the United States and later decides to return to his or \nher native country.\n  This tax would apply only if the value of the individual's business \nor investments had increased by over $600,000. In other words, the \nfirst $600,000 in appreciation is fully exempted from the tax.\n  The expatriate tax would apply only to the rich of the rich who made \ntheir fortune as a result of access to the enormous resources of this \ncountry.\n  It is at least ironic, if not deplorable, that Congress is moving to \nprotect millionaires who are fleeing the country while attacking \nprograms benefiting America's poor children.\n  I understand that the chairmen of the Finance and Ways and Means \nCommittees have charged the Joint Tax Committee with reviewing the \ntaxation of individuals leaving the country, with a report due by June \n1.\n  I will respect that directive, but will urge reconsideration of this \nproposal at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n\n                         iv. deficit reduction\n\n  The exclusion of the expatriate tax from the final version of the \nlegislation dodges another serious issue that we must address.\n  That issue is whether we are committed to reducing the Federal \ndeficit, or whether we are just committed to talking about deficit \nreduction.\n  The revenues generated from the tax were dedicated to deficit \nreduction.\n  I will fight to see that the $1.4 billion this tax would raise will \nultimately go to deficit reduction.\n  In fact, I urge my fellow Senators today to make a commitment--that \nwe will dedicate the revenues derived from closing tax loopholes--like \nthe gaping one available to those rejecting the benefits and \nobligations of American citizenship--to deficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, with those remarks, I look forward to voting for the \nlegislation at the earliest possible moment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my friend from \nFlorida for making a very explicit point, which the chairman made, \nwhich is that, if inadvertently you omitted consideration of a whole \npossible class of potential taxpayers which we did not deal with, we \nought to--in shorthand I think we refer to it as green card issue. The \nreview that is going to come up and which will, whatever we do, be \nretroactive to February 6, whatever the budget may produce, may produce \nmore revenue than we otherwise would have done in the bill before us. \nAnd I think the committee was unanimous that it should indeed go for \ndeficit reduction, in the final vote on the amendment by the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey--which stood alone--just not to \ndeal with other matters but simply to reduce deficits.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, if I could, I would like to take a few \nminutes to talk about this proposal, since it was the amendment that I \noffered in the Finance Committee that was adopted, passed the U.S. \nSenate, and went to the conference committee.\n  I think this provision, or something very close to it, will pass the \nU.S. Congress this year. And it will pass the Congress this year \nbecause I think that the arguments against it will not stand. The point \nhas been made that this is an exit tax. It is not an exit tax. It is a \ntax on the accrued gains while someone was a U.S. citizen. When someone \nopts to leave to escape the estate tax that he or she would otherwise \npay, we are saying, no; when you begin the process of renouncing your \nU.S. citizenship, you will be taxed. This is not a tax on little \npeople. As every Senator who has spoken indicated, this is a tax on the \nvery wealthy.\n  The amendment that I offered specifically excluded any pensions, any \nreal estate owned by the individual, and $600,000 in gain, which means \nthat the person would have to have assets of about $5 million before \nthey could even reach the threshold of being taxed.\n  So, I believe that citizenship comes with certain responsibilities. \nThose responsibilities are to pay one's fair share of tax; that is, \nboth income tax and, upon death, it includes estate tax.\n  I regret that this was dropped in conference. But I do not have any \ndoubt of the commitment of the distinguished Senator from Oregon to see \nthat this is going to be passed this year. I certainly do, and I say \nthe distinguished Senator from Oregon does as well. I believe that we \nwill see this passed this year. We had a hearing. There was nothing in \nthe hearing that made me believe that we would not pass this in some \nform. There might be a change here or there. It will be effective \nFebruary 6.\n  So the message is out to all those around Washington who might be \nlooking for nice arrangements that there will be no change in this \ndate. If you have begun your renunciation of citizenship on February \n20, do not expect the date to slip. It is February 6.\n  So, Mr. President, I simply want to reassert my belief that this \namendment will pass. I will offer it again. We will have a process to \nlook at this. The distinguished Senator from New York, and I believe \nthe Senator from Oregon, will also support this measure and it will \npass and become law this year.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota very briefly, about 2 minutes, and then I will \nreclaim the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the courtesy of the \nmajority leader.\n  I support the sense-of-the-Senate resolution offered by Senator \nKennedy. I agree with the Senator from New Jersey that I believe that \nby the end of this year this will be law.\n  I also want to say, however, that I hope this afternoon a method is \ndeveloped by which we can pass the conference report on this matter. We \nhave small business men and women, sole proprietorships, farmers all \nacross this country who are now about 15 months past due and about 70 \npercent short, even with this bill, of achieving what they ought to \nhave; and, that is, 100 percent deductibility for health insurance. I \nthink time is of the essence.\n  While I support the sense-of-the-Senate resolution, I hope very much \nthat it will not delay passage this afternoon of this piece of \nlegislation. This piece \n[[Page S4979]] of legislation is essential for millions of small \nbusiness people, and it is very, very time sensitive. I believe that we \nought to move it. I hope that a method is found by which we can do that \nthis afternoon.\n  Let me say one more time that tax deductibility for health insurance \nfor sole proprietors in this country is essential, and it is not just \nessential in this bill at 30 percent. We need to do more. The next step \nis to go to 100 percent.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is it possible now to pass the conference report by a voice \nvote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the conference \nreport?\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask that the yeas and nays be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand the request is to vitiate \nthe yeas and nays. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. The question is on the conference report?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the conference report.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I have stated earlier, I for one \nwelcome the opportunity to set a time definite for the passage of the \nconference report so that everyone in this country will know as of now, \nthis afternoon, that this conference report is going through and will \nbe achieved.\n  I mean, it is interesting in that we have been debating the \nrescissions. I was here last night. When the majority leader was \ntalking about urging action on the rescissions, I did not hear that, \nwell, we are going to take up the conference report, that there was \nsuch a compelling sense of urgency about it. But obviously there is a \nsense of urgency, and I am more than glad to enter into an agreement \nthat we pass it at a time certain.\n  I also believe that we should have the opportunity to put the Senate \non record, hopefully unanimously, Republicans and Democrats alike, to \nsay with regard to the provision--which passed the Senate--the \nprovision that provides for tax payment from those wealthy individuals \nwho decide to renounce their citizenship--$3.6 billion worth--that we \nare going on record to insist that this provision is going to become \nthe law.\n  Now, I have great respect for my colleagues and their desire to make \nsure that this provision becomes the law, and I know that they can be \nvery persuasive in those conferences. But the fact is, we had the \nprovision in this bill, the bill went to conference, and the \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives had their way and the \nprovision was dropped.\n  The best way to indicate to the House conferees in the future that we \nare serious about this is to have a unanimous vote in the Senate. \nTherefore, I believe that that ought to be the procedure that is \nfollowed, that we should have an opportunity--hopefully it would be a \nunanimous vote--to say that the Senate is going on record in strong \nsupport of the provision that would have resulted in $3.6 billion in \nrevenue, according to the Finance Committee--$3.6 billion.\n  That provision has been dropped. I believe it was a mistake to drop \nit, and the Senate of the United States ought to go on record with a \nbroad, overwhelming majority to say that we want it reinstated as \noutlined here, and that 100 Senators believe this to be so.\n  And I just finally would say I think it is entirely appropriate to go \non record at this particular time when we are debating rescissions. As \nsoon as this issue is resolved, we will be talking in this Chamber \nabout the amendment of the Senator from South Dakota which relates to \neducation of children and to child care. The cost of the Senator's \namendment is a third of this $3.6 billion cost, a third of this cost. I \nthink it is entirely appropriate that we go on record at this time, Mr. \nPresident.\n  There is no desire to delay. I was glad to stay here and am prepared \nto go ahead and see votes on the rescissions. I plan to be here. I am \nhere this afternoon. I waited here yesterday to speak for the amendment \nof the Senator from South Dakota. I waited from 2 o'clock until 10 \no'clock last night, to be able to speak for it.\n  We spoke very briefly on the Senator's amendment. Then we had an \namendment that was put right on top of it which precluded us from \nhaving any further debate and discussion. Then this measure came right \nin. I was going to exit the floor at 3 minutes of 12 and then was told \nthat this measure was going to come on in here and was going to be \npassed in a few moments, and I had to object to it, without having the \nopportunity to talk to the Democratic Members and others on that \nconference committee.\n  That is not how you treat the institution, Mr. President. I am glad \nto cooperate, and I urge that we set a time definite for the vote and \nthe final disposition of the conference report, and that prior to that \ntime we have an opportunity to express the sense of the Senate--which I \nhope will be unanimous--in order to reaffirm the Senate's position on \nthe provision that has been reported out favorably--virtually \nunanimously, Republican and Democrat alike--from the Finance Committee \nand accepted virtually unanimously by the Members of this body. If we \ncan get that process set up, then I think that would be the best way to \nproceed.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I know the Senator from Massachusetts said he does not have \nany confidence in anybody on the Finance Committee, either party, so we \nare going to hold hostage all weekend millions of people out there who \nwant to do their tax returns because we do not trust each other. There \nare 3.1 million filers and they live in all of our States. We have got \nthem down now to 2 weeks. We are going to squeeze them now, take 3 days \naway from them. They are going to have to file amended returns, which \nis going to cost them a lot of money, but it is going to make somebody \nfeel good in the Senate.\n  That is why the American people are so frustrated when they look at \nCongress. No wonder it is only a 31-percent approval rating. After \ntoday, it will probably drop to 10. Every time we bring up a bill this \nsession we have this turkey shoot. Everybody over on the other side \nfigures out some little political amendment they can offer. And I have \nserved notice on the White House today we are not bringing up any more \nbills the White House wants until we have some understanding on the \nlegislation that we thought would go through here in a normal way. If \nthe President does not care, that is good enough for me. If he does not \nwant this legislation, we are not going to take it up, but neither will \nwe take up legislation that he wants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/31/senate-section/article/S4974-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4979-S4980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the conference \n     report to accompany H.R. 831, the Self-Employed Health \n     Insurance Act:\n         Robert Dole, Bob Packwood, John Ashcroft, Orrin Hatch, \n           Richard Lugar, Lauch Faircloth, Larry Pressler, Thad \n           Cochran, Trent Lott, Pete Domenici, Rick Santorum, \n           Larry Craig, Alfonse D'Amato, Hank Brown, James Inhofe, \n           and Slade Gorton.\n\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. It is my intent to either have a pro forma session tomorrow \nor, unless we can agree to count a day and it will not be necessary to \nhave a pro forma session, come in at 11 o'clock on Monday, and the \ncloture vote will occur at 12 o'clock.\n  Now, if those who feel so strongly about this little sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution want to deny us cloture, why, that is fine. We will \nexplain to the \n[[Page S4980]] 3.1 million people in Minnesota and Kansas and Oregon \nand Massachusetts and California and Oklahoma, wherever, what is \nholding us up, why they are going to have to pay their lawyer, their \naccountant to file an amended return because some Senators wanted to \nhave a little fun in the Senate and we were not interested in their \nwelfare. We are not willing to take the word of our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle about an amendment that already passed the Senate. \nAs we learned since then, it should be corrected as pointed out by the \nSenator from Florida.\n  Now, maybe the Senator from Massachusetts feels that he has a special \nright in the Senate where he can have everything he wants voted on \nbefore anything else. It does not work that way. The Senator from New \nYork wanted to have a vote yesterday on his amendment. I did not see \nanybody letting him vote. We had a filibuster going on on the other \nside, from Members on the other side of the aisle who would not raise \ntheir voice when we were first talking about helping Mexico. We could \nnot get one Member on this side to stand up and say they supported the \nPresident of the United States. But they would not let Senator D'Amato \nvote. No. That was a very important issue.\n  We are supposed to hold up 3.1 million filers, about 9 million \npeople, because the Senator from Massachusetts wants to vote on his \nlittle sense-of-the-Senate thing first. He does not have confidence, \napparently, in those of us on the Finance Committee.\n  That is his choice. That will be the choice of all those who support \nthe Senator. So the moment of truth will come at noon on Monday when we \nhave a cloture vote.\n  If we cannot get cloture on Monday, I do not know when the conference \nreport will pass.\n  I wish to thank both Senators Packwood and Moynihan for their efforts \nto bring this to the floor and pass it to help millions of people in \nAmerica. I guess maybe only a third will have to file amended returns. \nI do not know what it costs any more; probably $50, $100. You can add \nup the costs going to real people--the taxpayers.\n  But, again, if that is what the Senator from Massachusetts wants, we \nwill do the best we can. And the best thing I can think of is to do as \nI have just done: File a cloture motion and indicate there will be no \nmore votes today, and indicate we will be in tomorrow, if necessary. \nBut, in any event, there will be a cloture vote at noon on Monday.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/31/senate-section/article/S4979-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4980-S4981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           SITUATION IN HAITI\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, President Clinton is in Haiti today as part \nof the transition from American control to U.N. control. All Americans \nare proud of the performance of the men and women of our Armed Forces \nin Haiti. As always they have served where ordered with skill and \ncourage. And all Americans are pleased that the occupation of Haiti has \ngone as smoothly as it has.\n  We all support democracy in Haiti. That does not mean, however, that \nwe should have occupied Haiti in the first place. And the transition to \nU.N. command serves as a reminder that all concerns about the Haiti \noperation are not over.\n  First, we would do well to remember that the problems in Somalia did \nnot occur under United States command--they occurred after the \noperation was transferred to U.N. control. We learned the hard way that \nthe agenda of Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the United Nations is not the \nAmerican agenda. It is true the U.N. commander is an American--Gen. \nJoseph Kinzer--but the U.N. bureaucrats will be in the loop. The \nproblem of Mission Creep has already been raised--in requests to disarm \nthe Haitian population, for example. In my view, U.N. command of \nAmerican soldiers should be avoided.\n  Second, the costs of Haiti are mounting daily; $1\\1/2\\ billion have \nalready been spent on the occupation and nation-building in Haiti. The \ntab is only going to go up--up to $2 billion or more. In a time of \nsevere budget cuts, and in a time when foreign aid is being reduced, we \nmust ask whether we can afford $2 billion for Haiti.\n  Third, Haiti still has a long way to go. Elections called for in the \nHaitian Constitution have been\n postponed. Political assassination appears to be on the rise. Serious \nreports of involvement by the Aristide government in this week's murder \nhave been made, and they deserve full examination. Little effort to \nreach out to parliamentary opponents has occurred. There are disturbing \nindications that President Aristide or his supporters are subverting \nthe democratic process. Despite the ceremony today, we realize there \nare real problems in Haiti--and there will continue to be problems, no \nmatter how long the United States or the United Nations stays in Haiti.\n\n  We all support genuine efforts at reconciliation and democracy in \nHaiti. We hope the long-delayed elections move forward in Haiti--that \nthey are free and fair, that the results are respected by all Haitians, \nand that President Aristide keeps his promise to step down. As a recent \narticle by President Clinton's former envoy to Haiti points out, the \nhard work of restoring democracy in Haiti was not returning President \nAristide from exile--it is in building truly democratic institutions in \na country that has never known them.\n  I ask consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 22, 1995]\n\n                        A Voice for All Haitians\n\n       Operation Restore Democracy landed more than 20,000 U.S. \n     soldiers in Haiti and secured the return of President Jean-\n     Bertrand Aristide on Oct. 15, 1994. ``We have helped to give \n     the people of Haiti a chance to remake the democracy they \n     earned, they deserve and they plainly wish for,'' said \n     President Clinton on the eve of Aristide's return. Today that \n     goal, which appears to have been eclipsed by the Clinton \n     administration's need to portray Haiti as a foreign policy \n     victory, is in danger of being subverted by some of \n     Aristide's most ardent supporters.\n       The issue before Aristide is the election of some 2,000 \n     local officials, 18 of the 27 senators and all 83 deputies, \n     scheduled to be held June 4. There's little doubt among \n     political observers that Aristide's Lavalas movement will win \n     big. In fact, in some districts four and even five candidates \n     are competing for the honor of representing their movement. \n     But legitimate opposition parties charge that the Aristide \n     government is stacking the Provisional Electoral Council with \n     Lavalas loyalists and making arbitrary decisions that \n     prejudice fair and open elections.\n       When former President Jimmy Carter traveled to Haiti \n     recently to raise these concerns, he was greeted with obscene \n     graffiti painted by Aristide supporters. The mildest epithets \n     called our ex-president ``a false democrat,'' ``a thug'' and \n     a ``danger to democracy.'' While Aristide praised Carter to \n     his face, his close advisers characterized the ex-president \n     as ``tricky and sneaky'' behind his back. Carter offered to \n     perform the same role he did in 1990, when he and a group of \n     international monitors ensured Aristide's free election in a \n     political atmosphere that was even more problematic than it \n     is now. It's a role he's played in Nicaragua, Panama and \n     Guyana. This time Carter's services were turned down.\n       Why? Whether Aristide is leading the move to consolidate \n     power at the expense of political opponents or permitting the \n     more radical elements in his Lavalas movement a free hand is \n     not clear. One former member of the coalition that supported \n     Aristide's presidential candidacy in 1990 predicted to us \n     that paramilitary groups would emerge if the political right \n     is not given an opportunity to participate fully in the \n     political process. Political violence and even civil war are \n     possible in this highly polarized society, he says. And \n     legitimate democrats are fearful and frustrated. They see the \n     heavy-handedness of the Aristide camp as a portent of the \n     authoritarianism that has plagued the political history of \n     their country.\n       The fairness of the June elections raises the larger issue \n     of political reconciliation in Haiti, which has been \n     championed by Haitian politicians on all levels of the \n     political spectrum as the key to the future of democracy in\n      their country. Unfortunately, this goal was abandoned by the \n     Clinton administration almost a year ago, when Aristide \n     lobbied hard for U.S. military intervention to restore him \n     to power. He got his way. Since then he has dismantled the \n     Haitian military. Remnants of the old police force now \n     operate under international supervision. And the new \n     police force that is being trained poses no threat to him. \n     Interestingly, the only attempt to politicize the police \n     force--which the U.S. Embassy, to its credit, put an end \n     to--came from the Aristide camp.\n       When Aristide's political rivals extended the olive branch \n     in July 1993 during the New York Pact and again in the spring \n     of last year, they were accused of advocating ``power \n     sharing'' and pushed away. This came after first U.N. \n     Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and then Vice \n     President Gore assured Aristide in person that neither the \n     United Nations nor the United States would accept any \n     agreement that would threaten his constitutional power. It's \n     important to remember that the Haitian \n     [[Page S4981]] constitution of 1987 provides for a \n     parliamentary system of government with executive authority \n     divided between a president and a prime minister. Political \n     reconciliation is necessary before the larger task of nation-\n     building can begin.\n       Aristide has the opportunity to initiate a new, \n     constructive phase in Haitian history. But first he must take \n     the lead in creating a participatory political culture in \n     which all Haitians have a voice. The coming elections are an \n     excellent place to start. If he can bring himself to play a \n     historically creative role, he may be able to convince \n     Haitians steeped in cynicism that political comity is \n     achievable. And once the promise of political stability is \n     buttressed by visible signs of political reconciliation, he \n     may find it easier to attract the private investment that his \n     country desperately needs.\n       Rather than resting on laurels that can quickly turn to \n     ashes, the Clinton administration should view the Carter \n     visit as a wake-up call. It should take the lead in getting \n     more international observers to monitor the June elections. \n     And, more important, it should be urging Aristide to act as a \n     true democrat and president of all the people of Haiti at \n     this critical time.\n       Lawrence Pezzullo is former special adviser on Haiti to the \n     Clinton administration.

Mr. President, I am disappointed with the news that we \nwill not have the opportunity to vote on the conference report. I do \nnot think there is any doubt that when the conference report passes, it \nwill pass overwhelmingly.\n  There is no need to file a cloture petition. There is not one \nDemocrat holding up the conference report this afternoon--not one. \nWhenever we have that vote, it will be overwhelming. Cloture will be \ninvoked overwhelmingly. I doubt that even one Democrat will oppose \ncloture. So to go for a cloture motion at this point is really \nmeaningless. There is no need for it. No one is holding up the \nconference report.\n  Cloture is designed to break a filibuster. There is no filibuster. We \nhave not even had a good chance to discuss it, much less filibuster it.\n  So for anyone to misunderstand what is happening here would be a very \nsignificant mistake. The fact is, we are on the floor this afternoon \nand we are prepared to work.\n  I had hoped that by now we would be in the middle of a good debate \nabout protecting children. I thought we would have a good opportunity \nhere to talk about helping 1 million children with the Democratic \namendment that was offered this morning. That is what this debate was \nsupposed to be all about today. The fact that that debate is not being \nheld is, in and of itself, a very significant disappointment. Because \nthe majority leader saw fit to offer a second-degree to our amendment, \nI also feel very disappointed.\n  The fact is that we ought to have an opportunity for an up-or-down \nvote on that amendment itself. If the Republicans have alternatives, we \nought to discuss those. But we will save that argument for another day.\n  It was the majority leader's decision to take that legislation off \nthe table and then to put the conference report before the Senate for \nconsideration this afternoon.\n  All we were suggesting as part of that consideration is to deal with \nthe matter the Finance Committee had taken up, and that was to \neliminate a tax break providing millions of dollars of benefits to some \nof the wealthiest people in this country.\n  The headline in the Washington Post says it all: ``Tax Break for \nWealthy Expatriates Sparks Class Warfare Charges: `Confiscatory Tax' on \nRich Who Leave U.S. Denounced.''\n  What kind of class are we protecting here, for heavens sake? What \nkind of class warfare is this?\n  The real class warfare is occurring by many Republicans who will not \neven allow us to have a vote on the minimum wage issue. That is class \nwarfare; an unwillingness to provide those at the lowest rung of the \neconomic ladder with a meaningful income. That, in my view, is what \nclass warfare is all about.\n  Every Republican and Democrat ought to be opposed to providing \nexpatriates a huge tax handout. There should not be any question about \nthat.\n  But let there be no mistake: As strongly as we feel about this, as \nstrongly as we want to address this issue, we are prepared to set it \naside, to have a vote at a time certain next week so that we can move \nalong the legislation dealing with the deductibility for the self-\nemployed.\n  We want that to happen. We are going to vote for cloture on Monday. \nWe are going to support it on Monday or Tuesday, whenever the leader \ndecides to bring it up. And it is our desire to move this legislation \nalong as quickly as possible.\n  So there is a nice ring, perhaps, to the indignation on the other \nside, but the fact is that ring rings pretty hollow when the truth is \nlaid out. The fact of the matter is, very clearly, Democrats want just \nas much as Republicans to pass this legislation.\n  We offered a vote in relation to both Senator D'Amato's and Senator \nKennedy's amendments on Tuesday morning and to pass the conference \nreport today.\n  So the record ought to be very clear about this. We were going to \nbreak the logjam the Republicans caused yesterday with the D'Amato \namendment. We were going to break the logjam that was created, in part, \nby the determination by some Republicans to protect the wealthiest \namong us, and we were prepared to have the votes next week, Monday and \nTuesday, just as quickly as we could work out an arrangement for both \nDemocrats and Republicans.\n  That is not going to happen, and I am disappointed. It is only 1:30. \nWe should not have the afternoon off. We ought to have the ability to \ndebate why we are leaving 1 million children unprotected as a result of \nthe rescissions made in the supplemental that has been pending before \nthe Senate all week.\n  We ought to talk about the ramifications of 5,000 kids being denied \nopportunities to get adequate child care and hundreds of thousands of \nchildren who \n[[Page S4982]] are not going to get the opportunities in education that \nthey should because we are rescinding the funds that provide those \nopportunities.\n  Those are the kinds of debates we needed to have this afternoon. It \nis very unfortunate that we will not be given that chance.\n  Let me say one more time, without equivocation so that everyone \nunderstands, we want the legislation to provide tax deductibility for \nthe self-insured to pass this afternoon. We are prepared to vote right \nnow. We will bring people back and vote as often as we need to to make \nthat point clear, if that is required. But there ought not be any \nmistake. No one on this side of the aisle is holding that provision up. \nWe want it this afternoon. We will take it on Monday, we will take it \nwhenever it is offered, but it is going to happen, and it is going to \nhappen with overwhelming Democratic support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank our leader, Senator Daschle, for \na very clear, concise summation as to where we are in the Senate this \nafternoon.\n  I might be missing something. I think, given the tone of some of \nthose who have spoken this afternoon, that evidently I am missing \nsomething. All week we talked about how we were going to get into the \nissue of rescissions. That is a matter of enormous importance and \nconsequence. The reason it is of enormous importance and consequence, \nin many respects more so than regular appropriations bills, is because \nthis is funding that has already been planned to be used.\n  In particular, when so many of the funding cuts that are included in \nthe rescissions bill affect children and affect education, this is the \nopportunity for the Senate of the United States to make a statement, to \nhave a debate, and to have accountability--and also, hopefully, to take \npositive action on those issues affecting children and education.\n  The Senator from South Dakota indicated earlier in the week that he \nwas prepared to offer an overall amendment to try to reflect the \nposition of a number of different Members of the Senate on these issues \naffecting children and education and voluntarism. He had stated that \nearlier in the week.\n  It was his hope to offer that amendment yesterday but when our friend \nand colleague the Senator from Connecticut came over here to speak on \nchildren's issues, unbeknownst to us, as the debate will show, there \nwas another amendment before us that was not related to the \nrescission--an amendment that dealt with the Mexican situation. That \nissue is enormously important and enormously significant.\n  There was certainly an indication from our side that if the issue \nregarding Mexico was to be decided and considered as an independent \nkind of issue, then the matter could be resolved.\n  But nonetheless, no, we had no opportunity to consider the Daschle \namendment.\n  Last evening, when I was down in the well at about 10 o'clock there \nwas a sense of urgency: ``We have to move ahead with this bill,'' the \nSenator from Oregon said. ``We are going to stay in all Thursday night \nand all day Friday.'' Read the Record--all day Friday. We are going to \nstay here even into Saturday if we have to, he said; we have to finish \nthe bill. There was no comment that the conference report was coming \nup. That is a different issue, but we understood we were staying here \nto complete the bill.\n  And then there were the inquiries in the well: ``When are you going \nto bring that amendment up?'' It was decided that the Senator from \nSouth Dakota's amendment would be brought up at 10 o'clock this \nmorning. Many of us who are the cosponsors and have had a longstanding \ninterest, committee jurisdiction interest, came over to be able to \ndebate and discuss these issues--at least to make a case about the \nimportance of Head Start, the importance of chapter 1, the importance \nof the volunteer community service program.\n  The minority leader had hardly gotten his amendment in when there was \nan amendment on top of it--an amendment on top of it. Usually in this \ninstitution, you permit the person putting the amendment in and the \nprincipal cosponsors to speak in favor. That courtesy was not even \naccorded. We were off and running on another amendment in the second \ndegree that continued on through the morning.\n  Many of us stayed here. We continued to think that, because of what \nthe majority leader said, we were going to have an opportunity to make \nour case. Then at 12 o'clock, with a few minutes notice, we were told \nwe were going to set aside the rescission issue. We were only going to \nreturn to the rescissions after the disposition of the conference \nreport, which excluded a very, very important provision that had been \naccepted here in the Senate unanimously, a provision that was valued at \n$3.6 billion--$3.6 billion.\n  Well, Mr. President, on the one hand, the minority leader's amendment \nis $1.3 billion for children that we intended to battle for. It \nreflects a very substantial group of the Members here, hopefully \nbipartisan, but certainly an overwhelming majority of the Members on \nour side. It is $1.3 billion.\n  Then we were asked, in a matter of moments, to consider another \nmeasure, which I support, which is the deduction in terms of the self-\nemployed. In that particular measure, the conferees had dropped a \nrevenue measure that would have been worth $3.6 billion, almost three \ntimes the amount of money that would fund the children's programs. And \nwe are being labeled this afternoon as being somehow not considerate of \nthe small business men and women.\n  As the leader said, it is 1:30. We are glad to talk about these \nissues. We are glad to debate them. I am glad to vote on these \nmeasures. And suddenly we found out, no, we are not going to do it. \nAfter he speaks, after you speak, the Senate is going out and, no, we \nare not going to give any consideration to these issues, we are not \ngoing to debate them.\n  It is a reasonable juxtaposition--$3.6 billion from wealthy \nindividuals who renounce their citizenship and $1.3 million for \nchildren's programs.\n  The $3.6 billion is on a measure which was accepted unanimously here \nin the Senate but resisted by House Republicans. We are told, ``Well, \nwe'll do our best, we'll try to come back, the next time we'll do \nbetter.'' I do not question or doubt the commitment of those members of \nthe Finance Committee--but I have been around long enough to know that \nwhen you go into conference with a vote of 100-0 of the Members, you \nget more attention from the House. That is the record around here. That \nis the history around here.\n  All we are doing is saying let us have a chance to express ourselves \non this issue. Let us have a chance to express our view on this \nprovision that was worth $3.6 billion when it passed through here last \ntime and $3.6 billion less when it is considered now this afternoon. We \nare told that for objecting to that change, we are told by the \nRepublicans that we do not care, we somehow do not really care about \nthe small business men and women. Let me tell you, Mr. President, I \npropose that we have a vote on adoption at a time certain--at 5 o'clock \non Monday--and a 4 o'clock vote on the sense of the Senate.\n  I am going to vote for the cloture motion. It is going to be agreed \nto. The minority leader is quite correct, every American ought to \nunderstand it is going to go through on Monday at whatever time is \nestablished by the majority. It is going to go through. We are all \ngoing to vote for it. I do not know anybody who is going to vote \nagainst it. That is why this is an extraordinary set of circumstances. \nI am going to vote for it. Everyone is going to vote for it. But this \nissue is not going to go away. This issue is not going to go away.\n  We were quite prepared to have a vote on the measure at a time \ncertain that would accommodate most Members--I would leave that up to \nthe majority and minority leaders on Monday, whenever they want, they \nknow the schedule--and to have a vote on the sense of the Senate at a \ntime certain. We were even prepared to have that vote on adoption of \nthe conference report and then a time certain have a vote on the sense \nof the Senate.\n That was certainly acceptable. But we in this body ought to be able to \nexpress ourselves on an issue of that kind of consequence and \nimportance; $3.6 billion--here today, gone tomorrow, when \n[[Page S4983]] one of the major amendments on the rescissions is going \nto be $1.3 billion.\n  There are a dozen other amendments, Mr. President--on the voluntary \ncommunity service programs, on education programs, children's \nprograms--that are a fraction of that, a fraction of the $1.3 billion. \nNobody is interested in an undue delay in the rescissions bill.\n  But to say that, my goodness, this is somehow out of sync with what \nhas gone on in common debate, and that this is an unusual way to \nproceed, defies the history of this institution.\n  I must say, I would think that the parents of those children would \nhave to be asking themselves this afternoon, why is it that my child, \nwho is one of those 70,000 that could have received assistance under \nthe chapter 1 program, or under Head Start, will not be able to get it? \nWhy is the $1.3 billion is not there? My child will not be able to get \nin a Head Start Program because the resources are not there; my child \nwill not be able to get day care because the money is not there. We are \nsaying, no, your child will not get into Head Start, will not get into \nchapter 1, we are saying no to the school boards that are trying to \nhave education reform, and no to the school boards and parents, that we \ncannot afford to provide the already appropriated $100 million for safe \nschools.\n  The Senator from North Dakota debated the issue about guns in the \nschools, and we had a long debate about safety in the schools. And we \naccepted money for safety in the schools--$100 million is proposed to \nbe cut out of that. Parents are wondering why, if my school board wants \nto have those programs for safety in the schools, we cannot have it. \nThe money has just been rescinded. We have just said no to $3.6 billion \nin revenue that was accepted unanimously by Republicans and Democrats \nin the Senate. That is gone. That disappeared somewhere out there.\n  To raise the issue that somehow we are not really serious about \ndealing with this underlying issue, that is hogwash. I do not know why \nit is that every time you agree with one side of the aisle, you are a \nstatesman or a stateswoman, and when you do not, you are political. \nJust read the Record on that. That was said earlier today. You are \npolitical somehow. This is politics. It is about children. When you \nagree, you are a statesman; when you differ, it is somehow politics. We \nheard that on the floor. I was not here. I was at another conference \ndealing with another issue which is affecting working people, the issue \non the minimum wage.\n  Four years ago, the last incremental increase in the minimum wage \ntook place. We have not had an increase in the minimum wage in the \nperiod of the last 4 years. Most Americans believe that men and women \nin this country want to and can work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the \nyear, and if they do, then they ought to be able to provide for their \nfamilies. That has been true under Republicans and Democrats. The last \ntime we increased the minimum wage, we had a Democratic Congress and a \nRepublican President. Bob Dole voted for the increase and so did Newt \nGingrich. We are just asking to bring the purchasing power back to \nwhere it was 4 years ago. But they say, ``We have no time to debate it. \nWe have no time to consider it. We are opposed to it.''\n  Evidently, those dozen multimillionaires were able to get their wages \nor incomes taken care of--to the tune of $3.6 billion. They are able to \nget their interests taken care of.\n  Well, I wish that we had on the floor of the Senate the Dowd family--\na young, very appealing young man and his wife and two children, making \nvirtually the minimum wage. They spend $75, $80 a month just to repay a \nstudent loan. He is making the minimum wage and is still trying to pay \na student loan. He did not have enough money to continue his education, \nand he is trying to pay for it. They are both working, Mr. President, \ntrying to make ends meet.\n  As we pointed out--and I see my friend and colleague Senator Simon on \nthe floor here, and he attended that event--the principal problem this \nfamily has--even though they could do better in remaining on welfare, \nthey want to work and want to be able to provide for their children--\nthe principal problem they have is that they do not have enough time to \nspend with their children. The mother's principal concern is that, ``My \nchildren will not grow up in a home like I did, where we used to be \nable to have one meal a day together, dinner. That does not happen in \nour family because my husband comes home at 3 o'clock, and I leave at \n3:30.'' They spend an hour and a half with their children on the \nweekends.\n  These are our fellow citizens. They are wondering why some of us are \nraising the issue of preserving $3.6 billion for a dozen very wealthy \nindividuals who renounced their citizenship and we have no time for \nthese hard-working Americans. They are not out there to renounce their \ncitizenship; they are not out there to try to find loopholes; they are \nnot out there to try to evade the taxes. They are playing by the rules. \nThey are playing by the rules and are honored to be citizens of this \ncountry. But we have no time to consider them. We do not have the time. \nThat is shameful, Mr. President.\n  I am not going to be lectured to by any Member of this body about \nwhat is in the interest of those self-employed people. We know what is \ngoing on. We know. That is a red herring. That is a red herring for \nprotecting those dozen wealthy taxpayers who want to change their \nnationality and bug out with all the money that they have made here in \nthis country. That is scandalous.\n  So I am quite prepared to discuss this issue. There are those who \nsay, oh, well, by doing this we are somehow not concerned. The American \npeople are much more intelligent and much fairer than many in this body \ngive them credit for. And they know, or hopefully they will know, what \nis at issue here. It is an issue about fairness. You can talk about \nprovisions and contracts and compacts and all the rest of it. But, Mr. \nPresident, it is wrong, it stinks.\n  It stinks when we reject a provision that would have provided $3.6 \nbillion in revenues for the deficit. We are trying to do something \nabout education and children in this country, and this provison, which \nthe Finance Committee said will return $3.6 billion, disappears out \nthere because of some complexity. This loophole remains, and at the \nsame time we are not prepared to get some resolution on the issues that \nhave been talked about in Senator Daschle's amendment--the Head Start \nchildren in this country, or the chapter 1 kids, or safe schools, or \nthe day care programs. That is just wrong.\n  This Senator is not going to go along with it this afternoon. We will \nhave a chance to vote in favor of cloture, and that conference report \nwill pass and will become law. Every self-employed person ought to \nunderstand that there was not one person on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate who spoke this afternoon who is not going to vote in favor of \nand support the conference report. I certainly urge that they do.\n  This did not have to happen this way. All we had to do was accept the \nsense of the Senate, pass this measure, and it could have been done \nthis afternoon. We could have done it that way, or we will do it in a \ndifferent way. We are still going to do it. I regret the inconvenience \nto Members if their plans have to be altered; but it did not have to be \nthat way. I think the Record will show that it did not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. SMITH assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, before I get into prepared remarks on \nanother subject, let me associate myself with the remarks of Senator \nKennedy. I think we have to ask ourselves why we can be so responsive \nto a few millionaires who want a tax break that is going to cost $3.6 \nbillion and we cannot respond to millions of Americans who are \nstruggling at the minimum wage?\n  I think we have to go to two things. No. 1, our system of financing \npolitical campaigns. Those millionaires, I am sure, if we look at our \nfinancial records, have contributed to Members of the Senate. Maybe to \nPaul Simon, I do not know. They have a voice.\n  How many people working at the minimum wage have contributed to \nMembers of the U.S. Senate? Not very many, if any, because they cannot \nafford it.\n  We respond to those too much, to too great a degree, who pay for our \ncampaigns. That is the simple reality.\n  I think the second reality is, millionaires can hire the lobbyists. \nThat is \n[[Page S4984]] part of our system. I do not suggest that we change \nthat. I do suggest that we change the way we finance campaigns.\n  What we have to keep in mind is, who is contacting Members? And the \npeople who have real needs, working men and women who are struggling, \nare they getting their voices through? Too often, they are not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/31/senate-section/article/S4981-5", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4984-S4987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FOREIGN AID AND FAMILY VALUES\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, after I announced I would not seek \nreelection to the Senate, President Clinton called me and suggested \nthat periodically I should make comments about issues, on the \nassumption that someone who will not again be a candidate for public \noffice could speak without having the onus of public gain associated \nwith the remarks. This is the second in a series of observations in \nresponse to the President's suggestion.\n  We have heard a great deal about family values during the recent \npolitical season. There are few Americans who do not recognize the \nvirtues of family values and treasure them. However, in no other nation \ndo political leaders talk as much about family values as in our \ncountry, and in no other Western industrialized nation is there \nanywhere close to the 23 percent of children living in poverty that we \nhave.\n  Political leaders talk more about family values than act upon them. \nAssuming that we are serious in our concerns about family values, we \nshould ask ourselves what that implies in policy.\n  There are some obvious answers. We will be concerned about one \nanother in a family. Violence will not be part of that family life. \nEach person will try to live responsibly and help others in the family \nwhen there are needs, great or small.\n  A slight bit of reflection will cause people to recognize, if we \nfollow the finest ethical standards and if we show love and concern for \neveryone in our household, but ignore the problems of our neighbors, we \nwill not be protecting our family. We will have failed in our attempt \nto project family values.\n  If the neighborhood in which we live deteriorates, our family is in \njeopardy because of problems of crime, or simply because of a loss of \neconomic value to our home. If an unpleasant atmosphere where we live \nreplaces a pleasant atmosphere, fear will be the unseen companion, as \nour family members walk the streets of such a neighborhood.\n  Anyone who professes family values but ignores the neighborhood is \nbetraying the very values he or she professes.\n  What is true of homes immediately adjacent to that family is also \ntrue of homes 6 blocks away. While the threats of crime and economic \ndeterioration are less pressing than to a home next door, the threats \nare, nevertheless, real. We recognize that family values are not a set \nof virtues to be practiced in isolation.\n  On further reflection, we recognize that what is true of immediate \nneighbors and those who live 1 mile away is true for those at greater \ndistances. Ultimately, people in the Chicago suburbs who wish to \npractice family values must understand that they have a stake in what \nhappens on the west side of Chicago. People in New York sense that they \nhave a responsibility to themselves to help victims of a flood in \nCalifornia.\n  ``One Nation, under God, indivisible,'' is more than a phrase. To the \nextent that we create that as a reality, we protect our families. To \nthe extent that we permit the artificial barriers of race or geography \nor sex or religion or ethnic background to diminish our concern for one \nanother, we diminish the quality of life for our families--all of them.\n  Concern for others cannot stop at the borders of our Nation if we are \nto protect our families; 650,000 American homes have experienced grief \nbecause of a loss of a family member in military contests with other \nnations. We have slowly learned that we cannot protect our families \nwhen we ignore the threats to nations beyond our borders.\n  If I were speaking a decade ago, I would have said that the great \nexternal threat to the families of our Nation is nuclear annihilation; \nthe United States and the Soviet Union have thousands of nuclear \nwarheads pointed at each other. If that spark had been ignited in some \nway, civilization, as we know it, would have died.\n  Today, the great threat to our security is instability in trouble \nspots around the world. As the only superpower left in the world, we \nwill either provide leadership or there will be deterioration within \nnations and between nations.\n  Few thoughtful people in this country or any other would deny that \nthe United States should lead. But there are sizable numbers of \nobservers of the international scene who believe this Nation is too \noften squandering its opportunity for significant leadership.\n  Ultimately, the United States, along with the rest of the world, will \nsuffer because of that. I say that with the knowledge that both \npolitical parties in this Nation must do better.\n  President Clinton faced the huge task of moving from Governor of \nArkansas to suddenly becoming the most influential person in the world \nin foreign policy. It is not an easy transition.\n  In March of 1994, he did a better job than in March 1993. This year, \nhe is doing a better job than last year. A year from now, he will do a \nbetter job than he is doing today. That is encouraging. He is a giant \non the international scene by reason of his position.\n  But he is hampered in his effectiveness by limited background and \nalso by the reality that his two key players in international affairs, \nSecretary of State Warren Christopher and National Security Adviser \nAnthony Lake, are capable and knowledgeable but both are, by nature, \ncautious.\n  The net result from the executive branch is leadership that is \ngenerally solid but sometimes not as bold as it might be.\n  The greater deficiency is with the legislative branch. We too often \nmicromanage. I have been guilty of this myself. A much worse offense is \nthat we pander to public opinion and reduce this Nation's ability to \nlead more effectively.\n  A public opinion poll suggests foreign aid is unpopular; we cut \nforeign aid, even when it hurts our long-term interests. If there is a \nsurge of public opinion suggesting that we avoid sharing risk for peace \nwith other nations, we follow the surge of public opinion rather than \nnational and international need.\n  When we discover that speeches calling for reductions in what we pay \nto the United Nations bring applause, we pander to the applause and \nbecome the world's No. 1 deadbeat.\n  What should the United States be doing? Let me suggest three points: \nNo. 1, as a people, we must broaden our understanding of other nations \nand other cultures.\n  The provincialism of Congress mirrors our people.\n  A family cannot be said to truly have family values if they do not \nunderstand one another.\n  That is true within our Nation, where we have far to little \nunderstanding between urban and suburban and rural populations and far \ntoo little understanding across the barriers of race, religion, sex, \nand ethnic background.\n  But it is true beyond the borders of our Nation. The family of \nhumanity needs to understand the hopes and fears, the dreams and \nproblems of those who live in other nations. As we learn, we will be \nwilling to share more than our experiences. But basic knowledge is \nvital, whether within a single family, a community, a nation, or in the \ncommunity of nations.\n  Our knowledge is lacking. That is why the Peace Corps is more \nimportant than what our volunteers do for other nations; we gain a \nsensitivity to other cultures, a major asset to the nation. Colleges \nand universities can do much more to broaden the understanding of \nstudents. Can someone really be considered educated if, upon graduation \nas an engineer or physician or teacher or journalist or accountant or \narchitect, he or she does not have the most minimal understanding of \nthe rest of the world? We understandably lament the failure of too many \ngraduates having even a cursory understanding of the religious heritage \nof the United States, but can people who do not have some appreciation \nof the beliefs of Moslems and Buddhists be expected to deal effectively \nwith other nations?\n  [[Page S4985]] A fine, small, liberal arts college that I attended \nfor 2 years, Dana College in Nebraska, is seriously considering a \nprogram to offer its students assistance which would permit any \nstudent, regardless of family income, to study or travel abroad. The \ntheory is that the students would not only enlarge their personal \nhorizons, but when they return to this small campus, they could \nstimulate others. Dana College has only 600 students, but they come \nfrom 27 States and 14 nations. I hope the college can raise the money \nto do this, and lead other colleges and universities around the nation \nto do the same.\n  Our language provincialism reflects our cultural provincialism. In \nalmost every nation in the world--if not all of them--all elementary \nstudents study a foreign language. In the United States, only a tiny \nfraction do. We are the only nation in which you can go through grade \nschool, high school, college, and get a Ph.D., and never have a year of \na foreign language. We are also the only nation in which, if we study \nFrench or German or some other language for 2 years, we will say, ``I \nhave studied German.'' Or, ``I have studied French.''\n  It is uninformed provincialism that leads Members of Congress to call \nfor laws prohibiting military leaders of any other nation from \ncommanding our troops in a U.N. operation. Ever since George Washington \nhad French leadership for some of our rebels, we have worked with other \nnationals. Would there be anything un-American about having a NATO \ncommander who is Canadian or Italian or from some other NATO nation? \nWill we agree to take part in a U.N. operation only if we're promised a \nleadership role proportionately much greater than the resources we have \ncommitted? Responsible patriotic fervor can sometimes be converted into \nirresponsible nonsense cloaked in ``patriotism.''\n  The media of our Nation should do more to inform us, but faced with \nbudget problems, major newspapers, wire services and networks have \nreduced their overseas personnel.\n  When critics rightfully note that the U.S. budget and policy do not \nreflect the tremendous changes that have occurred in the rest of the \nworld, particularly our military budget, part of the reason is that \neven the people who do not get their news primarily from television \nbites receive too little information about other nations, unless there \nis a crisis. The lack of public understanding of the dramatic changes \nin the world makes it more difficult for leaders in the administration \nand Congress to alter foreign policy.\n  That democracy is spreading in Africa and much of the rest of the \nworld is known by only a tiny fraction of the American people who can \ntell us lurid details of the O.J. Simpson trial.\n  Editors who rightfully criticize Members of Congress for pandering to \npublic whims defend their obsession and excessive attention to the \nSimpson trial by telling us, ``We're giving the public what it wants.'' \nThat is an irresponsible answer for politicians and an irresponsible \nanswer for the media.\n  Commenting on foreign aid, Michael Kinsley wrote recently in the New \nYorker:\n\n       Americans are scandalously ignorant * * *. All over the \n     country--at dinner tables in focus groups, on call-in radio \n     shows and * * * occasionally on the floor of Congress--\n     citizens are expressing outrage about how much we spend on \n     foreign aid, without having the faintest idea of what the \n     amount is. This is not * * * a question of being misinformed. \n     No one--not even Rush Limbaugh--is out there spreading the \n     falsehood that we spend 15 percent of the Federal budget on \n     foreign aid. People are forming and expressing passionate \n     views about foreign aid on the basis of no information at \n     all.\n\n  If we expect the legislative and executive branches of our Government \nto build a responsible course of leadership on a base of public \nignorance, we ask for far more than we are likely to receive.\n  My second point: We should be providing more foreign aid, not less.\n  In probably two out of three of my town meetings people ask: ``Why \ndon't we cut back on foreign aid, and spend the money on our own \nneeds?''\n  They, of course, have no idea that through our aid programs more than \n3 million lives are saved each year through immunization programs; that \nas we help the other countries survive economically, they frequently \nbecome our customers, then lift our standard of living; that much of \nwhat we call foreign aid is spent for food and equipment in the United \nStates.\n  We cannot reverse illiteracy or set up a program to educate people on\n   family planning with a military budget; this takes foreign aid.\n\n  When the political parties of democracies in Asia held a conference \nrecently, they closed their meeting by singing, ``We Shall Overcome,'' \nan expression more of hope than confidence, because democracies in many \nparts of the world are frail. A little help from the United States as \nthe world's leading democracy means much to them, both for the concrete \nhelp and in symbolic terms.\n  When I ask people at town meetings--and I am sure my colleagues from \nNew Hampshire and Michigan have this same experience--what percentage \nof our budget goes for foreign aid, usually the guess is somewhere \nbetween 15 percent and 25 percent. They are startled with I tell them \nit is less than 1 percent.\n  A University of Maryland poll found the same answer. But, then, the \nUniversity of Maryland asked how much would be ``appropriate'' and the \nanswer: 5 percent. When asked how much would be ``too little,'' they \nanswered 3 percent--more than three times what we actually spend.\n  If military aid is subtracted from our foreign assistance, less than \none-half of 1 percent of our budget goes for foreign aid, to economic \nassistance.\n  Because of the huge and growing U.S. debt, this year our gross \ninterest spending will be 22 times the amount we pay for foreign aid. \nEven more startling, because so many U.S. bonds are now held by the \neconomically fortunate beyond our borders, we will spend more than \ntwice as much on interest to them as we do on foreign aid that is \ndesigned in large measure for helping poor people.\n  We appropriate less of our national income for foreign aid than any \nWestern European country or Japan.\n  At one point under the Marshall plan, we spent 2.9 percent of our \nnational income helping the poor beyond our borders. And how properly \nproud we are of it. Today we spend less than one-sixth of 1 percent of \nour national income on foreign economic assistance. Yet most Americans \nbelieve we are the most generous of the wealthier nations. In the \nMarshall plan years our national income--in inflation-adjusted terms--\nwas approximately 40 percent of our present income. As our income has \nrisen, our response to poor people has diminished.\n  But something else is significant about the Marshall plan, which \nrescued Western Europe from communism. When General Marshall announced \nit at a Harvard commencement, and President Truman followed with more \ndetails, the first Gallup Poll showed only 14 percent of the American \npeople supported it.\n  We had a Democratic President who did not consult with pollsters \nbefore he called on the American people, and he had to deal with a \nRepublican Congress. Senator Arthur Vandenberg, a Republican leader \nfrom Michigan, did not first ask what the Marshall plan might do to his \nparty's political fortunes or how he might use it against the \nPresident. A Democratic President and a Republican Congress did the \nunpopular, what was right, and served this Nation and the world well. \nThe lessons to be drawn are obvious.\n  President Ronald Reagan suggested that we should devote 1 percent of \nthe Nation's income to helping the poor beyond our borders, appreciably \nless than we did under the Marshall plan.\n  We have not come close to the Reagan standard.\n  Only Denmark and Norway meet this not-so-high standard. Among other \nnations that assist more than we do are Sweden, Netherlands, France, \nFinland, Canada, Belgium, Germany, Australia, Switzerland, Luxembourg, \nGreat Britain, Austria, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Japan, New Zealand, and \nIreland.\n  Canada does three times better than we do.\n  While we lag behind other nations on economic assistance, we spend \nalmost as much on defense as the rest of the world combined. Looking at \nour budget, you would hardly guess that the Berlin Wall fell. If we \nwere to reduce our defense expenditures by one-half--which I do not \nadvocate--we would still have, by far, the largest expenditure on \n[[Page S4986]] arms of any nation in the world. Unfortunately, we are \ncompounding that problem by pushing many nations to buy arms from our \nweapons producers, arms that too often destabilize an area rather than \nstabilize it.\n  The United States defense budget suggests that the great threat to \nthe world is a Soviet-type attack. The reality is, the great threat is \ninstability. While nations struggle to build democracy, we build more \nB-2 bombers instead of assisting democracy. Purchasing the B-2 bombers \nhelps the manufacturer, but they are designed for yesterday's defense \nneeds. They were useless in Desert Storm and Haiti. While we blunder \nahead with billions on useless bombers, shaky democracies receive our \ncold shoulder. ``We can't afford to help,'' we tell them. While the \nswing to democracy around the world has been dramatic, it is not \nirreversible. Some democracies are likely to fail because of U.S. \ninattention and paltry financial backing.\n  Our weak performance in assisting democracies has been compounded by \nour failure to pass the balanced budget amendment. Instead of lessening \nU.S. government borrowing and reducing interest rates around the world, \nwe have chosen the high-interest-rate course. That causes higher debt \nservice costs for desperately poor people. The executive director of \nthe International Monetary Fund once told me that facing our U.S. \nfiscal problems is more important to the developing world than our \nforeign aid. Yes, we in the United States pay higher interest rates \nbecause of our fiscal folly, but so do many nations who can afford the \nhigh interest rates less than we can, and they have not caused our \nnational debt. The developing nations now owe $1.4 trillion. If U.S. \nimprudence forces interest rates up 1 percent, that potentially costs \nthese poor nations $14 billion. If we exercise fiscal prudence and \ninternational interest drops 1 percent, that potentially saves them $14 \nbillion, far more than our economic assistance.\n  In a family in which one person becomes very wealthy, and others in \nthe family are extremely poor, some suffering from malnutrition, they \nwill not continue to be a cohesive family if the wealthy member of the \nfamily simply ignores the problems of the poorest. A family member who \nmakes no attempt to understand the problems of the poorest in the \nfamily will be regarded by the other family members as arrogant and \ncallous, and when that family member faces problems--which all family \nmembers eventually do--the other members of the family are not likely \nto come to his or her rescue.\n  It takes no great imagination to see where the United States fits \ninto that picture.\n  We should play a stronger role in U.N. peacekeeping and peacemaking.\n  I am impressed by the leadership of Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali. \nBut he has an impossible job if the United States does not play a \nstrong supporting role.\n  That means paying our dues.\n  That means contributing more than dollars to U.N. peacekeeping \nefforts. The latest U.N. report of March 6 of this year shows the \nfollowing troop contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations:\n\n                                                                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     Country    Strength\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFrance...........................................        5,093          \nUnited Kingdom...................................        3,860          \nJordan...........................................        3,698          \nPakistan.........................................        3,102          \nCanada...........................................        2,629          \nBangladesh.......................................        2,208          \nPoland...........................................        2,181          \nNetherlands......................................        1,823          \nNorway...........................................        1,775          \nGhana............................................        1,730          \nMalaysia.........................................        1,677          \nNepal............................................        1,607          \nTurkey...........................................        1,488          \nRussian Federation...............................        1,487          \nSpain............................................        1,452          \nDenmark..........................................        1,368          \nArgentina........................................        1,360          \nSweden...........................................        1,316          \nUkraine..........................................        1,208          \nU.S.A............................................        1,139          \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Nepal, with a population of less than one-tenth of ours, is \ncontributing 41 percent more troops than the United States. Jordan, \nwith a population of 3.2 million--less than 2 percent of our \npopulation--is contributing more than three times as many troops as the \nUnited States.\n  There are 16 U.N. peacekeeping operations underway at this point, and \nwe are contributing troops to 6.\n  But it is more than the deficiency in the contributions of numbers.\n  Somalia illustrates the problem. Contrary to the present public \nimage, the Somalia action was one of George Bush's finest moments and \nsomething for which the United States should be proud. Our actions \nsaved hundreds of thousands of lives.\n  I was in Somalia with Senator Howard Metzenbaum early in November \n1992. I have never seen anything like it, and I hope never to see \nanything like it again. We returned to the United States on a Sunday \nnight and, the next morning, called the U.N. Secretary General. \nFourteen weeks earlier, the U.N. Security Council had authorized 3,500 \ntroops to go to Somalia to help in the desperate situation there. Weeks \nlater, 500 Pakistani soldiers finally arrived and were forced to hole \nup at the airport at Mogadishu, the capital city. I told Boutrous-Ghali \nthat he should get the additional 3,000 troops there immediately and \nthat Somalia needed an additional 10,000 troops, a figure based only on \ninstinct. He told us he would send the additional 3,000 troops by ship. \nWhen I responded vigorously that untold lives would be lost if the \ntroops did not arrive by plane, he noted, ``Your government charges me \nvery high rates to move troops by plane.'' I asked him if we could use \nthe cost of flights to apply to our past-due bills at the United \nNations, and he quickly said yes. I called Secretary of State Larry \nEagleburger and gave him the background, asking him to call the \nSecretary General immediately. I also asked the Secretary of State to \ndiscuss the matter with the President, explaining that I would call the \nPresident directly, but he was in Connecticut that day for the funeral \nof his mother. The next day, President Bush asked the Secretary of \nState to fly to New York to discuss the matter with the Secretary \nGeneral. Then, President Bush--to his great credit--moved quickly and, \nthat Thursday, announced that the United States would lead U.N. efforts \nin Somalia. In a few days, troops, food, and medical supplies were in \nSomalia.\n  How many lives could have been saved if the United Nations had been \nable to respond more quickly? Thousands. But no one will ever know the \nprecise number.\n  Another example: When serious trouble between the Hutus and Tutsis \nstarted in Rwanda, Senator James Jeffords and I got on the phone to the \nCanadian Gen. Romeo Dallaire in charge of a small contingent of U.N. \ntroops in the capital city of Kigali. One of the amazing things about \nour technological age is that you can call from Washington, DC, to a \nravaged city in Africa and reach someone by phone. That was on May 12,\n 1993. He told us that if he received 5,000 to 8,000 troops \nimmediately, he could stop the bloodshed in Rwanda. Senator Jeffords \nand I immediately dispatched a message to the White House, and to other \nofficials, urging quick action. On October 5, 1993--almost 5 months \nlater--the U.N. Security Council authorized action. With unbelievable \nbrutality exploding in Rwanda, nothing happened to stop it for a \nseemingly endless period of time. To their credit, the French sent \n2,000 troops, and later, the United States and other nations sent \nsmaller numbers to protect camps and airports on the periphery of \nRwanda, primarily in Zaire.\n\n  How many lives could have been saved if the United Nations had been \nable to respond more quickly? Thousands. But no one will ever know the \nprecise number.\n  Lesson No. 1 to be learned: The United States and other nations must \nequip the United Nations to respond quickly to this type of emergency.\n  I introduced in the last Congress, and will reintroduce in this \nCongress, a proposal calling for 3,000 volunteers among U.S. service \npersonnel who would be paid slightly more than other U.S. troops, who \nwould be ready on 24-hour notice to go to any place in the world called \nfor by the Security Council and approved by the President of the United \nStates. We should call upon Germany, Great Britain, France, Japan, and \nother nations to do the same, and smaller nations to have a smaller \ncontingent of troops available on similar, quick notice. Senator \nJeffords will cosponsor the legislation.\n  Today, after the Security Council acts, the Secretary General gets on \nthe phone and begs nations for help. It is a time-consuming process \nwhen time \n[[Page S4987]] means lives. If the United Nations can move more \nquickly, we can prevent future disasters in places like Somalia, \nRwanda, and Bosnia.\n  There is a second lesson to be learned.\n  If the United States is to play a responsible role of leadership in \nthe community of nations, some risks must be taken, and when there are \nregrettable casualties within our Armed Forces, we must stay our \ncourse.\n  Those who enlist for service in the Chicago Police Department know \nthey will be performing a public service, but they also know they will \nbe taking a risk. If some drug smugglers or gang leaders in a \nneighborhood kill two policemen, the mayor of Chicago will not announce \nthat that area of the city will no longer have police protection \nbecause of the casualties.\n  Somalia illustrates our problem.\n  Mistakes were made, primarily by a U.S. military man put in charge of \npart of a U.N. mission for which he had little background. He looked \nfor military answers to problems rather than the diplomatic answers \nthat Ambassador Robert Oakley had adeptly been fashioning.\n  But when a U.S. serviceman's body was dragged through the streets by \nteenage thugs, when that man went to Somalia on a humanitarian mission, \nthe American people were appalled, and there were cries in Congress to \npull out all our troops immediately.\n  At that point, we had a new President inexperienced in international \nrelations facing a volatile Congress. Some calming words of explanation \nto the American people would have been appropriate, explaining that if \nlocal terrorists can cause a few American casualties, and we flee the \nscene, the example will not go unnoticed by others around the world \nwherever American troops are stationed.\n  The reality is that fewer American service personnel were killed in \nSomalia than cabdrivers were killed in New York City that year. That \ndoes not make any of the deaths less tragic. But those who enter the \nArmed Forces must understand that, like the Chicago Police enlistees, \nthey are taking additional risks. And the American people must \nunderstand this.\n  We are in the budget season, discussing whether or not to appropriate\n   money for certain fancy weapons systems. What other nations question \nis not the technical proficiency of our weapons but our backbone. And \nthe question is being asked, not about those who serve in the Armed \nForces, but about the administration, Congress and the American people. \nOthers look at the weakness of both the Bush and Clinton \nadministrations in Bosnia and they wonder. A few terrorists frighten us \nout of Somalia, and they wonder about our professed resolve elsewhere.\n\n  When several Members of Congress issued calls to get us out of \nSomalia, the administration first called a meeting of all Members of \nboth Houses at which Secretary of State Warren Christopher and \nSecretary of Defense Les Aspin spoke. The meeting was a disaster. Such \na large meeting on a volatile subject should never be called; the \nnoisemakers take over.\n  Then the White House called a smaller meeting with about 20 of us \nfrom Congress with all the key administration people present, including \nthe President. The lengthy meeting, held on October 7, 1993, resulted \nin a compromise that all U.S. troops would be pulled out by March 31. I \nwas not happy with this, but I agreed to the compromise because it was \nconsiderably better than an immediate pull-out.\n  A few days after the White House meeting, President Mubarak of Egypt \nvisited the United States, and I went to Blair House to pay a courtesy \ncall on him. Just before I got there, an administration official asked \nme to urge President Mubarak to keep his Egyptian troops in Somalia \nafter March 31. Without quoting President Mubarak directly, it is not \nviolating any confidence to say that the request to have his nation, \nwith its meager resources, stay in Somalia while the wealthy and \npowerful United States of America wanted to quietly back out, did not \nimpress him.\n  We must be careful in using our human and military resources, but \nwhen we make the decision to use them--preferably in concert with other \nnations--we should use those resources with firmness and a reliability \nthat other nations, friendly or unfriendly, sense.\n  Since U.N. efforts at peacekeeping are in our security interest, \nwould it be asking too much for us to suggest that 1 percent of the \ndefense budget be set aside for support of peace keeping? Far from \nharming our security needs, that would strengthen the ability of the \nUnited Nations to respond quickly to emergencies, and that 1 percent \nwould not harm any defense needs that we have.\n  It is easy for officeholders of either party to appeal to the fears \nand hatreds of people, to appeal to the worst in us, to ask us to turn \ninward rather than reach out.\n  But if we are serious in our talk about family values, we should urge \nour citizens to reach beyond the artificial barriers that separate \npeople; to be concerned about one another, then, all families will be \nmore secure. Appeals to shortsighted selfishness do not help a family, \nand a political call for shortsighted selfishness does no favor to the \nnation. As leaders, we must appeal to the noble in our people, not the \nworst, and if we apply that to international relations, the United \nStates will benefit, as will the rest of the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to call attention to a statement \nmade by President Clinton's chief spokesperson Michael McCurry, as \nreported in the March 22 Washington Times.\n  In discussing the Republican Presidential field and candidate Pat \nBuchanan in particular, Mr. McCurry said: ``Mr. Buchanan and his \nmutaween will be out there parading across America, and we can track \nthem down.''\n  Mr. McCurry's reference is to Saudi religious officers, to whom I \ngather he is equating American conservatives who are both religious and \ninterested in playing a role in politics.\n  With this statement, Mr. McCurry has managed no mean feat: he has \nslurred religious Americans, he has slurred individuals of Arab \ndescent, and he has misused his position as White House spokesman.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is wrong to attack those who are \nreligious and involved in politics as zealots and extremists. These \nattacks are unfair, divisive and destructive. They challenge the right \nto engage in important moral arguments in public life, to everyone's \ndetriment.\n  People of strong faith always have been involved in politics and \ntheir faith has influenced their political action--to America's \nbenefit.\n  Even before our Nation was founded, people of faith brought Americans \ntogether through their eloquent advocacy of religious, moral and \npolitical principles. During the Revolutionary War ministers used \npolitical sermons to expound and elaborate on Thomas Jefferson's famous \nwords in the Declaration of Independence--that all men are created \nequal and ``endowed by their creator'' with rights to life, liberty and \nthe pursuit of happiness. They told Americans that it was their \nreligious as well as political duty to protect their rights and the \nrights of their children and grandchildren by fighting for \nindependence.\n  These brave ministers established an American political and religious \ntradition that continued to thrive, through the Civil War and on into \nthis century. \n[[Page S4988]] Martin Luther King, Jr., drew on this tradition. He was, \nof course, the Reverend Martin Luther King--a religious minister. His \ncrusade for racial justice and equality of opportunity drew explicitly \non references to God and God's will.\n  Reverend King called for racial equality, not because some mere \nphilosophical, academic principle demanded it, but because God demands \nthat we treat one another with respect, according to the content of our \ncharacter and not the color of our skin. In this way he showed \nAmericans their duty toward one another, and brought us together in \npursuit of a just equality of opportunity.\n  Today, however, conservative people of faith are attacked as \nintolerant extremists for having the temerity to make demands on our \nconscience. Mr. McCurry's statement is only the latest in such regard. \nPeaceful pro-life protesters are condemned as religious bigots for \nopposing what they feel is a great moral crime. The Christian Coalition \nand other similar groups are often depicted as a dark force whose \nparticipation in the political process is somehow inappropriate.\n  Mr. President, we must reject this kind of antireligious bigotry in \nwhatever form it takes. After all, should Martin Luther King have been \ndismissed as an intolerant religious fanatic?\n  I certainly hope not, for that would have denied our country his \nmoral force, which contributed mightily to the civil rights movement's \nsuccess. Yet Mr. McCurry's apparent disdain for the involvement of \npeople of faith in the political process would surely have kept \nReverend King out of politics, unless, of course, such intolerance only \napplies to conservative people of faith.\n  I also am concerned about Mr. McCurry's comments because, frankly, I \nbelieve that it perpetuates in American public life the stereotype that \nanyone connected to the Arab world must be an extremist.\n  As an American of Lebanese descent, I take great exception to Mr. \nMcCurry's use of his White House podium in this fashion. I believe it \nis inappropriate to employ ethnic-based references or comparisons as a \nmeans of insulting or demeaning others.\n  Arab-Americans have worked hard to assimilate and succeed in America. \nAccording to the 1990 census, 82 percent of Arab-Americans graduated \nfrom high school, while more than half, 52 percent had at least a \ncollege degree and a full 15 percent held some form of graduate degree. \nFurthermore 36.4 percent, more than one-third, of Arab-Americans are \nrepresented in managerial positions or the professions.\n  However, it is difficult for any ethnic group to enjoy full \nacceptance and assimilation if they remain targets of scorn or if \npeople of their heritage are employed as negative symbols. Whenever \nsomeone is insulted for being ``stupid'' or ``lazy'' or ``fanatical''--\n``just like'' people of a certain ethnic group--we reinforce the notion \nthat all the members of the ethnic group so referenced are a people who \nare stupid or lazy or fanatic. The result is ethnic division, bad \nfeelings and unfounded prejudice.\n  That is what Mr. McCurry's statement does. Moreover, invoking as it \ndoes the prestige of the White House inevitably will heighten anti-Arab \nfeelings in this country and place an unfair burden on people who are \nhard-working, loyal, tax paying citizens.\n  Finally, I am concerned about Mr. McCurry's statement because it \nseems clear to me that a Presidential Press Secretary, whose salary is \npaid for by the taxpayers, should not engage in such blatantly partisan \nactivity.\n  I am not here supporting Pat Buchanan's run for the Presidency. But \nin my view Mr. McCurry stepped over an important line when he attacked \nMr. Buchanan in the way he did. The American people are not paying Mr. \nMcCurry so that he can make insensitive stereotyping statements \nintended, among other things, to help his boss' chances in the next \nelection.\n  The President has many avenues available to him if he wishes to make \ncampaign statements. He also has the option of going through the steps \nnecessary to make an open bid for reelection. Within this context it \nwould be understandable that his campaign spokesman would make partisan \nstatements.\n  But to have a public employee making such blatantly political \nattacks, capitalizing on the media access and prestige of the \nPresidency for purely political ends, is simply unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/31/senate-section/article/S4987-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4988-S4989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          SOUTH DAKOTA GRANITE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once \ncalled Mount Rushmore ``the shrine of American democracy.''\n  Because of his love of that shrine, it is especially fitting that, as \nwe approach the 50th anniversary of FDR's death on April 12, the new \nmemorial that is being built now in our Nation's Capital to honor \nPresident Roosevelt will be carved, like Mount Rushmore, out of South \nDakota stone.\n  There is another reason that South Dakota rock is being used for the \nmemorial. It is, as geologists will tell you, quite simply one of the \nmost beautiful granites in the world.\n  It is called carnelian granite, named for the warm, mahagony color of \nthe rock. It has been quarried in Milbank, in the northeast corner of \nSouth Dakota, since 1908.\n  Because of its rich color and brilliant shine, Milbank granite has \nbeen used for public monuments in nearly every State and Canada. In \nPierre, the capital of South Dakota, it was used in 1912 to build our \nstatehouse. In Washington, it was used to build the National Catholic \nShrine and the poignant memorial to the women who fought in the war in \nVietnam.\n  The Roosevelt Monument, which will be completed in spring 1997, will \nuse 135,000 square feet of Milbank granite. That is about as much \ngranite as you would need to construct an 80-story building.\n  The memorial will depict 12 pivotal years in America's history \nthrough a series of four rooms, each devoted to one of FDR's four terms \nin office. The granite from my home State will form the walls of those \nrooms, into which will be carved President Roosevelt's own inspiring \nwords. Among the bronze sculptures to inhabit the rooms will be a \nstatue of Eleanor Roosevelt, a champion of women's rights, who had a \nprofound effect on FDR and on this Nation.\n  Like Theodore Roosevelt before him, Franklin Roosevelt was always a \nlittle awe-struck by the stark beauty of the American West, and \nparticularly South Dakota. In 1944, he suggested that the United \nNations be located in the Black Hills of South Dakota so that world \nleaders might ponder the profound solitude and the magnificence of the \nEarth as they faced tough issues.\n  South Dakota is a land of awe-inspiring geological resources: the \nBlack Hills, the Badlands, vast caves and glacial deposits, and of \ncourse, the 2\\1/2\\ billion-year-old Milbank granite.\n  Among the oldest rocks in the world, the South Dakota granite will \nproduce a tribute of geological, almost infinite, duration to an \nextraordinary President who led this Nation through the depths of the \nDepression and the horrors of the Second World War to a far better \nplace.\n  In 1936 when FDR came to Mount Rushmore to preside at the dedication \nof Jefferson's likeness, he said ``we can mediate and wonder what our \ndescendants will think about us 10,000 years from now when they see \nthis mountain.''\n  We in South Dakota are proud that future generations will gaze upon \nthe rock of South Dakota when they reflect on the lasting contributions \nto American society of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n  It is especially appropriate that we honor President Roosevelt now.\n  There are people in Washington who truly hope and aspire to the great \nthings that President Roosevelt had wanted and to which he dedicated \nhis life. But the fundamental ideals in which President Roosevelt \nbelieved--fairness, genuine opportunity for all Americans--go beyond \nDemocratic and \n[[Page S4989]] Republican politics.

Mr. President, relating to the debate that we began this \nmorning, let me say that I hope we can renew our debate about \npriorities as we approach the last week of this particular session \nbefore the Easter recess.\n  It was a debate about priorities and a debate about the need for \ndeficit reduction and a debate about how we get there.\n  An amendment that I offered today achieves exactly the same level of \ndeficit reduction as the level proposed in the committee-reported \nrescissions bill, but it does so without damaging our children's \neducational and health care needs.\n  What the amendment was designed to do, without adding one penny to \nthe deficit, in a way that was completely paid for, was to create a \nbetter balance between the requirements laid out in the original \nrescissions package and the objectives that we all have with regard to \ndistributing the burden of deficit reduction fairly. On the list of \npriorities we say we all share, education is high. But certainly that \nwas not reflected to the degree that it should be if, indeed, our \npriorities are as we say they are.\n  We all had hoped we could have a good debate this afternoon with \nregard to those priorities, with regard to our Nation's values, the \nvalues of families, but we were not given that opportunity, and for \nthat I am very deeply disappointed.\n  The majority leader, as is his right, offered a second-degree \namendment that really does not address this issue of education and the \nneeds of working families. Obviously, there are many ways in which to \ncontinue to work at meaningful deficit reduction, but that really was \nnot the sole purpose of the amendment on our side.\n  What we were attempting to say is that you can have good and \nconstructive debate about how we ought to reduce the deficit, and that \npart of that debate ought to be about the values and the tremendous \npriorities that we have invested in in the past, with regard to \neducation and children.\n  We wanted to call upon the Senate to reconsider how we treat working \nfamilies with children. The response, unfortunately, that we received \nwas a proposal to gut our amendment and have the bill pulled entirely.\n  I do not know what the other side may be afraid of here, but it seems \nto me that support for our amendment is very loud and very clear. The \nsupport, again announced on the west side of the Capitol this morning \nin very clear terms, was that we ought to recognize that we have \npriorities that stand not as mutually exclusive but clearly in tandem--\nmeaningful deficit reduction at the same time we have meaningful \ninvestments in the priorities that this country ought to insist upon.\n  Since we stood up for working families of 1 million children, \ntelephones have been ringing off the hook in the Senate offices across \nthe Capitol. Our amendment is building support because it addresses the \nneed to reduce the deficit at the same time it restores funds that are \nneeded for working families.\n  If this amendment is not adopted, America's children will pay the \nprice in terms of their education, their housing, their health care, \nand their child care. We need to invest in our future, and our \namendment says going after children's programs first is wrong.\n  We also need to ensure that we properly fund the Federal Emergency \nManagement Administration so that we meet emergency needs caused by \nrecent natural disasters. Our amendment does that. It is also \ncompletely paid for. It restores the $1.3 billion simply by taking what \nis viewed as excessive funding for FEMA in the years beyond 1996 and \ndedicating that money, as it should be dedicated, to the investment in \nchildren.\n  The total rescission under this substitute is identical to the level \nin the pending Senate bill--$15.1 billion, including the money \nallocated to the Shelby amendment.\n  The substitute provides FEMA with exactly the same level of funding \nas the House bill--$5.36 billion.\n  If our colleagues dispute the level of funding in our amendment, they \nare also disputing the Republican leadership in the other body, because \nthe figure is identical on both sides of the Capitol.\n  One million children should not be left out or ignored as we continue \nthe duel on priorities that we have here--priorities that recognize \ntheir interests, future needs, and their interest in inheriting a \ncountry that is not as deficit-laden as it is today.\n  So we can do both. I hope that as we work through this rescissions \nbill, and certainly through the budget priorities we will be debating \nas we consider a budget resolution later on, we can recognize the need \nto do both in a meaningful and bipartisan way. That is what this \namendment attempts to do. That is what I hope the Senate will do. That \nis what I hope we have the opportunity to do next week.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/31/senate-section/article/S4989-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe 1993 Federal income tax rate increases on trusts established for \nthe benefit of individuals with disabilities or for college education \ncosts of a beneficiary; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n     the persons with disabilities trusts tax rate restoration act\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, things aren't always as they \nseem--especially in the world of tax legislation. Included in the same \nsection that raised the tax rates for higher income individuals were \nprovisions increasing the tax rate for trusts with meager incomes as \nlow as $1,500.\n  President Clinton campaigned that he wouldn't raise taxes on anyone \nearning less than $200,000, yet in the law the President signed in \n1993, tax bracket increases begin for trusts that have income of \n$1,500.\n  This isn't really a tax on trusts. It is a tax on people who are \nmentally ill and people with disabilities. It is also a tax on \neducation.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would repeal that tax \nincrease.\n  Trusts, at first blush, are faceless entities associated with the \nidle rich. But the vast majority of trusts are long- \n[[Page S4994]] term financial planning tools for people with simple \ngoals and very special needs.\n  Trusts are set up to save for college or to provide a living \nallowance for people with disabilities or mental illness. It is a way \nthat parents can plan for the time when they have passed on. These are \n``worthy purpose'' trusts that are taking a heavy tax hit under the \n1993 law.\n  Increasing the tax rates on these faceless entities called trusts \nsounds appealing until we stop to realize that the money comes out of \nthe living allowances of individuals with disabilities, or mental \nillnesses.\n  I have experienced personally the agony a family faces as they try to \nadequately plan and provide for the future comfort and financial \nmanagement of the affairs of a person with a disability or mental \nillness. Parents of children with special needs feel an indescribable \nvulnerability and responsibility as they contemplate, ``How can we best \nprovide for our child who has a disability or mental illness when we \nare gone?'' ``How can we insure that he/she will have an adequate \nliving allowance?'' It is an inescapable worry that shouldn't be \ncompounded by misguided and ever changing tax policy.\n  The problems are complex. It isn't just having enough money. Money\n   isn't the issue. Taxes aren't the issue. It is a management and \ncaring dilemma. Some loved ones who are mentally ill are not suited to \nhave immediate access to the financial resources that their parents \nsaved for their economic security. A trust is a mechanism to provide \nthe financial resources that parents would provide if they were still \nalive.\n\n  These trusts are not set up because wealthy people are trying to \navoid taxes. Most of the tax avoidance schemes were written out of the \nTax Code in 1986 anyway. The type of trust I am talking about is set up \nto provide for a loved one. Our tax policy should encourage family \nresponsibility. Only the family can be counted on to provide financial \nsupport.\n  This is a terrible deed that we did to raise the rates on these \ntrusts. Some of these trusts were set up decades ago to provide an \nadequate living allowance. They are irrevocable trusts. Once they are \nset up they cannot be changed.\n  These trusts are vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and other \neconomic variables. It is wrong to also subject them to an ever \nincreasing tax burden.\n  Parents and grandparents like to set up education trusts for their \nchildren and grandchildren. It teaches children to save. But under the \ncurrent law, trust income is taxed much more steeply than in the past. \nIn fact, these tax provisions really clobber these trusts, too.\n  Under the old law, taxable trusts for college or for the care and \nmaintenance of a person who is disabled or suffers from a mental \nillness paid a top rate of 31 percent on taxable income of more than \n$11,250. That was quite steep.\n  But under current law, it became much, much worse. They pay 39.6 \npercent on income of more than $7,500.\n  This means that a very small trust under prior law with income of \n$2,750 would have paid $562 in Federal income taxes. Under the current \nlaw, the trust pays $862--a 53-percent increase.\n  The bill I am introducing today would repeal that 53-percent rate \nincrease.\n  Under the new tax law, trusts would pay 31 percent on income between \n$3,500 and $5,500; 36 percent on income over $5,500 and 10 percent \nsurcharge on income over $7,500 leading to a marginal rate of 39.6 \npercent.\n  For a country with a miserable savings rate, this is the wrong tax \npolicy and the wrong message to our children about responsibility, \nsavings and investment.\n  I would like to think the rate increase for these trusts was an \nunintended consequence of the tax law. Regardless, it is one provision \nthat should be repealed.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this bill. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 657\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand the boundary of the Santa Fe National \nForest, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n          The Santa Fe National Forest Boundary Adjustment Act\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation on behalf of myself and Senator Domenici to authorize the \nForest Service to acquire land and easements adjacent to the Santa Fe \nNational Forest in New Mexico. The purpose of this legislation is to \npreserve the Atalaya Mountain area, east of the city of Santa Fe, NM. \nThe tracts of land in question comprise a portion of the eastern scenic \nbackdrop of Santa Fe which provide the physical and visual edge of the \ncity. They are logical additions to the Santa Fe Forest.\n  The expanded boundary will adjoin existing city-owned lands, and will \nconnect with and contribute to the city's open space plan. This \nboundary adjustment will provide a more logical exterior boundary for \nthe Santa Fe National Forest, thereby also facilitating management and \nadministration of these Federal lands.\n  This property possesses outstanding scenic qualities that are \npresently enjoyed by the general public traveling in the vicinity. In \naddition, these lands are crossed by historic wood gathering trails, \nused by Santa Fe residents for over 300 years, and could provide \npermanently protected public access corridors.\n  Over the last several months, broad community concern has been \nexpressed over the prospect of development of the west face of Atalaya \nMountain. There is strong public support for preserving this property \nin an undeveloped state for public use and enjoyment. The purpose of \nthis legislation is to protect Atalaya Mountain through acquisition of \nland and conservation easements by the Forest Service, thus returning \nthe land to the public as open space. This \n[[Page S4995]] legislation specifically prohibits the Forest Service \nfrom selling this land and endangering it to development in the future. \nIt is our intent that this legislation spur Forest Service acquisition \nand provide the extra protection that the mountain so richly deserves.\n  This effort represents a high level of cooperation and compromise \namong several parties--the current owners of the land in question, \nSanta Feans concerned about the preservation of open space, and local \nand Federal governments. I am pleased to support this effort through \nintroduction of this legislation, which will ensure that Atalaya \nMountain, one of Santa Fe's natural treasures, will be protected. Let \nme take this opportunity to thank my colleague, Senator Domenici, for \nhis cosponsorship of this legislation. Congressman Richardson has \nintroduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives. It is \nmy hope that we will be able to move swiftly to pass this legislation, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I ask that the full text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 658\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and \nTrade Act of 1990 to replace the prohibition on higher State make-\nallowances for the processing of milk with a requirement that the \nsupport purchase price for milk be reduced if a person collects a State \nmake-allowance that is higher than the Federal make-allowance and the \nmilk is purchased by the Commodity Credit Corporation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n           elimination of double subsidy to dairy processors\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the legislation \nthat will restore some fairness to the Dairy Price Support Program. \nPrevious legislative and administrative attempts to correct the problem \nin the system have been unsuccessful. It is time to try a new approach.\n  Under the Dairy Price Support Program, USDA set Commodity Credit \nCorporation purchase prices for manufactured daily products in order to \nindirectly support the price of milk. Rather than requiring the \nprocessors to pay dairy producers the support price, the Dairy Price \nSupport Program sets the support price for the individual manufactured \nproducts at levels sufficient to achieve plant returns that in turn, \nallow processors to pay farmers the specified support price. This \nrequires a determination by USDA as to the appropriate plant margin. \nThis margin is more commonly known as a ``make allowance. ''\n  Despite changes in the 1990 farm bill, some States in this country, \nare still able to set prices for milk used to make cheese, butter, and \nnonfat dry milk such that processing plants are guaranteed a higher \nprofit margin--or make allowance--for their products than allowed under \nthe dairy price support system. That allowance provides companies in \nthose States with an artificial competitive advantage. At the same \ntime, processors in those States sell significant amounts of surplus \ndairy products to the Federal Government.\n  The bill I am introducing today sends a clear message to those \nStates--it says ``You can't have it both ways.''\n  While the specifics of this issue are complex, the fundamentals are \nclear and understandable. If States create pricing structures to give \ntheir milk processors a leg up, they cannot do so at taxpayers expense.\n  That is exactly what is happening in the State of California today. \nBecause of the California State pricing system, cheese, butter, and dry \nmilk processors are provided such a high make allowance that they can \nsell their products competitively on the east coast even with the high \ncost of transportation. Meanwhile, other States must abide by the \nmanufacturing margin set by the Department of Agriculture.\n  Currently, the State of California provides their plants with a make \nallowance that is 57 cents per hundredweight higher than the national \nmake allowance for cheese, and nearly 60 cents per hundredweight higher \nthan the national make allowance for the processing of butter and milk \npowder.\n  California processors pay their dairy farmers less for the milk they \nneed to make cheese, butter, and powder, and let farmers absorb the \nmarket risk, while taxpayers absorb the cost.\n  Meanwhile, processors elsewhere in the country who are playing by \nthe \n[[Page S4996]] rules, paying at least Minnesota-Wisconsin base price or \nan associated minimum price for milk used in dry milk production, are \nforced to compete with California's products in the grocery store's \ndairy\n case. If we don't change this inequity, processors and dairy farmers \noutside of California will continue to lose.\n\n  The growth in the California dairy processing industry in the last 10 \nyears has been dramatic--and it is due--at least in part--to the higher \nmake allowance. The higher profitability of the plants drives the need \nto operate plants at capacity and build even more plants creating a \ndemand for milk that spurs on the growth of milk production. The lack \nof risk for processors makes dairy manufacturing even more attractive \nto investors. As one might expect, Mr. President, the sales of surplus \ndairy product to the Federal Government from California have been \ndramatic as well.\n  Between 1990 and 1994 marketing years, one State--the State of \nCalifornia--sold 35 percent of all of the surplus butter purchased by \nthe Federal Government and 42 percent of all the nonfat dry milk \npurchased by the Government.\n  Not only does the higher make allowance provide California dairy \nproduct manufacturers with an artificial competitive advantage in the \nmarket place, it encourages milk production and increases surpluses, \ndriving down national milk prices to farmers.\n  Congress recognized the importance of this issue in the 1990 farm \nbill when we prohibited any State from having a higher make allowance \nthan the Federal make allowance. Five years later, the law has not been \nimplemented. The Secretary's attempt to implement the law has already \nbeen the subject of seven lawsuits. Complaints about the Department's \nproposed rule have at the same time charged the rule will have no \nimpact whatsoever or be wholly devastating on both the California \nprocessing industry and the national dairy industry. Well, Mr. \nPresident, I doubt that both could simultaneously be true, but it is \nhard to know which will be the final outcome.\n  It is time to restore some reason to this drawn out administrative \nprocess. My bill does that. It simplifies the law by removing the \noverall prohibition on States having higher make allowances. It \neliminates the existing statutory requirements for penalties and it \nremoves the burden from the producer to bring a complaint against his \nprocessor to USDA.\n  My bill simply requires the Commodity Credit Corporation to reduce \nthe price it pays to any plant or person selling surplus dairy products \nto the Government operating in a state with a pricing system that \nprovides a higher make allowance, by an amount that is equal to the \ndifference between the State and Federal make allowance. Regardless of \nthe point of sale of the dairy products, if they were produced by a \nplant in a state with a higher make allowance, the CCC purchase price \nmust be reduced.\n  This bill also explicitly includes cooperatives which have been \nexempted from the proposed USDA rules. Since dairy cooperatives market \nmost of the milk in California, it is essential that they be compelled \nto comply with the requirements of this bill.\n  This bill is based upon a proposal by the Lakeshore Federated Dairy \nCooperative in Wisconsin and their member-producers who are fed up with \nUSDA's inability to implement current law, the artificial competitive \ndisadvantages they face in the dairy case, and the bald-faced abuse of \nthe dairy price support system that has gone unfettered for the last 15 \nyears.\n  The appeal of this approach is obvious. It allows an individual State \nto have its own pricing structures, but forces them to play by the \nrules of the Federal dairy price support program if they wish to take \nadvantage of it. States should not be allowed to increase the cost of \nthe dairy price support program to taxpayers and depress national \nprices to other producers in the process, while providing their own \ndairy industry with an additional processing subsidy.\n  The legislation I am proposing not only makes more sense than the \ncurrent proposal, it also saves money. It has less of an impact on \nCalifornia producer prices and will not lead to significant increases \nin milk production. In fact, preliminary CBO estimates indicate that \nthis legislation, if enacted, would save upwards of $40 million over 5 \nyears.\n  I think this is a solid compromise to a long-standing problem that \nwill persist if Congress fails to act. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Lakeshore Federated \nDairy Cooperative be included in the Record, and that the text of the \nbill also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 659\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MILK MANUFACTURING MARKETING ADJUSTMENT.\n\n       Subsections (a) and (b) of section 102 of the Food, \n     Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. \n     1446e-1) are amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       ``(1) Federal make allowance.--The term `Federal make \n     allowance' means the allowance for the processing of milk \n     that is permitted under a Federal program to establish a \n     Grade A price for manufacturing butter, nonfat dry milk, or \n     cheese.\n       ``(2) Person.--The term `person' includes a cooperative.\n       ``(3) State make allowance.--The term `State make \n     allowance' means the allowance for the processing of milk \n     that is permitted by a State for manufacturing butter, nonfat \n     dry milk, or cheese.\n       ``(b) Milk Manufacturing Marketing Adjustment.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a person \n     collects a State make allowance that is higher than the \n     Federal make allowance and the milk or product of milk that \n     is subject to the allowance is purchased by the Commodity \n     Credit Corporation, regardless of the point of sale, the \n     Corporation shall reduce the support purchase price for the \n     milk and each product of the milk by an amount that is equal \n     to the difference between the State make allowance and the \n     Federal make allowance for the milk and product, as \n     determined by the Secretary of Agriculture.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Lakeshore Federated\n\n\n                                            Dairy Cooperative,\n\n                                     Rockford, IL, March 31, 1995.\n     Hon. Russ Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: Lakeshore Federated Dairy \n     Cooperative supports your adjustments to ``Milk Manufacturing \n     Marketing Adjustment'' in your proposed legislation.\n       The major impact of implementing the ``Milk Manufacturing \n     Marketing Adjustment'' would be on cheese sales to the \n     Commodity Credit Cooperation. The current California make \n     allowance for cheese per hundredweight is $1.94. This \n     compares to the $1.37 per hundredweight used by the CCC in \n     calculating the block cheddar cheese purchase price. This \n     section will eliminate a $0.57 make allowance advantage \n     California has over cheese manufacturing plants in 42 other \n     states.\n       California's Class 4b make allowance has resulted in the \n     cost of milk to California cheesemakers to fall below the M-W \n     price, which represents the minimum cost of milk to \n     cheesemakers regulated under federal orders in 42 states. \n     This allows California cheese plants to produce cheese at a \n     lower raw milk cost than plants in most other states, because \n     of a government loop-hole.\n       California has had this windfall for the past 10 years and \n     is using politics and the court system to delay any new \n     regulations.\n       The dairy industry in California had an opportunity to take \n     care of the California make allowance provision that had come \n     to the attention of the U.S. Congress and USDA in February \n     1992. California chose to ignore the U.S. Congress and \n     Section 102 of the 1990 Farm Bill. They chose to add 70 cents \n     per cwt. on milk used in Class I and Class II as a surcharge, \n     through an emergency price relief bill passed in 1991.\n       This price relief bill allowed the California department of \n     Food and Agriculture to increase the cost of milk utilized in \n     Class I and Class II and the fluid milk consumers subsidized \n     the California milk producer and continued to allow a high \n     make allowance to the milk manufacturing industry. This \n     emergency price relief bill was just another California State \n     milk pricing scheme to allow the California milk \n     manufacturing industry to continue to use high state ``make \n     allowance.''\n       Congress recognized this make allowance issue in the 1990 \n     Farm Bill and instructed USDA to correct the problem. USDA \n     failed to honor the request, as they have done prior to the \n     1990 Farm Bill. Our cooperative filed briefs with Secretary \n     of Agriculture, Mike Espy, in 1994 on the make allowance \n     issue and as of today, nothing has been done.\n       The California Department of Food and Agriculture has \n     denied a petition to hold hearings on whether the state's \n     Class 4-A and 4-B milk pricing formulas\n      should be replaced with the Minnesota-Wisconsin price within \n     the past month. There is no doubt \n     [[Page S4997]] that the California dairy industry has no \n     respect for the U.S. Congress or USDA's internal politics. \n     They had a chance to correct the make allowance inequity this \n     past month and thumbed their nose at the rest of the United \n     States.\n       Lakeshore Federated Dairy Cooperative is made up of three \n     Capper-Volstead Cooperatives: Manitowoc Milk Producers \n     Cooperative, Milwaukee Cooperative Milk Producers, \n     Brookfield, WI, and Mid-West Dairymens Co., Rockford, IL. The \n     combined membership of the three cooperatives includes 6,200 \n     farm families located in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, \n     Minnesota and Iowa.\n       The cost to administrate this new section in the 1995 Farm \n     Bill is zero. The CCC will make a calculation once for the \n     States with milk pricing schemes and use the same reduction \n     on the price per pound of products purchased by the CCC. This \n     price per pound reduction will also reduce spending by USDA.\n       Members of our cooperatives feel there is little downside \n     to your proposed legislation. There have been scenarios as to \n     the shift of milk from cheese to NFDM production or the shift \n     of milk from NFDM production to cheese production. These are \n     unpublished studies with questionable assumptions and \n     conclusions.\n       We would like to thank you and your staff for supporting \n     this make allowance issue.

administrative action in or for any land management plan, \n     standard, guideline, policy, regional guide or multi-forest \n     plan because of implementation or impacts, site-specific or \n

Mr. President, today is a day of independence. \nToday, the Social Security Administration becomes an independent agency \nof the U.S. Government. This is an event of historic importance for \nSocial Security and for the Nation.\n  We have increased the stature of the Social Security Administration, \nstrengthened its leadership, and established a bipartisan advisory \nboard. I am proud to have sponsored the legislation, the Social \nSecurity Administration Reform Act of 1994, that brought about these \nchanges, for they were sorely needed. Public confidence in the Social \nSecurity system has declined to the point where a recent survey of 18- \nto 34-year-olds revealed that 46 percent of respondents believed in \nUFO's, while only 28 percent believed their Social Security will be \nthere when they retire.\n  Mr. President, there is no greater authority on Social Security in \nthe Nation's Capital, or indeed anywhere in the United States, than my \ndistinguished friend Robert J. Myers. Bob Myers came to Washington in \n1934 and was quite literally present at the creation of Social \nSecurity. He served as Chief Actuary of the Social Security \nAdministration from 1947 to 1970, and as Deputy Commissioner from 1981 \nto 1982, after which he became Executive Director of the National \nCommission on Social Security Reform. Bob Myers is a familiar figure to \nmembers of the Committee on Finance, where he is a frequent witness on \nSocial Security matters, and he is well known to many other Members of \nthe Senate and House of Representatives. When it comes to Social \nSecurity, he is an institution unto himself. And so when an expert of \nBob Myers' vast knowledge and experience speaks out on this subject, we \nhad all better listen closely.\n  I invoke Robert Myers on this day--Social Security independence day--\nbecause he has just written an outstanding commentary in response to a \nrecent Time magazine article entitled ``The Case for Killing Social \nSecurity.'' The cover of the March 20 issue of Time depicts a Social \nSecurity card torn into pieces. The lengthy Time article argues that in \nthe next two decades, Social Security will ``be lurching into its final \ncrisis.''\n  Well, Mr. President, the ``case for killing Social Security'' is weak \nindeed, and Bob Myers has demonstrated this as only he can. His paper \nmakes clear that, far from being close to demise, the Social Security \nsystem will remain solvent with only minor adjustments. Yes, \nreasonable, measured changes will need to be made in order to assure \nsolvency over the long term. But Congress and various administrations \nhave never shirked from this bipartisan responsibility in the past, and \nwe will not do so in the future. Social Security is not at risk, and we \nneed to say so--as Bob Myers has done with great clarity.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the commentary by Robert J. \nMyers be printed in the Record.\n  The commentary follows:\n   Commentary on Time Magazine's Cover Story on the Social Security \n                                Program\n\n                          (By Robert J. Myers)\n\n       The cover of Time, the Weekly Newsmagazine, for March 20 \n     was captioned ``The Case for Killing Social Security.'' The \n     contents featured a nine-page article going into detail as to \n     why the program should be drastically changed, even \n     eliminated, by moving to an entirely different system based \n     on individual savings accounts. Unfortunately, the article \n     involves many half truths, errors, and omissions of pertinent \n     facts and is not well balanced.\n       The general thrust of this article is well shown by its \n     introductory sentence--``You know a government program is in \n     trouble when it's less credible than a flying saucer.'' The \n     basis of this remark is from the results of an opinion survey \n     of persons aged 18-34 made by the Third Millennium. This \n     showed that 46% of the respondents believed that UFO's exist, \n     while only 28% thought that Social Security will still exist \n     by the time that they retire.\n       A very knowledgeable senator has made the comment about \n     this so-called analysis of the financial sovlevency of the \n     Social Security program that those who believe in the \n     existence of UFO's are ``dopey''. Accordingly, their views on \n     such a complex matter as the long-range viability of the \n     Social Security program cannot be taken too seriously. Or \n     their views as to UFO's may be considered as an attempt to be \n     funny--under the theory ``ask a silly question, expect a \n     silly answer.''\n       The article then states that, in about 20 years, Social \n     Security ``will be lurching into its final crisis'' and will \n     ``collapse altogether''. It immediately contradicts this \n     ``certainty'' by saying that this can be avoided by benefit \n     reductions or tax increases, although asserting that these \n     would have to be ``stunning'' and ``huge''. The article fails \n     to recognize that the program is not--and has not, in the \n     past, been--unchangeable. Further, such changes (which, \n     admittedly, are very likely needed) do not involve great \n     [[Page S5019]] shifts at one time, but rather deferred and \n     gradual small ones. The Social Security program is not--and \n     was never intended to be--one that is of an unchangeable, \n     contractual nature. Rather, it can be--and has been--adjusted \n     from time to time to reflect changing demographic, economic, \n     and social conditions.\n       Next, the article asserts that, beginning now, some \n     retirees are getting a ``bad deal'', because the value of \n     their benefits (taking into account interest) will be less \n     than ``the sum of their lifetime contributions, plus \n     interest.'' And, further, it is stated that this deplorable \n     situation will get much worse as time goes by.\n       Unfairly, it is not pointed out that by ``contributions'' \n     is meant both the employer and employee contributions. \n     Economists will generally say that employees really pay the \n     employer contribution, because it is part of total \n     remuneration. I assert that, while this may be true in the \n     aggregate, it is not necessarily the case on an individual-\n     by-individual basis. Many private employee benefit plans \n     (such as defined-benefit pension plans and health benefits \n     plans) do not give each employee benefit protection financed \n     by the employer that has a cost as a percentage of salary \n     which is the same for all employees. For example, health \n     benefits plans have a higher value relative to salary for low \n     earners than for high earners, because for persons of a given \n     age and family composition, the value of the benefits in the \n     dollars is the same.\n       Even more importantly, Social Security is not--and never \n     was intended to be--a system involving complete individual \n     equity, under which each participant would get exactly his or \n     her money's-worth in benefit protection, no more and no less. \n     Rather, it is intended to contain elements of both social \n     adequacy and individual equity.\n       Under the social adequacy principle, relatively large \n     benefits in relation to contributions are paid to several \n     categories: participants who were beyond the normal entry age \n     into the labor market when they were first covered (a common \n     practice in private pension plans); lower-paid workers; and \n     workers with dependents. The individual-equity principle is \n     present in that, for a particular category of workers, the \n     larger the earnings on which contributions are paid, the \n     larger will be the benefit amount, even though not \n     proportionately so.\n       The money's-worth situation under Social Security is far \n     less extreme than is the situation for school taxes. Such \n     taxes are paid, directly or indirectly, without regard to \n     whether the payer has children currently, or has had \n     children, or will have children. Moreover, the amount of the \n     taxes bears no relationship to the possible ``benefit'' \n     protection.\n       Following this incomplete, even inaccurate, money's-worth \n     discussion, the article goes on to state that, ``almost \n     unanimously'', scholars and policy analysts believe that the \n     Social Security program is doomed and is\n      ``ripe for retirement'' now. This unsupported statement is \n     outrageous! Scores of scholars and policy analysts \n     (including those persons who have a good knowledge of the \n     structure and history of the Social Security program) do \n     not hold this view, and only a handful of persons who are \n     qualified by their knowledge and experience would support \n     it. I am confident that, if a survey on this matter were \n     made among actuaries (who are the ``social engineers'' in \n     the general pension area), no such ``dooms-day view'' \n     would be overwhelmingly held, or even supported by many.\n       These ``experts'' whom the article has found proclaim that \n     the present Social Security program should be replaced by a \n     two-tier system--a public-assistance needs-tested safety net \n     under a mandatory private savings plan involving complete \n     individual equity. Ignored in this proposal are several \n     important matters. One is the huge general-revenues cost of \n     the safety net, whose costs would have to be met indirectly \n     by the higher-paid persons, who would think only that they \n     are getting their money's-worth from the mandatory savings \n     plan. Further, there would be great disincentives for saving \n     by lower-income (and even middle-income) persons, because \n     they would get little more by doing so than they would by \n     utilizing the safety net only. And, still further, fraud and \n     abuse would abound as persons would be tempted to hide income \n     or transfer assets to their children and receive the income \n     back ``under the table.''\n       Moreover, the proposed ``simple solution'' fails to \n     recognize the problem of providing adequate disability and \n     survivor benefits for persons who have such an event occur at \n     the young or middle ages. In such cases, the mandatory \n     savings will not have built up to a high level and thus will \n     not ``purchase'' adequate benefits.\n       Next, the article proclaims that the Social Security trust \n     fund (another display of ignorance because there are two \n     trust funds--one for retirement and survivor benefits and the \n     other for disability benefits) is an ``empty cookie jar,'' \n     because ``the Treasury has already raided it for hundreds of \n     billions.'' This is patently false! The bonds and notes held \n     by the trust funds are just as valid as any government \n     securities held by banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, \n     you, and me. They pay an equitable rate of interest and are \n     part of the recorded National Debt. Certainly, the money that \n     went for them (the excess of income over outgo of the trust \n     funds) was spent. But the same thing is done by the Treasury \n     with the proceeds of any bonds which it sells to\n      the public--or, for that matter the same as a corporation \n     does when it sells its bonds, or a savings bank does with \n     your deposit (it ``spends'' the money by lending it to \n     somebody else).\n       The article then bemoans the problem, some 20-25 years \n     hence, when under present law, the bonds will begin to have \n     to be redeemed in mass. To do so, such action as raising \n     income taxes or floating new loans from the public will be \n     necessary. But this is no different than what has to be done \n     when government obligations held by the general public come \n     due. And it is most important to note that, if the trust \n     funds had not had the money to purchase the bonds in the \n     beginning, the general public would have had to have done so, \n     and there would still be the same problem of redeeming the \n     bonds at some time.\n       Further, if changes in the Social Security program are made \n     in the next few years--as I believe that they should be--this \n     situation of a dismantling of huge trust-fund balances would \n     not occur. In fact, if Senator Moynihan's proposal, made \n     about five years ago, to slightly lower contribution rates \n     now and slightly raise ones many years hence--thus returning \n     to pay-as-you-go financing--were adopted, this problem would \n     not occur. And further, the true magnitude of our horrendous \n     general-budget deficits would be apparent.\n       A minor error, and yet one that clearly displays the \n     ineptitude of the article, is the statement that maximum \n     Social Security payroll taxes ``have already multiplied 10 \n     times since 1950.'' Such tax in 1950 was $90 (3% of $3,000) \n     and is $7,588.80 in 1995 (12.4% of $61,200). The correct \n     ``multiplying factor'' is thus 84.3, not a mere 10!\n       The next cry of ``doom and gloom'' in the article is that, \n     some 35 years from now, if nothing is done in the meanwhile, \n     the trust funds will be exhausted, and the Social Security \n     tax rate will have to be increased to 17%. This is reasonably \n     correct (although I would have said 16% initially and 17% \n     some years later) under the conditions stated. However, such \n     conditions are most unreasonable! Congress, which almost \n     always acts reasonably and responsibly (although not always \n     promptly enough!), will undoubtedly act well in advance of \n     such a cataclysmic event. True, an increase of about 4% in \n     the combined employer-employee tax rate in a single year \n     might ``devastate the economy'', as the article claims.\n       But what should be done--and likely will be done--is to \n     transition in some benefit cost reductions (like an increase \n     in the Normal Retirement Age, so as to recognize increased \n     longevity) and some contribution\n      rate increases (like 1% each on employers and employees, in \n     steps over a period of years). This would have little, if \n     any, adverse effect on the economy.\n       Next, the writers of the article had the temerity to wander \n     into the actuarial field by quoting figures as to the \n     probability of a new-born baby reaching age 65 (better would \n     have been the higher probability for a person entering the \n     labor force at age 20) and the expectation of life at age 65, \n     for both 1940 and 1990. Not surprisingly, most of their \n     figures are in error, as shown below:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   Percent surviving    Expectation of  \n                                       to age 65        life at age 65  \n                                 --------------------       (years)     \n          Sex and year                               -------------------\n                                    Time     Correct    Time     Correct\n                                   figure     value    figure     value \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMale, 1940......................        54      55.8        13      12.1\nFemale, 1940....................        61      65.5        15      13.6\nMale, 1990......................        72      74.1        15      15.1\nFemale, 1990....................        84      85.1        20      18.9\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Out of eight figures, the article had only one which was \n     even nearly correct.\n       Then, the article re-writes history by asserting that, in \n     the early years of the Social Security program, Congress \n     could increase benefits easily every few years (and thus \n     garner votes), because there were few beneficiaries relative \n     to the number of contributors. Not so! Most of the benefit \n     increases were made to reflect changes in the cost of living, \n     and they were financed by the accompanying increases in the \n     level of wages that were taxes. At all times, Congress was \n     very conscientious about the cost implications of the \n     changes, not merely as to the next year or two, but also as \n     to the long range (75 years).\n       Further, the article asserts that the 1983 Amendments were \n     based on ``rather minor cutbacks in benefits and very major \n     increases in taxes, the last of which took effect only in \n     1990.'' In the first place, the 1983 Amendments did not \n     increase the tax rate in 1990 over what it was in previous \n     law. Further, reductions in benefits played a major role in \n     saving the program by the 1983 Amendments. If the income \n     taxation of benefits is considered as a ``benefit cut'' \n     (because, in effect, the money remained in the trust funds), \n     then 48% of the solution in the short range (10 years) was \n     due to tax increases and 52% to benefit cuts, while for the \n     solution over the long (75 years) only 23% was due to tax \n     increases, with 77% due to benefit cuts. On the other\n      hand, if the income taxation of benefits is considered as a \n     ``tax increase'' item, then 70% of the solution in the \n     short range was due to tax increases and 30% to benefit \n     cuts, while for the long range, 54% was due to tax \n     increases and 46% to benefit cuts. In any event, the \n     benefit cuts were by no means ``minor''.\n       The article next describes several ways to modify the \n     Social Security program without ``killing'' it. Just before \n     this, the article \n     [[Page S5020]] quite properly (and in contrast to the slogan \n     on Time's cover) points out the disastrous weakness of the \n     Heritage Foundation's proposal to let people opt out at will; \n     this would set up a vicious circle of actuarial anti-\n     selection, because the low-cost persons (young and high-paid) \n     would drop out, and the high-cost ones would remain in, with \n     resultant financial collapse.\n       The proposals for change include the following:\n       (1) Raise the Normal Retirement Age (which solution is my \n     choice).\n       (2) Raise the Early Retirement Age (which may be desirable, \n     but does not lower overall costs, because the reductions are \n     on an ``actuarial'' basis).\n       (3) Reduce Cost-of-Living Adjustments, presumably by giving \n     less than the CPI increase (which is undesirable, because it \n     most adversely affects the oldest beneficiaries, who are \n     least able to do anything about their situation--because of \n     the compounding effect).\n       (4) Means-test the benefits (which is a bad idea, because \n     it would discourage low- and middle-income persons from \n     saving, and it would encourage fraud and abuse by \n     beneficiaries).\n       Next, the article seems to look favorably at a proposal by \n     Senators Danforth and Kerrey to reduce the employee Social \n     Security tax rate (but not the employer rate) from 6.2% to \n     4.7% and then require that the 1.5% reduction be put into a \n     private investment fund, with future Social Security benefits \n     being ``reduced to reflect the drop in taxes.'' Certainly, \n     IRAs and so-called 401(k) plans are very desirable and should \n     be encouraged, but they should be kept separate and built on \n     top of a uniformly applicable Social Security program. The \n     actual mechanics of the foregoing proposal, however, are \n     faulty (and really cannot be perfected). It would work out \n     reasonably well administratively for high-paid workers, but \n     would be a disaster for low-paid, intermittently-employed \n     workers. The proceeds from a 1.5% contribution, coming in \n     dribbles over the year, would be ``eaten up'' by the \n     administrative expenses of handling, recording, and reporting \n     them. Mutual funds\n      generally require fairly sizable deposits--not anything like \n     the roughly $20 quarterly payments (varying each time) for \n     a $5,000 worker.\n       The article mentions that the estimated long-range \n     financial status of the Social Security program has worsened \n     over the years since the 1983 Amendments. However, it fails \n     to point out that the actual short-range experience has been \n     more favorable than estimated in 1983 (the current fund \n     balance being more than $100 billion higher than estimated).\n       In summary, it is really outrageous that, by incomplete and \n     erroneous reporting, the article casts so much doubt on the \n     long-range financial viability of the Social Security \n     program. This is despite the fact that, by very careful \n     reading of the end of the article, it could be concluded that \n     reasonable small, gradual changes could be made--without \n     changing the basic nature of the program--that would very \n     likely ensure its viability.\n       Finally, the article is supplemented by a note, ``How Chile \n     Got It Right.'' This describes the new Chilean social \n     security plan instituted in the early 1980s. It replaced a \n     traditional social insurance system that was some 60 years \n     old, but that was in great financial and administrative \n     difficulties due to inflation (which raised benefits greatly \n     and, at the same time, made the accumulated assets worthless) \n     and extensive coverage noncompliance.\n       The Chilean article is quite correct that the new plan \n     reasonably well solved the problem, although this was not the \n     only way in which that could have been accomplished. However, \n     this article, too, contained many errors and omissions that \n     glossed over some of the weaknesses in the new plan and other \n     elements of it that make it not necessarily a desirable \n     course to follow for other countries, let alone the United \n     States.\n       A number of factual errors occur in describing the current \n     Chilean plan. These cast doubt upon the credibility of the \n     analysis. First, the contribution rate for retirement \n     pensions is not 12%, but rather it is 10% (with an additional \n     approximately 3.5% for the build-up of disability and \n     survivor pensions).\n       Second, the plan is not a ``two-tier'' one, consisting of a \n     small flat stipend funded from general revenues for only the \n     poorest pensioners and the accumulation of employee \n     contributions in private investment funds. Rather, it \n     involves the accumulation of employee contributions in such \n     funds, plus the provision of sizable prior service credits \n     financed from general revenues, plus a guarantee of a \n     relatively sizable minimum pension being produced for persons \n     with at least 20 years of coverage, financed from general \n     revenues. Such minimum pension is 85-90% of the legal minimum \n     wage, which in turn is about 30-40% of the average wage in \n     the country. Thus, the minimum pension is a quite large \n     amount, so that many people will be affected.\n       Third, the article states that retirement benefits under \n     the new plan at present are 40% higher than under the old \n     one. Actually, they are about at the same level (as was \n     intended), although disability and survivor pensions are much \n     higher (because they are financed currently and are not as \n     much affected by past inflation).\n       Several serious errors of omission are present, so that \n     elements are not brought out that would argue against the \n     Chilean approach being applicable in all other countries. \n     First, there are the mammoth general-revenues costs to be met \n     for prior service credits and for all time to come for the \n     large minimum pensions. Few countries--and especially the \n     United States--have large surplus amounts of general revenues \n     readily available.\n       Second, the fact the employees contribute, and employers do \n     not do so any more, is not what it seems. When the new plan \n     was established, the government required all employers to \n     give a more-than-offsetting 17% pay increase to all \n     employees.\n       Third, the administrative expenses of the new Chilean plan \n     are about 13% of contributions for the retirement portion--as \n     against 1% in the U.S. system.\n       Fourth, coverage compliance is poor under the Chilean \n     system. Only about 80% of those who should be contributing \n     actually do so. Further, many low earners contribute on much \n     less of their wages than the actual amount, because they will \n     get the minimum pension in any event.\n       Fifth, by no means is all the money piling up in the \n     investment funds being used to promote the economy. Much of \n     the money is ``laundered back'' to the government to pay the \n     huge costs of prior service credits and minimum \n     pensions.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/31/senate-section/article/S5018-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5020-S5021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   RHODODENDRON PRINCESSES RECOGNIZED\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, it is always a pleasure to \nrecognize excellent students from the State of Oregon. However, I am \nespecially honored to praise five young people who have distinguished \nthemselves in the areas of scholarship and service, thus reflecting a \nsincere interest and involvement in their schools and communities.\n  Emily Anthony, Tracy Holman, Brandi Kekua, Lelia Lowe, and Rovina \nMurti are all winners in the Rhododendron Scholarship Program. This \nprogram is part of the Florence Rhododendron Festival held annually in \nOregon and second in size only to Portland's Rose Festival. By \nreceiving scholarships, these five young women form the 1995 \nrhododendron royalty court.\n  The Rhododendron Scholarship Program's goal is to raise over $10,000 \nfor academic and vocational scholarships. This royalty court works with \nlocal businesses, individuals, colleges, schools, fraternal \norganizations, and other groups to raise these scholarship funds.\n  I commend these young women for their earnest work, heartfelt \ngenerosity, and outstanding success. Furthermore, I applaud the \nperennial work of the Rhododendron Scholarship Program for the \nimportance it places on higher education and for the intense, local \neffort it makes to support the education of its students. It is a model \nprogram worthy of duplication.\n  Mr. President, I ask that brief descriptions of each 1995 \nrhododendron princess be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                 Rhododendron Scholarship Program--1995\n\n\n                         princess emily anthony\n\n       Emily Anthony, 17, plans a career in the field of health \n     care.\n       A student at Siuslaw High School, she has also been a \n     student of ballet for ten years.

Mr. President, I rise today to sadly note the death \nof Father Mike Lavelle, president of John Carroll University in \nCleveland, OH. Father Lavelle was an important leader of our community.\n  Rev. Michael Joseph Lavelle, S.J. Ph.D., a native of Cleveland, \njoined the faculty of John Carroll in 1969 and served as president of \nthe university since 1988. After collapsing from an attack of cardiac \narrhythmia on February 27, Father Lavelle never regained consciousness \nand died last Saturday.\n  I had the great privilege to work closely with Father Lavelle in a \nnumber of areas affecting higher education. He was a tireless advocate \nfor programs and services helping students, faculty and John Carroll \nUniversity.\n  Most recently we worked together to establish a Veterans' Teacher \nPreparation Program at John Carroll University. Father Lavelle was \ninstrumental in the development of this program to assist retiring \nmilitary personnel to obtain the necessary certification to teach high \nschool science or mathematics. This program which turns ``Troops to \nTeachers'' is just one example of the vision and commitment of Father \nLavelle to help improve Cleveland.\n  The death of Father Lavelle is a great loss and we will miss him. \nAnnie and I extend our sympathy to his sister, Helen, and the rest of \nhis family at John Carroll University and throughout Cleveland.\n  Mr. President, I ask that an article from the Cleveland Plain Dealer, \nMarch 26, 1995, be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n     JCU's Lavelle Dead at 60--Leader in Academia and Jesuit Order\n\n                         (By Richard M. Peery)\n\n       University Heights.--The Rev. Michael J. Lavelle, a Jesuit \n     priest whose long and distinguished career led him to the \n     presidency of John Carroll University, died yesterday at the \n     A.M. McGregor home in East Cleveland.\n       He never regained consciousness after collapsing Feb. 27 \n     from severe cardiac arrhythmia, while working out at the \n     university's physical fitness center. He was 60.\n       ``Father Lavelle was a strong visionary, capable president, \n     and he was also a friend,'' said Frederick F. Travis, acting \n     JCU president. ``He was very well liked on campus and was a \n     popular choice for president in 1988 among both faculty and \n     staff.''\n       During Lavelle's tenure as the 21st president of John \n     Carroll, the freshman class enrollment grew from 500 to more \n     than 700. He was instrumental in having two dormitories built \n     to house the influx of students.\n       He also helped initiate the movement of John Carroll's \n     athletic teams from the President's Athletic Conference to \n     the Ohio Athletic Conference. The change led to competition \n     with Baldwin-Wallace, Mount Union, Wooster and Muskingum \n     colleges.\n       In 1983, Lavelle was elected to the 33rd General \n     Congregation of the Society of Jesus, which established the \n     direction of the worldwide Jesuit order for the last 12 \n     years. He also served as one of a dozen advisers to the \n     American Catholic Bishops Committee on their pastoral letter \n     on the economy in the 1980s.\n       An economist and an expert on Eastern Europe, he traveled \n     to Soviet bloc countries more than 20 times, expanding his \n     expertise in Soviet and international economics and working \n     with this fellow Jesuits in those nations, many of whom had \n     been driven underground.\n       The Cleveland native grew up in the Lakeview Terrace \n     public-housing complex on the West Side. His father worked \n     for the old Cleveland Transit System for 42 years, 28 of them \n     on the Detroit Ave. and Clifton Blvd. streetcar lines.\n       Lavelle, a 1953 graduate of St. Ignatius High School, \n     distinguished himself as a member of the school's football \n     team, which won the 1952 West Senate League championship. He \n     was voted the West Senate Most Valuable Player and was named \n     to the All-Catholic High School football team. An all-\n     scholastic offensive guard who also played defense, he \n     received All-Ohio honorable mention.\n       Lavelle was a member of the school's track team for four \n     years, played basketball for one year and played sandlot \n     baseball in the summer.\n       He was inducted into the St. Ignatius Athletic Hall of Fame \n     in 1988.\n       Several years ago, Lavelle had a quadruple heart bypass \n     operation, but he could still be found in the gymasium during \n     many lunch hours playing pickup basketball with faculty \n     members.\n       But it was another school activity that made the deepest \n     impression on Lavelle as a teenager. One holiday, while \n     delivering food baskets to the needy, he went to the home of \n     a woman on Scovill Ave. who lived with just a mattress on the \n     floor, a table and one chair. She cried when she received the \n     food.\n       Lavelle said the experience made him decide to go into a \n     profession where he would help people. The summer after he \n     graduated from Ignatius, he decided to become a priest.\n       ``Sure, my parents were surprised, and some girlfriends \n     too,'' he recalled years later.\n       Lavelle attended Xavier University Cincinnati from 1953 to \n     1957. He earned degrees from Loyola University of Chicago and \n     a doctorate at Boston College. He also studied at Harvard \n     University's Russian Research Center in Boston and at the \n     Sankt Georgen theology school in Frankfurt, Germany, where he \n     was ordained in 1968.\n       He planned to say his first Mass on his father's birthday \n     in 1969. But Lavelle returned to Cleveland early that year \n     and delivered his first Mass at his father's funeral in \n     Ascension Catholic Church.\n       Lavelle joined the John Carroll faculty in 1969 as an \n     assistant professor of economics. He became chairman of the \n     business department in 1973 and served as the dean of the \n     School of Business from 1975 to 1977.\n       He left John Carroll to serve for six years as provincial \n     superior of the Detroit Province of the Society of Jesus. He \n     was the religious leader of 350 Jesuit priests and brothers \n     in Michigan and Ohio.\n       He returned to John Carroll as academic vice president in \n     1984. Two years later, he took on additional duties as \n     executive vice president for day-to-day operations. He was \n     named president in 1988, succeeding the Rev. Thomas P. \n     O'Malley, who resigned to take a teaching assignment in \n     Africa.\n       Lavelle's inaguration was marked by his pledge to increase \n     the university's commitment to community service and \n     multicultural development. It was celebrated with a variety \n     of ethnic foods and entertainment.\n       The multilingual priest, who was fluent in German and could \n     read French, Italian, Czech and Russian, was known for his \n     love of ethnic art, tradition and food. At the start of each \n     school year, he distributed to new faculty members a list of \n     local restaurants known for their ethnic cuisine.\n       An amateur cook, he was known for preparing dishes such as \n     linguini with red clam sauce. For many years, he volunteered \n     as a cook for the Friends of Templum House benefit.\n       Lavelle was a trustee of Boston College, Xavier University \n     and Magnificat High School. He was a former trustee of \n     Canisius College, the University of Detroit, Loyola College \n     in Maryland, St. Joseph's University \n     [[Page S5022]] in Philadelphia and the Jesuit School of \n     Theology in Berkeley, Calif.\n       He is survived by his sister, Helen of Chicago.\n       Services will be at 10 a.m. Wednesday at Gesu Catholic \n     Church, 2470 Miramar Blvd., University Heights.\n       Schulte & Mahon-Murphy Funeral Home in Lyndhurst is in \n     charge of arrangements.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/31/senate-section/article/S5021-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    EIGHTH GRADE YOUTH ESSAY CONTEST\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a group \nof young Indiana students who have shown great educative achievement. I \nwould like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the winners of \nthe 1994-95 Eighth Grade Youth Essay Contest which I sponsor in \nassociation with the Indiana Farm Bureau and Bank One of Indianapolis. \nThese students have displayed strong writing abilities and have proven \nthemselves to be outstanding young Hoosier scholars. I submit their \nnames for the Record because they demonstrate the capabilities of \ntoday's students and are fine representatives of our Nation.\n  This year, Hoosier students wrote on the theme ``Indiana Farmers--\nProducers of Food, Jobs, and World Trade.'' Students were encouraged to \nconsider and creatively express the role of Indiana agriculture in our \ncountry and in the world marketplace. I would like to submit for the \nRecord the winning essays of Jamie Shonk of Clay County and Joe Roth of \nPulaski County. As State winners of the Youth Essay Contest, these two \noutstanding students are being recognized today, Friday, March 31, \n1995, during a visit to our Nation's Capital.\n  The essays follow:\n\n       Indiana Farmers--Producers of Food, Jobs, and World Trade\n\n                     (By Jamie Shonk, Clay County)\n\n       Indiana agriculture has a far reaching effect on Hoosier \n     economy and world trade. Indiana is one of the top five corn \n     producing states in the United States. Corn production \n     influences the Indiana job market and economy in various \n     direct and indirect ways.\n       Corn production begins with research in test plots, \n     laboratories, and Purdue University, where germination \n     testing is done. Planting seed corn requires laborers and \n     detasslers. It is processed, bagged, and distributed, meaning \n     jobs for sales people, secretaries, truckers and advertising. \n     Farmers purchase seed, chemicals, fertilizer, fuel and \n     equipment. Average costs per acre is $135.00. At harvest, \n     grain is either stored or sold to local grain elevators. From \n     there, corn is shipped by train or truck to central \n     elevators. Corn is then sold to cereal mills and food \n     processors. High oil corn is sold for livestock feed. \n     Brokerage firms benefit because more farmers are selling on \n     the futures market and the board of trade. Farming magazines, \n     radio,\n      and T.V. brings revenue to the advertising industry. Corn is \n     also used to make ethanol.\n       Corn is also a major source of food, from the Corn Flakes \n     we eat in the morning to the oil we use for cooking. As \n     Americans are becoming more health conscious, we are shifting \n     away from animal fats to corn oil.\n       Corn is sold to other countries where crops cannot be \n     grown, and is profitable to Indiana in world trade.\n       Modern corn production in Indiana involves high technology, \n     business, marketing, research, advertising, and labor. This \n     will be demonstrated in 1995 by the Farm Progress Show at the \n     Jarvis Farm in Terre Taute. Area motels were booked full four \n     hours after the location announcement. Corn production \n     touches all Hoosiers some way by food, jobs, or trade.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n        Indiana Farmers--Producers of Food, Jobs and World Trade\n\n                     (By Joe Roth, Pulaski County)\n\n       I am a bushel of corn. On October 16th I was harvested from \n     a farm in North Central Indiana. I was put in a bin on that \n     Indiana farm where I was dried to a suitable moisture for \n     safe keeping until January. Already in my short life I have \n     helped employ several people. People who design, build and \n     maintain farm equipment, and people who manufacture, sell, \n     and transport fuel for this harvesting equipment and gas for \n     the drying process.\n       Come with me on the rest of my journey until I have become \n     a finished product. From the farm I am loaded into a tractor \n     trailer truck that transports me to a large elevator. Here at \n     the local elevator some of the corn is ground for feed for \n     local livestock feeders, but I am being sent to the East \n     Coast for export to a foreign country. I have been weighed, \n     checked for moisture and quality, and loaded into a 100 car \n     train. Here I have helped employ several more people. Once I \n     arrive at the Baltimore seaport, I am unloaded from the \n     train. Again I am checked for quality and loaded into a large \n     cargo ship. My destination is a corn processor in Europe. \n     Soon I'll become feed for livestock, or if I'm good enough, \n     maybe corn flakes for human consumption.\n       Along the way I have helped employ hundreds of people, \n     people involved in the manufacturing, sales and service of \n     farm machinery, transportation equipment, fertilizer, seed \n     and agronomy people, the petroleum industry, people who labor \n     in the feed mills and the elevators, people who work in the \n     commodities\n      trading business, and last but not least, the people who \n     work in the food processing business.\n       I am just a bushel of corn, and right now I am only worth \n     $1.86, but if you stop and think about how many people I help \n     employ, you will soon realize just how important I am to \n     these people. I help make Indiana and the USA the greatest \n     supplier of food in the world.\n\n\n                        1994-95 district winners\n\n       District 1: Jenny Marsh, Joe Roth.\n       District 2: Allison Westrem, Charles Geller.\n       District 3: Amanda Miller, Tony Goyer.\n       District 4: Miriah Chapman, Brett Steffen.\n       District 5: Ashley Beth Greenwood, Adam Chandler.\n       District 6: Becky Black, Patrick Aitchison.\n       District 7: Jamie Shonk, Gregory James Scott.\n       District 8: Lori Parcel, Justin Russell.\n       District 9: Katie Parker, Jeff Buchanan.\n       District 10: Hannah Dunn, Adam C.

Mr. President, one of the controversies we will \nface in the Senate before this session is out is whether to follow the \nadvice of the bankers and the secondary markets and cut back on the \ndirect loan program.\n  Direct loans are a great thing for students, their parents, the \ncolleges and universities, and for the taxpayers.\n  To cave in to the financial interests, who want to keep their Federal \nsubsidy--often the same people who denounce welfare for the poor--is \nsomething I hope the Senate will not do.\n  Recently, the Chicago Sun-Times, which originally opposed the direct \nlending program, had an editorial supporting the program now.\n  The experience in the schools that have it is so positive, I hope we \nwill listen to our colleges and universities and not to those who are \neager for profits at the taxpayers' expense.\n  I ask that the Sun-Times editorial be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                  [From the Sun-Times, Mar. 29, 1995]\n\n                Direct Loan Program Is Good Deal for All\n\n       Under the guises of deficit reduction and reduced \n     government, Republican forces in Congress are pressing for \n     changes in student loan programs that would impose onerous \n     new costs on college students and stall broader availability \n     of direct loans, the plan sponsored by Sen. Paul Simon (D-\n     Ill.) to eliminate middlemen.\n       [[Page S5023]] Both proposals are without merit and should \n     be ``zeroed out,'' to swipe a phrase from the new \n     congressional vocabulary.\n       Efforts to eliminate the federal subsidy of interest \n     charges on student loans come at a time when rising college \n     costs are forcing more students to borrow money to pay for \n     their education. The American Council on Education reports \n     that 6.6 million students took federal loans this year, up \n     from 4.5 million in 1988. Meanwhile, the dollar amount \n     increased from $11.8 billion to $25.8 billion. The government \n     eases that burden by paying interest on loans while the \n     student is in school. Without the subsidy, the debt of an \n     undergraduate who takes out the maximum loan amount for four \n     years would increase 20 percent, the ACE says.\n       These subsidies are costly--$2.2 billion this year--but \n     they are based on sound public policy: providing access to \n     higher education.\n       Elsewhere in Congress, moves are afoot to limit the direct \n     loan program, which Simon sponsored to allow students to get \n     loans directly from the federal government. The program, \n     which is being phased in over five years, is strongly opposed \n     by banks that have risk-free profits under government loan \n     guarantees, and by the huge public-private agencies that \n     administer the program and run profitable secondary loan \n     markets. Having failed to block the original legislation, \n     opponents now seek to limit direct loans to 40 percent of \n     student loan volume, arguing that private enterprise works \n     better than government.\n       Although we would like to see stronger guarantees that \n     schools are not ripping off the direct loan program--as many \n     for-profit trade schools did under the subsidized bank loan \n     program--we believe the record of the direct loan program to \n     date calls for its continued expansion. Students and \n     participating schools, including the University of Illinois \n     at Champaign-Urbana, report fewer hassles with direct loans.\n       More important, the program is expected to save money. The \n     Clinton administration estimates $5.2 billion would be saved \n     by 2000, if the direct loan program were fully implemented by \n     the 1997-i98 school year. That's a good deal for the schools \n     and a good deal for the taxpayers. The program should \n     continue on schedule.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/31/senate-section/article/S5022-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     RESOLUTION OVER UNDER THE RULE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
