The clerk will report the unfinished \nbusiness.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1541) to extend, reform, and improve \n     agricultural commodity, trade, conservation, and other \n     programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Craig (for Leahy/Lugar) amendment No. 3184, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n       Wellstone (for Kohl) amendment No. 3442 (to amendment No. \n     3184) to eliminate the provision granting consent to the \n     Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3442 to Amendment No. 3184\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time on the amendment?\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to call up our amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is the pending question.\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, today, I and others rise in opposition to the \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact. While we have only a short time to \ndiscuss this matter, I think that it is important to fully understand \nits ramifications--for farmers of other regions, for consumers in the \nNortheast, and for the principle of free trade within our country.\n  As I have said before, it is difficult for me to stand here and \noppose my friends from the Northeast in their efforts to help the dairy \nfarmers of their region. But I feel that this is a very important \nissue, and that it is the wrong thing to do.\n  The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact is a regional compact unlike \nany we have seen before. It is an effort by six Northeastern States to \nwall themselves off from the rest of the Nation economically. The \ncompact would bring about artificially increased milk prices in the \nNortheast, for the benefit of the farmers in those States, at the \nexpense of that region's consumers, without regard to market forces. \nAnd it would do so by imposing a prohibitive compensatory payment \nscheme to prevent more reasonably priced milk from coming in from other \nregions. It is at its heart anticompetitive.\n  I will be the first to say that dairy issues are regionally divisive, \nand the first to agree that we should get beyond our divisions and find \ncommon ground. And I believe that compromise and consensus are \npossible, even in dairy policy.\n  But the Northeast Dairy Compact ignores all efforts at compromise, \nand instead is an effort by one region to remove itself from the \nnational system and establish a regional dairy policy. It takes an \nalready outmoded milk pricing system, and twists it even further.\n  While the context for this compact is dairy, I believe its \nramifications are far more broad.\n  Make no mistake about it. This compact is unprecedented in the \nhistory of the Nation. It is true that the Constitution allows States \nto enter into a compact with other States, as long as those compacts \nare approved by Congress. This authority has been used many times, \nwithout controversy, by States that seek to address multistate \nenvironmental or transportation concerns. But I know of no instance \nwhere it has been used to allow States to engage in price-fixing \nactivities, or as a way to circumvent the commerce clause of the \nConstitution. Congressional approval of this compact is an invitation \nfor all sorts of economic balkanization.\n  The Framers of the Constitution had the foresight to see the dangers \nof allowing States and regions to erect economic barriers against other \nStates in the Union. \n\n[[Page S1002]]\n\n  Two years ago, when the Northeast Dairy Compact was considered in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, many of my colleagues raised valid \nconstitutional concerns with the compact.\n  If we set the precedent today by granting consent to one region of \nthe Nation to wall itself off economically from the rest, we must ask \nourselves, where will it stop?\n  If we deny free trade within our own borders, we are whittling away \nat the economic unity that is one of the core principles of this \ncountry. And I will not stand for it.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the motion to strike the \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact from this bill.\n  I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I want to thank the Senator from Wisconsin for his \nexceptional leadership. Last night, when I laid down this amendment the \nSenator is speaking about, I did it because of what I think all of us \nin the Midwest feel very, very strongly about. First of all, many of us \nhave been working for 5 years to have milk marketing order reform. That \nis what we really stand for. That makes all the sense in the world.\n  We have had a system in place since 1933, and it worked in the \nbeginning, but it is archaic and it has a discriminatory effect on \ndairy producers in the upper Midwest. We have lost thousands of dairy \nfarms in my State of Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, the problem with the Northeast Dairy Compact, above \nand beyond what the Senator from Wisconsin has spoken about, in terms \nof some of the regional barriers it creates, is that this also will \nforestall the kind of genuine reform that we really need of the milk \nmarketing order system.\n  Mr. President, it is not appropriate to cut a special deal for one \nregion's dairy farmers to the detriment of dairy farmers in other \nregions, especially in the upper Midwest. So, Mr. President, I think \nthis is a critical vote, and I am proud to stand with the Senator from \nWisconsin. I hope that our colleagues will support this amendment. It \nis absolutely key to the future of the dairy industry in this country \nto have a fair milk marketing order system, to have real reform. This \namendment really takes us in that direction.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota [Mr. Grams].\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in offering this \namendment to strike the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact from the \nfarm bill.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I rise today for the over 11,000 dairy \nfarmers I represent--the most productive, yet overburdened, dairy \nproducers in the world.\n  For years, Minnesota's dairy industry has struggled against the \nharmful impact of an archaic Federal milk marketing order pricing \nscheme, which has played a key role in the loss of over 10,000 dairy \nfarms over the last decade--an average of nearly 3 farms every day.\n  These statistics emphasize the importance of fixing the dairy \nprogram. Yet, today we are faced with a proposal which would impose \nanother set of burdensome regulations and harmful trade barriers on our \ndairy producers.\n  If this dairy compact is enacted, it will increase the minimum price \npaid to dairy farmers in New England. These higher prices will likely \nincrease dairy production in that region, causing New England milk \nproducers and processors to seek additional markets in States like \nMinnesota. In the process, this overproduction has the potential to \nflood markets and depress milk prices paid to dairy farmers outside of \nthe compact States.\n  The long-term effect of these lower prices would be to drive the \ndairy industry from States like Minnesota out of business--leading to a \nshortage of milk within the region and requiring processors to import \nmore expensive milk from other regions.\n  Due to the 20-percent loss of milk production in Minnesota over the \nlast decade, this is already happening. With the dairy compact, we run \nthe risk of making this even worse for dairy producers around the \ncountry.\n  In addition, the compact will result in the proliferation of \nanticompetitive trade barriers between the States. If enacted, the \nCompact Commission will have to make immediate decisions about how to \nkeep lower priced milk in States outside the Northeast from entering \ntheir region.\n  In order for the compact to survive, New England would have to engage \nin protectionist behavior, not from other countries, but from within \nthe United States itself.\n  At a time when we are trying to open up global markets for our \nNation's farm producers, it makes no sense to encourage protectionism \nwithin our own borders. Yet, that is exactly what the dairy compact \nwould do.\n  The Nation's dairy industry should be exactly that--a national \nindustry. Special favors for one region of the country will have a \ndetrimental impact on the others.\n  For far too long, regional politics have made the dairy program what \nit is today: archaic, unfair, unwise, and unworkable. Let us not take \nanother step backward by authorizing this Northeast Dairy Compact.\n  After all, the purpose of the Agricultural Marketing Transition Act \nis to remove the Government from interfering in the agricultural \ndecisionmaking process and reduce the regional conflicts that have \nplagued our farm policy for years.\n  The dairy compact would do just the opposite: It would expand the \nrole of government in dairy policy, create an unfair advantage for \ndairy producers in New England, and further weaken the dairy industry \nin States like Minnesota.\n  I will not stand for that. And neither should any other Senator. It \nis time to put an end to the failed dairy policies of the past--and \ncertainly to the unwise proposal before us today.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for small dairy \nfarmers across the country and voting to strike the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact from this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, who controls time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I believe I control the time on our side, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Let us get down to what we are talking about. I think it was brought \nout well by the Senator from Minnesota. That is, they want to protect \ntheir farmers. That is understandable. They would like to have no milk \norders. They would like to have nothing in this country because they \nbelieve they are lowest producers. That is fine.\n  This issue was raised before. I want to remind everybody, the Senate \nvoted 65 to 35 earlier this year to say that, yes, the six States of \nNew England, a small area of our country, has the right to act like any \nbig State, because California and several other States have done the \nsame thing we seek to do. Many have said, ``We want to protect and help \nour dairy farmers stay in business.'' Little old New England, six \nStates are no bigger than many of the other small States.\n  We talk about the State's rights here. These six legislatures voted \nto do this. Two of those are metropolitan States. They said, ``We want \nto protect the farms of Vermont.'' We are tucked way up in there. We do \nnot bother anybody with our milk supply. We could not. We are too far \naway. We are at the end of the energy, the end of everything up there. \nWe are bordering on Canada that has milk prices 50 percent higher than \nours. We cannot get into their markets. Hopefully with NAFTA we can.\n  All we are saying, ``Let us do what any other State can do and let us \nget our producers a little more money for their milk that goes to the \nconsumers.'' The consumers agreed, ``We are willing to pay it, we are \nwilling to pay it.''\n  So why does Minnesota and Wisconsin--later on we will have a chance \nto vote for something to protect them, something to give them what they \nwant. We are willing to go along with it if they leave us alone. They \ndo not, no. We will have the ability to be able to help our producers. \nIt is only 5 years, a sunset, that says try it for 5 years and keep it \ngoing until NAFTA or something comes by.\n  It is hard to understand why they would pick on our farmers up there \nso far away. There is no way we are a threat to their markets. I cannot \nunderstand why they have taken this position. Fortunately, the Senate \nhas already said 65 to 35 that you are right, \n\n[[Page S1003]]\nNew England, your States have a right to act like any big State.\n  I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend and colleague from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, it probably makes sense this is the first thing we are \ndebating this morning because of the fact that it is a dairy amendment \nand dairy farmers get up early, work hard, maybe a little bit early for \nsome of our friends in the Senate, but Senator Jeffords' and my good \nfriend, Harold Howrigan, up in Franklin County, VT, is up there. He has \nalready finished milking, had breakfast, and probably back in the barn \nnow feeding the calves.\n  I mention him for this reason: Harold is the president of the St. \nAlbans Cooperative, but first and foremost a hard working dairy farmer \nlike so many men and women in Vermont. I hope when we debate this \namendment we consider how it will affect the average dairy farmer. This \ncompact was an idea that came from Vermont. It could help Vermont's \nhard working farmers get a better return for their work. It will also \nhelp consumers gets more stable prices.\n  All of New England is united in this effort. I ask those who would \nvote against it, how would they explain to somebody in New England why \nthey did it? It allows the States to take over their own destiny.\n  We hear all kinds of talk about the need to give more responsibility \nback to the States. We heard it across town at the National Governors' \nAssociation, telling Members of Congress to do that. In fact, I tell my \ncolleagues, if I understand the wire service copy I was reading at \nabout 1 o'clock this morning, the National Governors' Association has \nvoted to support this concept. Now, the Senate also voted that way, 65 \nto 34.\n  This is not something that is anticonsumer legislation. It is \nsomething where people come together in their own region to help their \nown region.\n  We are talking about beverage milk. That is a regional market. You do \nnot drive milk halfway across a country. You do it in the region. Over \n97 percent of the package milk sold in New England comes from bottlers \nregulated in New England. The rest comes from outside. Less than 1 \npercent comes from outside our region.\n  This is also not closing out other markets. They are not there, \nanyway. Fluid milk remains within the region where it is. It also is \nnot something where the consumers are going to be gouged. This compact \nwould increase prices only if four of the six New England States agree \nto it.\n  Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts have 11 \nmillion consumers. They have fewer among all of them than 1,000 \nfarmers. This is not a case where some farm bloc is going to roll over \nconsumers. It is going to have to be something where the consumers want \nto do it, not that the farmers want to do it. They are an infinitesimal \npart of the population involved.\n\n  It also will make the point that it is not the farmer that is getting \nthis money, it is the retailer. The past 12 years, farm prices fell 5 \npercent. Retail prices, I ask my friend from Vermont, I believe went up \nabout 30 percent, is that not right, or more, during that same time? If \nyou want to look at the price of milk, look to the retailers. It is \namazing, as the price goes down to the producer, the cost goes up in \nthe supermarket.\n  I yield back to my friend from Vermont, but I ask if that is not the \ncase?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That certainly is. I happen to have a chart here.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thought you might.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have a chart that displays that fact. The farmers are \nthe most important group that the consumers ever have to keep prices \ndown, but they cannot do it if the retailers keep going up. Our farm \nprices have been going down for the last 10 years, and the retail \nprices have been going up. Every time we go down, they go up. Anybody \nthat tries to say we are the cause of high retail prices, there is just \nno evidence of that whatever.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I hope, Mr. President, that the 65 Senators who voted for \nthis last time, who obviously felt it was important to do so, felt they \nhad legitimate reasons to do so, would not suddenly decide to change \nexactly as they voted last time.\n  To reiterate:\n  Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the amendment \noffered by Senators Wellstone, Feingold, Kohl, and others.\n  The underlying bill would grant congressional consent to the \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact. This compact is an agreement among \nthe six New England States to create a commission that will have the \nauthority to oversee the pricing of fluid milk. All six States' \nGovernors and legislatures strongly support this amendment.\n  All year we have heard about the need to give more responsibility \nback to the States. Across town, at the National Governor's Association \nmeeting, Members of Congress are lining up to tell the Governors how \nthey are willing to turn more control back to the States.\n  The underlying bill would allow the six New England States to take \nmore control over milk pricing. The Senate voted 65 to 34 in favor of \nan amendment that added the compact during the budget bill debate.\n  Even though the 6 New England States have debated this compact for 7 \nyears, and even though 65 Senators voted in favor of the compact, my \ncolleagues from Wisconsin insist that they know what is best for new \nEngland. So they want to strip this provision from the bill.\n  They claim that the compact would hurt their region, but that claim \nis false. We are talking about beverage milk, which is a limited \nregional market. It does not travel long distances because it is \nperishable. Fluid milk from Minnesota or Wisconsin is not sold in New \nEngland.\n  Over 97 percent of the packaged milk sold in New England comes from \nbottlers regulated in New England. The rest comes from the neighboring \nmilk marketing order. Less than 1 percent comes from outside our \nregion.\n  Even if fluid milk did come in from outside our region, which it does \nnot, the compact would allow the flow of milk into and out of the \nregion just as it occurs now.\n  Opponents make a lot of claims about this compact. They claim it \nwould erect a trade barrier around New England.\n  This is simply not true. Over 20 percent of the milk sold in New \nEngland comes from New York. The compact would ensure that these \nfarmers also receive their share of benefits from the compact.\n  The compact works just like the current Federal order system. Any \nproducer supplying the market would receive the benefits.\n  I agree that the national industry needs to come together behind a \nunified dairy policy. I will support reasonable reforms of the milk \nmarketing orders and the dairy program.\n  In the meantime, I do not see how we can hold the New England States \nhostage. This compact is State law in the six New England States, an \nidea that came from the countryside, not from Washington. The New \nEngland States think they have a better way of pricing milk. We should \nlet them.\n  Some try to make the claim that the compact would raise consumer \nprices. The link between farm and retail milk prices is tenuous at \nbest. In the past 12 years, farm prices have fallen 5 percent, while \nretail prices have increased over 30 percent.\n  There is no guarantee there would be any price increase. The compact \nwould increase prices only if four of the six New England States \nagreed. Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts \nhave 11 million consumers and fewer than 1,000 farmers. Their consumer \ninterests far outweigh their farmer interests. Both farmers and \nconsumers would have to be represented on the commission.\n  The New England State legislatures have voted overwhelmingly to give \nthe compact commission this authority. All 12 members of the New \nEngland delegation are cosponsors of the compact and it has already \nreceived the support of 65 Senators.\n  This is a grassroots effort. New England is asking for nothing from \nthis body nor the Federal treasury--just the opportunity to act in \nconcert for their common good. In the spirit of federalism I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this amendment and give this opportunity to \nthe New England States.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Vermont. \n  \n[[Page S1004]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont controls 7 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, let me make one comment. We are not \nruling out anybody else flowing their milk in. Hey, guys, bring it up \nif you can get the price. Bring it in, Minnesota. You can get the \nprice. We are not trying to lock anybody out. You can get the price, \nPennsylvania, then ship milk in, come on in, and take advantage of the \nprice. That is your right.\n  We have not ruled anybody out, and we are not trying to make a market \nfor ourselves. We are trying to be generous in helping the dairy \nfarmers to stay alive in our area. If you can do it, if the price goes \nup, and it attracts you, what you are saying, and the end result is, we \nhave to knock you out so that price gets even higher so we can ship in. \nIf you cannot ship in with the high price, we will give you--you want \nit higher than that. You want to really rip our consumers off it you \nare going to get into our markets because you can get into them now.\n  Mr. President, I retain the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Dole, Senator Lugar, \nSenator Leahy, and others for their tireless efforts in bringing us a \nfarm bill. I know that they have overcome many obstacles, and that it \nhas not been an easy task. I also understand that there is an urgency \nto pass this bill. It is important for all those in the business of \nproviding food for America that we act to improve these programs. \nOverall, I support these improvements and will vote for this bill.\n  I do object, however, to the provision added to the compromise \nversion of S. 1541 that would give congressional approval to the \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact. This proposal was introduced and \nplaced directly on the Senate calendar, bypassing the Judiciary \nCommittee which has jurisdiction over interstate compacts. In other \nwords, we are being asked to vote on this controversial compact without \nhaving had a hearing or a committee markup on the issue during this \nCongress.\n  Although some changes and minor improvements were made to the \nproposal from the version that was debated in the 103d Congress, those \nchanges have not altered the essential nature of this compact. It would \nstill permit member States to set the price for fluid milk above the \nexisting Federal order price, effectively setting up a dairy cartel. \nThese member States would be protected from competition from other \nStates. This form of trade barrier is exactly the kind of practice \nprohibited by the commerce clause of the Constitution, and it is not \none we should sanction in an interstate compact. Compacts have been \nused to build bridges, roads, and tunnels; to dispose of waste; or to \nset boundaries. Never have they been used to restrict interstate \ncommerce.\n  Despite the modifications its proponents have made, I remain \nconcerned about the dairy compact's potential anticompetitive effects, \nthe burdens it places on interstate commerce, and the harm it would \ncause to consumers by increasing prices. The compact would raise the \nprices milk processors would have to pay for milk sold in the compact \nStates, and those costs would be passed on to consumers.\n  I am equally concerned that the compact will disrupt existing Federal \nprograms that regulate milk prices and that it will increase costs to \nthe Federal Government. Costs to the Government will undoubtedly \nincrease if the Government is forced to purchase more surplus when \nfarmers are encouraged to increase production well beyond demand. This \nis certainly not a time when we should be increasing pressure on the \nFederal budget.\n  The fact is that we already have a Federal system for setting minimum \nmilk prices to dairy farmers. That system provides a safety net through \nthe dairy price support program and dictates minimum prices paid \nthrough the Federal milk marketing order program. I see no reason to \nestablish a second milk pricing mechanism that will benefit only a few \nStates.\n  In short, I remain seriously concerned that the dairy compact will \nhurt consumers, milk processors, and taxpayers. At a minimum, it \nembodies a concept that requires deeper scrutiny and further \ndiscussion.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nWellstone amendment to strike the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact \nfrom this bill.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot of talk in this debate about the \nneed to preserve the family farm, and how the farm legislation that we \npass should, at the very least, not cause more family farmers to go out \nof business.\n  Well, I can tell you that what we have at stake in this vote on the \nWellstone amendment is nothing less than the survival of many family \ndairy farms in Maine and the other New England States.\n  It's very simple. If this amendment wins, large numbers of family \ndairy farms in Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, and other New England \nStates go out of business. If we defeat the Wellstone amendment and \nretain the Craig-Leahy language, more farmers have an opportunity to \nkeep their farms, the rural economy of our region stays afloat, and \nconsumers and processors in our region have the satisfaction of knowing \nthat the price they pay for fresh milk provides a fair return to the \nfarmer who produced it.\n  And that is one thing that I hope everyone keeps in mind on this \nvote: The only people directly affected by the compact--the farmers, \nconsumers, and processors of New England--all support it.\n  What is also at stake is the concept of State-based problem-solving. \nIn the debates held so far in this Congress, and surely in the debates \nto come, we have heard and will hear many Members argue that the States \nare often best positioned to solve their own problems, and that they \nshould be allowed to do so without interference from Washington. I \ncouldn't agree more.\n  With this vote on the Wellstone amendment today, Senators will have \nan opportunity to match words on this concept with deeds. The compact \nrepresents a regional response to a regional problem. It directly \naffects only those States that belong to the compact, and it doesn't \ncost the Federal Government anything. We have to decide whether we are \ngoing to support State problem solving, or obstruct it.\n  As in many other rural regions of the country, agriculture is a \ncornerstone of Maine's economy. Within the agricultural sector, dairy \nfarming usually ranks second or third in cash receipts every year. The \ndairy industry provides not only jobs for the farmers themselves, but \nfor the people who sell farm machinery, service the machinery, sell \nfuel and feed, and provide other goods and services. Dairy farms also \naccount for large shares of the municipal tax base throughout rural \nMaine, making them critical contributors to local schools and essential \ntown services.\n  Unfortunately, all is not well in the Maine dairy industry. In 1978, \nMaine had 1,133 dairy farms. By 1988, that number had declined to 800. \nIn 1991, there were 680. And today we are down to roughly 600. I \nunderstand that our New England States have experienced the same \ndevastating trend, and that Vermont, especially, has been losing huge \nnumbers of family farmers. Without the compact in this bill, I can tell \nyou: the bleeding of our family farms will continue.\n  The precipitous decline in the number of dairy farms can be \nattributed to several factors, but most notably to the fact that \nFederal market order prices in New England are generally much lower \nthan the costs of production in the region. Opponents sometimes like to \nsay that New England has some of the highest average order prices in \nthe East. This is generally the case because most of New England's milk \nmarket involves fresh, fluid milk, which brings a higher price than \nmilk sold for other products; whereas, in other regions like the Upper \nMidwest, less than one-sixth of the milk producers is sold for the \nfresh fluid market. But the average order price in New England in the \nfirst half of 1995 was $13.17 a hundred, while the costs of production \nin Maine, which is a fresh fluid milk market, are close to $17 per \nhundred. New England farmers cannot make it under the existing order \nsystem.\n  Mailbox prices provide a better illustration of the fact. The mailbox \nprice is the actual price that the farmers receive after deducting the \ncosts of marketing their milk. And if we look at mailbox prices, we see \nthat New England farmers get the lowest take-home prices east of the \nMississippi River. \n\n[[Page S1005]]\nFarmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota receive significantly higher mailbox \nprices--nearly 50 cents a hundredweight more.\n  Faced with the same problems throughout the region, the six New \nEngland States banded together to develop a joint regional solution. \nThey painstakingly negotiated an interstate dairy compact that will \nensure a fairer and more stable price for dairy farmers in the region. \nBut it is a pricing program that also protects the interests of \nconsumers in the region. As evidence of the balance and fairness \nachieved by the compact, both the net-producing and net-consuming \nStates in the region all approved the compact with strong support.\n  The compact creates a regional commission which has the authority to \nset minimum prices paid to farmers for fluid, or class I milk. \nDelegations from each State comprise the voting membership of the \ncommission, and these delegations in turn will include both farmer and \nconsumer representatives. The minimum price established by the \ncommission is the Federal market order price plus a small ``over-\norder'' differential that would be paid by milk processing plants. This \nover-order price is capped in the compact, and a two-thirds voting \nmajority of the commission is required before any over-order price can \nbe instituted.\n  Mr. President, until a court struck down the Main dairy vendor's fee \nin 1994 because we did not have the required congressional \nauthorization, milk in my State was priced by a mechanism that is \nsimilar to that which could be utilized by the Compact Commission. \nMaine's experience was uniformly positive. Farm prices were stable and \nreasonable, but no farmers got rich on the minimal adjustment provided \nby the ``over-order'' price under the vendor's fee program. It only \nhelped the farmers keep their heads above water. Dairy processors and \nvendors maintained their business, and consumers did not see any \nsignificant increases in the price of milk. It was a win-win \nproposition for everyone in Maine, and I am confident that the compact \nwill achieve the same success throughout New England without violating \nthe constitution's interstate commerce clause.\n  With very few exceptions, the compact only affects New England \nconsumers, farmers, and dairy processors. The compact applies only to \nfluid or class I milk, and approximately 97 percent of the fluid milk \nconsumed in New England is processed by New England-based processors. \nApproximately 75 percent of the milk that these processors process \ncomes from New England farmers; the rest comes from New York, whose \nfarmers would receive any higher prices for their milk sold to New \nEngland under a compact.\n  Although the direct impacts of the compact fall only on the New \nEngland States, we have shown a more than ample willingness to address \nthe concerns expressed by Senators from other States. The compact \nconsent provision in this bill provides additional assurances that the \ncompact only applies to class I, fluid milk. The provision also \nincludes a 5-year sunset, so that another act of Congress will be \nrequired to continue the compact after years. It's a fail-safe. If \nproblems do arise with this compact, then Congress can let it expire \nafter 5 years. In effect, what we are proposing in a kind of pilot \nprogram.\n  And we would be willing to go even further. Senate Joint Resolution \n28, the consent resolution that we introduced last year, explicitly \nprovides that no additional States will be allowed into the compact \nwithout the formal approval of both Houses of Congress, that out-of-\nregion farmers who sell milk in the compact region will get the same \nprice as farmers in the region, that the commission's pricing authority \nis strictly limited, and that the commission must develop a plan to \nensure that over-order prices do not lead to increases in production. \nUnfortunately, the amendment before us ignores the good-faith, \nconstructive offerings that we have made in the past.\n  Mr. President, why should the Federal Government deny the States an \nopportunity to solve their own problems, especially when it doesn't \ncost the Federal taxpayers? The answer is that we shouldn't. We should \npraise the States for their self-reliance and ingenuity when they \ndevise creative ways to solve their problems, as they have done in the \ncase of this compact. I hope that Senators will recognize the value in \nthis kind of state-based problem-solving, support the wishes of the \npeople who will really be affected by this legislation, and vote no on \nthe Wellstone amendment.\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, yesterday, I voted for cloture on \nthe Craig/Leahy substitute to the farm bill. I cast my vote in hopes of \nreaching cloture so that we could debate and discuss the 1995 farm \nbill. I have consistently voted in the past in favor of moving forward \nwith debate to ensure the integrity of farm legislation which would \nallow our farmers to plant their crops. We were not able to obtain \ncloture yesterday, however, late yesterday evening, the leadership came \nto an agreement to complete a farm bill. Unfortunately, I am not able \nto be present for today's debate due to business which takes me away \nfrom the Senate. These past months I have postponed scheduled meetings \nand trips in order to meet the Senate schedule. The business which \ntakes me away from the Senate today was planned many months ago with \nthe knowledge that we would be in recess for the month of February. I \nam leading an important delegation from Oregon, which includes members \nof the Port of Portland, on a vital trade mission to Taiwan and Korea.\n  Mr. President, I know that millions of jobs, including those of \ntruckers, retailers, farm implement dealers, bankers and exporters, are \ndependent upon a healthy farm economy. Consumers are accustomed to \nconsistently having quality, yet, inexpensive agricultural products on \ntheir grocery shelves. Yet, there is no more troubled sector in the \nAmerican economy than agriculture. Agricultural surpluses, declining \nfarm exports, failed farm and farm related businesses are constant \nreminders of the need to reestablish strength and stability of American \nagriculture.\n  The roots of our farm crisis are many and the solutions to the \nproblems are indeed complex. The Senate and House Agriculture \nCommittees have labored for the past year in an attempt to bring bills \nto a vote in our respective Chambers. Truly, it has been a daunting \nyear. We are now in a crisis situation where we have reverted to laws \nwritten in the 1930's and 1940's. If we do not find compromise and pass \na farm bill now, we face much greater costs and exacerbate \ninstabilities in the agricultural sector. Many of the programs of the \n1930's are unpopular because they call for strict acreage allotments \nand marketing quotas on major crops. However, a simple extension of the \ncurrent law for more than a few months will prove to be economically \ndisastrous for both the Federal Treasury and beleaguered farmers who \nfall behind daily as talks continue in the Senate Chamber.\n  I cannot say that I agree entirely with the proposed farm bill, S. \n1541. The proposed 7-year contracts with the Federal Government, \nguaranteeing continued payments regardless of market conditions will \nallow farmers broad flexibility to grow crops in accordance with market \nconditions and not Government regulations. However, I am concerned that \nthe bill would cut spending for the Export Enhancement Program, which \nsubsidizes overseas sale of U.S. commodities, such as wheat. I am also \nconcerned that the Market Promotion Program [MPP], which helps U.S. \ncompanies fund overseas promotional and advertising campaigns, would be \ncapped. If we are to allow flexibility to meet market demands we must \nalso tap into as well as create markets in foreign countries, \nespecially in the Pacific rim in order to achieve the goal of \nindependence from traditional Government assistance to farmers.\n  Mr. President, I also offer an amendment which addresses a problem in \nOregon that deals with the Oregon Public Broadcasting's [OPB] \neligibility for the Public Television Demonstration Program \nadministered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. OPB's eligibility \nfor the program was held in suspension last year when it was discovered \nthat OPB's broadcast coverage did not meet the statute's statewide \nrequirement. OPB covers 90 percent of the State's population and 84 \npercent of the State's rural area. And, since all of OPB's productions \nare rebroadcast by one local public television station, \n\n[[Page S1006]]\nOPB's programs are essentially available to all Oregonians. Until the \ndefinition of ``statewide'' is clarified, OPB will not be eligible for \nthe grant program. Thus I submit my amendment to clarify the language \nfor the eligibility criteria for the Public Television Demonstration \nProgram.\n  In conclusion, I find sections of this farm bill which I would like \nto change, as do many of my colleagues. However, we must continue to \nfind and forge compromise in order to move toward not only a farm bill \nbut balancing our national budget. I sincerely believe we will soon \nachieve that goal.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes of our time to \nSenator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nWellstone's amendment to strike the congressional approval to the \nNortheast Dairy Compact contained in this Leahy substitute. I am \npleased to be a cosponsor of his amendment.\n  Mr. President, there are so many things wrong with this Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact, it is difficult to know where to begin.\n  The greatest irony of the Northeast Dairy Compact's inclusion in \nfreedom to farm is that the package, in the words of the Agriculture \nCommittee Chairman Lugar, purports to be market oriented. He called \nthis package a bold departure from current law. Well, he's right. The \nNortheast Compact is a bold departure from current law, but it is far, \nvery far, from the goal of market orientation.\n  Mr. President, the Northeast Dairy Compact is the antithesis of \nmarket orientation. It is exactly the type of program that reformers in \nthis body have been targeting for 2 years. Many of those who support \nthe Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact have been among the most \noutspoken critics of farm programs which impose taxes on consumers to \nsupport agricultural producers--which is exactly what the Northeast \nCompact does. But it does far more than that, Mr. President.\n  The compact allows six States with far more consumers than dairy \nproducers, to artificially raise the price that consumers pay for fluid \nmilk. It is a price fixing compact, pure and simple, Mr. President. And \nit is without precedent in our Nation's history.\n  This is not about States rights. Never was the 10th amendment or the \ncompact clause of our Constitution intended to allow several States to \ncollude to fix prices for products produced in those States while \nsimultaneously keeping products produced in other States out of the \ncompact region. Mr. President, that would be a restraint of interstate \ncommerce. Well, Mr. President, that is what this compact does--it \nrestrains trade and it allows States to fix prices. And it has far-\nreaching consequences for the entire Nation.\n  Who will pay for the generosity of these compact States to their \ndairy farmers?\n  Consumers in the compact region and dairy farmers throughout the \ncountry.\n  Since this bill has not been the subject of a single hearing in the \nSenate, and has never been marked up by the committee of jurisdiction, \nthe Judiciary Committee, in the 104th Congress, I think it is important \nthat we review what the compact actually does.\n  First, it allows six States to enter into to a compact to fix prices \nfor fluid milk at a level substantially higher than allowed under the \ncurrent Federal milk marketing order system.\n  It would also allow six additional States to enter the compact if \nthey wish, along with any States contiguous to those additional six \nStates. This is no small compact, Mr. President. If those additional \nStates are added--and how could Congress justify denying those States \nif we approve the initial six?--the compact area would comprise 20 \npercent of national milk production.\n  That is a significant level of production that would substantially \ndisrupt national milk markets and ultimately depress prices for all \ndairy producers in this country--except those in the compact.\n  Second, the compact would allow those States to set the price for \nfluid milk up to $17.40 per hundredweight--a full $1.35 above the \ncurrent minimum fluid milk price in that region established by Federal \norders. I would also caution my colleagues that the current fluid milk \nprice for the Northeast is at one of its highest levels in years. What \nthis means is that the $1.35 bonus for New England milk producers is \nlikely the smallest that bonus will be for the 5-year period of this \ncompact. That minimum bonus would translate into a minimum consumer-\nfunded payment of $4,000 for a farmer with a 50-cow herd.\n  Also keep in mind that the minimum price in the compact States is \nallowed to be adjusted by inflation using 1990 as a base year. By the \nyear 2000 the cap on fluid milk prices could be well over $20 if \ninflation increases by 3 percent per year.\n  That consumers will pay dearly for the privilege of supporting the \nNew England dairy industry is proven by the provision in this bill that \nrequires the compact States to reimburse the Women, Infants and \nChildren's Supplemental Food Program for the increased cost of milk \npurchased under the program. However, taxpayers would not be reimbursed \nfor the higher costs of mandatory nutrition programs such as national \nschool lunch and breakfast programs, food stamps, and others.\n  For a Congress so fervently promoting tax breaks for Americans, I am \nsurprised to see this tax on consumers so heartily embraced by the \ncompact supporters and the supporters of the Leahy substitute which \ncontains the compact.\n  I am sure the many consumers in the compact region would like a \ntaxbreak of $4,000 or more each year. Instead they will receive a tax \nincrease through their purchases of milk.\n  I also urge my colleagues to keep in mind, that while in-region milk \nproducers get to vote on whether or not they want the higher price for \nthe compact milk, consumers are afforded no such voice. Mr. President, \nI ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the New York Times, \nentitled ``Milking Consumers,'' be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the New York Times, Saturday, July 22, 1995]\n\n       New England senators and governors are pressuring Bob Dole, \n     the Senate majority leader, to submit a pernicious bill to a \n     hasty vote before it clears committee.\n       The bill creates a compact among Maine, Vermont, New \n     Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts to \n     raise milk prices above Federal levels. By some estimates, \n     the cost of a gallon of milk would rise from about $2.50 to \n     between $2.85 and $3.\n       Over all, the price increase would pump perhaps $500 \n     million a year into the bank accounts of New England dairy \n     farmers. But it would needlessly pummel poor parents by \n     forcing them to spend up to 20 percent more to buy milk.\n       Besides discouraging milk drinking, the compact sets an \n     ugly precedent. New England cannot enforce artifically high \n     prices unless it keeps milk produced outside New England from \n     flowing into the region. That is why the bill imposes what \n     amounts to a protective tariff on ``imported'' milk.\n       The compact would in effect create a barrier to interstate \n     commerce, sharing our milk produced in the Middle West the \n     way the United States threatened to shut out luxury cars from \n     Japan. The precedent so set would be ill advised, if not \n     unconstitutional. What might be next? An oil compact in the \n     Southwest? A wheat compact in the Midwest?\n       Mr. Dole ought to reject a quick vote on the dairy compact \n     because it raises unexplored constitutional issues. Senators \n     ought to reject the compact because it needlessly harms \n     children. Mark Goldman, president of a New Jersey milk \n     processor, poses the right question. Who believes that the \n     voters of New England if forthrightly asked, would approve \n     paying an additional 56 cents for a gallon of milk for the \n     privilege of fattening the bank accounts of a few nearby \n     farmers?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The New York Times editorial states:\n\n       The price increase [provided in the Compact] would pump \n     perhaps $50 million a year into the bank accounts of New \n     England dairy farmers. But it would needlessly pummel poor \n     parents by forcing them to spend up to 20 percent more to buy \n     milk.\n\n  The editorial provides some good advice to Senators who will soon \nvote on this measure--Senators ought to reject the compact because it \nneedlessly harms children. I think that is pretty good advice, Mr. \nPresident.\n  In addition to the ill effects on consumers, the compact erects \nbarriers to \n\n[[Page S1007]]\nkeep milk from other States from flowing into the compact region. The \nCompact requires that lower cost milk produced in surrounding States \nmust receive the higher compact price, through compensatory payments, \neven if producers in those other States can provide that milk at a \nlower cost to buyers. When you include transportation costs, any buyer \nof milk in the compact region would be foolish to acquire milk from \noutside the compact region. Any unwise buyer who did so would soon be \nput out of business by their competitors.\n  That producers from noncompact States are free to sell into the \ncompact region, as the supporters claim, is accurate. However, there \nwould be no demand for that milk because of the disincentives the \ncompact creates for its acquisition.\n  While compact supporters claim that any producer in the country will \nbe able to benefit from this, it is illogical to conclude that is true. \nIf it were, the compact itself would be rendered ineffective because \nthe compact region would be flooded with less expensive milk from \nsurrounding States. Make no mistake, this compact is only supported by \nits sponsors because the walls it erects around the compact region are \nhigh and well-reinforced.\n  Third, while milk from outside the compact region is prevented from \nentering, milk processors in the compact region who must pay the higher \nprice for the raw product, may receive a subsidy to allow them to ship \ntheir products outside the compact region. The compact includes that \ntrade subsidy because those compact region processors will be required \nto pay so much for milk that their products would be uncompetitive in \nother parts of the country where milk producers do not receive \nartificially inflated prices.\n  For members who think the impacts of the compact are isolated to \ncompact States, I suggest they take a careful look at this provision. \nThe very export subsidies we have been trying to tear down in \ninternational trade through GATT and NAFTA will be imposed by the \ncompact region States to the disadvantage of milk processors and \nproducers in other States.\n  In summary, Mr. President, this compact provides authority for six \nStates--and potentially many more--to fix artificially high prices for \nmilk at the expense of consumers. It erects barriers to any noncompact \nmilk, and it subsidizes exports of compact region products.\n  I've talked about the impacts on consumers. But what of the impact on \ndairy farmers throughout the country?\n  The compact balkanizes the U.S. dairy industry by insulating the \nNortheast dairy industry from the market conditions that all other \nfarmers in this country must face. And, Mr. President, there are dairy \nfarmers in every State of this Nation that will be affected by this. \nThat is because there is a national market for milk, not a regional \none. A surplus in one region depresses prices for all farmers \nnationally, and a shortage in one region raises prices for all farmers. \nThat is why there is a national system for the marketing and pricing of \nmilk.\n  However, with this compact, when national prices that farmers receive \nfor milk plummet due to changing market conditions, the Northeast \ncompact States will be completely isolated from those price \nfluctuations. When dairy farmers in Texas or New Mexico or Florida are \nresponding to lower milk prices by reducing supply, the Northeast \nproducers will continue to over-produce milk despite the market \nsignals. And that, Mr. President, will exacerbate the excess supply \nsituation depressing prices nationwide.\n  Not only will the compact insulate Northeast producers from price \nshocks that all other farmers face, it will also have the effect of \ndriving down prices for dairy farmers in other parts of the country \neven if supply and demand are in balance.\n  It is a simple fact of economics that dairy farmers respond to higher \nprices with greater production. The exorbitant compact prices will \nsurely increase production in the Northeast and yet the compact \nprovides for no effective method of supply control. Those surpluses \nproduced in the Northeast will drive down prices for farmers \neverywhere.\n  In addition, without a market for that surplus milk in fluid form, it \nwill go into secondary milk markets. It will be manufactured into \ncheese and butter and powdered milk. Those products, generated by \nexcess production in the Northeast, will then compete on the national \nmarket alongside products produced in other States by producers \nreceiving far lower milk prices.\n  Not only will noncompact producers suffer from lower prices, but they \nwould also lose markets for their products.\n  Mr. President, not only does this compact fail to recognize the \nnational nature of milk markets, but it builds additional regional \nbiases into current law.\n  The compact exacerbates current inequities of the Federal milk \nmarketing order system that have discriminated against upper Midwest \ndairy producers for years. It is inherently market distorting and \nregionally discriminatory.\n  I want to just reiterate, the Senator from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, \nindicated we will have a opportunity later in the day to vote on \nsomething to help the Midwest. That is not clear at all, unless there \nis an agreement between the parties. We are trying very hard, but if \nthat is not achieved we will be ending up with current law in this \narea, so there is no real help for the rest of the country in that \nregard.\n  In addition, this compact will also have a significant impact on the \nentire U.S. dairy industry. It insulates New England dairy producers \nfrom the market.\n  Mr. President, I understand why the compact States want the consent \nof Congress for this compact. The Northeast is losing dairy farmers. \nBut, Mr. President, the decline in dairy farmer numbers is a national \ntrend and the pain is felt nationwide.\n  Today there are 27,000 dairy farmers in my home State of Wisconsin, \nmore than any other State in the Nation; 15 years ago, Mr. President, \nthere were 45,000. Mr. President, our average herd size in Wisconsin is \nsmall--55 cows. These are small farmers who have experienced the same \nproblems facing the Northeast--but far more acutely than any other \nregion of the country and more than any other individual State. My \nState of Wisconsin, which until 1993 was the No. 1 milk producing State \nin the country, suffers from the loss of over 1,000 dairy farmers per \nyear. We lose more farms per year than the current number of dairy \nfarmers in five of the six compact States.\n  A recent survey indicated that in the next 5 years 40 percent of our \nremaining farmers will go out of business. That is over 10,000 family \ndairy farmers.\n  This trend is mirrored in other States throughout the upper Midwest. \nWhile we recognize that there are many reasons for this decline, the \noverwhelming message I hear from family dairy farmers in Wisconsin, \nMinnesota, and throughout the Midwest is that we need reform of \noutdated Federal milk marketing orders which provide artificial \nadvantages to other regions of the country driving Wisconsin farmers \nout of business.\n  So I understand the desire of the Northeast to remedy their local and \nregional problems in their dairy industry, however further \nregionalizing dairy policy is not the answer. Congressional changes to \ndairy policy must recognize the national nature of milk marketing as \nwell as the comprehensive and interrelated nature of fluid and \nmanufactured milk products.\n  Wisconsin dairy farmers can no longer afford to help other regions at \ntheir own expense.\n  The supporters of this legislation have tried to present this as a \nvery simple idea--that of a simple interstate compact designed to help \nthe struggling producers of that region in isolation from national \nmarkets and having no unintended effects on non-compact producers.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to recognize that simply is not \nthe case. This compact is unprecedented and Members should not be \nsurprised that approval of this package will result in additional \nrequest to approve price fixing compacts.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the motion to strike the Northeast \nDairy Compact from the bill. It is not market oriented. It is the \nantithesis of market orientation and its inclusion in this bill is \ncompletely inconsistent with the rhetoric of this Congress including \nmany of the supporters of this compact.\n\n[[Page S1008]]\n\n  Providing congressional consent to this compact in a bill which \npurports to allow farmers to take their signals from the marketplace \nnot the Government would be the ultimate irony of this farm bill.\n  If we pass this compact today, I believe every Member will soon \nregret it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this motion to strike the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact from the farm bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Feingold, \nSenator Wellstone, Senator Grams, Senator Lautenberg, and Senator \nHatch, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this motion to strike \nthe Northeast Dairy Compact.\n  I would also like to point out the 65- to 35-vote that Senator \nJeffords and Senator Leahy referred to was a vote on a much broader \nreconciliation amendment that had other things in it beside the \nNortheast Dairy Compact, so that was not a clean vote. What we are \ngoing to have today on the Northeast Dairy Compact is a clean vote \nwithout any other considerations. I hope that will elicit a different \nand a more correct response than the vote that occurred heretofore.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 5 minutes and 50 \nseconds left.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment. The Northeast interstate dairy compact is the remarkable \nproduct of 7 years of formal, interstate cooperation in New England. It \nhas the bipartisan support of the region's six Governors--four \nRepublicans, one Democrat and one Independent. And it is backed by the \nregion's farmers, consumers, and milk processors alike.\n  Mr. President, we have spoken often this past year in this Chamber \nabout returning power back to our sovereign States, to allow the States \nto work together with the Federal Government to solve the problems we \nface. Here is a fine example of such a cooperative federalism, most \nappropriately presented in the context of this farm bill.\n  The compact is a pilot project, with a 5-year sunset. It simply needs \ncongressional consent to be approved. I urge this body to give the New \nEngland States an opportunity to implement this test program.\n  Mr. President, the compact has had an impressive journey through the \nsix New England State legislatures. In fact, it has passed with \noverwhelming margins in both producing and consuming States. The Rhode \nIsland State Legislature, representing over 1 million consumers and \nonly 31 dairy farms voted near unanimously to pass the compact.\n  Some of my colleagues have been misinformed about what the compact \nwould or would not do. Not surprisingly, the dairy processors' lobby \nhave been promoting misguided information on how the compact will work. \nThey have a long history of working against legislation that protects \nand improves dairy farmer income.\n  However, the compact, which has been approved overwhelming in each of \nthe six New England State legislatures is not the monster that a select \nfew have made it out to be.\n\n  The Northeast dairy compact is intended to help give farmers and \nconsumers fair and stable milk prices. The compact has been carefully \ncrafted so that it will not affect the national diary industry or \nburden the consumer. The compact can only regulate class I milk in New \nEngland, that is beverage or fluid milk, which makes up only 1.5 \npercent of the national milk supply. We are dealing with a very small \namount of fluid milk. National processors will not be affected by this \ncompact. It will have no affect on class II of class III milk which is \nused for manufactured products.\n  Mr. President, my own State of Vermont has lost over 1,200 farms in \nthe last 10 years. Today, Vermont dairy farmers are receiving milk \nprices well below the cost of production. Current milk prices for \nfarmers are as low as they were over 10 years ago.\n  I understand that Vermont is not the only State to witness a decline \nin its number of dairy farms. Dairy farms throughout the country \ndeserve price stability and enhancement and I hope that a dairy \ncompromise amendment will be offered and accepted today that will \nbenefit farms across this Nation.\n  Mr. President, New England is not asking Washington to solve its \nproblem, it is asking Washington to allow New England to solve its \nproblem on its own. The compact is a regional solution to a regional \nproblem. The six New England States should not be denied the \nopportunity to do just that.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment \nand allow the people of Vermont and New England the opportunity to help \nthemselves protect the future of their dairy farms.\n  Mr. President, let me remind everyone again, you have been reminded, \nyou voted for this and I think you ought to keep that in mind. You \nvoted for it in a very similar situation. It was a bigger bill, yes, \nbut it was the same issue exactly.\n  The New England States have taken 7 years to examine what they can do \nto help the dairy farmers. I have here, and I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record, a letter from the six New England Governors \nto the leader here, telling him that they support this bill, together \nwith some other material. It is very important.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                       New England\n\n\n                                  Governors' Conference, Inc.,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, July 17, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: We, the Governors of the New England \n     States, have learned that you will soon consider the \n     Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, SJR 28, on the Senate \n     Floor. We would like to take this opportunity to thank you \n     for agreeing to take this critical, procedural step on behalf \n     of the Compact, and to reaffirm our strong support of its \n     passage.\n       Enclosed, you will find the New England Governor's \n     Conference resolution which was adopted in support of \n     Congressional approval of the Compact. The resolution details \n     the significance of the Compact to our region with regard to \n     its specific importance to both New England dairy farmers and \n     consumers, and, equally, as a model of formal, interstate \n     cooperation.\n       Thank you again for agreeing to move the Compact forward. \n     We are hopeful that, when it comes to the Floor, you will \n     consider its importance to our region.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Stephen Merrill,\n                                Governor, New Hampshire, Chairman.\n     William F.

Also, I have letters from the Governors to all of us \nwith respect to that. We have brought this over here. We have explained \nit to staffs and they agreed with us, 65 to 35. I wanted you to keep \nthat in mind.\n  Second, we are a negative producer. What are they afraid of? We only \nproduce 70 percent of the milk consumed in New England. We are not a \nthreat to anybody. Mr. President, 30 percent of our milk comes from New \nYork and Pennsylvania. It can come from Wisconsin. It can come from \nMinnesota. We are not creating any barriers to anybody.\n  We say our consumers are so desirous of making sure that our farmers \nare there--they love the cows on the hillsides. That is New England. It \nis tradition.\n  All we are asking is to be treated as any other big State can be. New \nYork has an order that helps protect their producers, California does, \nother States do. Why can we not, as six little States up in New England \ntucked off up in the corner there, have the ability to protect our \ndairy farms?\n  I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, obviously I agree completely with my \ncolleague from Vermont on this. The point is, this goes beyond \nquestions even of romanticism or anything else. It is not romanticism \nwhen we talk about the hard work of the dairy farmers. This is one of \nthe most difficult jobs in America today.\n  They have also, though, created even more problems for themselves \nbecause they are the most efficient producers in America today. Their \nefficiency and their hard work is not being rewarded. It tends to be \npunished, with the system we have.\n  What we are saying is at least allow us, consumers and producers \nalike in New England, to set our own destiny. It is the only fair \nthing. This is not a case where it is farmers against consumers, as \nthough the two are different; or consumers against farmers. This is a \ncase where producers and users come together to make it work.\n  I hope we defeat the effort to strike the New England Dairy Compact. \nIt has been put together by Republicans and Democrats alike. This \nSenate ought to approve it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we have spoken often in the past year, \nin this Chamber, about returning power back to the sovereign States to \nallow the States to work together with the Federal Government to solve \nthe problems we face. Here is a fine example of such cooperative \nfederalism.\n  Most appropriately presented in the context of this farm bill here, \nthe compact is a pilot project with a 5-year sunset. It simply needs \ncongressional consent to be approved. Other States can do it by \nthemselves. They are big enough. We cannot.\n\n  I urge this body to give the New England States an opportunity to \nimplement this test program. The compact has had an impressive journey \nthrough six New England State legislatures --six State legislatures. \nTwo of them, primarily consumers have approved so they can help keep \ntheir dairy farmers and the rural life of Vermont alive. The Rhode \nIsland State Legislature, representing over 1 million consumers and \nonly 31 dairy farms, nearly unanimously passed this. Why should we be \nprohibited from doing what other States can do, merely because the \nMidwest believes and hopes that sometime in the future they can ship \ntheir milk to us because the price would get so high, because our \nfarmers are out of business, that they could ship it over there to \nprofit?\n  They are welcome now. Why do they want to be so greedy?\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 1 minute and 25 \nseconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to add that Senator Pressler is \ncosponsor of this amendment. He was an original sponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like, in closing, to remind Senators \nthat if we allow this kind of a price-fixing scheme to make its way \nthrough the Congress, then there will be no way to prevent in a logical \nway any other group of States setting up similar price-fixing \nmechanisms under the same justification, not only in dairy but in any \nother industry. That is not what we intend to do in this country. We \nneed a national market for our products in this country.\n  So every Senator is affected by what will occur if we allow the \nNortheast Dairy Compact to make its way through Congress. It is for \nthat reason--and the other reasons that we have discussed--that I urge \nmy colleagues to reject the Northeast Dairy Compact.\n  I thank you.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as we bring this to a close, I know \neveryone is interested in saving their dairy farms. The question is \nwhether you try to do it at the expense of some other dairy farmer. \nVermont has lost one-third of its farms in the last 10 years. I know \nthe Midwest has done likewise. But they are not hurt by us. As pointed \nout, they can ship to us now. They can ship at a higher price if this \ngoes through. But they cannot do it; they are too far away. That is our \nproblem. We are too far away from anything. We are at the end of the \nenergy stream. We are at the end of everything. We are tucked up in \nthat little corner barricaded from markets in Canada. We could get 50 \npercent more for our milk if we could go across the border. We want to \nstay alive, and our States and our State legislators want us to stay \nalive. When you get six States to approve something that helps the \nfarmers primarily in two States, you have got to really believe that \nthey are sincere in their efforts to try to do what is best for their \nState.\n  Mr. President, I urge a ``no'' vote on this motion to strike. By a \nvote of 65 to 35 the Senate voted against what they are being asked to \ndo today. I hope they will recognize that and keep the same wonderful \nlogic that they used for those 65 votes.\n  I yield to the Senator from Vermont for a final comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have already been ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Kohl amendment be \ntemporarily set aside with the vote to occur on or in relation to the \namendment and the time to be set by the majority leader after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader. I also ask unanimous consent \nthat if there are stacked votes, the votes occur in the order they were \noffered.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, for the benefit and information of all \nMembers, the agreement calls for several amendments in sequence. To the \nbest \n\n[[Page S1010]]\nof our ability, we will shift back from one party to the other, \nalthough the agreement reached last evening was that if there are not \nMembers present from the opposite party, we would feel free to move to \nwhoever had an amendment. There are 10 amendments offered on the \nDemocratic side and five on the Republican side if the maximum were to \nbe offered.\n  Next in sequence we are anticipating the amendment by the \ndistinguished Senator from Colorado, who is in fact present. He will \ncontrol the time on our side on that amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Indiana yield for \nanother housekeeping observation?\n  I urge Senators who may have amendments, or issues, if they can to \ncome and talk with the distinguished Senator from Indiana and myself to \nsee if maybe not all amendments necessarily need a vote. If it is \npossible for us to come together on something, now is the time to do \nit.\n  The other thing is that I hope when we stack the votes-- and I \nbelieve it is the intention of the leaders to do this at that time--\nthat after the first vote there would be a shortened time for \nsubsequent votes. But I urge the cooperation of Senators, certainly on \nmy side of the aisle, and I am sure the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana feels that way about his side of the aisle we as we move \nforward on these issues.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I concur in all the distinguished Senator \nhas said.\n  Let me also mention that one reason for having votes late in the \nmorning is literally to clear the trail--it is the intent of the \nleadership to complete action on this bill at 4:45--so that everyone \nhas been heard, and votes occurring may in fact be stacked votes later \nin the morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3443 to Amendment No. 3184\n\n(Purpose: To direct the Secretary of Agriculture to ensure that private \n    property rights, including water rights, will be recognized and \n    protected in the course of special use permitting decisions for \n                   existing water supply facilities)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3443 to amendment No. 3184.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . CLARIFICATION OF EFFECT OF RESOURCE PLANNING ON \n                   ALLOCATION OR USE OF WATER.\n\n       (a) National Forest System Resource Planning.--Section 6 of \n     the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of \n     1974 (16 U.S.C. 1604) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(n) Limitation on Authority.--Nothing in this section \n     shall be construed to supersede, abrogate or otherwise impair \n     any right or authority of a State to allocate quantities of \n     water (including boundary waters).

No water rights arise in the United States or any \n     other person under the provisions of this Act.''\n       (b) Land Use Planning Under Bureau of Land Management \n     Authorities.--Section 202 of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1712) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(g) Limitation of Authority.--Nothing in this section \n     shall be construed to supersede, abrogate, or otherwise \n     impair any right or authority of a State to allocate \n     quantities of water (including boundary waters).

Mr. President, both sides have a copy of this amendment. \nIt simply is a clarification of an action that the Senate had taken \nearlier in the year. That action was taken on an appropriations bill. \nAs I am sure Members will appreciate, the members of the Appropriations \nCommittee are reluctant to legislate on an appropriations bill. The \nform it took was a restriction in spending of funds by the Secretary of \nAgriculture.\n  Mr. President, to be brief, the situation arises out of a rather \ndifficult circumstance that involved what I believe is a maverick \nregional forester. The situation is this: Colorado has about 37 percent \nof its State owned by the Federal Government. It is literally very \ndifficult, or impossible in some areas, to transfer water from the \nmountain areas where it is accumulated from the snow melt and the \nreservoirs to the cities for drinking water without crossing Federal \nground. There are a few areas where it is possible to get drinking to \nthe cities and deliver drinking water and agricultural water without \ncrossing Federal ground, but very few.\n  To cross Federal ground, what has traditionally been the case is \npermits have been offered by the Federal Government. As the Senate is \nwell aware, when someone applies for a new permit, an extensive review \ntakes place. That is to ensure that it meets the environmental \nstandards of the Forest Service. What is happening in Colorado is an \nentirely new event which has begun to take place, and in other places \naround the country. That is, when these permits to cross Federal ground \ncame up for renewal, the Forest Service has demanded that the cities \nforfeit a third of their drinking water for them to be allowed to renew \ntheir permit to cross Federal ground.\n  No provision for forfeiting water is included in the statutes. One \nwould certainly understand if these were new permissions, but they are \nnot. They are existing permits. In a number of cases, the permits \npreexisted the existence of the Forest Service. Some had literally been \nin existence for well over 100 years. They are the absolute lifeblood \nof the State. I may say this practice appears to do be followed by a \nnumber of other foresters around the country as they look at it and \nbegin to apply this same consent to other States.\n  Literally what happened is the Forest Service wanted to extort--I use \nthat word advisedly because it is a strong word, but I think it fits--\nwater from the cities as a condition to renew an existing permit. Let \nme emphasize that nothing was changed. If something was different, if \nthere was an expansion of the permit or a change in the use of the \npermit, one would understand action by the Forest Service. But these \nwere circumstances where the city wanted to specifically use its \ndrinking water the way it had for over 100 years. The Forest Service \nused the event of renewing the permit to demand a forfeiture of the \nwater. No statute gives them that authority, but when they have the \nability to stop the \n\n[[Page S1011]]\nrenewal of the permit, they have enormous leverage.\n  Our cities and our water districts spent literally millions of \ndollars. One of the most environmentally conscious communities, I \nbelieve, in the Nation--Boulder, CO--had attorney's fees that exceeded \nmillions of dollars just in that one city's case alone. What happened \nis some of the small cities that could not afford the attorney's fees \nforfeited a third of their water, or a portion of their water \nrights. Others, through negotiation, forfeited less. Others fought it \nthrough court and continue with longstanding studies and expensive \nattorneys' fees to negotiate the process out.\n\n  All this amendment does is exactly what was done earlier in the year \nthrough the appropriations process. It simply says when you have an \nexisting permit, where you are not changing it, that they cannot \nrequire you to forfeit your water rights. It stops extortion in effect.\n  I do not know of any opposition. The amendment, when it came up on \nthe appropriations bill, enjoyed strong bipartisan support. It was \nadopted by the House conferees on the Appropriations Committee.\n  Let me emphasize, it is important because the cities continue to \nspend millions of dollars in attorneys' fees. To change the rules after \nthe project is built, after the drinking water is delivered, is wrong. \nIt is not simply bad policy, but it is wrong in terms of a moral \nstandard. To change the rules of the game after you have set up your \nwater system, spent millions of dollars, and you have thousands of \npeople dependent on it for drinking supplies is a travesty.\n  This sets forth in the statute clear guidelines so that you cannot \nretroactively repeal someone's water rights or extort water. It does \nnot, let me emphasize, apply to new projects. Everyone should \nunderstand that the Forest Service has an appropriate job in renewing \nnew applications, but it is a very important item to be included in \nthis measure and a very important protection for cities, municipalities \nand farmers around the Nation.\n  I do not know of opposition. I will be happy to answer questions from \nother Members, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is available to any who might \nspeak in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I reserve that time.\n  I should say that I do have a concern. This came up quite late last \nnight, and I have just had a chance to start looking at it. I am \nconcerned that the amendment would change permanent Forest Service law \nand does so without the normal hearings and debate or committee \nconsideration. We have done this before. The Senate one other time \nchanged Forest Service law on an ad hoc basis, and I think many of us \nrued the day for that. The so-called salvage rider was done on an ad \nhoc basis. It was done to address dead and dying trees. In fact, the \nmeasure instead suspended laws in Oregon and Washington and forced the \nForest Service to cut live, green, ancient forest.\n\n  What I worry about is under the constricted and contracted situation \nin which we find ourselves we might do something similar.\n  The Senator has held a dozen hearings this year on Forest Service law \nfocusing especially on conflicts within the existing law, but this \nissue has not received significant attention in this logical forum \ndespite representation on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  I worry when we tell the Forest Service that they have to mandate for \nmultiple use, which we have. That is a law passed long before any of us \nwere in the Senate. That means the Forest Service has to manage for \nanglers, boaters, fisheries, wildlife, recreation, skiing, and a dozen \nother uses. They have to do that by law. Now we have this amendment \nthough that says a single use gets preference but yet the multiple use \nlaw which has been there for 35 years still stands.\n  If we have a problem here, let us find a better way of doing it. I \nthink it can be solved administratively. The Department of Agriculture \nspent a lot of time, I am told, on this issue. I am informed that all \nthe parties involved have been invited to participate and that the \nrelevant parties have agreed to a settlement. If that is the case, I \nthink we should follow that procedure, not venture into unknown \nterritory with a sweeping amendment to laws that have been on the books \nfor decades.\n  The Forest Service was established to serve the many interests of all \nAmericans. This amendment says that is fine, they can serve all \nAmericans except that one becomes more equal than the other, water \nuses. And the idea of multiple use goes out the window.\n  So between now and the time of the vote I would be happy to talk with \nthe proponent of the amendment, but, frankly, at this point I would \nhave to oppose it because I believe it steps into a major area of law \nand does it in a way that could have unforeseen and difficult results.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, if I could respond to the Senator from \nVermont, I appreciate his remarks, and I think he is right to be \nconcerned that we take a thorough look at these amendments as they come \nup.\n  Let me say that this was not only the action as a result of debate, \nextensive debate in the Chamber on an amendment to the appropriations \nbill earlier this year, but it was the very subject on which a high \nranking member official of the Department of Agriculture had \nmisrepresented the facts to Congress. It was extensively debated during \nthat debate last year.\n\n  I might say this has gone on for several years, and the \nadministrative response, of course, is the first thing you would think \nof and the most natural, and I might say when this first happened, let \nme spell out if I could what happened.\n  When I first heard about this, I learned that Boulder, which has had \nreservoirs in the mountains and used them for drinking water for well \nover 100 years, had been denied the reissuance of the permit even \nthough they intended to use it exactly the same way they had always \nused it, and they had demanded from them a third of their water rights.\n  When I heard that and I found it applied to other cities, I went to \nthe Secretary of Agriculture, who was at that time Secretary Madigan.\n  So I might say to the Senator from Vermont I did follow the \nadministrative route on this. I did talk to Secretary Madigan. He \nissued a specific directive ordering them to issue the permit. \nSecretary Madigan gave out a special directive, signed by the \nSecretary, directing the regional forester to issue the permit. The \nregional forester received that directive and did not follow it--\nignored it--until Secretary Madigan had left office. It was at that \ntime that the administration indicated to us that policy was still in \neffect and they intended to eventually issue the permits.\n  So we have followed the administrative route.\n  Now, what happened was a high ranking official from the Department of \nAgriculture testified that this was still the policy, testified under \noath before Congress that this was still the policy, and it was not. \nThey had repealed it secretly. So this has had extensive debate and \nextensive review.\n  I have to tell the Senator in the strongest words I know I cannot sit \nback and have my cities lose their direct drinking water on a permit \nthat is over 100 years old when they do not intend to change it.\n  Now, that is not reasonable. I do not intend to change existing law \none single bit, not one bit. The McCarran law discusses specifically \nthe primacy of State with regard to water allocation and water rights. \nBut let me assure the Senator and the Members of the Senate this in no \nway mandates multiple use--no way.\n  This is a restatement of the McCarran law as it applies to permits. I \nwant to indicate to the distinguished Senator from Vermont, I would be \nhappy to work with him on this amendment. If he has suggestions for it, \nI would be happy to look at those and review them. I would be happy to \nwork with him in any way I can. But one thing I cannot do--and I cannot \nbelieve any Member of the Senate could do--is \n\n[[Page S1012]]\nstand idly by and watch their cities lose their drinking water. That \ndoes not make good sense. That is what is involved. The millions and \nmillions of dollars our taxpayers have had to pay in attorneys fees to \nget an existing permit renewed without any change is outrageous.\n  So I make that offer to the Senator. I hope very much that if there \nare improvements or suggestions he has for me, he would bring them \nforth. But I hope he would join me in supporting this measure.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Idaho at this point.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before the Senator does that, would the \nSenator yield to me on my time for just a response?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, obviously my concern is, as I stated, that \nI do not want to see a major change in the multiple-use Forest Service \nlaw on an amendment within a forum of this nature. I would also say to \nthe Senator from Colorado, this is a matter that I first heard of I \nthink about 11:30 last night. I know he is aware of that. I think most \nof us heard of this amendment at about 11:30 last night.\n  As you know, I have been fairly active in the negotiations on the \nbill. This was not the first item that I was looking at. It is going to \nbe some time before we actually have a vote. It will be after 11 \no'clock, in any event. Between now and then, I will meet with the \nSenator from Colorado. We will discuss it further.\n  Mr. BROWN. I appreciate very much the Senator's willingness to review \nthis.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado for \nyielding.\n  If I could have the attention of the ranking member of the committee, \nthe Senator from Vermont. I would like to express to him that I have \nbeen involved with the Senator from Colorado for well over 2 years as \nhe fought this battle, and chairing the subcommittee that deals with \nforestry, we have taken a close look at the amendment and the problems \ninvolved.\n  What has happened in the West historically--and I think the Senator \nfrom Vermont appreciates this--while the watersheds, largely the head \nwaters, were owned or retained by the Federal Government, the right of \nwater acquisition and water management and control was given to the \nStates. And, of course, municipalities and irrigation districts went \ninto those head waters and developed facilities under the permits of \nthe Forest Service and the McCarran Act. That established the water \nsystems of the West.\n\n  In many situations we find Federal agencies, for whatever reasons, \nsaying, ``To get reissuance of your permits, you have to give us some \nof the water.'' Instead of going in and filing for water like every \nother citizen has the responsibility to do to acquire a water right, \nthey are extorting, as the Senator from Colorado said, by arguing that \nyou cannot continue--we will not renew your permit or you cannot gain \nthis right-of-way or continued access unless you do this. And in almost \nall instances, it gives up some of the water, even though that is not \nthe responsibility of the Federal Government in the West, and \nhistorically it has never been.\n  I know that is an issue that is being fought by many, but it is an \nissue that Western States will simply not give up, nor should they. \nThey must retain primacy on water.\n  While I have found, in all instances, cities and irrigation districts \nand others willing to comply in the modernization and in the safety \ncodes of their facilities, this is not an issue about safety, it is not \nan issue about the environment; it is an issue about water, power, the \npower of holding the water or controlling it.\n  So what the Senator from Colorado is doing, in my opinion, is exactly \nright. It is a reinstatement, not an expansion, of law, a reinstatement \nof the existing law and the way it has operated and provided the \nmunicipalities of the West, provided the irrigation districts that have \nallowed the arid West to flourish, the kind of position and control in \nthe water that we think is critically necessary.\n  I strongly support my colleague and hope that the Senate will concur \nwith him in this amendment. And I hope, Mr. President, that if at all \npossible, we could work this out and take this amendment. I think it \nfits very nicely into existing law.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask Members of the Chamber to think how \nthey would feel if they represented California and the Federal \nGovernment said that the drinking supply crosses the Federal highway \nand goes into San Francisco, and we are going to cut off the water for \nSan Francisco. I do not think any reasonable person in this Chamber \nwould think that made sense.\n  How would they feel if they represented New York City and the Federal \nGovernment said, ``Your water line crosses over a Federal property and \nnaval base that the Federal Government owns, and as a condition of \nbeing able to continue to cross that ground, we are going to take a \nthird of your drinking water''? I do not think there is a Member of \nthis Chamber who would think that made sense.\n  That is literally what we face here. We face a bureaucrat at the \nregional forestry level that has made up their own law and provided \nconditions that the statute does not call for. The only way we can deal \nwith it is to make this very clear that this clarifies existing law. It \ndoes not change it.\n  Mr. President, it is essential that we do this. Without it, our \ncities face literally millions of dollars of attorneys' fees, long, \ndragged-out court cases. What we see is a real danger to solid, \nreliable municipal planning.\n  I want to assure the distinguished Senator from Vermont I want to \nwork with him, and I will be happy to do that between now and the time \nthe votes come up later this morning.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am authorized by the distinguished Senator from Vermont \nto yield back all time on his side of the amendment.\n  Is there further debate by the distinguished Senator from Colorado?\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the distinguished chairman. I have no other \nrequests for time. I believe that the Senator from Vermont indicated \nthat at the appropriate point he was going to yield back.\n  Mr. LUGAR. He has indeed. I am prepared to do that.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back on the \namendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Brown \namendment be temporarily set aside, with a vote to occur on or in \nrelation to the amendment at a time set by the majority leader after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader. For a matter of information, \nthat would come after the Kohl amendment that we considered earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3444 To Amendment No. 3184\n\n                    (Purpose: To improve the bill.)\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3444 to amendment No. 3184.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield to myself such time as I may \nrequire on this amendment.\n  I rise to offer an amendment to the Agriculture Reform and \nImprovement Act of 1996. In July 1995, the Agriculture Committee gave \npreliminary, but unanimous, approval to four titles of the farm bill. \nThey covered farm credit, trade, rural development, and \n\n[[Page S1013]]\nresearch. Since then, there has been further bipartisan work on a \nmiscellaneous title and an agriculture promotion title. I present the \nfruits of those labors to the Chamber today.\n  The Government's role in agricultural lending is substantial. This \namendment provides direction to USDA to focus on helping beginning \nfarmers and ranchers to get started and progress in farming and \nranching. The amendment emphasizes that the USDA's assistance is \ntemporary, and, most importantly, it modifies or ends a variety of \nrisky farm loan policies which the committee considered during hearings \nthis year.\n  The amendment will expand and maintain our presence in overseas \nmarkets for high-value and bulk commodities. It establishes measurable \nbenchmarks to evaluate U.S. export performance programs, including \ndollar value and market share growth goals. In addition, increased \nflexibility in the operation of export credit programs will allow us to \nseize future opportunities.\n  We know that all leadership is local. Rural businesses and \ncommunities cannot sustain themselves without first taking a hard look \nat the human capital and resources at their disposal.\n  This amendment provides for a new rural program delivery mechanism \nthat depends on local and State leadership and consolidates over a \ndozen duplicate programs.\n  The amendment also address the vital role that agricultural research, \nextension, and education play in ensuring a productive, efficient and \ncompetitive agricultural sector in our Nation. Research is the \nfoundation for agriculture's future success.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment which will bring \nagricultural policy into the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, this amendment also contains a number of miscellaneous \nprovisions supported by various Senators. We are not aware that these \nare controversial. Among them are provisions to set oilseed loan rates \naccording to a market-based formula, proposed by Senator Moseley-Braun; \nto provide equitable treatment for beginning farmers under the \nAgricultural Market Transition Program, proposed by Senator Pressler; \nand numerous other amendments. I ask unanimous consent that a \ndescription of these provisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The Lugar amendment will:\n       1. Correct a typographical error in the Leahy substitute.\n       2. Establish oilseed loan rates under a formula similar to \n     that used for wheat and feed grains, at 85% of a five-year \n     olympic average of market prices within a range of $4.92 to \n     $5.26.\n       3. Make a technical change to haying and grazing rules that \n     will allow current practices to continue with respect to \n     grazing on wheat stubble.\n       4. Make three changes in the peanut provisions of the Leahy \n     substitute: (1) Allow producer gains from the sale of \n     additional peanuts to be used to offset quota pool losses; \n     (2) reduce the quota loan rate 5% for producers that refuse a \n     bona fide offer from a handler at the quota loan rate and \n     instead opt to place their peanuts under loan; and (3) \n     prohibit government entities and out-of-state non-farmers \n     from holding quota.\n       5. Make a technical change to ensure the continuation of \n     current treatment for fruit and vegetable crops double-\n     cropped on contract acres.\n       6. Include titles of the farm bill earlier agreed to by the \n     Agriculture Committee, including provisions on trade, \n     research, credit, rural development, promotion and \n     miscellaneous items.\n       7. Restore a previously-stricken authorization for ethanol \n     research.\n       8. Allow 20% of available funding from commodity purchases \n     in the Commodity Supplemental Food Program to be permanently \n     carried over for administrative purposes.\n       9. Authorize a Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program to \n     promote implementation of various management practices to \n     improve habitat, utilizing $10 million in Conservation \n     Reserve Program funding, and make other changes to \n     conservation programs.\n       10. Make technical changes in Leahy substitute language \n     authorizing land purchases in the Florida Everglades.\n       11. Clarify disqualification of food stores when knowingly \n     employing Food Stamp traffickers.\n       12. Reauthorize an existing fluid milk promotion program.\n       13. Provide a specific authorization for the existing \n     Foreign Market Development Cooperator program.\n       14. Allow USDA to make adjustments in contract acres (for \n     purposes of the Agricultural Market Transition Program) if \n     necessary to provide equitable treatment for beginning \n     farmers.\n       15. Clarify definition of ``statewide'' coverage under the \n     USDA's Television Broadcasting Demonstration Grant program.\n       16. Authorize grants for water and wastewater systems in \n     rural and native villages in Alaska.\n       17. Provide for a reduced application process for the \n     Indian Reservation Extension Agent program and for equitable \n     participation in USDA programs by tribally-controlled \n     colleges.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I know of no opposition to these \nprovisions. As the Chair may interpret correctly, this is an attempt to \nprovide in this bill amendments that have been offered by many Senators \nthat have been cleared on both sides of the aisle. I will yield to any \nSenator who may have comments.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for yielding. I thank the chairman \npublicly for the work he has done on behalf of farm legislation this \nyear, the extensive hearings on almost all of the titles of the farm \nbill, working them out in a very intricate way, under some very \ndifficult circumstances--circumstances from a Budget Committee that \nsaid to the chairman and to the Agriculture Committee that we had to \nfind substantial savings in agricultural appropriations.\n  I say that, Mr. President, in light of what we have done since 1986. \nSince 1986, direct payment to production agriculture in this country \nfrom Government programs has been reduced by this Congress by 60 \npercent. So we have continually, over the period of now a decade, \nprogressively reduced the amount of money on a program-by-program basis \nthat was going to production agriculture for one reason or another. In \nalmost all instances, I have agreed with that and voted for it. I think \nagriculture today is stronger because of it, because they have \nprogressively moved to farm to the market instead of to the program. \nThat is part of the debate today and part of the consideration in the \nfarm legislation we have before us.\n  But my point is that it made it increasingly difficult for the \nchairman, myself, and other members of the Agriculture Committee to \ndeal with the important issues of the day. But, I must tell you, I \nthink we accomplished that. Not only did we accomplish that, but I have \nworked in cooperation with the chairman, the committee, and committee \nstaff in developing what I think is an excellent bill.\n  Now, the en bloc amendment the Senator has just introduced is a very \npositive approach in many areas. It looks at foreign market development \nin a line-item authorization. We all know that, because of the \ntremendous efficiencies of American agriculture today, if we are going \nto hold those prices in the marketplace, we have to move a lot of that \nproduction to the world market. The chairman is tremendously sensitive \nto that, and these amendments reflect that.\n\n  I have worked for some time to strengthen the ability of alternative \ncrops in the region of the Pacific Northwest and in the State of Idaho \nand in surrounding States. One of those alternative crops is an oilseed \ncrop known as canola. Many in agriculture are familiar with it. It is a \nnew crop for our region. I have worked with that industry to provide a \ncheckoff, much like the dairy industry has, the beef industry has, and \nother industries have, so that they can use their own money to promote \ntheir own programs, to promote their sales internationally, to do \nresearch for the development of a better crop and better alternatives \nor varieties. That is included in this en bloc amendment, along with an \nimportant amendment for the sheep industry's improvement center. We \nknow that the domestic sheep industry today is struggling to stay \nalive. They need to look at alternative methods for marketing and \ngeneral improvement of the livestock of that industry. That has been a \nconsideration by the chairman, and I greatly appreciate that.\n  I hope the Senate can agree on this en bloc amendment. I think it \ncomplements the legislation that is before us today, rounds it out into \nwhat is a positive farm bill, I think, for American agriculture. I \nthank the chairman very much for the work he has done in this area and \nthe cooperation he has offered us. \n\n[[Page S1014]]\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Is it appropriate to make comments, I ask the \ndistinguished chairman?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I respond to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana that \nwe are discussing the Lugar amendment, and as in each of these \namendments, there is 15 minutes to each side. I control the time on our \nside. It is certainly appropriate if the Senator wishes to use the \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nLouisiana. There are 7 minutes remaining on your side.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Lugar amendment is pending.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will just be brief in my comments. I guess time is \nrunning, so if no other Democrat is here, I will make comments.\n  Mr. President and Members and, really, indeed, everyone who is \nconcerned about the farm situation in this country must be wondering \nwhether the Congress will have the ability to get the job done. Here we \nare in February, and people in the Deep South, and Louisiana in \nparticular, my farmers, are wondering what is going to happen this \nyear. They have their implements being prepared, the combines, the \ntractors, the irrigation systems they are concerned about putting into \nplace, and they are wondering while they are working on the equipment \nwhat in the world is the program they will operate under for 1996.\n  I think it is extremely important that the Congress move \nexpeditiously on this legislation. We should have done it last year. I \nhave been in Congress for 20 some-odd years, almost 24 now, and we have \nalways had farm bills done the year before. Generally, farmers had to \nbe in the field deciding what to do.\n  I think we are late. Farmers cannot be late in their planning. \nCongress should not be late in tending to our business, the business of \npassing a farm bill of substance.\n  I hope we can conclude action today. There will be a number of \namendments and I think some may improve the legislation; some, I think, \nmay do damage to the legislation. It is so critically important that we \nget a bill in place so that the farmers in this country could know what \nto do, when to do it, and under what economic terms and conditions they \nare going to have to operate.\n  I think it would be insane for Members of the Senate to leave \nWashington, DC, to take a vacation back in our respective States or \nanywhere else while this pending business is not completed. I think it \nwould be a very serious mistake. We should stay here, get the job done, \nbefore we think about moving any further down the line.\n\n  My final comment, Mr. President, this morning I think there is going \nto be an amendment dealing with the sugar program. We fought this fight \nfor years and years and years. It is the only program that operates at \nno net cost to the taxpayers of America, but ensures a stable and \ndependable supply of sugar to the consumers of this country. There are \nsome large industrial users that would probably like to get their sugar \nfor free. I can understand that, but it does not certainly serve the \nneeds of the overall farm policy in this country.\n  Our plan that is in this legislation is a dependable, stable program. \nAgain, it operates at no net cost. It guarantees when additional sugar \nfrom foreign sources is needed that it can come into this country to \nmeet the needs of our domestic producers, suppliers and refiners in \nthis country. It has worked well. ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' \nhas been said so many times before in different context. It certainly \nfits very well in this current situation. We have a program that works. \nIs it perfect? Of course not. But it works, it is solid, it is stable. \nI have never, I think, ever, received any letter from consumers or \nhousewives complaining about the price of sugar.\n  People know that it has been a dependable price. It has always been \nthere. We have had some foreign sugar come in when it is necessary. Yet \nthe suppliers and domestic producers in this country have been able to \nsurvive under difficult circumstances.\n  We have a situation, I understand, in Florida that has brought about \nsome concern. This bill addresses it in a way that I think the Members \nof the Senate from Florida who are very attentive to the needs of their \nStates have supported, and strongly support.\n  I conclude by urging that any amendments dealing with sugar in this \narea to eliminate the program be eliminated as an amendment because we \nhave something that works. We should keep it that way. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Louisiana. \nWe serve jointly as cochairs of the Sweetener Caucus here on the Senate \nside and work cooperatively together to solve the problems that this \nindustry has had. I think we have accomplished that over the years, \nboth in cane and sugar beet production, critical crops to the South, \ncertainly to my State and other States in the West and Midwest.\n  What is important, as the Senator has spoken to, is creating a \nbalance that offers stability to a program and at a reasonable cost to \nconsumers. It is not just a good program in Idaho for Idaho \nagriculture, but it employs a tremendous number of people and provides \na necessary and important commodity. I will discuss this later if \namendments are offered to the program that we have worked very closely \non to develop.\n\n\n                   Modification of Amendment No. 3184\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to modify amendment 3184 with permanent law provisions and, \nonce that modification has been made, no amendments be in order to \nstrike the permanent law modification during the pending action on S. \n1541.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3444\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I understand we are \nnow on amendment No. 3184, proposed by Mr. Leahy, as modified by the \namendment just sent to the desk by Mr. Craig?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 3444, the Lugar amendment, is \nstill pending.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will be sending an amendment to the \ndesk. Is the bill open for amendment at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The bill is not open for amendment. Will the Chair advise \nthe Senator when the bill is open for amendment?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will be delighted to yield when I can figure out what \nis going on around this place.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Lugar amendment is the pending business; as in each \ncase, 15 minutes to a side. We are still on that amendment, and we \nanticipate within a few minutes there may be clearance on the \nDemocratic side for the Lugar amendment, in which case it will be \naccepted and we will move on. The distinguished Senator from Iowa will \nbe recognized to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I see. I did not understand the process under which we \nwere operating. I was not privy to those deliberations that went on \nlate last night.\n  Mr. President, let me say I do not even know what the Lugar amendment \nis, right now. It is probably OK. I just want to take at least a couple \nof minutes--I guess I have the floor--to raise my voice in protest \nagainst this process we are now undertaking.\n  Agricultural legislation is serious business. It not only affects the \nfarmers in my home State and farmers and ranchers all across the \ncountry, it affects consumers and affects people who live in small \ntowns in rural areas.\n  I have been here 22 years. I have been on the Ag Committee that long, \n10 in the House and now 12 in the Senate. I have been through a lot of \nfarm bills. I have never seen such an obscene process as what we are \ngoing through right now, and I use the word with its full import and \nmeaning, ``obscene.''\n  The fact that we have before us a 7-year farm bill--I do not mind \ndebating the farm bill and offering amendments and whatever comes out \nof this body, fine. That is the will of the body to do that. But, to be \nchoked by a process that only allows several hours of debate, that only \nallows 10 amendments on this side, allows 5 amendments on that side; \nthat only allows a half-hour evenly divided for any amendment--what \nkind of deliberative process is this? Is this the U.S. Senate? Or is \nthis some Third World dictatorship, where somebody is trying to cram \nsomething through?\n  I just want to say I protest to the utmost what we are doing here and \nhow we are doing it today. Farm legislation deserves more than 7 hours. \nWe can spend 2 weeks on a telecommunications bill, or longer. I do not \nknow how long it took. We can spend days and days debating other \nthings. But for perhaps the most important thing for farmers and \nranchers and rural people, what do we get, 8 hours, 7 hours, to debate \nand amend and try to fashion a bill?\n  I am sorry, this process smells to high heaven. I have some \namendments I am going to be offering, but I want to make the record \nvery clear I object to the way this bill is being pushed through, the \nway we are being choked off and strangled in this process. The Senate \ndeserves better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Lugar amendment \nbe temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the floor is now open. In fact an amendment \nfrom the Democratic side would be in order.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3445 to Amendment No. 3184\n\n   (Purpose: To strike the section relating to the Commodity Credit \n    Corporation interest rate and continue the farmer owned reserve)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3445 to amendment No. 3184.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (1) Strike section 505 and insert: ``Notwithstanding the \n     provisions of section 110, the Secretary shall carry out the \n     Farmer Owned Reserve program in accordance of with section \n     110 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.) \n     as it existed prior to the enactment of this Act.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, my amendment would do two things. First of \nall, it strikes section 505. What is section 505? Section 505--believe \nit or not, I know this is going to come as a shock to you, Mr. \nPresident, and others who may not have been privy to what is in this \nso-called farm bill--section 505 raises interest rates that the \nCommodity Credit Corporation charges farmers. Under current law, the \nUSDA charges farmers interest on commodity loans at a rate based on the \ncosts of money to the CCC, the Commodity Credit Corporation. It is a \nTreasury-based rate. This is the way it always has been. \n\n[[Page S1016]]\n\n  But the bill and the Leahy-Lugar or Lugar-Leahy amendment would \nincrease the interest rate on commodity loans by 100 basis points above \nthe rate, as calculated under the formula in effect on October 1, 1989.\n  There is simply no justification for hiking the interest on farmers \nabove a level representing the cost of funds to USDA. This bill, as \ndrafted, would constitute usury against farmers. It is unreasonable. \nHere we have the Fed finally, I think, coming to its senses, I hope, in \nstarting to reduce interest rates. They never should have hiked them in \nthe first place over the last couple of years. Yet, on the other hand, \nwe are going to charge more interest to farmers.\n  I wonder how many farmers know that. I wonder how many farmers know \nthat in this bill their interest charges are going to go up 100 basis \npoints, for no reason. There is no reason for it. The Treasury rates \nare going down, not going up. These commodity loans are among the most \neffective and cost-effective of all farm programs because they do allow \nfarmers to market their grain in a more orderly fashion. It helps them \nobtain funds to pay their expenses using their commodity as a \ncollateral while improving their opportunity to take advantage of \nhigher prices that usually occur after a harvest.\n  So maybe that is the reason they are raising the interest rates to \nfarmers. Maybe they will not be able to keep their grain and they will \nhave to dump it at harvest time when prices are low. That is OK for the \ngrain dealers, OK for the processors--bad deal for farmers. These loans \nalso help alleviate the stress and overloading on transportation and \nmarketing channels during the harvest season.\n  Mr. President, there is simply no reason for USDA to make money from \nfarmers using this program by charging interest rates exceeding the \ncost of money to USDA. So my amendment would simply retain current law. \nBecause it would simply retain current law, there would be no cost \nrelative to baseline for the amendment. As for the cost of the overall \nbill relative to baseline, adding the cost of this amendment would \nstill leave the cost of the bill well below CBO baselines.\n  Mr. President, that is the first part of my amendment, to strike that \nsection that raises interest rates to farmers, leave it as under \ncurrent law that is the cost of money to the Government.\n  As I said, these commodity loans help farmers market their grain in \nan orderly fashion. They can hold their grain and market it when prices \nare higher. It leaves the farmer more in charge of when he wants to \nmarket it rather than when he has to dump it to pay his bills.\n  But there is another important tool that farmers use in order to \nmaximize their income and to ensure that they can sell their grain at \nthe appropriate time. That is something called the farmer-owned \nreserve. That is the second part of my amendment. That is to reinstate \nand restore the farmer-owned reserve, which is eliminated in this bill \nand in the Lugar-Leahy amendment.\n  The farmer-owned reserve again helps farmers store crops in times of \nsurplus when prices are low. It alleviates the glut on the market. It \nhelps farmers await opportunities for better prices. It is a marketing \ntool for farmers. The farmer-owned reserve also protects consumers \nbecause it helps to hold grain grown in good times in reserve so that \ndrought or other natural disasters will not drive prices to extremely \nhigh levels.\n  The availability of grain in reserve is also important in bringing a \nlittle stability to both grain and livestock sectors. The reserve helps \nto keep grain prices from going as high as they might otherwise. It \nhelps prevent the liquidation of livestock herds in teams of short feed \nreduction. The liquidation of these herds eventually leads to higher \nmeat prices at a later point for consumers.\n  The Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute at the University \nof Missouri and Iowa State University estimated that substantial stocks \nthat we held on hand going into the 1988 drought prevented some $40 \nbillion in extra food costs to consumers mostly in keeping the meat \nprices from going sharply higher. So the farmer-owned reserve bill is \ngood for the grain farmer, has allowed that grain farmer to market the \ngrain when he wants, and it is a marketing tool.\n  Second, it is good for livestock producers because in times of short \nproduction or over demand, it keeps their prices from spiking up, which \nmay cause them to liquidate their herds. They do not have the luxury of \nnot feeding their cattle for a long period of time and waiting until \nthe prices go down. A lot of herds are liquidated because of the sharp \nspikes in prices.\n  The other thing is, if we get a glut in the price, they go way down. \nA lot of livestock people put on more animals, and that leads to great \nfluctuations in the livestock market.\n  So the farmer-owned reserve bill provides stability, a marketing tool \nfor grain farmers, some stability in protection for our livestock \nproducers, and it provides a great deal of protection for our \nconsumers. Who knows when we will have the next drought or the next \nflood? Who knows what crop conditions are going to be like next year \nwith global warming and everything else that is going on and the crazy \nwinter weather? Who knows? It is in our best interest to ensure that we \nhave a farmer-owned reserve.\n  I remember when the farmer-owned reserve came into existence. I \nremember the debate at that time. The farmer ought to keep the grain, \nnot the processors, not the shippers, not the elevators. The farmers \nought to have control over that grain and sell it when that farmer \nwants to. That was the whole idea behind the farmer-owned reserve. It \nhad broad bipartisan support. Check the record. I am right. Republicans \nand Democrats across the board supported the institution of the farmer-\nowned reserve. There is no reason to do away with it.\n  Yet, this bill, and the Lugar-Leahy amendment, does away with the \nfarmer-owned reserve. My amendment simply reinstates it as it was. My \namendment does not include an offset because the bill is well below the \nCongressional Budget Office baseline. The amendment would only \nconstitute a continuation of the farmer-owned reserve as it was in the \n1990 farm bill. It would not result in spending on the farmer-owned \nreserve above a baseline level.\n  So, again, Mr. President, my amendment does two things to help \nfarmers and consumers. One, it knocks out the provision of the bill \nthat raises interest rates to farmers.\n  I see the chairman is here. Perhaps we can have some discussion. I do \nnot know why we are raising interest rates to farmers 1 percent when \nthe Fed is already starting to lower interest rates and Treasury rates \nare going down. There is no reason for that.\n  So the first part of my amendment knocks that out and leaves interest \nrates on CCC loans at cost of money.\n  The second part of my amendment reinstates the farmer-owned reserve.\n  I reserve whatever remainder of time I might have.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes and forty seconds remain.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I require on \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, two elements of the amendment offered by \nthe distinguished Senator from Iowa are costly provisions. I think \nSenators need to understand that there are expenses attached which the \ntaxpayers would have if the amendments were to be adopted. \nSpecifically, the Harkin amendment as it deals with CCC credits and the \n100-basis-point increase, which the pending legislation would provide \nin the CCC interest rates, if that were stricken, this would cost the \ntaxpayers $260 million. So it is a significant item.\n\n  The point made by the distinguished Senator is, why should interest \nrates for farmers be increased as represented by the CCC interest \nrates? And the fundamental answer is that these rates are well below \ncommercial rates. In essence, as the Agriculture Committee dealt with \nthis problem, we have tried to bring some equity among farmers, \nbusiness people, and those who are involved in commerce generally in \nAmerica. And the elimination of the 100-basis-point advantage likewise \nwas a very important saving at the time that \n\n[[Page S1017]]\nwe were all considering the balanced budget amendment that was vetoed \nultimately by President Clinton.\n  I hope that simply because the President has vetoed this particular \nbudget, even as the President and congressional leadership are still \nhard at work as far as we know attempting to find a balanced budget in \n7 years, that we would not abandon all of the thoughts that we had that \nwere very important with regard to balancing the budget. This is a $260 \nmillion item.\n  Mr. President, the second part of the Harkin amendment would restore \nthe farmer-owned grain reserve which pays farmers 26\\1/2\\ cents a \nbushel for storing grain. I would simply point out that restoration of \nthis farmer-owned reserve will also be a costly item--in this case, \n$100 million of additional expense to taxpayers in this country.\n  Furthermore, I would simply say as a farmer who has adequate storage \ncapacity on my farm, and well aware of how the farmer-reserve plan \nworked in the past, that I do not think it is a very good idea. I say \nthis as a farmer, not as somebody coming in from the outside offering \nadvice to farmers.\n\n  The truth of the matter is, so long as we had the farmer-owned \nreserve we had an enormous overhang of grain on markets. Those of us \nwho looked to the markets to give signals for our marketing plans \nalways had to take into consideration hoards of grain--hundreds of \nmillions of bushels held out there that could depress markets strangely \nand sometimes almost capriciously.\n  The thought was suggested this morning that this farmer-owned reserve \ngave some solace to consumers. But it is really quite to the contrary, \nMr. President. It has led to fits and starts with regard to marketing \nplans for farmers that finally we got rid of all of this grain, and the \nfarmer-owned reserve was finally depleted. It is gone. It is no longer \na hanging sword over the market price.\n  I would like to leave it that way, Mr. President. I think that is the \ndesirable policy. In fact, the Senator's amendment does two unfortunate \nthings: It would reestablish bad policy, and charge the taxpayers of \nthe country $100 million for that dubious privilege.\n  Mr. President, the arguments are starkly simple. I will not embellish \nthem further--$260 million more cost if you strike the 100-point \ninterest differential and $100 million more cost if you restore the \nfarmer-owned reserve situation. In both cases, I think they are bad \npolicy and very expensive.\n  So, obviously, Mr. President, I strenuously oppose the amendment for \nthe reasons I have suggested.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3445, as modified\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have a modification of my amendment I \nsend to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       (1) Strike section 505.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the modification I sent to the desk was \nsimply to strike the provision on the farmer-owned reserve and that \nleaves the amendment to strike section 505, which is striking that \nportion of the bill that raises the interest rates to farmers.\n  I will have another amendment that I wish to send to the desk that \nwould reinstate the farmer-owned reserve. I ask the chairman if I can \ndo that now, or do I have to wait for another time?\n  These are two separate issues, and I did not mean to get them \ntogether in one bill. So now I have an amendment at the desk that \nsimply strikes that section which raises the interest rates. I wish to \nalso offer the amendment to reinstate the farmer-owned reserve.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, if I may raise a question of the \ndistinguished Senator, he wishes to separate the two issues?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. In two amendments?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I have no objection.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Could I send the other amendment to the desk?\n  I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would suggest that until the first \namendment is set aside, a second amendment would not be in order.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I will just take what remaining time I have to respond \nto the distinguished chairman's comments on the Commodity Credit \nCorporation. He said it would cost $260 million--that is true--over 7 \nyears, a very small price to pay for ensuring that farmers are not \ncharged higher interest rates that are not even warranted.\n  Now, when you say that it costs money, it does not really cost money. \nIt just adds to what is in the present bill because the present bill \nraises interest rates. So if you take that out, you are saying it costs \nmoney.\n  No, it does not. This is sort of a shell game. It does not really \ncost money. It only costs money because by the bill raising interest \nrates to farmers, the Government is going to make some money.\n  Well, I do not think the Government ought to be making money off of \nfarmers by charging them another percent interest rate on commodity \ncredit loans. So let us not get caught up in that kind of nonsense.\n  Second, on the farmer-owned reserve, the Senator is right; there is \nno grain in the farmer-owned reserve now because prices are high and \nfarmers have sold their grain. Who can say next year or the year after \nor the year after or the year after for 7 years?\n  He talks about the grain hanging over the marketplace. That is the \nway it used to be when the processors and the elevators got the grain \nand the grain companies. When Cargill got the grain, yes, they could \nhold it over. But now that farmers have it, they can market that grain \nwhenever they want, and that is the way it ought to be. It is a \nmarketing tool for farmers, not something that depresses the market. \nThe 7-year cost of this amendment is $81 million, which still keeps the \nbill well within CBO's baseline. So I did not need an offset for that.\n  So there are no pay-go problems relative to the baseline here. The \nbill now saves $784 million against the December 1995 CBO baseline. It \nsaves about $8 billion against the February 1995 baseline, so there is \nroom in the budget for these amendments.\n  So this first amendment on the Commodity Credit Corporation will cost \nfarmers $260 million. That is what it will do if we leave it in there. \nIf we take it out, it is not going to cost the Government and it is \nwell within the baseline. These increased interest rates on farmers are \na tax on farmers. Make no mistake about it; it is an additional tax on \nfarmers. I think it is usurious, and I hope we can get this stricken so \nthe farmers do not have to pay increased interest rates when it is not \neven warranted by anything happening in the marketplace.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will just respond briefly to the \ndistinguish Senator's argument. Obviously, we are not imposing a tax on \nfarmers. A farmer wishing to borrow money does that as a citizen, a \nvoluntary act. The question is whether that loan ought to be subsidized \nby all the rest of the taxpayers, people in various other businesses \nall over the country. To some extent it is now subsidized, and the \nlegislation that the distinguished Senator from Idaho and I introduced \neliminates 100 basis points of the subsidy. It brings the loan rate for \nfarmers closer to that of commercial loans in our country, some basic \nfairness really with all borrowers. That is the issue.\n  Now, if we offer a subsidy to farmers, I have pointed out it will \ncost taxpayers and other borrowers $260 million. That has no \nrelationship whatever to baseline or budget or what have you. It is \njust a cost of the subsidy.\n  In the agriculture legislation we provided this year, we have tried \nto bring about more equity among farmers and other taxpayers in the \ncountry. I believe the savings involved are substantial. They are over \na 7-year period of time. They do not bring any injury to farmers as a \ngroup of people with relationship to anybody else. They bring about \nequity, and I believe the taxpayers care about that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a good debate, and I appreciate \nthe comments by the distinguished chairman \n\n[[Page S1018]]\non this issue. But I would engage him even further.\n  The interest rate was raised in the bill to meet budget \nconsiderations. They were looking for every bit of money they could \nfind to meet the budget, and so someone, I do not know whom, decided, \nwell, we will raise the interest rates on Commodity Credit Corporation \nloans to farmers by a percent, and that gained us $260 million.\n  We are not now engaged in a budget debate. That has gone. We have \nroom within the budget for this. That is the key. There is room in the \nbudget for this.\n  Let us take this $260 million that my friend from Indiana said is \ncosting taxpayers. No, it is not. What this $260 million represents is \n$260 million taken from farmers. That is what it is. Farmers pay it. If \nwe do not have them pay it, that means farmers get to keep that $260 \nmillion over 7 years. Now, if we take it from them, what is the \ndifference between that and a tax, I ask you? It is a tax on farmers. \nAnd, no, it is not true that taxpayers have to pay it. That is not it \nat all.\n  Why should farmers get a better rate on their commodity loans than \nthey can get at the local bank? Why should they? I will tell you why. \nBecause a farmer, an individual farmer out there does not have the \neconomic clout to go to the big banks in Chicago or New York or Kansas \nCity and get the prime rate. They have to pay whatever the local rate \nis. And it is usually a lot higher.\n  Now, Cargill, if they want to borrow money, they go to Chicago and \nthey get the prime rate. They might even get it better than that, for \nall I know, because they are big and they are a big customer. Farmer \nJoe Jones in Iowa, though, who goes to the local bank to borrow money \nso he can pay his bills and keep his crop and market it when he wants \nto, has to pay local going rates.\n  That is why we have this in the bill. That is why we have had it for \n60 years, I think, if I am not mistaken. For pretty close to 60 years \nwe have had that provision which allows farmers to borrow from CCC. And \nnow they are getting slapped with a tax. I am sorry, I am just going to \ntell it like I see it. This is $260 million taken from farmers. Talk \nabout takings, this is taken from the farmer. There is no reason for \nit.\n  On the farmer-owned reserve, again, $81 million over 7 years is a \nsmall price to pay for stability for farmers and for consumers to know \nthat if there is a drought or flood or some other national disaster, \nthey are not going to get hit with exorbitantly high food prices. So on \nboth of these issues, but especially on the interest rate issue, I say \nto my colleagues, do not stick it to the farmers and charge them more \ninterest than what is necessary for the Government. By doing so, you \nare just taking $260 million more out of farmers' pockets over the next \n7 years, and we ought not allow that to happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator, indeed, makes no \napology for being candid. He always has been a truth teller, and I \nappreciate that. The facts are clear that the Senator believes farmers \nshould receive lower interest rates in this particular instance in the \nCCC loan than commercial rates.\n  Clearly, as a part of general equity, the committee felt otherwise. \nWe feel as a matter of fact that the loan rates ought to be comparable \nfor commercial activities in our country, and this was a good time to \nrectify that. It was a part of the budget consideration, and I hope we \nhave not forgotten that altogether. That is not an issue that has been \nlaid aside by the country, and it is not a question of sticking it to \nthe farmers. The question is simply equity for farmers, equity for \ntaxpayers, equity for all of us. I think this is an important \nconsideration. It is a $260 million consideration, as a matter of fact.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, with regard to stability for consumers, the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa mentioned that because of high prices \nnow the bins are empty. They will always be empty if prices are very \nhigh in the world. The point is, we ought not fill them up again and \nthus depress the prices because of this overhang. That is the principle \nand that is the policy. Furthermore, $100 million of savings to the \ntaxpayers is involved in not reinstituting bad policy.\n  Mr. President, how much time does our side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes left.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am prepared to yield back, that is, if all time is \nyielded back on the Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, has the Senator from Iowa used all his time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I move that the Harkin amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3446 to Amendment No. 3184\n\n            (Purpose: To continue the farmer owned reserve)\n\n  The clerk will report the second Harkin amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3446 to amendment No. 3184.\n       At the appropriate place insert the following: \n     ``Notwithstanding the provisions of section 110, the \n     Secretary shall carry out the Farmer Owned Reserve program in \n     accordance of with section 110 of the Agricultural Act of \n     1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.) as it existed prior to the \n     enactment of this Act.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is my second amendment. I yield back \nall my time. I already discussed it.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will follow the same course as the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa. We have had a good discussion of both \namendments and, therefore, I yield our time back on our side. I ask \nunanimous consent that the second Harkin amendment be temporarily set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, might I note, I believe we are open for \nanother amendment on the other side. I should note, Mr. President, for \nour colleagues that everybody has been very cooperative. A number of \nSenators have not used all their time. Things are moving forward. I \nalmost hate to mention that as a compliment because it might spoil the \nrhythm of things.\n  I encourage Senators to keep coming forward. I know there are others \non the floor now. But it is my intention on this side that whenever \npossible--whenever possible--on an amendment to yield back time. I \nwould not do anything to cut off anybody's time, of course, that is \nallotted to them, because it is a relatively short amount of time on \neach amendment. But when we can, we can yield it back.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the normal rotation would be now to come to \nour side of the aisle, if one of our Senators is ready.\n  Is the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania ready?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Just 1 minute.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3225 To Amendment No. 3184\n\n   (Purpose: To provide farm program equity by reforming the peanut \n                                program)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. I have, I believe, at the \ndesk amendment No. 3225. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] for himself, \n     Mr. Bradley, Mr. Brown, Mr. Smith, Mr. Gregg and Mr. Kyl, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3225 to amendment No. 3184.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Amend Section 106, Peanut Program, by:\n       (a) Striking paragraph (2) in subsection (a), Quota \n     Peanuts, and inserting the following: \n     \n[[Page S1019]]\n\n       ``(2) Support rates.--\n       ``(A) Maximum levels.--The national average quota support \n     rate for each of the 1996 through 2000 crops of quota peanuts \n     shall not be more than $610 per ton for the 1996 crop, $542 \n     per ton for the 1997 crop, $509 per ton for the 1998 crop, \n     $475 per ton for the 1999 and 2000 crops.\n       ``(B) Disbursement.--The Secretary shall initially disburse \n     only 90 percent of the price support loan level required \n     under this paragraph to producers for the 1996 and 1997 \n     crops, and 85 percent for the 1998 through 2000 crops and \n     provide for the disbursement to producers at maturity of any \n     balances due the producers on the loans that may remain to be \n     settled at maturity. The remainder of the loans for each crop \n     shall be applied to offset losses in pools under subsection \n     (d), if the losses exist, and shall be paid to producers only \n     after the losses are offset.''\n       ``(C) Non-recourse loans.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, for the 2001 and 2002 crops of \n     peanuts, the quota is eliminated and the Secretary shall \n     offer to all peanut producers non-recourse loans at a level \n     not to exceed 70 percent of the estimated market price \n     anticipated for each crop.\n       ``(D) Market price.--In estimating the market price for the \n     2001 and 2002 crops of peanuts, the Secrtary shall consider \n     the export prices of additional peanuts during the last 5 \n     crop years for which price support was available for \n     additional peanuts and prices for peanuts in overseas \n     markets, but shall not base the non-recourse loan levels for \n     2001-2002 on quota or additional support rates established \n     under this Act.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have a very short period of time under \nthe agreement to go through this. So if I can, I would like to first \nsay I would like to describe our amendment so I can get that in; and \nthen I would like to talk generally about the dramatic need for reform.\n  What we have seen in the bill that is before us right now is an \nattempt to move farm programs, at least a lot of farm programs, into \nthe 21st century--actually the 20th century; the late 20th century, not \nreally the 21st century--in an effort for reform, the freedom to farm.\n  There are a couple of programs that have been left aside, that have \nbeen allowed to continue as they are and have not been reformed. In \nfact, in the past several farm bills, while other commodity programs \nhave been reformed, a couple of programs have been set aside for \nnontouched status. One such program is the Peanut Program.\n  What we are trying to do with this amendment, Senator Bradley and I, \nis to do just a modest amount of reform over the next few years and \nreally make this program look like programs like the Soybean Program \nlooks today. So we are just trying to bring the Peanut Program into \nwhat is the 1960's and 1970's farm policy as opposed to the 1930's farm \npolicy.\n  What we do is gradually reduce the support price for peanuts from the \ncurrent level, which is $678--and, by the way, the world market price \nfor peanuts is not $678 a ton, which is what it is in this country for \npeople who grow quota peanuts; it is $350 a ton. So we pay, as this \nchart shows, a tremendous amount more for peanuts in this country than \nthe world does.\n  What happens as a result of that? Well, a lot of our folks who \nprocess peanuts end up producing Snickers bars and the like up in \nCanada or Mexico where they can buy peanuts at the world price, not \nhave to subsidize an arcane quota system at $678 a ton. So we are \nlosing jobs. Not only are we losing jobs, but consumption of peanuts is \ngoing down. We are losing farms and losing processors and losing \nshellers.\n  This is a doomed program. Keeping prices at this level is dooming \nthis program, not just for the processors and consumers, but for \nfarmers also. What we do is gradually reduce the support price for \npeanuts from $678 to $610 next year, and by the year 2000 it goes down \nto $475 for the years 1999 and 2000. After the year 2000, we go to a \nnonrecourse loan program which is similar to other agriculture programs \nin place right now as a safety net program.\n  So we still have a program for peanuts when we are done. It looks \nmore like the traditional farm programs. It is not a system, as I will \nexplain in a minute, that is absolutely indecipherable, as well as \nunfair, to growers who do not happen to have passed on from generation \nto generation a quota that allows us to charge this outrageous price \nfor peanuts that we do charge.\n  Let me now talk very briefly about the peanut program. Mr. President, \nhow much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas 11\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me talk a little bit \nabout this program. Freedom to farm is about simplifying agriculture \nprograms, providing certainty and simplicity. We do that in a lot of \nareas of this farm bill, and I commend the chairman, Senator Lugar, and \nSenator Leahy for their work in moving farm programs, albeit slowly, \nbut gradually toward simplicity and certainty.\n  We do not touch this program. We do not reform this program, and this \nis how it works. I wish I had time to explain this monstrosity of a \nprogram. It has taken me, as a new member of the Agriculture Committee, \na year to just begin to understand how this program works.\n  It is discriminatory is probably the nicest thing you can say about \nit. If you are a quota farmer--that means, if you own a license to \nraise so many tons of peanuts--you can sell your peanuts at $678 a ton. \nIf you do not have a license, which has been passed on usually from \ngeneration to generation--and, by the way, about 20 percent of the \nquota holders, 20 percent of the people who own quotas control 80 \npercent of the quota peanuts in this country. So it is very few \nfarmers, in some cases not even farmers, people who own these things \nlive all over the world and lease out the quotas so people can grow \ntheir peanuts. If you do not own one of these quotas, you do not get \n$678 a ton, you get $132 a ton when the world market price is $350.\n  There are literally hundreds of thousands of growers out there who \ncannot even make ends meet because of this program for the privileged \nfew--for the privileged few--who just happened to have a granddaddy who \nknew somebody on the board when they handed out these quotas back in \nthe 1930's.\n  That is not the way we should run farm policy in this country, and it \nis discriminatory. If you look at the percentage of minorities who have \nquotas, that is another story altogether. Minorities were not given a \nlot of quotas in the South back in the 1930's to grow peanuts, and that \nis another inequity built into this program. It is a great reason to \nget rid of it.\n\n  Let me talk about equity. As I said before, in the process of the \nlast couple of farm bills, we have gradually begun to reform the farm \nprograms. We have reduced support prices for a variety of commodities. \nIn fact, we have reduced support prices for every single commodity but \none: Peanuts.\n  Peanuts have gone up. Price supports have gone up since the 1985 farm \nbill by 21 percent. Peanut support prices have gone up 21 percent. \nEvery other program has gone down. Every other commodity support price \nhas gone down, as we seek to get Government more and more out of \nsupporting agriculture and allowing agriculture to work on its own.\n  Only peanuts, with this horrible quota system that prejudices folks \nwho were not lucky enough, as I said, to have their granddaddy give \nthem a quota license--those are the folks who make money at the expense \nof other growers, of shellers, of processors and consumers, because we \npay a heck of a lot more for peanuts in this country than they do \nanywhere else in the world. Why? For a privileged few, a privileged few \nwho just happened to know someone back in the 1930's or their \ngranddaddy happened to know someone in the 1930's.\n  It is a system that needs to be done away with. Frankly, the right \nthing to do is to eliminate the program outright. But we understand \nthere are a lot of people who own these quotas who have loans and \nrelationships, that they borrowed money based on the fact they had \nthese quotas and were able to get these increased prices, so we phased \nit out. We are not going to drop anybody off the quota right away. We \nphase it out over a period of 5 years and then go to a nonrecourse loan \nprogram. We still keep a safety net in place for all peanut growers, \nnot just the privileged few who happen to own quotas, but for all \npeanut growers.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nKentucky. \n\n[[Page S1020]]\n\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Katherine \nDeRemer, who is on detail from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, be granted the \nprivilege of the floor during the consideration of S. 1541, the \nAgricultural Market Transition Act of 1996.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair and thank my colleague from Alabama.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized next, for the purpose of offering an amendment, at the \nconclusion of the debate on the Santorum amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. I withdraw it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of \nmisinformation about the peanut program. It is a very complicated \nprogram, but it is a cost-effective and consumer-oriented program.\n  In the bill that is before us, the underlying bill, there is \nsubstantial reform. We have a reform peanut bill that is before us. It \nis reformed in a great number of ways. It will have the effect of \nlowering the cost of the peanut program to the extent that it is a no-\nnet-cost program. It is not going to cost the Government.\n  Over the years, the peanut program has cost the Government about $13 \nmillion a year. This past year, the cost has increased, but the peanut \nprogram is essentially very little cost to the taxpayer. The quota will \nbe reduced by as much as 28 percent. Therefore, this change alone \ndemonstrates significant reform. Frankly, I said, in my judgment, it \nwent too far, but it prevailed on the Republican side. That is what \nthey wanted to do, and they felt like that was the thing to do. I still \nbelieve that the reforms go too far. I do not like it, but it has been \nreformed.\n  So all these figures that the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania \nis using do not show the reformation that has taken place.\n  His bill will basically kill the peanut program. Actually, a similar \namendment to his in the House was estimated by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture to cost the program $110 million in the first year alone, \nwhereas the reform bill in the package before us in the Senate is a no-\nnet cost. In effect, we are talking about a cost to the Government of \n$110 million in the first year under the Santorum amendment.\n  The amendment that Senator Santorum offers would bring the support \nand the market price below the cost of production, making financing \nimpossible and driving farmers out of the business and reducing the \nsupply to consumers.\n  Two separate studies by the farm credit system shows that basically \nwhat he is doing will mean that somewhere between 40 and 45 percent of \npeanut farmers will not be able to get financing the first year. And \nthen in the remaining years, none of them could get financing relative \nto this. This would leave the industry with a significant reduction in \nsupply.\n  I have some charts. This is a bag of salted peanuts. It sells for 20 \ncents, 23 cents, and 7 cents. That is 50 cents. The farmer gets 7 \ncents. The manufacturer gets 23 cents. The retailer gets 20 cents. That \nis 99 percent peanuts. I do not know what else you add to it. I suppose \nyou add a little salt. And maybe you can cook them a little bit in \npeanut oil, which is a good oil relative to it.\n\n  Whoever heard of one of these bags of peanuts selling for anything \nlike the bottled drinks, like the colas? When they first started out \ntalking about putting a 1-cent tax on them--it never materialized in \nthat manner. Instead, they have always been increased in multiples of \n5. The price used to be 10 cents, and now we find soft drinks being 50 \ncents, 55 or 60 cents.\n  How are you going to save any money on a bag of peanuts when the \nfarmer gets that little? Down here you have peanut butter. The peanut \nbutter here contains 90 percent peanuts. This particular jar sells for \n$2.08. As it is, that is what we picked out in the store. There is a \nstudy by Purdue University, and they went out and picked out six cities \nto sample. The price varied for a jar of peanuts of the same size; I \nbelieve it was 18 ounces. It varied from $3.17 down to the lowest at a \n$1.23 a jar. We are going to show you a chart later showing what it \ncost the manufacturers to produce peanut butter and make a profit. For \nthe School Lunch Program, manufacturers sell peanut butter and \nobviously make a profit at about 80 cents a jar, compared to an overall \ncommercial retail average of $1.83. The manufacturer's cost is what \nthey sell to the School Lunch Program, and they make money on that at \n80 cents a jar.\n  Now, M's. We have here plain M's and peanut M's. The consumer \npays the same retail price, ``disputing what candy manufacturers have \nbeen saying about the effect of peanuts on consumer prices.'' They sell \nfor the same thing. No difference whatsoever when you go into the \nmarket.\n  All right. Here we have Hershey. Bear Stearns, which is a leading \ninvestment house, on September 18, issued a new alert relative to \nHershey Food Corp., and they upgraded it from neutral, to ``buy.'' Bear \nStearns says: ``Hershey will be a major beneficiary of several \nlegislative and regulatory reform measures expected to be put into \neffect in the near future; namely, the phaseout of Government price \nsupport for sugar and peanuts.''\n  And on another page of this, Bear Stearns said--and this is \ninformation they sent out to their investors--``Phase out support for \nsugar and peanuts. As a new part of the farm legislation being hammered \nout, the U.S. Government could gradually phase out price supports for \nsugar and peanuts.'' Bear Stearns is making their stock recommendation \nbased on the elimination of the Price Support Program. We expect this \nbill to go into effect in 1996. ``Such measures would lead to \nsubstantial margin improvements for Hershey, whose chocolate operations \nconsumes huge quantities of these two commodities, sugar and peanuts.'' \nIt goes on relative to profit margins for share-holders and other stock \naspects.\n  Now, several years ago, there was a GAO study pertaining to this, and \nthey said, regarding the support price, there was a possibility of it \nmeaning lower costs to the consumer. Yet, when they testified before \nthe House regarding their report, they came up with a very changed and \nrealistic thing. The GAO basically stated in testimony that by \n``consumer,'' they did not mean the final consumer of the product, but \nthe first buyer of the peanuts to make them into candy or peanut \nbutter. Further, GAO admitted that it could be zero that the homemaker \nwould ever see of that savings. The GAO also stated that they had \ninterviewed both small and large manufacturers of peanut products and \nwere told that they may not pass the cost savings directly on to the \nfinal consumer of peanut products, but that they could develop some new \nproduct lines with a lower support price.\n  I want to show you the history of what has happened relative to \nfarmer price and retail price. Here are the various things. The support \nprice is in blue on the chart here, and the red is farm prices, and \ngreen the retail price. Over the years, the farm price has always been \nabove the support price. That has been consistent throughout. The loan \nrate has not been used much. Look at the difference as to what the \nmanufacturers and the retailers make, in regards to retail price versus \nwhat the farmer makes.\n  Let us see if we cannot get that chart now pertaining to the cost of \nthe manufacturing. This is from USDA. This chart shows the \nmanufacturers' cost. The manufacturers are able to make and sell peanut \nbutter to the USDA School Lunch Program at 81 cents a pound, while \nconsumers pay more than twice that amount for the very same peanut \nbutter in grocery stores. The retail price illustrated in this chart is \nactually below the retail average. In some places, the retail price is \nover $3. As I indicated earlier, 90 percent of \n\n[[Page S1021]]\nwhat is in a jar of peanut butter is peanuts. They may have added a \nlittle salt and oil and other things pertaining to that.\n  Now we talked about prices paid by the School Lunch Program versus \ncommercial retail. Let us now turn to the chart on the comparative \nprices in cities across the world. Again, USDA is the source of this \ninformation. In the United States, the average price as of that date--\nand they vary according to the date--is $2.10. In Mexico, it is $2.55. \nIn Canada $2.72. The argument has been made that peanut butter produced \nin Canada, or any foreign country, is made with the cheaper, world \nmarket peanuts. This chart illustrates Hong Kong, Paris, and Tokyo. The \nU.S. peanut butter prices are the lowest in the world. I point that \nout. Let us look at Canada. I will not attempt to quote this French, \nbut they have labeling on this Canadian peanut butter. In Canada, the \nretail price is $2.99 and in the United States it is $2.21 on that \nparticular date and location. This example even takes into account the \nexchange rate.\n  Here we have a Snickers bar. They say they are going to pass on to \nthe consumer savings on Snickers bars. Everybody knows Snickers is \npacked full of peanuts. But when you get down to it, it actually only \nhas 2 cents worth of peanuts in it. The retail price for this Snickers \nbar is 55 cents. Furthermore, the sugar in a Snickers bar is only 3 \ncents. This information is from a reliable source, a director of \nquality and supply of Nestle's Chocolate and Confections, who made this \nstatement as of the 18th day of June 1995. If the peanut price is \nreduced what portion will a consumer see in regards to reduced retail \nprice. I say the consumer will see no reduction in the retail price.\n  Now, foes of the peanut program have been putting out a lot of \nmisinformation about new farmers, that they are not getting into the \nprogram. Of course, there is basically not a great number of farmers \nthat are in the program--somewhere between 10,000 to 15,000. However, \nwe have seen a steady increase of new farmers that have gone into the \npeanut program. Actually, the peanut program is easier for a new farmer \nto access than is the cotton, wheat or corn program. In order to \nparticipate in these commodity programs, a farmer must produce that \ncrop for 3 to 5 years building a base before they can participate.\n  Really, when you get down to it, ``quota'' means no more than just \nbase, relative to that. So the argument that peanut production is left \nto an exclusive group and therefore nobody else can get into the market \nis misleading. This chart illustrating program participation, using \nUSDA figures, demonstrates that new farmers do have access to peanut \nproduction.\n  The other argument, or criticism that is made, is that peanut quota \nholders do not produce their quota and instead lease, is also \nmisleading. Let us compare it to the other crops. Here we have from the \nU.S. Bureau of Census: In the peanut industry, there are more farmers \nwho own their land and do not rent than in wheat, soybeans or cotton. \nThis is the percentage of those that rent. The reasons that an \nindividual may rent can be all sorts of things. Say a widow only has \nSocial Security, her husband is dead, she wants to rent the quota, but \nthe critics say there is something wrong with that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I will yield at the end of my remarks.\n  This chart illustrates the situation relative to wheat, soybeans and \ncotton, pertaining to the issue of owner-operated and rented. There are \nsome who do rent. However, in this bill, there are provisions that \nwould do away with some of the public entities who own peanut quota, \nbut to do away with the concept of the right to lease one's land, and \ncriticizing those that do, seems to me that we are losing sight of the \noverall situation pertaining to widows, children and others who have, \nover the years, rented their land, or rented their quota. That is a \ndistinction we ought to certainly look at.\n  Now, food safety. We want to show that American peanuts have all \nsorts of safety tests. There are certain prohibited chemicals that \ndomestic producers cannot use in the production of peanuts. Producers \nin foreign countries do not have these same restrictions on pesticides \nthat domestic producers must conform with.\n  Today, under GATT, 74 percent of the peanuts allowed into the \nAmerican edible market come from Argentina. Yet, 50 percent of the \npeanuts that come in from Argentina cannot pass FDA tests in regards to \npesticide residues. They are listed here--I cannot pronounce all of \nthese--including pirimiphos-methyl. And then China--the two leading \nsources of foreign produced peanuts they are talking about is in \nArgentina and China--all Chinese peanuts coming into this country \ncontain pesticide residues that have been banned for in this country. \nThey cannot use these chemicals, yet these chemicals are being used in \nArgentina and China and are then exported to the United States.\n  China also has a particular disease known as stripe virus. Stripe \nvirus is a disease we have to be very careful of. There is another \ndisease called aflatoxin that comes in, when growing peanuts. In \nAmerica, by electronic means, every peanut kernel is inspected. It goes \nthrough an electronic process to be sure that there is no aflatoxin \ncontamination. Aflatoxin has been known to cause cancer, but that \nprocess does not exist in Argentina and does not exist in China. The \nfood safety requirements in regard to peanuts in the United States is a \nvery important issue and something that we ought to be very careful \nabout.\n  The issue of contamination was raised a while ago by one of the \ncommissions on world trade matters in regard to peanuts that were \nstored in Amsterdam. When they were proposed to come into the United \nStates, they were examined, and it was found that there was a \nsubstantial number of rat droppings in the peanuts.\n  I yield to the Senator from Georgia for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Helms). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Alabama. The Senator from \nAlabama has done such a distinguished job in his describing this \nimportant agricultural program and its general benefit to our Nation.\n\n  Let me just say briefly with regard to this particular program, my \nhat is off to the rural community, to the peanut growers who stepped \nforward very early in this process and became a true force in reform. \nThe Senator from Alabama has already acknowledged the enormous reforms \nthat exist in this bill.\n  I might point out in the measure that passed the committee, in the \nmeasure that passed the Balanced Budget Act, this bill saves over $500 \nmillion. This bill lowers the support price 10 percent. The price \nsupport escalator has been eliminated--a 200,000-ton reduction in quota \nhas been accomplished. The bill is replete with reform. The growers, \nthe rural community itself, were at the forefront of accomplishing \nthis. They need to be acknowledged for that. They do not need to be set \naside. They do not need to be reprimanded. This is a farm community \nthat came forward and did what it needs to do.\n  Let me say very quickly, the peanut program has been part of rural \nAmerica for nearly 50 years. The amendment offered by the Senator from \nPennsylvania is like throwing a light switch off. These farmers, these \nrural communities, have been functioning under the set of rules imposed \nupon them by the Government. The Government itself put this plan in \nplace. If we are going to change it, we need to do it in a transitional \nform, which is what this bill does.\n  This program now not only affects the farmers, but it affects the \nentire rural community--banking, the value of land, agribusiness in \ngeneral. It is not the kind of thing that you can come in and \narbitrarily change the rules in 24 months. You cannot do that without \ndoing enormous damage.\n  Let me say this. The communities affected by this program are rural \nand they are poor. In my State, these are the poorest counties in the \nentire State. They have poverty rates of 20 percent, and actions taken \nby the Government that are capricious and without sensitivity to time \ndo enormous damage, enormous damage.\n  The bill, as formed, moves in a market direction. The farm and rural \ncommunities have been a willing partner, but it is a transition so that \nthe communities can adjust to the changes in our time. \n\n[[Page S1022]]\n\n  I will oppose the amendment by the Senator from Pennsylvania. I think \nit is exceedingly important that when we change the way we conduct our \nbusiness, when we change what the Government has put in place, there \nneeds to be an enormous sensitivity to allow the communities to adjust \nand move to change, which is exactly what was accomplished in the bill \nthat came out of committee, and is exactly what was accomplished in the \nbill we sent to the President which he vetoed and which we are \nattempting to replicate here this morning.\n  I commend the Senators from Alabama, from North Carolina, from \nVirginia, for the work they have done to produce this market reform. I \nyield back my time to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Georgia, \nSenator Coverdell, mentioned the economic effect. There has been a \nrecent study by Auburn University on the economic impact in the tri-\nState area of Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, showing that the peanut \nindustry there exceeds $1.3 billion and the employment associated with \neconomic activity related to the peanut industry exceeds 16,000 jobs. \nThis has been based on the way that the Base Closure Commission did \ntheir calculations, the effect not just on peanut farmers, but what \neffect it has on other dealers and communities--the COBRA effect that \nwas set up under the base closures.\n  Going with the Santorum type of amendment would really mean the end \nof the peanut program. You would eliminate 37,500 jobs, with $350 \nmillion in lost farm revenue, $50 million in lost exports, a $750 \nmillion drop in land values, and a $25 million loss in tax revenues. \nThat is just in those three States referenced in the study. It does not \ntake into account other peanut-producing regions. The conclusion is \nthat changes made in the order proposed by Senator Santorum will have a \ntremendous negative economic effect.\n  In order to accurately understand the situation faced by domestic \nproducers relative to foreign growers of peanuts you have to examine \nthe guidelines, restrictions, wage and labor laws, as well as \nenvironmental laws in order to put domestic producers on the same \nplaying field. No. 1, as compared to American peanut producers, they \nare not subject to minimum wages. The farm labor in those countries--in \nChina and in Argentina and even in Mexico or any of the rest of the \npeanut producing countries--is so drastically lower than the wages in \nthe United States. There is no environmental protection, and, of \ncourse, there is no restricted chemical use, as we pointed out.\n  There has to be rigorous post-harvest treatment and rigorous \ninspection here in the United States. None of that exists in the \nforeign countries. So you have a situation where, if you reduce the \nprice support down to the Santorum level, what this is going to mean is \nyou get it down below the cost of production. Then, what it is going to \nmean is you are going to drive those farmers out of business because \nthey cannot afford to produce peanuts and make a profit and still \ncomply with all the stricter wage, environmental, and pesticide \nregulations. Therefore, peanut production will be forced to go \noverseas. The peanut industry has already suffered from unfavorable \ntrade agreements, such as NAFTA and GATT. You are going to have a \nsituation in which you will see there will be no more peanuts grown in \nthe United States. It is going to mean the end of peanut production. \nThen you are going to get peanuts coming in from Argentina, China, \nMexico, and these other places.\n  Another example? In the area which Senator Coverdell talked about, \nthe poor areas of Georgia, there is a large minority participation in \nthe peanut program. The ratio is more than 6 times greater than in the \nnational average in those Southern States. It means those people are \ngoing to be losing jobs relative to the peanut industry.\n  The reform package that is in the Lugar-Leahy-Craig bill, what we \nhave today, already cuts the peanut program by 28 percent. It is a no-\ncost-to-the-Government program, and it has made substantial reforms--\ntoo many, in my judgment. I hope I can do something about it in \nconference to improve it. But, nevertheless, that is the bill before us \nright now. Today, it is a matter of whether you are going to kill a \nreformed peanut program that has worked well or you will support peanut \nproduction in the United States.\n  I understand the Senator from North Carolina, Senator Helms, would \nlike some time. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator has just over a \nminute.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I yield to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator for a little \nunder a minute.\n  Mr. HELMS. This may be the best speech I ever made, Mr. President.\n  I want to compliment the distinguished Senator from Alabama for the \nlucid presentation he has made.\n  I want to say to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, he is \none of my favorites. I am glad he is in the Senate. I know he is \nsincere. But, on this matter, he is sincerely wrong. Mr. President, I \nmust oppose the Santorum amendment because it will do grave harm to \nthousands of small farmers in North Carolina and other peanut-producing \nStates.\n\n  The issue here is the future of the peanut program--and thousands of \njobs. The importance of this modest program can be measured \nstatistically by emphasizing that it provides $1.2 billion in farm \nrevenue, 150,000 jobs, while generating $200 million in exports. Peanut \nfarmers also provide America with a safe and abundant supply of \npeanuts.\n  Mr. President, in North Carolina, peanuts are a major commodity that \nproduces more than $100 million in revenue, while directly and \nindirectly employing more than 200,000 people in the various aspects of \nthe industry.\n  Moreover, the subject of reforming the peanut program was considered \nand debated in the Senate Agriculture Committee.\n  Interestingly enough, peanut farmers have already voluntarily \nreformed the program. They have cut their budgets, agreeing to a 10-\npercent cut in their pockets, and going to a no-net-cost program to \neliminate any cost of the program to the taxpayers.\n  The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] estimates these reforms will \nsave taxpayers over $400 million during the next 7 years.\n  So, Mr. President, I must oppose the Santorum amendment, and urge \nother Senators to do likewise and support the distinguished majority \nleader in his motion to table this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to address the issue of the \nsafety of foreign imported peanuts, which was raised previously by the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama, Senator Heflin.\n  Mr. President, opponents of the peanut program would have you believe \nthat American consumers are being defrauded. As evidence, critics cite \na ``world peanut price'' hundreds of dollars lower per ton than that \nwhich American producers receive under the peanut-price-support \nprogram. What most Americans do not realize, Mr. President, is that \nthose world price peanuts are of a quality and type that would be \nillegal to sell in the United States. I repeat, Mr. President, under \nUSDA rules and regulations for pesticide use and diseased content, most \nof these so-called world price peanuts would be illegal to sell to \nAmerican consumers.\n  Around the world, U.S. peanuts, and especially those of the type \ngrown in my State of Virginia, are recognized as a premium quality \ngrade worthy of a premium price on the world market. American peanut \nfarmers already are the leading exporters in the world, selling one-\nfourth of their crop each year on the world market. This so-called \nworld price for peanuts is artificially deflated because it is based on \nan inferior peanut used primarily for oil and animal feed rather than \nedible use.\n  Domestic peanut growers must meet the strictest health, safety, and \nenvironmental standards in the world. Our producers are limited as to \nthe types and amounts of pesticides and chemical additives that can be \napplied to their crops--restrictions that few, if any, imports can \nmeet.\n  American consumers should know that our peanut farmers cannot \n\n[[Page S1023]]\n  produce peanuts cheaper than their Third World counterparts who are not \nsubject to strict environmental regulations governing the use of \npesticides, fertilizers, and other agrichemicals; worker protection \nlaws; minimum wage laws; consumer protection laws; and USDA quality and \nsafety inspections required of American peanuts.\n  In short, Mr. President, the peanut program provides American \nconsumers with a low cost, stable supply of the highest quality, and \nsafest, peanuts in the world.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask Senator Chafee and Senator Reid be \nadded as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama said we would \nnot be growing peanuts in this country anymore. We would be driving all \nof these peanut farmers out of business with our amendment. What our \namendment does is, over 5 years, we reduce the quota price by roughly \n30 percent, and we then eliminate the quota.\n  How much of the cost of growing peanuts is the quota? The answer is \nroughly 30 percent. We reduce the support price equal to the cost the \nquota adds to the price of peanuts. So it is a wash.\n  What we have done is open up the market so all these additional \ngrowers--we are talking about these little rural communities and all \nthese poor growers. What about these growers who grow peanuts and do \nnot have a quota? They grow peanuts, their price is $132 a ton as \nopposed to, if you are one of these privileged few quota holders, you \nget $678 a ton. So let us think about these folks who just did not \nhappen to have a granddaddy who was at the trough 50, 60 years ago when \nthey were handing out these quotas.\n  Let us look at all the farmers out there working who have to buy \nquota seeds. To even grow additional peanuts, peanuts that do not get \nyou this nice big price, you have to go to the quota holders and buy \ntheir peanuts at their high price so you can plant your poor peanuts, \nthat are just as good in quality but you do not happen to have a quota.\n  The Senator from Alabama said a lot of things. First off, CBO says \nour savings in our amendment are the same as under the bill. There will \nbe no increased costs to the Government under the bill.\n  Second, the Senator from Alabama said under our bill, 49 percent of \nthe farmers would not be able to get loans in the first year. That is \ndifferent from the underlying bill. I remind the Senator from Alabama \nwe cut the support price in the first year of this bill the same as the \nunderlying bill. We do not change the first year. We go to $610. The \nunderlying bill is $610. To suggest we do the same thing and somehow 49 \npercent more people are not going to be eligible for loans does not \nmake any sense.\n\n  The Senator talked about how we sell peanut butter to the School \nLunch Program at a greatly reduced price, much less than market price. \nFirst off, I do not know anybody who does not sell bulk, to a mass \nconsumer, in bulk quantities, cheaper than they do when they have to \nput it in little 6- or 8- or 10-ounce jars and market it. Of course, \nthey are going to charge them less, as any bulk purchaser gets less \nwhen you are buying in that size than something you were going to \nmarket at a local convenience store. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, in 1991 the USDA suspended peanut butter purchases, peanut \nbutter sales for school lunch. School lunch programs suspended it. Why? \nBecause peanut butter prices were too high. They could not afford it \nanymore, so they had to suspend it. Why? Because we were making a lot \nof farmers who, again, their granddaddy had a quota, they were making a \nlot of money and our schoolchildren are not getting peanut butter \nbecause it is too expensive.\n  He looked at foreign price. I remind the Senator, as I am sure he \nknows, America is somewhat unique in the world in the consumption of \npeanuts. Most of the people around the world do not eat peanuts like we \ndo. Most grown in the rest of the world is used for feed for animals. \nVery little is used for food for consumers. It is considered, I would \nnot say a delicacy, but in a sense a very rare item for people to \nconsume.\n  We consume in this country over 70 percent of the world's peanuts for \nhuman consumption. To suggest because a couple of countries that do not \nsell a lot of peanuts have very high prices, it would be like maybe in \nthis country our prices for caviar are higher than they are in Russia, \nor something like that, where you have an indigenous food that people \nconsume versus something that is a luxury in other countries. That is \nnot a fair comparison.\n  Another amazing point that was made, the Senator compared the peanut \nprogram with the cotton program and the wheat program and said these \nother programs rent out their land for production of this crop. The \ndifference is, if you rent your land out for the production of cotton \nor wheat, you can still sell that cotton or wheat in this country. \nThere is no quota. The difference with peanuts is, when you rent that \nland out, you rent the quota. If you do not have a quota, you cannot \nsell your peanuts in this country.\n  So it is not the same. I mean, the difference is anyone can rent land \nto grow cotton. You can sell the cotton here. But unless you have a \nquota, you cannot sell your peanuts here in this country. You talk \nabout the small rural farmer, the guy who goes out and sweats every day \nto grow those peanuts, and he cannot sell them because you had \nsomebody's granddaddy at the trough 50 or 60 years ago because he was \nable to get a quota because he knew somebody.\n  If people do not understand quotas--a liquor license is the same \nthing. What is a liquor license? It is a piece of paper. It is not \nworth anything. If you sell a liquor license, you get a lot of money \nbecause it gives one an opportunity to do something that nobody else \ncan do. You cannot sell liquor in this country without a liquor \nlicense. And you cannot sell peanuts in this country unless you have a \nlittle piece of paper saying you can sell peanuts.\n  Is that American? Is that what we want to do to allow the privileged \nfew--by the way, 70 percent of the people who grow quota peanuts who \nhave this license rent that license. It is owned by somebody else, some \nfat cat sitting in New York City, or Paris, or someplace. They trade \nthem like securities.\n  So what do they do? They make a lot of money so a bunch of folks can \nsit and work their tails off. For what? For what? Basically, the world \nprice for peanuts is what they ultimately get. Who makes this \ndifferent? A bunch of fat cats who buy liquor--quota--licenses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, you have to have a piece of paper, a \nlicense, to sell liquor. This is different. The largest peanut farmer \nin the country does not have a quota. He is in California, and he has \n5,000 acres of peanuts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, do I have time to ask unanimous consent?\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may follow the Senator from Nevada \nwith an amendment after the next majority amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan], for himself, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Bumpers, and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3447 to amendment No. 3184.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In Title II, Section 202, on page 2-2, line 8, strike \n     ``$100,000,000'' and insert ``$70,000,000'' where \n     appropriate.\n       In Title II, Section 202, on page 2-2. after line 9 and \n     before line 10 insert the following:\n       ``Provided further, That funds made available under this \n     Act to carry out the non-generic activities of the market \n     promotion program established under section 203 of the \n     Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5623) may be used to \n     provide cost-share assistance only to organizations that are \n     non-foreign entities and are recognized as small business \n     concerns under section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 632(a)) or to associations described in the first \n     section of the Act entitled `An Act to authorize association \n     of producers of agricultural products,' approved February 22, \n     1922 (7 U.S.C. 291).\n       Provided further, That such funds may not be used to \n     provide cost-share assistance to a foreign eligible trade \n     organization:\n       Provided further, That none of the funds made available \n     under this Act may be used to carry out the market promotion \n     program established under section 203 of the Agricultural \n     Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5623) if the aggregate amount of \n     funds and value of commodities under the program exceeds \n     $70,000,000.''\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  For the Record, I want to make sure that the Record reflects that \nthis amendment is a joint amendment by my distinguished colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry, Senator Bumpers, and Senator Reid.\n  Mr. President, I think that those who have followed the debate on \nagricultural issues know that this Senator has not been a supporter of \nthe Market Promotion Program. In the limited time that I have available \nthis morning, I want to offer an amendment that was previously approved \non the floor of the Senate on September 20 of last year by 62 to 36. My \npreference would be to eliminate the Market Promotion Program, which \nhas cost the American taxpayer more than $1 billion, because I think it \nis a poster child for corporate entitlements in America and is without \njustification.\n  I yield to the pragmatic consideration that, although I have \nattempted on a number of occasions, joined by my friends on the floor, \nSenator Kerry and Senator Bumpers, to eliminate this program, we have \nbeen unsuccessful. So last September we crafted a compromise which \nsaid, among other things, that we will limit this program so that \nforeign corporations will no longer be eligible to receive payments.\n  I might say parenthetically that in the last year in which there is \ndata available, some $12 million of taxpayer money went to foreign \ncorporations to help them supplement their advertising budgets. In \naddition, some of the largest corporations in America are beneficiaries \nunder this program--companies that ought to be charged with handling \ntheir own advertising and promotional expense without reference to \ntaxpayer subsidies.\n  Here are some of the major corporations in the country in 1993, 1994: \nErnest & Julio Gallo, $7.9 million; Dole, $2.4 million; Pillsbury, \n$1.75 million; Tyson Foods, $1.7 million. And the list goes on.\n  This amendment would limit the branded promotion programs to those \nthat fall within the definition of the small business company under \nother provisions of the Federal Code.\n  It is my view that we should adopt a responsible compromise that has \nenjoyed the support of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nplace a limitation on this program in each of the two specifics which I \nhave just mentioned, and also to cap the program at $70 million. Under \nthe current proposed legislation which we are debating on the floor, \nthe Market Promotion Program would continue in each of the 7 years at a \n$100 million annual funding level.\n  We have talked a lot about curtailing Federal expenditures, taking a \nlook and making some of the tough decisions, downsizing Government. I \nhave listened to a great many speeches on both sides of the aisle. This \nis our opportunity to strike a modest blow for fiscal sanity by putting \na cap on this program and limiting the expenditures to $70 million \nannually. There can be no conceivable justification for providing \ntaxpayer-assisted funding to supplement the advertising budgets of \ncompanies the size of those that are listed in this exhibit that I have \noffered on the floor.\n  I might add further that the number of companies who have received \nassistance, of the 200 largest corporate advertisers listed in the 1992 \nStandard Directory of Advertisers, 13 of those companies received \nmarket promotion programs involving some $9 million in 1992.\n  So we think that this is something that has been before the Senate. \nIt has enjoyed bipartisan support. We think it makes sense, and we ask \nfor its consideration.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and am prepared to yield 5 minutes \nto the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Nevada for \nhis persistent efforts and for his tenacity in trying to address this \nquestion of inappropriate corporate welfare. I think all of us here \nwould understand and be sympathetic to the notion that, if there are \nsituations in our trading relations where you have a company that is \nhard pressed and disadvantaged against competition, as some of our \ncompanies are in certain industries, then it is conceivable that you \ncan make a legitimate argument that you want to find some kind of \nGovernment subsidy to redress the imbalance in the marketplace.\n  I know, for instance, that Airbus received significant subsidies. And \nBoeing and McDonnell Douglas have to compete against the French, or \nagainst other countries in those industries where there is a very \nsignificant subsidy. But here we have a situation where companies that \nare extraordinarily profitable are going to sell their products abroad \nanyway for which there is a market for those products anyway, where \nthey are profitable beyond any of the need criteria that you might try \nto establish, and nevertheless the taxpayers of this country are simply \nreimbursing them for a subsidy for an advertising budget that they \nwould expend anyway.\n  Let me be very explicit about that. The M Mars company, for \ninstance, has about a $262 million advertising budget. They spend that \nno matter what. When a company spokesman was asked, ``What do you think \nabout taking these Government funds?'' the company spokesman's answer \nwas, ``Well, you know, it is sort of like the mortgage interest rate \ndeduction. If it is there, you take advantage of it.'' So they take \nadvantage of the funds. It is not even a question of being need based.\n  At a time when everyone is looking for a responsible way to make \njudgments, critical judgments about who deserves Government assistance \nand who does not, it is simply wrong--it is just wrong, wrong \neconomically, wrong politically, wrong morally, wrong on every kind of \nbalance--to suggest that these companies with their--look at Tyson \nFoods. What is Tyson Foods doing getting a subsidy at this point in \ntime for this?\n  I like Tyson Foods. I like what they do. We are enormously proud of \nwhat they have accomplished and of what they are capable of doing. But \nat a time when we are being asked to cut back on education funding, on \nenvironmental cleanup, on science research, on the R tax credit, on \nall kinds of things that are important, how can you justify this kind \nof effort?\n  There are some small companies, there are some people working at a \ngreat disadvantage in the international marketplace against countries \nthat have a much greater degree of assistance and of partnership \nbetween the Government and the private sector than we do that may need \nsome kind of leverage. It is with that in mind that \n\n[[Page S1025]]\nthe Senator from Nevada and those of us who are promoting a change are \nnot suggesting, even though we think this is not an appropriate program \noverall, we think that it is fair to recognize those small areas of \nneed and simply to cut this program back to the $70 million cap.\n  When you measure this particular program and whatever justifications \nare given for it against the extraordinary reductions that we are \nfacing in title I funds, in drug free safe school money, in Pell \ngrants, in student loans, in environmental enforcement, in \ninfrastructure development, in science and research, in global climate \nchange research--you can run down the gambit and every one of those \nfundamental needs are being reduced--how can you justify continuing \nthis kind of corporate welfare?\n  I think most Americans are not even aware that this kind of subsidy \nis taking place, and every American that I have ever talked to, when \nyou explain to them what is happening, their eyes bug out and they \nsimply are aghast at the notion that this is what people in Washington \nare choosing to do with their money. The American citizen knows this is \ninappropriate, it is unnecessary, and measured against all the other \nchoices that we are making in Washington it is plain and simply wrong.\n  I am grateful to the Senator from Nevada for being willing to lead \nthe charge here in an effort to try to redress it. I hope the Senate \nwill once again vote as it did previously. We won this battle in the \nSenate. Unfortunately, as is so often the case here in Washington, the \ninterests come into the conference committee or get one or two people \nto hold up everything and so it was taken out in the conference, and \nhere we are back again. This is the same history that we had on a mink \nsubsidy and on the wool and mohair subsidy, and ultimately we will win \nthis battle because it is the right thing to do.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Mississippi as \nmuch time as he wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this is a subject we have debated on a \nnumber of different occasions on the floor of the Senate. I recall when \nwe had the agriculture appropriations bill before the Senate this past \nyear there were amendments offered to change various parts of the legal \nauthorization for the program, the statutory authorization. We resisted \nthose amendments on the appropriations bill and tried to keep the focus \non the amount of money that was being appropriated for the program.\n  As I understand the history of this amendment, when it was brought up \non the appropriations bill, the Senate passed it, or a version of it. I \nam advised by members of my staff that on that occasion when we went to \nconference the House conferees did not agree to accept the language and \nthe provision was dropped. It did not make it through the process to be \nincluded in the appropriations bill as finally adopted and submitted to \nthe President for his signature. So that is why this issue is raised \nagain.\n  Let me just point out, while this is a controversial program, and \nsome of the television networks have sort of made a hobby at least, if \nnot a profession, of attacking it and exaggerating it and trying to \nsensationalize it as something that is evil and not workable, the facts \nare that this is a program which has created American jobs because it \nhas expanded our level of exports in agriculture commodity trade and in \nfood product trade to the extent that it has been reauthorized. It has \nbeen supported by this Senate and the House as well time after time \nbecause of the evidence. The evidence is that this program works. It \nwas originally designed to be targeted against unfair trade practices \nby our competitors around the world. It was called the targeted export \nassistance program. The fact is it continues to work in that way \nbecause funds are allocated by the Department of Agriculture where \nthere are special problems or special opportunities and only this kind \nof assistance is considered to be effective.\n\n  So I urge Senators to look at this amendment very carefully. I am not \ngoing to get all out of breath, or red in the face, arguing against it \nagain. But I am going to say we should vote against this. It \nunnecessarily restricts--unnecessarily restricts--the Department of \nAgriculture, in the administration of the program. The Department of \nAgriculture has submitted testimony time and time again about how this \nhas been a very useful program. I hope the Senate will not be stampeded \nby the clever arguments that are being made by my good friends who \ncontinue to take this issue up and make a semicareer out of attacking \nthe Market Promotion Program. It is a good program, and I am going to \nvote against the amendment. I hope Senators will join me in doing so.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask for 5 minutes from my distinguished \ncolleague.\n  First of all, I compliment my good friend from Nevada for his \nperseverance in trying to rein in, if not torpedo totally, a program \nthat has absolutely no justification. He has been very diligent about \nthis, and I have been honored to stand by his side to try to bring some \nsanity to the agriculture program but especially to eliminate the \nMarket Promotion Program. As long as this program is on the books, at \nleast once a year every news magazine in the country, from ``60 \nMinutes'' on down, is going to do a piece on it.\n  Every time they do a piece on it, millions of Americans are going to \nsay, ``What on Earth are those clowns thinking about? How on Earth can \nthey justify such a program as this?'' Well, America, the answer is, we \ncannot.\n  If I had my druthers, I would torpedo this program to zero. But the \nSenator from Nevada is not asking to cut the program totally. He is \nsaying go back to the figure the Senate adopted 62 to 32 about 6 months \nago, and put it back where the Senate had it at that time. It was \npassed overwhelmingly here.\n  I am not going to belabor the arguments that have already been made, \nbut the one salient argument that the Senator from Massachusetts and \nthe Senator from Nevada has made--and I will make it again because you \ncannot make it often enough--what in the name of God are we doing \nsubsidizing Ernest and Julio Gallo, even Tyson Foods, the biggest \nemployer in my State, and Jim Beam? That ought to make the Christian \nCoalition happy.\n  All we are saying is, in the future we are going to do what GAO \nrecommended, except for one thing: They recommended that it be cut to a \nsmall business, generic, a new-to-exports small business program and \nfunded at no more than $50 million. The Senator from Nevada's amendment \nsays $70 million. Of course, that is $70 million too much, but we live \nin a real world around here. We know we cannot torpedo the thing \nbecause big business has too many defenders in this body.\n  The second thing GAO said is there is absolutely no proof that we are \nnot simply replacing money these corporations would use on their own. \nEverybody knows that is true. It is just a piece of welfare. If I were \nthe Gallo brothers, if I were Ralston Purina, Tyson Foods, Campbell \nSoup, Jim Beam, whoever, I would take the money, too.\n  But, colleagues, here is what this amendment does. It says, No. 1, \nyou cannot give this money directly to a big business. You can give it \nto a generic institute. You can give it to Riceland Foods. You can give \nit to any of these national coalitions that have as their members all \nthe poultry industry, all the liquor industry, those kinds of things. \nBut we also confine it to generic small business as defined by the \nSmall Business Administration.\n  It is a tragedy that we cannot kill this program. When I think about \nwhat we are doing to worthy programs in discretionary spending and \nstanding here, pleading with you to cut the most outrageous program \nthat we fund from $110 to $70 million, it is unfathomable.\n  So, Mr. President, let me say the jobs the Senator from Mississippi \ntalks \n\n[[Page S1026]]\nabout this creating, GAO says those are jobs we created anyway. Do you \nthink McDonald's is going to quit trying to sell Big Mac's all over the \nworld if we do not give them money?\n  Let me close by the saying I have had an excellent relationship with \nthe Senator from Mississippi. Back before a terribly untoward event \nhappened in November 1994, I was chairman of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee and he was my ranking member. Now he is \nchairman and I am his ranking member. This is one of the few \ndisagreements he and I ever had. We get along just fine in that \ncommittee and worked out those appropriations bills jointly, and I hope \nfor the country's benefit. This is one place I strongly disagree.\n  I hope our colleagues will again vote 62 to 32 to pass this \namendment. I yield the floor and yield back such time as I have to the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield as much time to the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho that he may require.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my chairman for yielding, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will not stand before any of the Members \nof the Senate today and attempt to justify large multinational, \nbillion-dollar corporations getting taxpayer-subsidized promotion \nprograms. That needs to be reformed, no question about it.\n  In the committee this year we have reduced the overall level of \nfunding from $110 to $100 million. But the reason the chairman of the \nappropriations subcommittee, who just spoke, and the reason I am on the \nfloor defending the program is because we are trying to take the \nGovernment out of production agriculture and put the Government in the \nright and proper role as it relates to its relationship to domestic \nindustries. And that is for small producers who have to compete against \nsubsidized producers in foreign countries, our Government should serve \nas a leveler of the playing field.\n  That is where our Government can work best. We know that in our \ncountry today for American agriculture to flourish, it must sell in \nforeign markets. And, oh, yes, by the way, every item that one of those \ncompanies sells in many instances is produced by a small producer and \nsold to that company that then markets it in a foreign country. That is \nthe other side of the story.\n  But what I am interested in are the marketing co-ops and the \nassociations that go to countries to develop markets so that we can \nsell to them directly our products. That is where market promotion \nworks at its very best. That is what the ag committee is really trying \nto get at.\n  I am not going to be stampeded by a couple of great, dramatic \ntelevision programs. That should not dictate policy on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate. It should make us aware of policy that is in trouble, that \ndeserves to be corrected. That is exactly what we are trying to do.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Nevada and the \nSenator from Idaho are not going to defend McDonald's. They do not need \nhelp. But those who produce the commodities that build the components \nof the food they sell need to be assured that they have full access to \nforeign markets under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and \nall other trade agreements we get into.\n\n  The only way we can maintain profitability at the production level on \nthe farm is to assure that our Government works in cooperation with \nthat producer in assuring them the level playing field and the access \nto foreign markets.\n  I am sorry, if we do not do that, if we allow foreign barriers to be \nconstantly built against our producers, without the advantage of \nbreaking those barriers down, then surplus arrives, profitability \ndrops, and guess where we will be? We will have agriculture lined up at \nthe door of the Congress once again, saying, ``You have got to help us \nout. You have got to provide a minimum income level. We're all going \nbroke.''\n  The transition that we have been involved in for well over a decade, \nMr. President, has been to move the farmer to the market and allow that \nfarmer to produce for a market. And that market is an international \nmarket as well as a domestic market. The Market Promotion Program has \nbeen designed to expand that foreign market and create a greater desire \non the part of the foreign consumer for the U.S. agricultural product. \nIt has worked in spades. We know that. USDA knows it. That is why it \nhas defended it. It has been misused. We all know that. We are working \nto correct that. I am going be as aggressive as anyone in getting it \ndone.\n  We have cut the funding now. That is a responsible action to take. We \nwill target and prioritize the money where it should be under the \npremise that I have laid out. That, I think, is the premise that all \nhave agreed on was the intent of the program originally.\n  So I hope the Senate will reject this amendment. It is important that \nwe look internationally when we think about American agriculture. That \nis a role where Government can play a responsible part as a partner \nwith our domestic U.S. farmer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Let me say briefly that I believe the Senator from Idaho \nought to support this amendment. All it does is give the taxpayers' \ndollars to be used by foreign corporations with respect to the granting \nof promotions, like McDonald's.\n  This says, look, no longer are they to be subsidized. We protect the \nrights of the co-ops to continue to participate in this program. I \nthink we are in agreement, as I understood the thrust of his argument.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, as they did on \nSeptember 20 of last year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The time \nremaining in opposition is 5 minutes, 57 seconds.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I see no other Senators on our side of the \naisle who wish to be heard on this amendment. Therefore, I yield back \nour time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has been yielded back. All time has \nbeen yielded back on the amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Bryan \namendment be set aside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on \nthis amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is set aside.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Santorum \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask for the yeas and nays \non the two amendments I offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to asking for the yeas and \nnays? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Might I inquire if there is going to be another amendment \non the other side. The clock is ticking.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I will respond to the distinguished Senator, there is no \none present on our side of the aisle, therefore, the Senator can \nproceed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand there is a unanimous-consent agreement that \nSenator Ford was going to go next. If he is not available, then I have \nan amendment I want to offer. I want to make sure Senator Ford offers \nhis amendment, but I do not want to let the clock tick, because we are \nunder time pressure.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I suggest now it would be good to expedite the situation \nby asking the Senator from Iowa to offer his amendment. We are going to \nhave a backup.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto \n\n[[Page S1027]]\noffer my amendment but that Senator Ford be able to offer the next \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Will the Senator modify the request to state the next \nDemocratic amendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3448 to Amendment No. 3184\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the eligibility criteria for the Environmental \n                       Quality Incentive Program)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3448 to amendment No. 3184.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Section 314 is amended by striking ``(ii) 10,000 beef \n     cattle'' and all that follows through ``lambs;'' and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(ii) 1,000 beef cattle;\n       ``(iii) 100,000 laying hens or broilers;\n       ``(iv) 55,000 turkeys;\n       ``(v) 2,500 swine; or\n       ``(vi) 10,000 sheep or lambs.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will try not to take much time on this. \nWhat this amendment does is to reinstate the limits on the size of \nlivestock operations eligible to receive benefits under the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentive Program.\n  Last year, the distinguished Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, and \nSenator Leahy introduced a bill called the Environmental Quality \nIncentive Program. Quite frankly, it was based upon a bill I introduced \nseveral years earlier called the Water Quality Incentive Program. So I \nhave been very supportive of it. I think it is a good bill. I have no \nproblems with it because it provides for technical assistance. It \nprovides for cost-sharing assistance and incentive payments for farmers \nto meet environmental problems with their livestock operations.\n  In the original bill that the Senator from Indiana introduced last \nyear, there were the following limits, and if you went over these \nlimits, you would not be eligible for cost sharing by the Government, \nand things like that. Let me read the limits: 1,000 beef cattle; \n100,000 laying hens or broilers; 55,000 turkeys; 2,500 swine; or 10,000 \nsheep and lambs. That was in the original bill last year.\n  In the bill before us today, all of those numbers have been bumped up \nto incredible extremes. Rather than 1,000 cattle, we now have 10,000 \nbeef cattle. Rather than 2,500 hogs, we now have 15,000 hogs. And \nrather than 100,000 laying hens or broilers, which I do not know a \ngreat deal about, we have 150,000.\n  I think the original bill that Senator Lugar and Senator Leahy \nintroduced had good limits. Why? Because those numbers in the original \nbill corresponded to the provisions of the Clean Water Act--I should \nsay, corresponded to the provisions of regulations implementing the \nClean Water Act--in terms of livestock concentrations.\n  So basically, the bill before us raises these limits up to what I \nthink are really unconscionably high levels.\n  You might say, ``Well, look, if they are big operators and they are \npolluting, we want to solve these environmental problems, so why not \nlet some of this money in cost sharing and taxpayers' money go to some \nof the bigger operators to clean up their environmental problems?''\n  My point is that these larger operators fall under the provisions of \nthe Clean Water Act, and they have to clean up their act. They have to \ndo that.\n  Take a smaller farmer who has maybe 1,000 hogs, maybe he has 1,000 \nbeef cattle, a family-size operation. That farmer does not have to meet \nthe provisions of the Clean Water Act, but it would be nice if he did \nso. It would help us all out. So the limited amount of money that we \nare going to have to help clean up our environmental problems, I think, \nwould better be directed toward the smaller family farmers because it \nwill give them an incentive to do so. They do not have to do so, but \ncost sharing, technical assistance and support will give them the kind \nof incentive to go ahead and put in waste management control systems, \nlagoons, and things like that.\n  For these bigger operators who have 10,000 beef cattle or 15,000 \nhogs, they have to do it anyway. They are so big, they ought to have \nthe capital resources that would allow them to do that. Quite frankly, \nmost of them do. So rather than taking the limited amount of money that \nwe are going to have and try and spread it out--and let us face it, \nbigger operators have attorneys, they have accountants, they know how \nto go after Federal dollars. You can bet your bottom dollar that the \nbiggest operators will be in there to get the cost share and technical \nassistance. What the heck, free money. If I am a big operator and I \nhave to comply with the Clean Water Act and there is a pot of \nGovernment money over here that I can go after that will help me meet \nthe requirements of the law and I do not have to dip into shareholders' \nequities or anything like that, well, I will do that, I will go after \nthe free Government money.\n  That is what will happen under the provisions in the bill before us. \nThe larger operators will go after the Government money, squeeze out \nthe smaller guy. The smaller family farmer has 500 hogs, 1,000 hogs, \n700 head of beef cattle. They do not even know this provision is there \nprobably, or if it is there, they will not know how to apply for it. \nBut if we limit it to those smaller operators, then that is where the \nmoney will go, and we can focus it where it is needed.\n  So I really do not understand why the initial numbers that were in \nthe Lugar-Leahy bill were changed. I thought they were quite adequate. \nI think there should be a limit on Federal assistance to these larger \noperations. In order to get large, they have to have capital resources. \nThey could not get large if they did not have the capital. If they have \nthe capital, then they have the money to make sure they meet the \nprovisions of the Clean Water Act.\n  So, again, I will just say, yes, they do have problems, but they can \nsolve them themselves. The Federal Government should not be subsidizing \nthe growth of large operations. My point is that large hog and cattle \noperations are first and foremost a State issue. States ought to \naddress that issue forcefully. But second, I do not believe the Federal \nGovernment, the taxpayers, ought to be in the position of subsidizing \nin any way the growth of these large operations, and that really is \nwhat this would do under this bill as it is before us.\n  So basically, to repeat, all my amendment does is it takes the \nnumbers for livestock operations that would be eligible for technical \nassistance and cost-sharing incentive payments to meet environmental \nstandards under the Environmental Quality Incentive Program.\n  It just reinstates those numbers that were in the bill last year. \nAgain, I want to make it clear that the large operations can still get \nthe technical assistance. I do not mind that. They just cannot get cost \nshare to build an animal waste facility. So that is all I am saying. As \nfar as the cost share money goes, let us target that to the smaller \noperators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield time to myself as I may require.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the spirit of the argument. I pay tribute \nto the distinguished Senator from Iowa for the work he has done in this \narea of environmental consideration for livestock. It is an important \narea in his State and in mine and in the many States that our committee \nserves. The program does offer us, through the cost-sharing situation, \nan opportunity to make a difference in encouraging smaller operations \nto have more environmentally satisfactory hog operations, although it \nis not limited to that.\n  The Senator pointed out that there are limits with regard to cattle \nand turkeys and chickens. The problem here, Mr. President, is trying to \narrive at some compromise in terms of the size of operations farmers \nnow have. \n\n[[Page S1028]]\n The original limitations on size, I believe, were derived from the \nClean Water Act regulations that discussed confined feeding operations \nin the 1970's. That was the genesis, at least, as I recall of the \nfigures at the time. Of course, the average size of the facilities for \nfeeding of livestock and birds has increased very, very substantially.\n  I make no case, specifically, for the figures that the committee came \nup with and that are incorporated in this legislation as having the \nwisdom of Solomon. They are clearly a compromise, after listening to a \nlarge number of producers and trying to think through the intent of the \nact, which, as the Senator from Iowa has stated correctly, is one of \ntrying to help smaller producers, with the thought that the larger \nproducers will have to take care of their own expenses.\n  My point is that these terms are relative. Some can move way off the \nspectrum and they are very large indeed, and under no circumstances are \nthey going to qualify for cost-sharing money. The argument has been \nabout what ought to be the limits as to what is a small- or even \nmedium-size producer under these terms. The Senator from Iowa has \nprobably visited with the pork caucus in Iowa and, within the last week \nhe will have discussed this, I suspect, with many Iowa hog producers \nwho were raising questions about--in terms of the number of hogs in the \noperation, as well as the payment--the limit of $10,000. In both cases, \nthe point they have made--and it is a very lively issue in Iowa--about \nthe size of hog situations and environmental consequences, because Iowa \nis a very important pork production State. It is the same in Illinois, \nIndiana, really, across the corn belt where there are large hog \nproduction situations.\n  Certainly, a number of farmers who came to visit with me about this \nwanted still a higher limit to qualify. In other words, they had more \nanimals than the limit. They were past the cutoff and they were not \ngoing to qualify. They want to get the threshold up higher. They would \nlike to see more money, likewise. I understand what they are saying. I \nwas not able to offer them promises that this is likely to occur, given \na limited amount of money and what have been some very extensive \nconversations with producers of all sizes.\n  I say, Mr. President, that the Senator raises a good point and is the \ntype of consideration probably best discussed in a roundtable \ndiscussion of many producers of different sizes to bring some reality \ninto the argument as to how hogs and cattle are now produced in America \nand what size operations we are headed toward. It is in that spirit \nthat I simply defend the work we have done and the reasonably pragmatic \ncompromise, based upon the sums of money available, and the actual size \nof operation in the country now. I hope the Senate will support that, \nunless there is a substantially greater preponderance of evidence that \nwe have simply missed the mark by a whole lot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will not take much more time. I \nappreciate the arguments made by my friend from Indiana. I have visited \nwith hog farmers in Iowa, too, and there is a battle going on in my \nState, and it is not a very pretty one. There are decisions being made \nabout these large hog operations in Iowa. I do not think that is the \npoint of this argument here. The point of my amendment is simply to \nsay, in terms of cost-share money coming from the Government--and it is \nnot a bottomless pit--let us focus that money on our smaller family \nfarmers, who are really not that well-equipped with working capital \nsometimes to meet the higher standards of environmental quality. In \nmany cases, they do not have to, but with the cost-share program, this \nwould give them incentive to do so. The larger operations can handle \nthemselves. They have the capital to do so. When you are talking about \n15,000 hogs, that is an extremely large operation in any State. If you \nare talking about 10,000 cattle, that is a lot of cattle.\n  So I think the original numbers that were in the bill, which, as the \nSenator from Indiana pointed out, do correspond with the regulations \ncovering the Clean Water Act. I believe they still hold pretty true \ntoday and will in the future, again, when we are looking at a limited \npot of money we can use. I do not need to take any more time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to support the Harkin amendment. \nI had filed an amendment virtually identical to this, that I will place \nin the Record.\n  Due to the unanimous-consent agreement reached last night between the \n2 leaders, the Republicans could offer only 5 amendments, while the \nDemocrats are able to offer 10.\n  Because of this limitation, I was not able to offer the amendment, so \nI will lend my support to the Harkin amendment.\n  The Harkin amendment will lower the caps to determine what livestock \nproducers are eligible for cost-share funds under the new Environmental \nQuality Incentive Program.\n  Mr. President, it is good public policy to assist farmers in \ncomplying with environmental regulations; the environment benefits, the \npublic benefits, and agriculture benefits. Farmers who grow corn, \nsoybeans, cotton, wheat, and many other crops have for many years \nreceived cost-share funds to implement environmental measures.\n  So, I approve of extending this assistance to livestock producers. \nHowever, there needs to be limits on what producers can receive USDA \nfunds.\n  In the original farm bill, contained in the Balanced Budget Act, the \nSenate approved limits on what producers can receive funds. Only hog \nproducers with less than 2,500 hogs and cattle producers with less than \n1,000 head of cattle were eligible.\n  But when this provision went into conference, these caps were raised \nto 15,000 hogs and 10,000 cattle. So now every large livestock \ncontinent and every factory hog farm can receive money from the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to help them comply with regulations.\n  The problem is, these type of farmers already have the capital to \nimplement these measures. In fact, the Clean Water Act already requires \nthem to do so.\n  This may not be a bad thing if Congress had an infinite amend of \nmoney to spend on this problem. But we do not.\n  In fact, under this bill only $100 million is authorized for \nlivestock assistance each year. With this limited amount of money, it \nis essential that we target assistance to the independent pork producer \nwho is forced to compete with the large factory-type hog farmers.\n  The independent hog producer can compete in this environment only if \nthey have a level playing field. Providing funds to large factory \nfarmers skews this playing field.\n  The caps in the originally passed Senate bill were reasonable--as are \nthe caps in the Harkin amendment. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be printed in the Record so \nthat you know exactly my intentions.\n  There being no objection, the text of the amendment was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n\n         amendment to substitute amendment no. 3184 to S. 1541\n\n    (Purpose: To target benefits under the Livestock Environmental \n Assistance Program to family farmers and to limit the amount any one \n                          farmer can receive)\n\n       Page 3-14, line 25 strike ``10,000'' and replace with \n     ``1000''.\n       Page 3-15, line 3 strike ``15,000'' and replace with \n     ``2500''.\n       Page 3-27, line 11 insert a period after ``$10,000'' and \n     strike everything through line 12.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I understand we have 30 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we have talked a lot this morning about \ncommodity programs--for good reason, they are the heart of the farm \nbill and the heart of rural America. However, unless we turn our \nattention to other priorities in rural America, we will be neglecting \nthe needs of millions of our citizens who live in our small towns.\n  To make sure we stay competitive, we have to make sure we maintain \nthe infrastructure that has made American agriculture second to none, \nour research, conservation, and economic opportunities for small towns.\n  To meet those objectives, I am offering an amendment to create a fund \nfor rural America. Over 3 years, this initiative will dedicate $300 \nmillion to meeting those needs--$50 million in fiscal year 1996, $100 \nmillion in fiscal year 1997, and $150 million in fiscal year 1998 for \ninvesting in meeting those priorities.\n  One of the top priorities must be keeping our research programs \ngoing. They make sure our farmers have the most up-to-date, most \nefficient farming techniques. This amendment will enable the Secretary \nto augment current programs and keep American agricultural ahead of the \ncompetition.\n  This amendment will, second, enable the Secretary to invest in \npriorities to enhance economic growth in rural towns--in sewer and \nwater grants, for example. As we prepare American agriculture for the \n21st century, we have to make sure that our children, our grandchildren \nhave economic opportunities to stay in our small towns.\n  This piece of legislation is the only one the Senate will consider \nthat will deal primarily with rural America. Unless we meet all the \nneeds in rural America--not just the real and pressing needs of our \nfarmers--then we will have done a disservice to rural Americans. We \nmust take this opportunity to invest in meeting the needs agriculture \nwill have to address to stay competitive and provide our citizens--and \nmillions around the world--with an abundant, affordable food supply.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, on our side of the aisle we share the need \nfor a very, very, strong agriculture development program. I have \nconfirmed with the distinguished Secretary of Agriculture, even again \nthis morning, about the multiple uses of that money \n\n[[Page S1030]]\nin our rural areas, including agricultural research, as well as sewer \nand water grants.\n  I think it is an important initiative. It is one that has been \nextremely important, President Clinton's priorities and the Secretary \nof Agriculture's priorities, but equally important on our side of the \naisle throughout the years in hearings we have held and work we have \ndone in agriculture development.\n  Therefore, I share in supporting the amendment of the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky. I am hopeful it might have unanimous passage.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am prepared to yield back time on our side unless other \nSenators wish to address the issue.\n  Mr. FORD. I am perfectly willing to yield back my time, and if there \nis no objection, we can pass the amendment. I yield back my time, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The question is on agreeing to \nthe amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3449) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 3444\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask my amendment now be the pending business, and I send \na modification of my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       On page 1-3, strike lines 5 through 14.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I know of no objection to my amendment. I \nask the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3444), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3450 to Amendment No. 3184\n\n     (Purpose: To strike the section relating to the sugar program)\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, may I inquire of the manager the present \nstatus of the timeframe? I understand I have half an hour, but the vote \nis scheduled for 11:30. I ask, if it is agreeable to the managers, that \nI be given my half hour before the votes go forward.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous-consent that the 30 minutes for debate \noriginally agreed to in the unanimous consent request be in order and \nthat the vote occur at the end of that debate of the Senator from New \nHampshire, which will be approximately 11:35 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for himself, \n     Mr. Reid, Mr. Santorum, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. \n     Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered 3450 to amendment No. \n     3184.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, none of \n     the provisions dealing with or extending the Sugar Price \n     Support Program shall be enforced.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. As I understand, I now control 15 minutes and someone in \nopposition controls 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, what this amendment does is address the sugar program. \nThe sugar program has been an item of considerable controversy here in \nthe Senate and in the House and in the farm program generally.\n  The sugar program is, in my opinion, an outrage. I have said that a \nnumber of times on the floor of this Senate. It is a subsidy program \nwhere the consumers of this country are asked to pay somewhere between \n$1.5 and $2 billion of additional costs for sugar used in this country \nin order to benefit a few growers.\n  It does not directly cost the Federal Government any money. It does, \nactually, cost money in the products we buy that are sugar related, but \nit is not a dramatic amount of money. What it is, essentially, is a tax \non the consumers of this country in the form of the price for sugar, \nwhich greatly exceeds what the world market price is for sugar.\n  In fact, if you look at the sugar program honestly, it is the only \nsurviving element of Marxist economics in the Western Hemisphere \noutside of Cuba. It is a program totally dominated by the Government, \nwhere the Government sets the price, where the price is set in a manner \nwhich has no relationship to the marketplace, where market force has no \nimpact on the production of the sugar, and where, as a practical \nmatter, if the marketplace were allowed to come into play, American \nconsumers would save around $1.5 billion a year.\n  Now, the amendment which I offer does not repeal the sugar program. I \nhave offered it on behalf of myself and Senator Reid from Nevada. The \namendment that I have offered says, rather than giving the sugar \nprogram, which is an outrage on its face, a 7-year extension, we will \nonly give it a 2-year extension. So we are essentially saying, listen, \nthis program has enough problems so that it ought to be reviewed on a \nfairly regular basis. It should not be extended for 7 years.\n  The benefits of this program run to a very small number of people. In \nfact, there is one sugarcane grower who gets about $60 billion a year. \nAbout 50 percent of the benefit of the program as it affects sugarcane \ngrowers runs to about 17 sugarcane growers which has been represented \nto us; whereas the detriment to this program runs to every American who \nhas to pay an outrageous, inflated, arbitrary nonmarket price for \nsugar.\n  Not only does the program have a debilitating effect on our \nconsumers, but it has a negative impact on our international relations \nbecause our sister States who want to produce this product cannot \nproduce it and sell it to the United States, specifically, our \nCaribbean neighbors. And it is having a significant environmental \nimpact in Florida where sugarcane production, which has been \narbitrarily increased as a result of this subsidy, is having a dramatic \nimpact on the viability of the Everglades. So the program itself makes \nno sense. There will be a representation on the other side the program \nhas been changed. That is not true. As a practical matter, the program \nmay have been changed superficially, but the substantive effect of the \nprogram has not been changed. The bottom line question is: How much \nwill sugar cost in the marketplace in the United States? Well, there is \nnot a marketplace, really. It will cost about twice the rate it would \ncost in the world market under the changes. There will continue to be \nan inflated and subsidized sugar program under the proposal in this \nbill.\n\n  So why the 7-year extension? It comes down to what is called greed, \npure and simple greed. The fact is, people know they cannot defend the \nsugar program. They know if they did not stick it on this bill and bury \nit in the bowels of this bill, it would never survive the light of day. \nEven Johnny Cochran could not defend this program before a jury of fair \narbiters. The fact is, this program is a pure and simple robbery of the \nAmerican consumer for the benefit of a very small number of producers.\n  Here we are, the center of capitalism in this country, rejecting the \nwhole concept of capitalism, having a program which basically \neliminates the marketplace.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself an additional minute.\n  It says, the marketplace does not have any bearing on how much you \nshould pay for sugar but, rather, a few powerful lobbyists should \ncontrol how much you pay for sugar. It really is outrageous. But, as I \npointed out, even though I find the whole program unbelievable, \nespecially in light of the fact that the Republicans, who are \nsupposedly supporters and defenders of the marketplace, control this \nCongress, I find it unbelievable we are continuing this program. Our \namendment, as supported by the Senator from Nevada, does not terminate \nthe program. It \n\n[[Page S1031]]\nsimply takes it from a 7-year program to a 2-year program. That is \nstill too long, but it seems to be a reasonable attempt at compromise.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is available on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. First, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dr. \nKate DeRemer have the privilege of the floor throughout the debate and \nvotes today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield a minute--I yield such time as he \nneeds to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn] is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3225\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, first, I would like to associate myself with \nthe remarks made by the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Heflin] the Senator \nfrom Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] and others opposing the Santorum amendment \non the peanut program. I will summarize my remarks in about 20 seconds \nin the following points. I oppose the Santorum amendment for three \nbasic reasons.\n  First, even without the reforms included in S. 1541, the peanut \nprogram is already one of the least expensive Federal commodity \nprograms. Under S. 1541, it will be a no cost program. So this bill \nwithout the Santorum amendment represents fundamental changes in the \npeanut program.\n  Second, the Santorum amendment does not recognize the evolutionary \nchanges in the peanut program which began with competition from GATT \nand NAFTA. The peanut title reforms included in S. 1541 reflect the \ninevitable fact that peanut producers in this country are going to have \nto compete in the international market by reason of those agreements.\n  Third, even those who support changing the peanut program, in my \nopinion, should oppose the Santorum amendment. The Santorum amendment \ndoes not give peanut producers or the rural communities which depend so \nmuch on the peanut program the time to adjust at all.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Santorum amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3450\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand in opposition to the amendment that \nmy colleague from New Hampshire has offered this morning.\n  Let me say at the outset, I ain't no Johnny Cochran, but I can defend \nthe revisions in this program, and I hope the Senator from New \nHampshire will listen this morning, because, if he was like many \nAmericans who sat down in a restaurant this morning to eat some cereal \nfor breakfast, they reached out and, for no cost to them, picked up a \npacket of sugar and spread it upon their cereal. They did not pay a \ndime for it or a dollar for it. The sugar price is such that it was a \nservice provided by the restaurant. Why? Because the sugar price in \nAmerica today, in a retail market, per pound is about 39 cents. In \nJapan it is $1. In Norway it is 70 cents. In Switzerland it is 55 \ncents. Of the 20 developed countries of the world, we are the third \nfrom the bottom in the price of sugar.\n  Why, then, is this Senator saying that consumers are getting ripped \noff, that consumers are paying billions of dollars for this program \nwhen in fact they are paying less than almost any other country in the \nworld except Third World nations where near slave labor produces it?\n  What we have today is a program that we are offering in this \nlegislation that responds to what the Senator from New Hampshire was \nsaying, and the Senator from Pennsylvania, and others. Reform needs to \nbe offered to agricultural programs built within the farm bill. What \ndid we do? We eliminated market allotments. No more domestic supply \ncontrol. Any farmer can raise cane or any farmer can raise sugar beets. \nWe do not restrict the market. We eliminated the 1 cent penalty, \neffectively lowering the loan rate an additional penny. What is real \nsavings? What do we do? Also, by the assessment, we raise $300 million \nfor deficit reduction.\n  Then why do we still have a program? We have a program to create a \nlevel playing field for the 1,900 farm families in my State, not a few \nrich producers, but 1,900 farm families who raise sugar beets, who have \nfound that an extremely valuable program.\n  What this program, then, offers is a Government participation in \nallowing a flow of foreign raw commodity into the market to balance out \ndomestic production. The 7.5 cents that might be saved if the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire succeeds will not be passed on to the consumer. That \nis 7.5 cents a pound. It will not be passed on to the consumer. It will \ngo in the pocket of the large producers of candy and soft drinks. That \nwould be fine if it did not destroy the market and the production \nenvironment for the domestic producer.\n\n  What happened in 1974 without a sugar program? The price of sugar was \nnot 39 cents a pound, it was 60 cents a pound. We saw radical gyrations \nin a market that nearly destroyed the production unit of American \nsweetener, both in the cane and the sugar beet market.\n  What we have offered is stability, but we also have heard the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. We also offered reform. In working with my growers \nand working with the sugar beet industry and the cane industry, we \nsaid--myself and Senator Breaux from Louisiana, with whom I have worked \non this--we cannot accept business as usual. The Congress is changing. \nWe want to change farm programs, and you have to farm to a market. And \nthey said they will.\n  What we also said is that we will not allow the massive dumping of \nforeign sugar in this market that is produced at little to no cost, \noftentimes subsidized, sometimes by $1 a day labor. But that is what \nthe large consumers of sugar want so their profits expand. But what \nthey pass to the consumer will be not one dime of savings. They have \nopenly admitted that after they spent millions of dollars in the \ntelevision markets of this country trying to convince us there was some \nkind of a ripoff. This is not a ripoff. This is a program of reform \nthat does not cost the American taxpayer one penny.\n  I believe it saves them money by creating a stable market. So that \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, or the Senator from Pennsylvania, or \nthis Senator can reach out in a restaurant, pick up a pack of sugar for \nno cost to them, and spread it across their cereal like thousands of \nAmericans do every day. It sounds like a good buy to me. I think it is \na great buy to the taxpayer.\n  I hope the Senate will reject this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nHawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member for yielding to \nme.\n  Mr. President, as I listen to all the evils that are being attributed \nto the sugar program during today's debate on the Senate floor, I \nhardly recognize the tiny white crystals that sweeten my cereal each \nmorning.\n  Sugar is an essential element of human nutrition. It is also the \nleast expensive food item you will find in an American kitchen. When \nyou go to a restaurant, there are only two things available at no \ncharge and in an unlimited quantity: water and sugar. Yet on the Senate \nfloor, sugar is the most maligned commodity grown in America.\n  Despite all the criticism being circulated by corporate food \nprocessors that are trying to put American sugar farmers out of \nbusiness, sugar is one of the best bargains you will find at the \ngrocery store today. A pound of refined sugar costs 39 cents.\n  But consumers elsewhere around the globe do not enjoy the same low \nprices as consumers in America. If you visited the grocery store in \nother industrialized nations you would get sticker shock when you came \nto the sugar display. In Tokyo, consumers pay nearly 90 cents for a \npound of sugar, more than double the U.S. price. In Europe, prices \naverage 50 to 70 cents per pound. \n\n[[Page S1032]]\n\n  Among developed countries, the average retail price for a pound of \nsugar is 54 cents, which is a premium of 38 percent compared to the \nU.S. price. And what do these consumers get for the premium price they \npay? Nothing. They get the same 1-pound box of sugar as we do in \nAmerica, but they pay substantially more for it--38 percent more.\n  Thanks to a farm program that assures stable supplies at reasonable \nprices, sugar is a remarkable bargain for American consumers. U.S. \nconsumers pay an average of 17 cents less per pound of sugar than their \ncounterparts in other industrialized nations. That is a savings of $1.4 \nbillion annually. So there is no doubt about one thing: the sugar \nprogram is a great deal for American consumers. By any measure, the \nsugar program has guaranteed U.S. consumers a stable supply of sugar at \nbargain prices.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. If Congress reduces or \nterminates the sugar program, not only will a dynamic part of the \neconomy disappear from many rural areas, but consumers will also lose a \nreliable supply of high-quality, low-price sugar. I urge my colleagues \nto vote against the Reid-Gregg amendment.\n  I am dumbfounded by the arguments of sugar opponents that the changes \nrecommended by the Senate Agriculture Committee are inadequate. If \nanything, the reforms go too far. Cane sugar growers in my State will \nbarely recognize the sugar program if the Senate bill becomes law.\n  The Senate bill eliminates marketing controls, eliminates minimum \nprice guarantees, and increases sugar imports by 20 percent. Growers \nwill pay a 1-cent-per-pound penalty when they forfeit sugar, which \namounts to a cut in the loan rate. Finally, all beet and cane sugar \ngrowers will face a 25-percent increase in fees paid to the Federal \nGovernment to market sugar. The only thing that has not changed is the \nrequirement that the program operate at no cost to the taxpayer.\n  The committee bill contains real reform. For sugar farmers in Hawaii \nand on the mainland these reforms will be painful, so painful that a \nnumber of them will not survive. I urge my colleagues to oppose deeper \ncuts than those proposed by the committee.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Gregg's \namendment to delete the sugar program from this bill.\n  Mr. President, California has not fared well under the current sugar \nprogram. Beet sugar production has declined markedly and the west \ncoast's only cane sugar refinery, located in Crockett, CA, has suffered \nsevere financial losses. As a result, California has lost several \nhundred sugar-related jobs in the past year alone.\n  In November, I learned that the cane sugar refinery in California was \nforced to cease operation for a week because it ran out of sugar. I \nhave since learned that the closing of this California refinery was not \nan isolated case and that other refineries in Baltimore, MD, and \nBrooklyn, NY, have been closed several times during the past year for \nthe same reason--no sugar.\n  Mr. President, the sugar program is complex. Under current law, the \nSecretary of Agriculture is required to provide price supports to \ngrowers through nonrecourse loans to processors, and to do so at no \ncost to the Federal Government. To accomplish this objective, the \nSecretary uses an elaborate supply management scheme that includes \nproduction and marketing allotments and strict import controls.\n  As currently administered, the sugar program has caused serious \nfinancial stress on a major segment of the U.S. sugar industry. The \nSecretary's initial decision to restrict import imports of raw cane \nsugar to the minimum allowed by law so distorted the price relationship \nbetween raw cane sugar and refined white sugar that all U.S. cane \nrefiners experienced severe operating losses for the past 2 years. The \nincreases in the quota announced by the Secretary of Agriculture last \nfall and last month are steps in the right direction, but the industry \nhas not yet recovered.\n  As I understand it, the fundamental problem with the administration \nof the sugar program is the complete disregard of the relationship \nbetween raw cane sugar prices and refined beet and cane sugar prices.\n  Present Government policy inflates raw sugar prices to unreasonable \nlevels by restricting raw sugar imports.\n  High price supports encourage excess beet production which, in turn, \ndepresses refined sugar prices.\n  As a result, the normal economic relationship between raw and refined \nsugar prices no longer exists.\n  Raw costs have exceeded refined prices so that cane refiners can no \nlonger recover their refining costs in the marketplace.\n  And cane refiners have been forced to sell their production at a \nsubstantial loss.\n  If continued as currently administered, the Government's sugar \nprogram will destroy the cane sugar refinery industry and seriously \nthreaten the stability of the Nation's sugar supply.\n  Cane sugar refiners have a vital role to play in the U.S. sugar \nindustry.\n  They provide over half of the refined sugar consumed in the United \nStates under normal circumstances.\n  Only cane refiners have the capability to supply sugar when domestic \nsugar production is adversely impacted by weather or other disruptions.\n  Since the sugar program was put in place in 1981, 11 of the \nindustry's 22 cane refiners have closed. The Government should not be \nin the business of deciding who is a winner and who is a loser in the \nsugar business.\n  Of immediate concern in my State is the damage the sugar program has \ninflicted on the California and Hawaiian Sugar Co. in Crockett, CA. \nThis 90-year-old cane sugar refinery is the Nation's largest and the \nonly such facility on the west coast. C Sugar refines all the sugar \nproduced in Hawaii, as well as some imported raw cane sugar brought in \nunder the quota. C Sugar refines and distributes about 15 percent of \nthe cane sugar consumed in the United States.\n  As a direct result of the sugar program and its impact on imports, \nC Sugar lost about $13 million in 1994 and incurred operating losses \nof about $23 million in 1995.\n  In 1981, C Sugar had 1,313 employees. Today C Sugar has 582 \nemployees. In other words, since 1981, over 700 jobs at C Sugar have \nbeen lost. Two hundred-six of these jobs were lost in January. More \ndrastic measures are inevitable unless fundamental changes are made in \nthe sugar program.\n  Mr. President, the job losses at this refinery are significant. These \nare good blue-collar jobs, predominantly union, with heavy minority \nemployment. C Sugar's work force is 50 percent minority and 75 \npercent union members. C Sugar pays wages of $13.50 to $24 an hour, \nplus benefits, pension, and medical coverage for retirees. In most \ncases, these workers are not going to be able to duplicate these jobs.\n  More recently, in January, Imperial Holly Corp. announced its \nagreement to purchase of three of Spreckles Sugar Co.'s beet sugar \nprocessing plants in California and plans to close all three facilities \nand consolidate operations at existing Holly facilities in California. \nThis will result in a further loss of hundreds of sugar related jobs in \nCalifornia.\n  Given the problems facing the sugar industry right now, I cannot \nsupport an extension of the current sugar program for 7 years as \nprovided in this bill.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in enthusiastic support of the \namendment offered by Senator Gregg and Senator Reid to phase out sugar \nprice supports over 2 years, rather than 7, which is the provision in \nthe underlying bill.\n  First, let me point out that sugar price supports are set to expire \nin 2 years under current law. So the pending amendment merely maintains \nthe status quo. Under freedom to farm, the sugar price support program \nreceives a 5-year reprieve. And the underlying bill contains a powerful \nincentive to hold raw sugar imports at 1.5 million tons, some 25 \npercent below current levels. If the Gregg-Reid amendment is not \nadopted, I predict the domestic cane sugar refining industry will \nvirtually disappear.\n  The Federal sugar price support program properly belongs in Cuba, not \nin a free market economy. It is a caricature of how a farm program \nought to work. The program is cleverly designed to operate at little or \nno direct cost to the Federal Government. The Department of Agriculture \n[USDA] provides nonrecourse commodity loans to sugar \n\n[[Page S1033]]\ngrowers. If raw sugar prices fall below the loan rate currently 18 \ncents per pound--the growers simply default on the loan and forfeit the \nsugar they put up for collateral. To prevent loan forfeitures from \noccurring, USDA sets very tight import quotas and domestic producer \nallotments which limit supply and drive prices above the loan rate.\n  As a result of this program, at 22 to 25 cents per pound, domestic \nprices for raw sugar are about twice world market prices. Domestic cane \nrefiners, such as Domino of Brooklyn and Refined Sugar of Yonkers, pay \nmore for raw material acquisition and refining than they are able to \nreceive for their finished product. Domestic food processors and \nconfectioners lose market share to foreign competitors who purchase \ntheir sugar supply on the world market. The Federal Government pays \nhigher prices about $90 million annually, for products it purchases for \nnutrition programs. And consumers pay $1.4 billion more than they need \nto for sugar and products containing sugar, according to the General \nAccounting Office.\n  Since the mid-1980's, the number of cane sugar refineries nationwide \nhas declined from 22 to 11. Fifteen hundred jobs have been lost in the \nrefining industry just in the last 5 years; capacity has been reduced \nby 40 percent. Domino has been forced to close its Brooklyn and \nBaltimore refineries six times in the past year because of raw cane \nsugar shortages.\n  What is particularly galling about the situation is that the refinery \njobs are good-paying jobs located in inner cities and around dockyards \nwhere other employment opportunities are scarce. Moreover, the sugar \nprogram is, perhaps, more distorted than any other farm program in \nsending enormous benefits to the few largest producers. The top 1 \npercent of sugar growers, about 150 farms garner 42 percent of program \nbenefits in the form of higher prices. The largest 33 producers each \nreceive over $1 million annually. The Fanjul brothers, who farm 180,000 \nacres of cane in Florida, receive some $64 million annually. The \nFanjuls, whose family dominated sugar production in Cuba before Fidel \nCastro took over in 1959, are not even United States citizens. All \nsugar producers receive price and income supports wildly \ndisproportionate to the Federal support received by other farmers. USDA \nestimates that sugar price and income supports average $472.30 an acre. \nCorn is supported at the rate of about $33.60 per acre; wheat is \nsupported at $23.40.\n  Most important, Mr. President, is the fact that the artificially high \nprice for sugar acts as a very regressive tax on low-income consumers. \nWe committed ourselves to phasing out sugar price supports when we \npassed the 1990 farm bill. We ought to stick to that commitment. I urge \nthe adoption of the pending amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Gregg-\nReid amendment to eliminate the sugar title in this bill.\n  As a Senator from a State which is home to a major sugar refinery--\nthe Domino refinery in Baltimore which provides over 600 jobs--I will \nnot support a bill which threatens their future existence.\n  This bill is a bad deal for Domino and other refineries. It threatens \nthe livelihoods of thousands of American working families--at \nrefineries not only in Baltimore, but also in New York, in California \nand elsewhere.\n  Too often, the sugar program squeezes refineries between artificially \nhigh raw cane sugar prices and low supply. The sugar program in this \nbill will worsen the problem.\n  Almost half of American sugar cane refineries have gone out of \nbusiness. Those refineries still in operation have faced temporary \nclosures again and again. These disruptions create economic hardships \nfor workers and disrupts production schedules.\n  To give our refineries some relief, I offered an amendment called the \nEmergency Sugar Refiner Relief Act which requires the Secretary of \nAgriculture to increase imports of raw cane sugar if the price of raw \ncane sugar exceeds 120 percent of the loan rate. My amendment would \nhave prevented refineries from future closings due to artificially high \nraw cane prices. Unfortunately, my amendment could not be accepted \ntoday but I will keep fighting for it at every opportunity.\n  It is outrageous that our sugar program has to pit growers against \nrefiners. There is no reason why our refiners have to be left out of \nthe sugar program, threatening the future of this industry.\n  Mr. President, I will not support legislation that threatens the jobs \nand livelihoods of hundreds of workers in Baltimore. The sugar program \ncontained in this bill is simply bad policy and there is no excuse for \nit.\n  I will continue to fight for the workers at Domino and the rest of \nthe refining industry. For this reason, I strongly support the Gregg \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 3 minutes and 47 \nseconds, and the Senator from Indiana has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I initially say that I very much appreciate \nthe leadership on this amendment offered by the Senator from New \nHampshire, and I appreciate the Senator from New Hampshire's leadership \nin that I have seen him work on this issue when he was a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives. I know that his heart was there when he was \nGovernor of the State of New Hampshire, and certainly for all of the \ntime that he spent here in the Senate he has been trying to do away \nwith this program that I think is one of the most absurd programs we \nhave anyplace in Government.\n  Mr. President, we talk a lot about reforming welfare. I think where \nwe should start reforming welfare is right here. We should reform \nwelfare as we know it, and that is the sugar program which is one of \nthe biggest welfare programs in the history of the country, if not in \nthe history of the world.\n  Mr. President, this program is a program that does not benefit \nfarmers. I repeat this is no help to the family farmer.\n  Seventeen cane growers get 58 percent of the benefit available to all \ncane growers. One cane grower received more than $65 million in 1 year \nalone. Thirty-three growers received benefits of over $1 million a year \neach. In Florida, two growers account for 75 percent of the production \nin that State which produces huge amounts of sugar.\n  The GAO concluded a study which said that the benefits going to \ngrowers are concentrated among a relatively few. And that is an \nunderstatement. Mr. President, 42 percent of grower benefits went to 1 \npercent of all sugar farms. The sugar cane industry is especially \nconcentrated with 17 of the estimated 1,705 cane farms--about 1 \npercent--receiving almost 60 percent of all cane grower benefits in \n1991. This is corporate welfare at its worst.\n  The Government-run sugar cartel artificially keeps sugar prices high. \nThe General Accounting Office estimates that because of this program \nU.S. sugar prices are twice as high as world prices. Because of a \nGovernment heavy hand in setting sugar prices, American consumers are \npaying about $1.5 billion every year in higher food costs. This adds up \nto a hidden tax of over $10 billion over the last decade.\n\n  The big sugar lobbies' contention that they are going to lose jobs is \nsimply without any foundation.\n  I repeat. This is a program that benefits the wealthy, and just a few \nwealthy farmers. It does not help the family farms.\n  It really hurts the American consumer. Take for example, Bobs Candy \nof Albany, GA, the Nation's largest manufacturer of candy canes--the \nthings with the little crook that we put on our trees at Christmas. \nThey are not going to be able to compete much longer with the Canadian \ncompetitors because of their significantly lower cane sugar prices in \nCanada. If this sugar program is extended, Bobs of Albany, GA, and \nhundreds of other manufacturers will be forced to move their operations \noverseas where they can get cheap sugar. And it would eliminate \nthousands of jobs.\n  While this program has been doing great, other farm programs have \nbeen on a downward path. The sugar program has stayed very stable. It \nis welfare I repeat at its worst. The sugar program has remained \nvirtually untouched from the last two farm bills \n\n[[Page S1034]]\nwhile other farm programs have faced reductions and many reforms.\n  The environmental consequences of the sugar program is that cane \nfarming is destroying the environment. Take, for example, what it is \ndoing to the Everglades in Florida.\n  The sugar program is big government at its worst. It sets prices, it \ncontrols imports, and it distributes benefits.\n  We should support this amendment. It would be good government to do \nso.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Vermont \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes and 47 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there are many farm programs that have not \nworked very well. Most of us have understood that, and we have debated \nwhat might make them work better. However, the sugar program is one \nthat works.\n  I represent the Red River Valley area of North Dakota, and others \nrepresent the Red River Valley area of Minnesota. It is dotted with \nhundreds and hundreds of family farmers who raise sugar beets.\n  The sugar program does work. Instead of trying to figure out how you \ntake apart a program that works in the farm program, we ought to decide \nhow to make the other programs work better. The sugar program ought to \nbe a model.\n\n  Now, I hear people talking about the world price for sugar. That is a \ndump price. Most sugar in this world is traded on long-term contracts \ncountry to country. The dump price, which people have been describing, \nis not related to this debate at all. The sugar program provides stable \nprices and has always provided stable prices for consumers and fair \nprices for producers. Every farm program ought to be as successful as \nthis one is.\n  This is a success story in dozens of ways, and we ought not take it \napart. I know people are talking about big agribusinesses. I am talking \nabout family farmers dotting the prairies out there in the Red River \nValley of North Dakota who operate successfully as a family farm under \nthis sugar program. I hope this Senate will turn down this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Comments were made that this program is good for consumers. I do not \nthink higher prices are good for consumers. I can tell you one thing. \nIt is not good for workers. We had two sugar refineries in Philadelphia \nthat closed in the 1980's as a result of this sugar program and the \nhigh cost of sugar that they had to deal with--1,500 jobs in the city \nof Philadelphia gone as a result of this program.\n  I hear so much about these small family farms. I am for small family \nfarmers. What about families who work in these refineries that are \ngoing out of business, like the ones that are threatened in Georgia and \nin Maryland and in other places around this country because of this \nsugar program? Let us not just look to the farmers. Let us look to the \nworkers who want to have jobs processing this sugar and confectioners \nwho want to use this sugar instead of having to send those jobs to \nCanada or Mexico where they can buy cheap sugar and cheap peanuts and \nother things they use in making candy.\n  Those are the kinds of issues we should be looking at, not just one \nsegment of the matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 1 minute has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for \n1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator. I will make a couple points.\n  There will be some people in the country who will never be satisfied \nuntil they can just about get free sugar to make all the products they \nmake and thereby destroy the domestic industry.\n  We have over 700 small family farms that produce sugar in Louisiana \nthat are dependent on this program. This program that we bring to the \nfloor today has a number of significant reforms. There is major change \nin the program. But this side, some of them want to kill the entire \nprogram. Under this bill, there are now going to be no limits on how \nmuch domestic production of sugar can occur in the United States. If \nyou want to plant more, go ahead. That is what this new program says. \nThere is going to be no guaranteed minimum price under the reforms that \nare being presented here today.\n  We also have a program that is guaranteed to operate at no cost to \nthe American taxpayer. What other program in this country can operate \nat no cost to the taxpayer? There is none, whether it is in health care \nor whether it is in other farm programs. This is the only one. You have \nheard these arguments about how much sugar costs and how expensive it \nis. I do not think any of us has ever had a housewife say anything \nabout sugar costs in her budget. It is still the only product that they \nwant to give away.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 48 seconds. The \nSenator from Vermont has 15 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator from Vermont have a closing statement? I \nwould like to maintain the right to close.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, a GAO audit was done of this program \nseveral years ago. The Senator from New Hampshire has quoted from that \nas to impact on consumers. Let me put in the Record a letter from the \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign \nAgricultural Services, saying that the GAO used a totally faulty basis \nfrom which to calculate it. This letter refutes the very figures that \nare being used by the Senator, and it is important that be a part of \nthe record.\n  This is the Department of Agriculture that analyzes and monitors \nthis, saying the wrong premise was used; therefore, the wrong figures, \nand in fact this might be a net savings to consumers instead of a cost \nbecause of the stability of the program itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time in opposition has expired.\n  Does the Senator want that letter included in the Record?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I do.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Patsy T. Mink,\n     House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congresswoman Mink: Thank you for your letter of July \n     26, 1995, concerning the General Accounting Office (GAO) \n     report that stated that the U.S. sugar program costs domestic \n     users and consumers an average of $1.4 billion annually and \n     GAO's July 1995 analysis that the sugar program cost the \n     Government an additional $90 million in 1994 for its food \n     purchase and food assistance programs.\n       In my opinion, GAO's April 1993 report was flawed in its \n     estimates. Some data were used incorrectly and important data \n     and sugar market issues were not considered. Based on GAO's \n     methodology, but by selecting prices in different time \n     periods, the results are more ambiguous. Depending on the \n     timeframe, one may contend that the domestic sugar program \n     either costs or benefits U.S. users and consumers.\n       GAO's estimate of $1.4 billion annually was based on an \n     assumption of a long-run equilibrium world price of 15.0 \n     cents per pound of raw sugar if all countries liberalized \n     sugar trade. GAO added a transportation cost of 1.5 cents per \n     pound of raw sugar to derive a landed U.S. price (elsewhere \n     in the report GAO stated that the transportation cost \n     adjustment should be 2.0 cents per pound.) To derive a world \n     price of refined sugar of 20.5 cents per pound, GAO added a \n     refining spread of 4.0 cents per pound.\n       GAO compared its constructed U.S. sweetener price with its \n     derived world price. However, GAO constructed the U.S. price \n     for the 1989-1991 period during which 1989 and 1990 were \n     unusually high price years for U.S. refined sugar. This \n     exaggerated the difference between the so-called world \n     derived price and the U.S. sweetener price. By selecting a \n\n[[Page S1035]]\n     period of world price spikes, such as 1973-1975, GAO's analysis would \n     show an annual savings to domestic users and consumers of \n     $350 to $400 million.\n       Clearly, the expected world price of raw sugar with global \n     liberalization is critical to any analyses of the effects of \n     the U.S. sugar program. In 1993, the Australian Bureau of \n     Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) estimated that \n     sugar trade liberalization in the United States, European \n     Union, and Japan alone would result in an average world price \n     of 17.6 cents per pound of raw sugar--2.6 cents per pound \n     higher than GAO's derived world price.\n       Based on the ABARE analysis and using a transportation cost \n     of 1.75 cents per pound, which more accurately reflects \n     global transportation costs to the United States, plus a \n     refining spread of 4.27 cents per pound (Landell Mills \n     Commodities Studies, Incorporated), a world price of refined \n     sugar is estimated at 23.6 cents per pound. Based on this \n     world price estimate and an average U.S. sweetener price over \n     1992-1994, a more normal price period, it can be shown using \n     GAO's methodology, that there are no costs to domestic users \n     and consumers.\n       The estimated effects of the U.S. sugar program are highly \n     sensitive to expected world prices if global sugar trade is \n     liberalized. GAO's analysis, in my judgment, does not \n     adequately consider the complexities and dynamics of the U.S. \n     and global sugar markets.\n       With respect to the effects of the U.S. sugar program on \n     Government costs of its food purchase and assistance \n     programs, an independent analysis by the Economic Research \n     Service (ERS) estimates the cost at $84 million based on the \n     difference between U.S. and world refined sugar prices in \n     1994. However, just as for the GAO analysis, different \n     effects could be estimated by using other time periods when \n     the price gap between U.S. and world prices was smaller. \n     Moreover, with global liberalization, the price gap would \n     narrow because of the dynamics of adjustment which were not \n     considered in the ERS analysis.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Eugene Moos,\n\n                                      Under Secretary for Farm and\n                                    Foreign Agricultural Services.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, no amount of smoke and mirrors here is \ngoing to obfuscate the basic fact that you can go into the \nmarketplace--in fact, it was quoted today on CNBC--and buy sugar at 10 \ncents a pound on the international market, but if you go out and buy it \nin the United States it will cost you 20, 21, 22 cents a pound. That is \nbecause the difference goes to a few growers who have a hammerlock on \nthe political system.\n  And does it not cost the taxpayers money? That statement was made--it \ndoes not cost the American taxpayers money. Of course, it costs them \nmoney; $1.5 billion a year in subsidy is carried by the American \nconsumers in order to benefit 17 cane growers who get 42 percent of the \nbenefit, as the Senator from Nevada so aptly pointed out.\n  The idea that we are presenting is not to eliminate the program. We \nare saying just do not extend it for 7 years. Do not put this outrage \non the back of the American consumers for 7 years, which would cost \napproximately $20 billion in subsidies having to be paid by the \nAmerican consumer.\n  We are saying just hit them for 2 years, just hit them for 2 years. \nAnd then let us go back and look at the program again. We are not \nsaying eliminate the program. We are saying just do not be greedy. Be \nreasonable. Give us a 2-year extension instead of a 7-year extension.\n  But what would be wrong with eliminating the program? The idea was \nyou would get free sugar; we are not going to be happy until we get \nfree sugar. We do not want free sugar. What we want is prices set by \nthe marketplace. This is called capitalism. It is the concept of Adam \nSmith, comparative advantage. Those are things Republicans used to \nstand for. They happen to be things this country was built on. They are \nthings which should be returned at some point in the sugar program. We \nare not asking they be returned today. All we are asking is that the \nsugar program only be extended for 2 years instead of 7 years--not an \nunreasonable request.\n  Mr. President, I certainly thank the Senator from Nevada for his \nsupport and the other Senators who cosponsored this amendment. And I \nhope that others will join us in putting a 2-year extension in place \ninstead of a 7-year extension in place for a program which should not \nbe extended at all.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nnext Democratic amendment and the intervening Republican amendment, \nSenator Daschle be recognized to offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Who yields time? There are 17 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield back the rest of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, we are coming now to the first vote, and \nthe order is that each side have 1 minute of explanation. The proponent \nof the amendment perhaps will proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3442\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator. The first vote is on the Northeast \narea compact. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Carl Levin be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. This is a very, very bad amendment. The amendment should \nnot go through. It is anticonstitutional. It only can be authorized by \nCongress. It should not be authorized by Congress.\n  It would allow six States to set the price of milk in their States \nand nobody else would be allowed, no other State would be allowed to \ncompete in that market unless they were prepared to meet that price. If \nyou can imagine, this is not the way we conduct the American economy. \nNo State would like to be the subject of that kind of a restriction. It \nwould allow other States at other times to come to Congress and ask for \npermission to set prices. We do not set prices in this country. We \nallow commerce to proceed in a competitive way. The Northeast area \ncompact is specifically an action to prevent that.\n  The proponents will say that we voted 65 to 35 for this. We have not \nvoted 65 to 35 for this before. The previous vote was on several \ndifferent provisions on a much broader agricultural amendment. It was \nnot an up-or-down vote on the Northeast area compact. It is bad policy \nfor this Congress, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the \nmotion to strike the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 1 minute has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would strongly urge that the Senate vote \nas it already has. We have, indeed, voted 65 to 34 in favor of this \ncompact. I would explain that was the vote on the compact before. This \nis something that involves only the Northeast. It affects dairy only in \nthe Northeast.\n  It is a compact carefully set up where consumers and farmers work \ntogether, where consumers actually have a veto over any price increase. \nI hope that we would allow the Northeast States to do what their \nlegislatures have joined together to do.\n  I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 20 seconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, all we are asking is that Vermont be \nallowed to do what other States can do. Big States can do it. \nCalifornia does the same thing we want to do. We allow anybody to come \nin. If Minnesota or Wisconsin want to bring their milk in, they can. \nThere are no barriers.\n  All we are trying to do is make sure we protect the few farms that \nare left tucked way up at the border of the United States in the \nNortheast where we have a very, very difficult time being able to buy \nour grains and all that. So we urge you to vote as you did last time, \nand that is against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired. All time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the question now occurs on agreeing to \namendment No. 3442 offered by the Senator from Wisconsin, [Mr. Kohl]. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], \nthe Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], and the Senator from Oregon [Mr. \nHatfield] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

We cannot proceed if \ndiscussions continue.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I believe we have worked this amendment \nout. I am proposing to alter the amendment by dropping the section \ndealing with BLM, section (c), applying it only to the Secretary of \nAgriculture, and in section (e), dropping any reference to a grant or \nissuance of a permit.\n  This dramatically scales back the amendment, and I believe this meets \nthe concerns expressed about it. As it would be amended, it would \nsimply mean that if an easement has existed for a long time, you could \nnot revoke it or refuse to renew it if the easement is in no way being \nchanged.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3443, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . CLARIFICATION OF EFFECT OF RESOURCE PLANNING ON \n                   ALLOCATION OR USE OF WATER.\n\n       (a) National Forest System Resource Planning.--Section 6 of \n     the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of \n     1974 (16 U.S.C. 1604) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(n) Limitation on Authority.--Nothing in this section \n     shall be construed to supersede, abrogate or otherwise impair \n     any right or authority of a State to allocate quantities of \n     water (including boundary waters). Nothing in this section \n     shall be implemented, enforced, or construed to allow any \n     officer or agency of the United States to utilize directly or \n     indirectly the authorities established under this section to \n     impose any requirement not imposed by the State which would \n     supersede, abrogate, or otherwise impair rights to the use of \n     water resources allocated under State law, interstate water \n     compact, or Supreme Court decree, or held by the United \n     States for use by a State, its political subdivisions, or its \n     citizens. No water rights arise in the United States or any \n     other person under the provisions of this Act.''.\n       (c) Authorization to Grant Rights-of-Way.--Section 501 of \n     the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. \n     1761) is amended as it applies to the Secretary of \n     Agriculture--.\n       (1) in subsection (c)(1)--.\n       (A) by striking subparagraph (B);\n       (B) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``originally \n     constructed'';.\n       (C) in subparagraph (G), by striking ``1996'' and inserting \n     ``1998''; and.\n       (D) by redesignating subparagraphs (C) through (G) as \n     subparagraphs (B) through (F), respectively:\n       (2) in subsection (c)(3)(A), by striking the second and \n     third sentences; and.\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(e) Effect on Valid Existing Rights.--Notwithstanding any \n     provision of this section, the Secretary of Agriculture may \n     not require, as a condition of, or in connection with, the \n     renewal of a right-of-way under this section, a restriction \n     or limitation on the operation, use, repair, or replacement \n     of an existing water supply facility which is located on or \n     above National Forest lands or the exercise and use of \n     existing water rights, if such condition would reduce the \n     quantity of water which would otherwise be made available for \n     use by the owner of such facility or water rights, or cause \n     an increase in the cost of the water supply provided from \n     such facility.''\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nBurns as a cosponsor and to vitiate the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The yeas \nand nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to engage in a 1-minute colloquy with the Senator from \nColorado. I could not hear one word he said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me ask two questions of the Senator \nfrom Colorado.\n  First, as I understand it, the amendment has been modified so that it \nwill only apply to Forest Service language.\n  Mr. BROWN. That is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. And the amendment also has a provision in it that it \nwill only apply to renewal of permits and not new permits?\n  Mr. BROWN. That is correct. To that end, we have dropped the \nprovisions that dealt with the issuing and the granting.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I will not raise a point of order, but would the Senator \nfrom Colorado join in requesting the Senator from Idaho to hold a \nhearing on this subject? I think it is a fairly complicated thing that \ndeserves a hearing.\n  Mr. BROWN. I appreciate it. That is a valuable suggestion. I am happy \nto join the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3443), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3445, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on amendment 3445.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent I be recognized to offer the next \namendment following the series of votes. We will have the next \nDemocratic amendment. I ask unanimous consent to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry: Is this the first amendment I \noffered which would strike the section of the bill that raises interest \nrates for Commodity Credit Corporation loans?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. For Senators who did not hear the debate earlier, for \nalmost 60 years we have allowed the farmers to borrow from the \nCommodity Credit Corporation using grain and commodities as collateral \nat interest rates based on Treasury rates. This bill raises the \ninterest rate 1 full percentage point. There is no good reason for \nthat.\n  There are those who argue farmers ought to be like other people out \nthere, borrowing at commercial rates. Large grain companies, and the \nlarge producers can go get the prime rate. My family farmers in Iowa \nhave to go to the local bank and pay prime plus 3. There is no reason \nto raise these CCC interest rates 1 percent. It is a $260 million tax \non farmers. Mr. President, $260 million more that farmers will have to \npay into the Treasury over the next 7 years that is not needed, and it \nwill hurt our family farmers.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I encourage Senators to vote against the \nHarkin amendment. It is, in fact, a $260 million subsidy to farmers. \nDeliberately, farmers have been given a rate 1 percent less for a long \ntime, at the \n\n[[Page S1037]]\nTreasury rate as opposed to the commercial rate. If every other \nbusiness in America had a similar advantage, that might be a different \nstory but other business people do not.\n  There was a time when we were interested in balancing the budget in \nthis Chamber. This was $260 million of the savings involved in that \nsituation. All we are asking for a vote ``no'' on this is that farmers \nhave identically the same opportunity at commercial rates and that the \n$260 million of savings to the taxpayers be preserved.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask that the Chair announce the vote at the end of 10 \nminutes from here on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is now on agreeing to the Harkin amendment numbered \n3445.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], \nthe Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], and the Senator from Oregon [Mr. \nHatfield] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3446\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the Harkin \namendment, No. 3446. There are 2 minutes for debate evenly divided \npursuant to the previous order.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. The Senator \nfrom Iowa is entitled to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate will be in \norder.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment reinstates the farmer-owned \nreserve which is suspended for the 7 years of this bill. In the 1970's \nwe heard a hue and cry across the country that the grain companies and \nprocessors had a hold over the grain markets because they could buy up \ngrain from the farmers at low prices and the farmers could not market \ntheir grain when they wanted to market it. So we put in something \ncalled the farmer-owned reserve, which is, first, a marketing tool for \nfarmers that allows them to be able to market their grain when they \nwant to at higher prices. Second, it is also a tool for consumers, \nbecause in periods of drought, when we have short supplies----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend for a moment. The \nSenate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Then those supplies of grain are available, so we avoid \nsevere shortages and extremely high prices. Mr. President, there is an \nestimate by the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute that, \nin connection with the 1988 drought, that the substantial stocks of \ngrain on hand, including in the farmer-owned reserve, prevented some \n$40 billion in extra food costs to consumers because we had that \nreserve owned by the farmers.\n  So this amendment just basically continues that program of enabling \nfarmers to store their own grain for a period as a reserve and allow \nthem to market in a more orderly way.\n  This is both a profarmer and a proconsumer amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the reason the Senate allowed the farmer-\nowned reserve to lapse was that essentially it was a very expensive \nstorage business with 26\\1/2\\ cents per bushel to a farmer who wanted \nto store grain. But eventually over half of the money was paid to \nelevators and to large grain merchandisers, not to the individual \nfarmers we are talking about here. We finally got rid of it because \nfarmers understood it was a hangover of wheat, corn, and beans over the \nmarket. It depressed prices.\n  I am a farmer. I have storage. I do not need 26\\1/2\\ cents a bushel \nto store for my own purposes. I market it on the basis of price.\n  That is the way the country proceeded, and we saved $100 million for \ntaxpayers for another subsidy that is unnecessary and unneeded for \nfarmers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Iowa. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], \nthe Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], and the Senator from Oregon [Mr. \nHatfield] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question now occurs on agreeing to the \nSantorum amendment No. 3225.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will Members of the Senate who are having \ndiscussions please retire to the Cloakroom.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I have is not an elimination of the \npeanut program. What is does is it phases \n\n[[Page S1038]]\ndown the support price for peanuts 30 percent over the next 5 years and \nthen replaces the quota system with a nonrecourse loan system. So there \nwill still be a peanut program, a safety net program. The only \ncommodity in the last 10, 15 years that has not been reformed is \npeanuts. It is the only one that has gone up in price since 1985. For \neverything else the support prices have been cut but not peanuts. \nPeanuts is still run with a quota system. That means you have to have a \nlicense to grow peanuts, and, if you do not have that license, you \ncannot sell peanuts in this country.\n  What we want to do is just reform it slightly over the next 7 years \nto really comport with the other programs that are going through \nreform, and I urge an affirmative vote to send a good message on this \nprogram.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will just take about 30 seconds.\n  I have had a lot of experience with the peanut program. There have \nbeen reforms made over the years. There are reforms in this bill. We \nare trying to get a farm bill passed, and I know that the Senator from \nPennsylvania has worked very long and very hard and has done a great \njob, but I think in the spirit of trying to get the bill passed, we \nought to take the reforms that have been made.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment, the identical \ncontents of which was before the Senate last fall and was approved \noverwhelmingly by a vote of 62 to 36. It seeks to cap the Market \nPromotion Program at $70 million. Under the current proposal, that \nfunding level would rise to $100 million on an annual basis.\n  It precludes the payment of market promotion moneys to foreign \ncorporations. Under the current law, foreign corporations may receive \nmoney.\n  It also precludes payments being made to large corporations that \nwould exceed the small business size and scope, and it would make it \npossible for moneys to continue to be received by cooperative \norganizations who are advertising on behalf of nonbranded promotions.\n  I urge its adoption. As I say, it has been before us previously and \nenjoys the support of the chairman of the committee and the ranking \nmember.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, in opposition to the amendment, let me \nsimply state that there are controls and reforms not only reflected in \nthis legislation before the Senate in the Market Promotion Program, but \nthere are also restrictions imposed by the Department of Agriculture in \nthe allocation of these funds.\n  In the view of many of us, that should answer all of the charges that \nhave been made by some of the sensationalized attacks on our effort to \nenlarge our share of the international market through helping our \nexporters of food and commodities do a better job competing with those \ncountries that engage in unfair practices to keep our products out of \nmarkets and to make us lose market share.\n  This provision in the bill that is sought to be amended creates \nAmerican jobs. It is time for us to stand up for our farmers and our \nexporters. I urge the Senate to vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3448\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on the Harkin amendment, \nNo. 3448.\n  Under the previous order, the time is evenly divided.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate will be in \norder.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Last year, Senator Lugar and Senator Leahy introduced S. \n854 to provide for incentive payments, cost-sharing, technical \nassistance, et cetera, to livestock producers to meet certain \nenvironmental standards. In that bill, for example, there is a limit \nrelating to the number of livestock above which you could not get cost \nshare payments, you could not get Government money. For example, in the \noriginal bill eligibility was limited to 1,000 beef cattle and 2,500 \nhead of hogs.\n  In the bill before us, the limits were raised to 10,000 beef cattle \nand 15,000 head of hogs. We have a limited pool of money, $700 million \nover 7 years for the livestock environmental assistance. This money \nought to go to the family-size farmers who need this help. The bigger \noperations have a lot of capital. They can take care of their own \nenvironmental problems. It is the small family farmers with the smaller \nherds that need this type of help.\n  My amendment takes this limited pot of money we have and sets limits \nbasically back to where the initial bill was last year at 1,000 head of \ncattle and 2,500 head of swine, which corresponds with the regulations \nthat have been promulgated under the Clean Water Act.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I argue against the Harkin amendment on the \nbasis that the limits that were set in the Lugar-Leahy bill were based \nupon the herds in 1970. They correspond to the Clean Water Act \nconsiderations of that time, and they made sense at that time.\n  Unhappily or happily, as the case may be, people in cattle, with hog \nfarms, with chickens, and with turkeys, have a great number. We have \nmade a limit of $10,000 per operation, but in meetings with producers \nall over the country, pragmatically the limits that we have come to \nseem to be a compromise between the large and the small.\n  I visited the Iowa Corn Producers last week and they feel that is \nabout the right level. We had the big and the small, and a great \ncontroversy was witnessed in that State. There is no magic in the \nfigures. They seem to me to be a practical compromise.\n  I advocate the committee text be retained and the Harkin amendment be \ndefeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

The Senate will be in order. Senators will \ntake conversations to the Cloakroom.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will oppose the next \namendment that will be up. Reform has been asked for in the sugar \nprogram, and we have brought major reform. This is of no cost to the \ntaxpayers. We create stability in the market, which I think all of us \nwant to see.\n  I yield to my colleague from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. My colleagues, I would say the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire knocks out all the reforms in the sugar program, \nwhich are substantial. He wants to make, I think, the program as bad as \nit possibly can be. Voting against that amendment preserves the reforms \nthat are in the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this is not about reform. There is no \nreform in this package. The price of sugar will remain twice the market \nprice under this bill or under the old law.\n  This is an issue of whether or not the sugar program will be locked \nin for 7 years as a huge subsidy and expense for the American consumers \nto bear, or whether we are going to continue it for 2 years and come \nback and revisit the issue. We are just asking for a reasonable chance \nto revisit the issue over the next 2 years, continue the program for 2 \nyears, come back and take it up. So I hope the people will take a look \nat this and be willing to vote for a 2-year extension, rather than a 7-\nyear extension.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I \nwould ask that the amendment be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Daschle, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Exon, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n     Heflin, and Mr. Bumpers, proposes an amendment numbered 3451 \n     to amendment No. 3184.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Section 103(f)(1) is amended by striking subparagraph (A) \n     and inserting the following:\n       (A) the lesser of--\n       (i) 85 percent of the contract acreage, or\n       (ii) the contract acres planted to a contract commodity or \n     oilseeds;\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I offer the amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenators Daschle, Conrad, Kerrey, Harkin, Wellstone, Kohl, Exon, Pryor, \nFeingold, Heflin, and Bumpers.\n  Mr. President, my understanding is there is 15 minutes on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The bill that we are now debating is called the freedom to farm bill. \nIt is a bill that provides 7 years of fixed payments to farmers. Yet, \nthere is no requirement in this legislation to plant a crop. All you \nneed would to participate is to have some base acres and a bank \naccount. You never need to plant a seed. You never need to harvest a \ncrop. Yet, you would get payments under this proposal.\n  You can have two farmers side by side under this proposal, one of \nwhom plants a crop, harvests a crop, and works all year operating a \nfamily farm. That farmer gets a payment under the Freedom to Farm Act. \nThe other farmer across the road does nothing, packs up, moves to \nArizona, does not plant a crop, never plows a furrow, and never starts \nan engine. That farmer gets the same payment.\n  Now, this is a farm bill. This bill is about helping farmers farm, \nnot helping farmers not farm. It is a bill about helping farmers who \nwant to farm. This should not be a bill about creating a payment system \nto pay people for not farming.\n  My amendment amends the Freedom to Farm Act and says that payments \nunder the Freedom To Farm Act will be made to farmers who plant a \nprogram crop, any program crop on their base acres. It provides for \ntotal flexibility. It simply says we will not make payments to people \nwho plant nothing. You must plant a program crop on your base acres to \nbe eligible for these payments.\n  Some will say, well, it has been done before. We have an 0/92 program \nand an 0/85 program. The 0/92 program allows farmers to plant oilseeds \non base acres. That is not the same at all. There is a requirement to \nplant.\n  The 0/85 program is a conservation use program. Payments are made for \nputting the land into a conserving use. Not the same at all.\n  The current provisions in this bill makes no sense to me at all, and \nthe Senate ought to adopt this amendment. The amendment says let us \nmake this a farm bill. Let us help the farmers who are planting crops \nand harvesting crops. Let us assist the work of family farmers in this \ncountry. But let us not pay people who do not plant and do not harvest.\n  Mr. President, I have several Members who would like to speak for a \nminute. Let me yield 1 minute to Senator Harkin from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nthis amendment. It is a commonsense amendment. This is just plain old \ncommon sense. Why should we be giving huge payments to people who may \nbe sitting on Miami Beach.\n  I have an example here, I tell my friend from North Dakota, of a \nfairly large wheat farmer in Kansas. He has 1,800 acres of wheat and \n600 acres of grain sorghum. Just take this year, wheat prices being \nwhat they are, sorghum prices being what they are, and let us see what \nhappens to this individual this year under the present prices. What is \nhe going to get this year? This farmer is going to net about $235,000. \nThat is a profit. Part of his profit is a Government check for $39,768. \nThat is on top of $195,000 in profit already.\n  Now, unless we adopt the Dorgan amendment, he can get that payment if \nhe did not plant anything at all. He could get that $39,000 if he did \nnot even want to do anything.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is right. If we are going to be sending \nout checks from the Government, at least we ought to expect people to \nwork for it and not be able just to sit back and do nothing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. \nKerrey.]\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Chair.\n  For years, the principal criticism of the farm program has been an \ninaccurate one, but it has been an effective one, that American farmers \nare being paid not to farm; converting acres is a payment not to farm; \nfarmers are going to get paid for wetlands regulation, lots of other \nthings.\n  They are certainly not paid not to farm.\n  In this program, the way it is written, the law basically says that \nthe Government will calculate the number of acres that you are eligible \nfor based on 4, 5 years of farming using Farm Service Office numbers.\n  The Farm Service Office will then say, ``Here is what your yields \nare.'' Both of them, by the way, have built in inequities because that \nis another problem. The Government will say, ``Here is your number of \nacres, your yield, multiply your numbers and take 85 percent, then add \nall the acreage up and all those bushels up.'' It will take the total \ndollars available for that crop, divide it into the total bushels, and \nthat is how many cents you will get. And you will get half your payment \nin June and half in September.\n  The only three things you have to do to get the payment is the \nfollowing: \n\n[[Page S1041]]\n First, comply with the conservation requirements; second, comply with \nthe wetlands requirements; and, third, promise not to plant more than \n15 percent alfalfa and not to plant fruits and vegetables. Other than \nthat, you do not have to promise to do anything. There will not be any \nquestion.\n  Farmers may make a calculation, ``Maybe I would be smarter not to \nplant at all. I don't have to plant under this. I don't have to put a \ncrop in and do anything other than take the Government money which they \nare offering.''\n  It is a very reasonable amendment, and it seems to me it is very much \nconsistent with the arguments and representations and presentations \nthat advocates of freedom to farm have been making all this day.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from North Dakota, \nSenator Conrad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, one of the most frequently heard \ncriticisms of Federal farm programs is that farmers are paid not to \nfarm, not to plant anything. Mr. President, that has not been the case \nunder recent farm law. But if the Dorgan amendment does not pass, it \nwill become the case. In fact, we will have circumstances in which \nfarmers will be paid not to plant, not to farm, not to produce.\n  Mr. President, I do not think there will be much support in the \nUnited States for a program that pays people not to do something, not \nto do anything. So I hope my colleagues will favor this amendment and \nvote for it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let us take the situation of a farmer in \nAmerica who has land. This is a basic asset for that farmer. Certainly, \nas common- sense rules, the farmer will plant a crop on the land or \nattempt to use the land to obtain income.\n  Certainly it is conceivable that there are Americans who have \nproductive assets and might decide that they simply do not want a \nreturn from those assets. But this is improbable. Most persons of sound \nmind and common sense who have opportunities to utilize economic \nassets, do so. And they do so continuously to make a living.\n  For example, the Senator from Iowa has pointed to a potential Kansas \nfarmer, maybe an actual farmer, but as I recall the instance, there \nwere as many as 1,800 acres of wheat crop, and given prices, as the \nSenator pointed out, that farmer might have a return of almost $200,000 \nfrom the markets that are very strong for wheat. The Senator also \npointed out that a Government check for $39,000 might also come to that \nfarmer under current programs.\n  The suggestion was that that farmer might have the option to go to \nHawaii and simply forget the wheat fields and collect the check for \n$39,000. That is possible as an option for that farmer, but most people \nwould ask, what about the $200,000 that he normally takes off the farm?\n  Mr. President, if the farmer himself is elderly, it is a very \nprobable set of circumstances in America today that the farmer will \nrent the land to somebody else and share the return. In fact, that \nhappens increasingly as farmers grow old. The payments follow the land. \nThe probability that the land is simply going to sit there and that a \nGovernment check comes as an ample reward is, I think, in most cases a \nridiculous assumption.\n  There is the one case, Mr. President, we have to consider carefully, \nand that is that some farmers in America, in stretching to meet \nGovernment program histories for their crops, may have simply \noverreached and they may have planted on land that in fact was not very \nfertile and does not get very much return at all. There may be at the \nmargin some cases where some farms, if farmed, lose money simply \nbecause the inputs into the farming and all the economic costs involved \nare more than the return that would come from the crop with or without \nthe Government involved.\n  As a matter of fact, in the Conservation Reserve Program, we have \nbeen attempting to work with farmers to set aside highly erodible land, \nto have that set aside as part of the program, or land that impacts \nupon riparian waterway safety. That, I thought, made good sense, Mr. \nPresident, in the conservation mode. Many acres probably should not \nhave been planted if our heritage of the soil is to be retained.\n  So farmers, in fact, have decided, as a matter once again of their \nown self-interest and given a government payment, to try to move away \nfrom the highly erodible lands or those that threaten waterways. But \nthat is an economic decision that makes sense.\n\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I understand the attempt of the argument to \nsuggest that there are farmers who simply will escape their \nresponsibilities. But my judgment as a farmer, Mr. President, is that I \nhave known very few people in Indiana farming during my lifetime who, \nhaving a good farm there with fertile soil, did not have a crop. They \nmay have planted it themselves, and they may have had children that \nworked with them. They may have had others to whom they rented the \nproperty, but the crop got planted because that was the living for the \nfamily. Those were assets that were available. And at the point when \nthey did not really wish to use those productive assets anymore, they \nsold them or they gave them away to children or through an inheritance. \nThat is the reality of agriculture in America.\n  The freedom to farm idea comes down to the fact that we are saying to \nfarmers they ought to have exactly that, freedom and flexibility to use \ntheir land in each and every way that would be productive and \nprofitable for the farmer.\n  If we once again insist that a program crop--wheat, corn, rice, \ncotton--be planted on that land for it to have value, to get a \ngovernment payment, we are back once again into the same restrictive \nagriculture that so many of us have decried for a long time. I am one \nwho rejoices that today we have a very good opportunity finally to \nbreak out of that mode of governmental restriction.\n  Why in the world we would once again want to return to those \nprinciples I cannot understand. It seems to me somewhat disingenuous, \nas those who offer this amendment suggest on the one hand--and the \nSenator from North Dakota was the author of the amendment--others who \nhave spoken have often pointed out very poignant cases of farmers in \ntheir States who have struggled against the weather and against great \nodds. But all the stories are ones of struggle. These are persons who \nunderstood how to farm the land. The question is, what sort of odds do \nthey have to meet in order to get income?\n  I have not heard very many stories from the Senator from North Dakota \nor from other Senators about their constituents who simply went to \nHawaii on the beach and ridiculed the Federal Government and the rest \nof the taxpayers for paying them for doing nothing.\n  As a matter of fact, farming is a struggle for a prohibitive majority \nof Americans who are engaged in it. It is a struggle they chose. Today \nwe are about to give them greater flexibility to make certain that \nstruggle is a more even one, that they really can plant whatever they \nwant to. And they will plant.\n\n  As a matter of fact, the great fear always of those who wanted \ncontrols and wanted to pin it down was that farmers would plant too \nmuch. The real secret of American agricultural debate for 60 years has \nbeen this latent fear that farmers, as a matter of fact, are so \ningenious, so hard working, that if left to their own devices they \nwould simply plant so much that the price of everything would decline \nprecipitously.\n  That was the basis of the New Deal philosophy, the burning of the \nlittle pigs, the plowing up of crops at the time. It was not the search \nfor farmers going to Hawaii; it was a search for farmers who were too \nproductive, to hold them in bounds, and to put on one restriction after \nanother, which we have not lifted from them in 60 years.\n  To hear the strange argument today that at the very moment of \nfreedom, farmers are prepared to chuck all of this and say, ``We are \nheaded to Hawaii. Send me the check,'' is not only a gratuitous insult \nto farmers, but it simply lacks any basis in fact and reality of \nanybody who is in the farming business.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about the heart of the freedom-to-farm \nidea. \n\n[[Page S1042]]\n If you pin down what has to be planted, once again, with Government \nrestrictions and say it has to be a program crop and, by golly, we have \nto see it in the ground before you receive a payment, you do, in fact, \ndefeat the whole prospect of freedom to farm, and I do not want to see \nthat occur.\n  I think Members ought to be alert that this is that type of \namendment. It is a killer amendment, and the instinct of going for the \njugular with this idea of farmers on the Hawaii beaches is, I think, \nwell crafted to try to give a picture of persons who are idle and who \nare trying to do in the taxpayers.\n  What, in fact, we have here is a situation that came out of the \nBalanced Budget Act. It was clear that through the payments that will \noccur in a 7-year period of time and diminish in money, we know \nconstantly now that the Federal Government and all the taxpayers are \nassured that farming is making a very sizable contribution to the \ndeficit relief that we have all sought to a balanced budget.\n  The last farm bill we passed, those of us involved in it, estimated \nit would have a cost of about $41 billion in terms of subsidies, the \nbasic deficiency payment for the program crops. It turned out to be $57 \nbillion, and there have been many explanations as to how we could have \nbeen that far off.\n  The freedom-to-farm bill we discuss today does not have surprises of \nthat sort. The payments are known. The amounts that will be distributed \nare constant, as well as the freedom of farmers to plant abundantly to \nfurnish to American consumers and to the world such abundance as we \nhave never seen and such wealth as we have never observed in terms of \nour export markets and our competitive ability. That is what the \nfreedom-to-farm act is about.\n\n  I am hopeful Senators will oppose the Dorgan amendment, will retain \nthe flexibility portions of this bill and the gist of freedom to farm, \nwhich I think is common sense and very clear to all of us.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 2 minutes to Senator Pryor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me and \nfor my colleague from North Dakota yielding me this time.\n  I have been listening to my good friend from Indiana, Senator Lugar, \nthe distinguished chairman of our committee. I will just simply say to \nour distinguished friend from Indiana, Mr. President, that the Dorgan \namendment is not a killer amendment by any stretch of the imagination. \nIt is simply an effort to address what promises to become a totally \noutrageous section and provision of the freedom-to-farm act.\n  We are saying in the Dorgan amendment--and I am a cosponsor--we are \nsaying that farmers do not have to do anything in order to receive \ntheir payments. If the Senator from Indiana has a fear that farmers are \nnot going to plant anything and go to Hawaii, if he says, ``Why, they \nare not going to do that,'' if he maintains that position, then he \nshould accept this amendment, he should be for the Dorgan amendment, \nbecause the Dorgan amendment couples production with an ultimate \npayment under certain circumstances. It does not decouple as the \nfreedom-to-farm act does.\n  We want a defendable farm program. This is one, Mr. President, this \nparticular program, this particular proposal, that I do not think we \ncan ultimately defend. I have been through, I think, about four farm \nbills, and I have never seen one like this, because this is going to \nbe, in my opinion, not an ordinary 5-year farm bill. It is not going to \nbe a 7-year farm bill. It is going to be about a 90-day farm bill, \nbecause when people wake up and ``20/20'' and ``60 Minutes'' and \neveryone else becomes exposed to what we have done to agriculture and \nto the agriculture industry and the economy in this country, they are \ngoing to demand that the Congress go back and draft a new farm bill \nthat will work.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Senator from \nIndiana. The Senator from Arkansas apparently said, ``This isn't going \nto happen. We're not going to have people getting payments and not \nplanting.'' If that is the case, why would anyone object to the \namendment? If it is not going to happen, my amendment is something that \nought to be accepted.\n  The Senator from Indiana talked a lot about the flexibility, freedom \nto farm offers in planting. He seemed to suggest somehow I was going to \noffer something that had a different kind of standard for flexibility \nthan he and others propose. That is not the case. They, of course, do \nnot propose complete flexibility. You cannot plant fruits and \nvegetables on base acres. I understand that.\n  I support the flexibility they are talking about. I provide the \nexact, same flexibility in this amendment. All I am saying is that you \nare not going to receive a payment for doing nothing. This is a farm \nprogram. Our interest is in helping family farmers farm.\n  The interesting thing about farming is you have to figure out what \nyour input costs might be in order to determine what your profit might \nbe and estimate what the price might be, because that is a factor of \nprofit.\n  One can foresee circumstances in which some people will say, ``As far \nas I'm concerned, I would like to move someplace else and get the \npayments at this point because the input cost is too high, the price \nrisk is too great. I think I will take the payment and let the land \nsit.''\n  I come from a town of 300. That town exists because all around you \ncan also see farmyard lights on at night. They are family farms \noperating and doing business in town. Every time one of these yard \nlights is turned off as we lose a farm, it kills a little bit of the \neconomic vitality of that town.\n  I am not interested in advancing farm bills to pay people not to \nfarm. I am not interested in advancing any farm bills that move in the \ndirection of more stringent requirements.\n  I am interested in advancing farm bills that do provide for greater \nflexibility, but not a flexibility that says we want to make Government \npayments for people who do not start a tractor in the spring and do not \ndrive a combine in the fall, do not plant and do not harvest and are \nnot farming. What kind of sense is that? I wish the Senator would \naccept this.\n  I notice he was able to suppress a grin when he said this was a \nkiller amendment. I appreciate the fact he did not grin on that because \nthis is not a killer amendment at all, nothing close to it. It is a \nsimple proposition, and the proposition is this: Let us decide what we \nare going to accomplish in this freedom-to-farm act. Let us provide a \nseries of payments to assist family farmers who are farming. Let us not \nadvance into the future with a backward-looking approach that pays \nfarmers who have not planted a single seed. That is not what farmers \nwant. That is not the help they need. That will not advance the \ninterests of rural America or family farmers.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I prefer to close debate. If the Senator from Indiana has \nother speakers or wishes to add anything, I reserve my time at this \npoint.\n  Mr. LUGAR. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, without being tedious, I just simply reiterate the \nfact that a farm that is fertile is going to be planted. It is going to \nbe planted by the farmer and by his children or family, by those \nassociates he rents to. What the Dorgan amendment finally gets to, once \nagain, is almost an insatiable desire on the part of those who want \ncontrol over what is planted and, therefore, want a relationship \nbetween program crops and payments.\n  We have been down that trail. We are trying very hard to get off that \ntrail today. I will just simply say, in my judgment, the great fear of \nthose who have been in supply controls throughout this time of the New \nDeal onward has been a fear of planting too much.\n  It is a strange argument today to argue that somehow farmers would \nplant too little or nothing at all. They simply will not utilize rich \nresources. \n\n[[Page S1043]]\n But given even the hard case, Mr. President, there may be some \ninstances in which there should not be a crop planted if the land is \nhighly erodible, if conservation dictates that it simply should not \noccur. That maybe becomes an option that is both rational and good in \nterms of the public good. In other words, there is no particular virtue \nin proceeding with planting a program crop when it is not economical to \ndo so and when it might be destructive in terms of the environment. In \nalmost every other instance, a crop is going to be planted.\n  The question we have today is: Will farmers be able to have maximum \nflexibility of choice as to what to do? Or, once again, will we be back \ninto the toils of supply control, of Government control, tied with \nthose decisions and checks from the Federal Government?\n  This is a transition program, Mr. President, a transition to the \nmarket. The transition is known to farmers as they enter into those \nprograms, and farmers are perfectly free not to enter into contracts. \nThat is also an option that is greatly feared by those who want control \nbecause many farmers might simply decide that the time has really come \nto plant for the market, as opposed to the Federal Government, with \ntransition payments or without.\n  Those choices we shall see before us, Mr. President. But for the \nmoment, it appears to me that this is a clear-cut issue in terms of \nfreedom to farm. I hope that the Dorgan amendment will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, we have no other speakers on our side. I \nyield back that time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, whatever amendment the Senator from \nIndiana was opposing, I would like to oppose it as well. The fact is I \nwould not support an amendment that goes back to supply control, or the \nold programs that go back to Government control over planting, et \ncetera. So whatever amendment that was he was describing, sign me up, I \nam against that as well. But, that is not the amendment at the desk.\n  My amendment cannot, in any way, under any condition, by anybody in \nthis Chamber, be described as an amendment going back to the old supply \ncontrol days or to requiring planting restrictions. This amendment \nsimply says that we are not going to pay people who do not plant a seed \nin the ground and do not plant a crop and do not farm. If, in fact, it \nis not going to happen that people will decide not to plant but accept \nthe payment--if that is the case and it is not going to happen, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana has made that point twice--then \nthere would be no reason not to accept this amendment. But, of course, \nit is going to happen.\n  The Senator from Indiana says it is not going to happen, but then \nadds it may happen because of conservation reasons. Maybe some land \nwould be put into a conservation use. For that we have a conservation \nprogram called CRP. Millions of acres are in the CRP.\n  This bill was not alleged to be a conservation program on the Senate \nfloor. It is a 7-year program of fixed payments to farmers. We are \nsimply saying, ``Let us not include in any 7-year program of fixed \npayments a provision that farmers should be able to plant nothing and \nharvest nothing and still get farm program payments.'' That is not \nmoving into the future. That is not part of a new idea. That is not \npart of new great freedoms. That does not eliminate planting \nrestrictions.\n  I have great respect for the Senator from Indiana. He is one of the \nmost able people serving in this body. But I hope that he and others \nwill really think through this process. They should ask themselves a \nquestion. Do we want--no matter what program passes in the Senate--a \nprogram that says to farmers across this land, ``If you choose to \ndecide that you do not want to plant anything, you get a payment. If \nyou want to move away from your small town and live elsewhere, you get \na payment. When you put your farm numbers together and you determine \nyou have risk with the marketplace and then you decide you are not \ngoing to farm, you are still going to get that payment.'' I think we \nmake a big mistake if we do that. I hope people will think through this \namendment and vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous consent that the Dorgan amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Has that been cleared on both sides? What is the order \nwith respect to votes?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I respond that this is being discussed by the leadership. \nMy impression is that there are other significant amendments, the \nSenator's amendment being one of these. Others are to be offered. The \nleadership is attempting to determine whether they should be voted upon \nat the end of the trail today, moving into final passage, or whether \nthere will be a burst of rollcall votes at some point after we gauge \nhow many amendments are still there.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding \nthat after the first group of votes, we were going to then entertain \nwhatever amendments were offered and have votes sequentially. I know \nthat the minority leader intends to offer a rather comprehensive \nsubstitute, and we certainly would want to have a vote on that by \nitself following debate. I wondered whether the minority leader has \nbeen consulted on the unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. LUGAR. He has been consulted by the majority leader. My \nunderstanding is that they are trying to discuss a way of handling \nthese votes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I might tell my colleague from North \nDakota, we are trying to have the first group of votes--as the Senator \nfrom North Dakota may know, we were able to dispose of a number of \nitems when we had so many Senators on the floor, unanimous consent \nitems. I believe the leadership is trying to package some others \ntogether. Obviously, any Senator, by objecting to unanimous consent, \ncould have a vote after the debate, which, of course, would protect the \ndistinguished Democratic leader. If I might have the attention of the \nSenator.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I withdraw my reservation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Obviously, the Democratic leader would be protected on the \ntime for a vote on his amendment. I would ensure that he was protected \nbecause, absent unanimous consent, a vote would come when his time was \ncompleted. But I think the distinguished leaders on both sides have \nbeen trying to work on the schedule, knowing that every Senator is \nprotected at the time of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request to lay the \namendment aside?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3452 to Amendment No. 3184\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the commodity payment provisions and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle], for himself, \n     Mr. Pryor, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dorgan, \n     Mr. Heflin, Mr. Exon, Mr. Breaux, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Baucus, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3452 to amendment No. 3184.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the amendment I offer this afternoon \nrepresents what I hope will be a consensus here about farm policy and \nthe direction we take in agriculture for the next 7 years.\n  We seek many of the same things, Republicans and Democrats.\n  We want to ensure that we protect rural America to the extent we can. \n\n\n[[Page S1044]]\n Democrats believe protecting rural America means ensuring it will \nprovide a safety net for farmers in the difficult times, when prices \nare low, when crops are poor. We want to provide the maximum degree of \nflexibility, giving farmers a chance to plant what they want, to \nrecognize the market changes, and to ensure they can respond to those \nchanges as quickly and efficiently and successfully as possible. We \nwant to simplify the complex programs that exist today, making them \neasier to administer, reducing the administrative intensity and the \nfrustration levels of farmers themselves. Finally, we want to guarantee \nthat farm programs do not end when this legislation expires.\n  That is the purpose of the amendment I offer this afternoon. I do so \nwith the recognition that we have many very diverse elements within our \ncaucus and within the Senate. In spite of that diversity, we have \nSenators from the South and the West, the East and the North who have \ncosponsored this legislation with me this afternoon. I am very \ndisappointed, frankly, that it has come to this, that we have not been \nable to work, as we have on so many occasions in the past, to come up \nwith farm policy that is much more bipartisan than this has been so \nfar.\n  Unfortunately, as a result, we do not have a comprehensive bill \nbefore us today. We have a very narrow budget bill that fails to \naddress many of the very legitimate concerns of rural America. While \nthe underlying legislation provides for the freedom to farm approach, \nthis amendment will address what we view to be many of the \nshortcomings, many of those areas that in our view fall short of what \nwe need to do to address in a comprehensive way farm legislation for \nthe next 7 years.\n  The amendment does a number of things, Mr. President, that I believe \nare supported by a vast majority of our caucus and hopefully by a \nmajority of the Senate. We provide, as I said, the maximum degree of \nflexibility. The whole farm base is provided with restrictions only on \nfruits, vegetables and potatoes.\n  There is no acreage reduction whatsoever.\n  We retain permanent law, reinstating the Agricultural Act of 1949 at \nthe expiration of the so-called freedom to farm act.\n  We establish permanent law for rice at the 1995 levels.\n  We set out a 3-year farm program instead of a 7-year program, only \nbecause we really do not know what the circumstances are going to be in \n3 years. We do not know what the market conditions are going to be. We \ndo not know how far short this legislation will fall in a whole range \nof areas. Rather than simply commit to 7 years and hope for the best, \nthis legislation says we should take a hard look at where we are in 3 \nyears, make whatever adaptations we have to make, and make sure we have \ncovered all of our bases so we are not left high and dry in 3 years \nwithout the protection that permanent law provides.\n  We remove the caps on loan rates contained in the freedom to farm \nact. We remove the Findley and stocks-to-use triggers, and set loan \nrates for wheat, feedgrains, oilseeds and rice at 90 percent of the \nOlympic average. We limit county adjustments to 3 percent.\n  There is an advance deficiency payment with no repayment necessary. \nThat advance payment is 20 cents per bushel for corn, 43 cents for \nwheat, 4.9 cents per pound for cotton and 1.54 per hundredweight for \nrice.\n  The remaining payment is tied to production and market conditions, \nthe market conditions dictating the degree to which we have an \nadditional payment. This is not a locked-in, 100 percent guarantee to \nthose who own land, whether they farm or not. This is not one of those \ncommitments to corporate agriculture that, indeed, they are entitled to \nunder freedom to farm without any requirement that they farm at all, \nwhich is obviously the subject of the Dorgan amendment.\n  We restore the farmer-owned reserve.\n  We restore the Emergency Livestock Feed Program.\n  We eliminate the Commodity Credit Corporation interest rate increase \nas Senator Harkin attempted to do.\n  We eliminate the prohibition of Commodity Credit Corporation funds.\n  We reduce the EQIP herd size eligibility to EPA point source numbers.\n  We allow enrollment in the Water Conservation Program and create a \nFarmland Protection Act to protect against urban sprawl.\n  We create a conservation escrow account.\n  We include a sense of the Senate provision on methyl bromide, \nencouraging Federal coordination on this issue, something we have to do \nultimately in California if we are going to deal with this issue \neffectively.\n  We reauthorize the Integrated Farm Management Program.\n  We provide tenant protection regarding the freedom-to-farm contracts.\n  We provide assistance to protect the Everglades.\n  Mr. President, in essence, this amendment is a comprehensive farm \nbill. This is what we should have done. This is legislation addressing \nvirtually every concern that farmers and others throughout the country \nhave raised--many of which go unaddressed in the so-called freedom-to-\nfarm act.\n  I have a large number of people who have asked to be heard on the \nbill and, to protect our time, I will reserve the balance of our time, \nyielding first 3 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a few months ago a number of us went to \nthe White House to meet with President Clinton. Senator Daschle was \namong them. We brought some farmers from North Dakota and South Dakota \nto talk to the President about the farm program and what they were \nexperiencing day-to-day on their farms.\n  One of them from North Dakota was Deb Lundgren. She and her husband \nand her children operate a family farm near Kulm, ND. They are third \ngeneration farmers, trying to run their family farm.\n  When I called Deb and asked her to come to Washington for a meeting \nwith the President she said, ``It is really a coincidence you called. \nYesterday morning,'' she said, ``my husband and I were having kind of a \ntearful conversation over the breakfast table about whether we would be \nable to continue farming next year.''\n  She came to the White House and told a compelling story to the \nPresident about the struggle that it takes to operate a family farm \nwith uncertain prices, uncertainty about whether you get a crop. They \nhad a wet year last year and did not have much of a crop. Prices are \nup, but it does not mean much if you didn't raise a crop.\n  At the conclusion of the meeting, the President said to Deb, ``You \nhang in there. We will try to fight for a farm program that really \nworks for family farmers.''\n  That is the only reason I care about this. If this farm program is \nnot about trying to help preserve a network of family farms in this \ncountry, in my judgment we do not need a farm program and we do not \nneed a USDA. Go back to the Abe Lincoln days, when he started the USDA \nwith nine employees.\n  If we are not going to save family farms, if we are not going to give \nfamilies a chance to farm in this country's future, we do not need any \nof this. If we need this, and I think we do, it is to try to help \nfamilies make a living out on the farm with uncertain prices and \nuncertainty about whether you can even get a crop.\n  What Senator Daschle had offered is a good compromise. Many of us \nhave worked on it for some long time. It is not the freedom-to-farm \nact. It does not provide payments for people who do not plant. It is \nsensitive to the market. It says when prices collapse, and they will, \nthere will be a safety net there and we will respond to the issues of \nthe market. We are not going to yank the safety net out from under \nfamily-sized farms. It says there is a need for permanent farm law.\n  Farm commodity prices go up and they go down. When they go down, the \nbig agrifactories can survive because they have the financial \ncapability of surviving. It is the mom and pop out there trying to run \na family farm that can fail.\n\n  Some people say that does not matter very much. I suppose to some it \ndoes not. The only reason we ought to fight for a farm program on the \nfloor of this Senate is to save farm families like Deb Lundgren and her \nhusband and so many others, who are out there every single day trying \nto make a living. We can do it if we do it the right way.\n  This alternative is the right alternative. It provides complete \nplanting \n\n[[Page S1045]]\nflexibility. It provides up-front payments to help recapitalize family \nfarms. It does all of the right things and is immensely better in terms \nof farm policy than the freedom-to-farm bill.\n  I am pleased to support this, and I hope my colleagues will. I hope \nwe can adopt this substitute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, very generally, the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from South Dakota is an amendment to improve upon the bill \nbefore us. Improvement is necessary in order to provide some kind of \ncertainty so farmers know in the future--when prices are not as high as \nthey are now--that there is some stability, some certainty. Improvement \nis necessary so farmers can continue to farm, continue to pay the bills \nand make payments on the equipment and fertilizer. In short, so they \ncan stay in business.\n  We know that today prices of wheat are higher than they have been in \nmany years. It is the same for most other commodities. So this \namendment offered by the Senator from South Dakota accomplishes several \nobjectives, all of which I strongly support. One of them, the main one, \nthe main philosophy and rationale, is more stability, particularly in \nthose years--we know it is going to come--when prices are going to be \nlow.\n  One provision which is also important is improving the marketing loan \nmechanism, to increase the loan rate from 85 percent of the 5-year \naverage to a level of 90 percent. That is very important, particularly \nin years of low prices.\n  The amendment also eliminates the mechanisms by which the Secretary \ncan reduce the loan rate. The so-called Findley amendment and the \nstocks-to-use adjustment are both eliminated. The amendment also \nremoves the arbitrary caps on loan rates which are contained in the \nbill. These caps serve to render loan rates lower at those times when \nthe loans are most useful to producers--times when prices are low.\n  Again, with this amendment there is a little bit more stability, a \nlittle more certainty at those times when we know prices are going to \nfall. That is one of the main reasons I support this pending amendment.\n  Another is to change the crop insurance. Back in 1994, the crop \ninsurance reform package imposed requirements that producers purchase \ncatastrophic crop insurance coverage in order to participate in the \nfarm program. Basically I think it had some benefits, though I would \nhave preferred to fix certain problems. But the pending bill totally \neliminates that requirement. What is the effect? The effect of \neliminating mandatory coverage. And that basically seals the fate of \nthe Federal Crop Insurance Program because we will have fewer farmers \nparticipating. For the crop insurance program to work, more farmers \nhave to participate. That is basically the theory of insurance. The \nmore everybody is involved, the more insurance works. The provisions in \nthis bill are going to end that linkage between insurance purchase and \nfarm program participation.\n  I expect that fewer producers are going to participate in the crop \ninsurance program. That means the crop insurance program will be at \ngreater risk. It should be modified, but it should not be eliminated.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge Senators to think down the road a \nlittle bit. Think of the years when prices are going to be lower. Let \nus improve this bill by taking care of those situations when prices \nwill be lower and we will have a little more stability and a little \nmore certainty.\n  Mr. President, I thank our Democratic leader for so aggressively and \neffectively working to help improve this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Montana for his \neloquence and the tremendous effort he has demonstrated in putting this \ncomprehensive package together. His effort and his leadership are \ndeeply appreciated.\n  Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I remind the Democratic leader he has 1 minute \n50 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will use my leader time as I may require. From that \ntime I will yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, as a Member of the U.S. Senate, it is so \nremarkably easy from time to time to do something. This is one of those \ntimes. This is a time when it is going to be very easy to say to \nfarmers across our country that you do not have to plant to have a \ncheck. You are going to get a check in advance. You can go on vacation, \nyou can get your check from the taxpayers. This is one of those times \nwhen I think we are about to make the terrible mistake, a terrible \ncompass error, trying to do something that is easy when actually we \nshould be doing something that is responsible.\n  Many of the farm organizations have come out now in support of the \nconcept of the freedom-to-farm movement. The freedom-to-farm \nlegislation has received the support, in the last several days and \nhours, of many of the groups that have opposed it. But, Mr. President, \nthat does not mean this is a piece of legislation without flaw. It is \nseriously flawed. It was a seriously flawed piece of legislation when \nit was introduced. It is seriously flawed today as we go to a vote with \na very short time to debate it.\n  I applaud the Democratic leader for offering us an opportunity, \noffering us a chance to save ourselves from making an enormous mistake \nthat could affect agriculture and affect our country for generations to \ncome.\n  This is a measure offered by the distinguished Democratic leader and \nothers of his colleagues who say that we want to keep a basic safety \nnet. We want to keep flexibility, but we do not want to decouple those \npayments from production. We need to couple those payments with \nproduction. We need to say to the farm sector in our country: Let us \nslow this down just a moment. We know there is no farm program. But is \nit better to have a bad farm program than no farm program at all for \nthe moment?\n  I think the Daschle alternative--very respectfully, I think his \nalternative gives us that opportunity and that chance to speak to the \nfuture of American agriculture. One, it does not tie us for 7 years. It \nonly obligates us and this Congress and the American farmer for a \nperiod of 3 years. In that 3-year period, hopefully we will have sorted \nout where we are and we will have the opportunity to revisit this \nissue.\n  The Senator from South Dakota has offered us a very good, \nconstructive option. I hope we will heed his wisdom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nrequire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the amendment by the distinguished \nDemocratic leader is a comprehensive plan. Earlier in our debate, in \nfact yesterday, as we talked about agriculture, the distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, offered, at least as one way of trying \nto resolve our agricultural legislation this year, the thought that as \nRepublicans we would offer our plan. It is called freedom to farm. It \nis the plan I laid down and has been amended. We have been debating it \nthroughout the day.\n  The majority leader challenged Democrats to offer a plan, and the \nDemocratic leader has done so. It is a very different plan, and Members \nwill need to make choices as we finally come to votes on that plan. Let \nme just say Members ought to understand that the plan offered by the \ndistinguished Democratic leader has expenses attached to it that are \nfairly substantial.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates for increased spending on \nthe loan rates amount to $7.6 billion over the life of his bill. That \nis a very substantial sum. Earlier in the day, I criticized amendments \nby the distinguished Senator from Iowa because they had expenditure \nincreases of $260 million and $100 million respectively. I commented, \nand I think most Senators agree, that we are still attempting to work \ntoward a balanced budget in this country. The agriculture legislation \nis a part of that, and the freedom-to-farm \n\n[[Page S1046]]\nbill that I am advocating today carefully calibrates those decisions in \nterms of sacrifice that agriculture must make.\n  The distinguished Democratic leader's idea is to provide, I gather, \nhigher income through rather startling change in the loan rate picture, \nand a very expensive one--$7.6 billion more. I think Senators and \ntaxpayers need to understand that is a transfer payment once again to \nfarmers who might qualify for those loans.\n  Let me just suggest, Mr. President, that as we have heard recitation \nof stories about farmers struggling--and, indeed, the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota mentioned the story of a lady attending a \nWhite House conference, as I gather, indicating the struggle that she \nhad--those struggles are well-known, and I have been pointing them out \nthroughout the opportunities I have had today.\n  The freedom-to-farm act provides stability. It provides, despite \ncriticism of some Senators, a payment each year. That is almost as \ncertain as you can make it, if a contract is signed. It provides \nfreedom to farm, but it also provides certainty of income.\n  Whatever might be said about current farm law and its extension, it \ndoes not provide a very great deal of certainty. I can testify to that \nfrom my own experience managing my own farm property from 1956 until \nthe present. I have been involved at the ASCS office throughout that \nperiod of time. I am very familiar with the corn program and the wheat \nprogram, and I would simply say if I were a thoughtful person relying \nupon the type of security provided by those programs, I would have \ngreat fears all the time.\n  Obviously, each farmer plants for the market, and does the best that \nhe or she can to maximize income. But let me just say, Mr. President, \nin the freedom-to-farm act that we have taken seriously the thought \nthat we are in transition in the world. We may have a broad swing, as \nSenators pointed out, at prices, but those certainly will be mitigated \nby the certainty of income. It would appear to me that all farmers who \nare looking for, as has been characterized today, some certainty and \nsome stability would clearly find freedom-to-farm to be a superior \nalternative on those grounds alone.\n\n  Freedom to farm is also superior, as I have pointed out, on the basis \nof budget, on the basis of taxpayer expense, and transfer payments of \nother citizens to the farm communities.\n  Mr. President, freedom to farm also offers more certainty because it \nis a 7-year program, not a 3-year program as suggested by the \ndistinguished Democratic leader. There is great stability in having a \nmultiyear program. This is why, at least in the last two instances, we \nhave tried for as long as a 5-year period of time, and most farmers \nhave found that to be a very satisfactory idea.\n  Mr. President, I will not attempt to go through each of the details \nof the Democratic leader's program. I am hearing it and seeing it on \nfirst impression today, as are most Senators, although many elements of \nthe program are familiar from arguments we have had before. For \nexample, earlier in the day the Senate rejected the farmer-owned \nreserve, as I heard--at least the recitation a short while ago that \nreappears. Likewise, we rejected the thought that farmers ought to be \nsubsidized with lower CCC interest rates, although, as I recall, I \nthink that reappears in the comprehensive package.\n  In short, there are reappearances of many elements that have been \nfound very unsatisfactory in terms of farm policy by farmers quite \napart from the rest of the general public. Indeed, the Democratic \nleader's bill is a collection of many programs that have had a high \ndegree of failure and lack of confidence, and even a combination of \nthem and with more money injected will not remedy that situation.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that Senators will affirm the freedom to \nfarm idea and the elements that have been discussed now during this \ndebate, and reject the alternative proposal of the Democratic leader.\n  There is a choice to be made today. I think the choice is a very \nclear one. And I am most hope hopeful that Senators will support \nfreedom to farm.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes of my leader time to \nthe distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the leader, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this has been a difficult and contentious debate, one \nthat has gone on now since 1995 to 1996. We stand on a precipice. The \nquestion is: What direction will we take? I very much fear that the so-\ncalled freedom-to-farm formulation will take literally hundreds of \nthousands of farmers right over the cliff. I believe that to be the \ncase because this is a radical change in farm policy. It says we are \ngoing to make fixed and declining payments to farmers over a 7-year \nperiod and no one knows what comes next.\n  Mr. President, it does not provide the kind of price support in a \nlow-price year that is critically important to preventing the loss of \nliterally tens of thousands of family farmers. That is right at the \nheart of this question and this debate. Do we say to farmers, We make a \npayment to you even when prices are good, but there is no price \nprotection when prices fall through the floor, no additional price \nprotection? Mr. President, I think that is a profound mistake.\n  I think we have an opportunity to take the best of the various \nproposals that are on the table and to have a plan that provides some \nfixed payments up front to help farmers with cash flow, to especially \nhelp them with the repayment of advanced deficiency payments from last \nyear, but to also put into law another form of payment that takes note \nof reduction in prices and reduction in yield. That is what the \nalternative does that is before us.\n  Mr. President, for decades we have sought to protect farmers, to \nbuffer farmers from dramatic swings in commodity prices. Under the \nRepublican plan, the farmers are left swinging. Farmers will no longer \nbe protected in low price years. The safety net on which farmers have \nrelied will be torn. I do not think that is good policy. I do not think \nit makes sense. I believe it will generate opposition to any future \nfarm programs.\n\n  Mr. President, our plan offers a combination of the guaranteed \npayment up front and price protection and protection against yields \nthat are reduced as a result of natural disaster. Our plan is a \ncompromise. Our plan is a compromise which I think many on both sides \nof the aisle could accept. It also is something that I think can stand \nthe test of time.\n  One of the great problems we have here is passing policies that can \nbe sustained. The pure freedom-to-farm policy is not one, in my \njudgment, that will stand the test of time.\n  According to North Dakota State University, net farm income in North \nDakota under the pure freedom-to-farm will drop 50 percent from the \nyear 1995 to 2001.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 4 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds of additional time to \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will just conclude with an example. I \nhave looked at a typical North Dakota farm with about 1,000 acres of \nwheat under normal production swings in the Congressional Budget \nOffice's expected price projections for 1996 to 2002. This typical farm \nwill receive 43 percent less under freedom-to-farm than under our plan; \n$22,000 under the Family Farm Protection Act, and $15,000 under freedom \nto farm.\n  Our plan stands behind the farmers and beside the farmers. Their plan \nsteps aside.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished chairman \nfor his kindness. He has agreed to allow us the use of 2 of his \nminutes. As I understand it, I have 4 minutes of leader time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes and 10 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Arkansas \nhave 3 minutes and the Senator from Nebraska have 3 minutes to complete \nour side of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. \n  \n[[Page S1047]]\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the reason I strongly favor this \nsubstitute is because it salvages rice markets. Under the freedom-to-\nfarm bill, payments start out big, peak in the third year, and they go \ndown after that. Right now, cotton, wheat, and corn, three of the big \nprogram crops in this country, are all bringing more than the target \nprice, which means under existing law those programs would not cost us \nanything if those prices hold up through the rest of the year.\n  That is not true of rice. And I am not optimistic that rice will \nachieve anything like, say, $9.50 to $10 a hundredweight any time in \nthe foreseeable future. And so what is going to happen under the \nfreedom-to-farm act? Rice farmers are going to be producing rice for \nabout $3 a bushel, if current prices stay up, $3.50, and they cannot do \nit. They cannot stay in business. So everybody is being lured with this \nsiren song about how much money we are going to pay you on the front \nend, and then it is over.\n  Now, the Democratic alternative program at least is a 3-year program, \nprovides for a 40-percent advance, and will at least give rice farmers \na chance to produce and stay in business. Under the freedom-to-farm \nbill, they will stay in business the first 3 or 4 years--unless public \nclamour forces the entire program to a quick termination, but after \nthat they are going to start dropping like flies.\n  I am not absolutely rhapsodic about this substitute. I do not have \nany delusions about it passing. But I wanted to vote for something so \nthey can put on my epitaph that I was violently opposed to the freedom-\nto-farm bill because I think it is one of the worst disasters this \ncountry is going to face.\n  We did not put in place the existing law just on a whim. We did it \nbecause we thought it was a good balance between the taxpayers and the \nfarmers. It is a good balance, and it is working. It is working \nextremely well. You could not pick a worse time to do away with today's \nprogram. On the other hand, if you wanted to do away with farm \nprograms, with today's high prices for most commodities, a time when \nfarmers know that they don't need immediate assistance from Federal \nfarm programs, you couldn't find a better time or a darker night in \nwhich to do it. This substitute retains the requirements of actually \nfarming in order to participate in farm programs. This may seem like a \ntrivial requirement, but it does not exist at all in the freedom-to-\nfarm bill. This substitute continues to provide a true safety net for \nfarmers during periods of market collapse. This substitute will protect \nfarmers when they need it and it does not offer them a golden parachute \nto the tropics.\n\n  Farming is hard work, and this substitute works with farmers. Anyone \nwho looks closely at our proposal will learn it has some good features. \nAnd most importantly, it is infinitely better than what we have before \nus in the form of freedom to farm.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for yielding to me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Democratic \nalternative introduced by the Democratic leader.\n  The farm bill situation has become so convoluted it is difficult to \nknow where to begin. We face an unprecedented situation. Not since the \n1950's has the Congress failed to enact a farm bill in a timely \nfashion. This predicament is a poor reflection on the 104th Congress.\n  Is it any wonder that this year's farm bill debate has sunk so low? \nNot at all. The bill before us, the so-called freedom-to-farm bill, was \nnever considered by the Senate Agriculture Committee. In the House of \nRepresentatives, Republican leadership bypassed the Agriculture \nCommittee altogether after it failed there. Through a bit of \nparliamentary magic, the measure was routed through the House Rules \nCommittee and then ramrodded into the budget bill with little \nopportunity for debate or amendment.\n  Throughout history, farm programs have had two essential purposes: to \nsmooth out devastating price fluctuations, and to provide a reasonable \nsafety net for family farmers. These are still worthy goals and should \nbe the subject of debate.\n  Unfortunately, the freedom-to-farm bill on both counts fails and \nessentially turns farm programs into welfare programs. It destroys the \nessential and the traditional connection between the market price and \nfarm payments.\n  In short, freedom-to-farm promises fixed transition payments, based \non historic production levels which decline over time. These payments \nwill be made regardless of market prices, as the Senator from Arkansas \nhas just indicated. In other words, they are entirely divorced. That \napproach is not market oriented. It is market ignorant.\n  Some have been led to believe this might be a fair tradeoff; money up \nfront in return for total elimination of farm programs as originally \ndrafted. Now, in a clever but meaningless gesture, in my view, it has \nbeen agreed to delete the elimination of the 1949 act. That sounds \ngreat, but does anyone believe we would ever agree to $700 wheat and \n$500 corn?\n\n  The National Center for Agricultural Law Research and Information has \nstudied the fine print of the freedom to farm act and concludes that \nthe payments ``* * * are not guaranteed for the life of the Freedom to \nFarm legislation.'' Other legal experts agree. Simply put, this so-\ncalled 7-year contract would be just as vulnerable as any other Federal \nprogram.\n  Where would that leave farmers? They will get the short end of the \nstick. Future budget negotiators will be hard pressed to defend \nexcessive freedom-to-farm transition payments when dramatic cuts are \nbeing made elsewhere.\n  What we need is a farm bill that provides greater flexibility, one \nthat preserves a basic safety net, one that protects family farmers, \nand one that taxpayers can support.\n  I strongly urge acceptance of the alternative offered by the Senator \nfrom South Dakota.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes and 20 seconds.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I see no other speakers on our side. \nTherefore, I will summarize the case for freedom to farm which, as a \nmatter of fact, is going to mean much greater flexibility and freedom \nto farmers and provide really the greatest degree of safety over a 7-\nyear period of time.\n  Senators on the other side of the aisle supporting the distinguished \nDemocratic leader's bill have talked about certainty and stability, \nabout the fact that farmers could go out of business in large numbers \nin the rice business or in other commodities that have been mentioned. \nThere always is that danger, and this is one reason why the legislation \nhas occurred.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, if the desire is for security, freedom \nto farm is by far the preferable option simply because it does have a \ncertain payment for 7 years. The Democratic leader's program is based \nupon current farm policy and lasts for 3 years, and, as I have pointed \nout, from my own experience even if there is a loan rate there or even \nif there are target prices and deficiency payments that come when \nmarket prices are lower, these are uncertain in volume. They are no \nmore likely to provide stability or certainty that a farmer will stay \nin business.\n  Mr. President, we are on the threshold, in my judgment, of an \nunprecedented period in American farm history dictated largely by our \nsuccess in export markets. In this particular year, the Chinese turn of \nevents, that is, their move to import as opposed to export, has turned \naround prices, as Senators have pointed out on both sides of the aisle, \nremarkably high prices for wheat and corn and soybeans. Other factors \nhave led to very high prices for cotton during this market year.\n  Senators have pointed out, given the fact that market prices are well \nabove the target prices, there is a case to be made that there is no \nGovernment payment at all under those circumstances. This leads to some \nquestion as to where the 40-percent payment would come from, for \nexample, in a year such as this. \n\n[[Page S1048]]\n\n  Would USDA ignore all the market signals, ignore the facts, even if \nwe were looking toward the year we are about to plant, in which a \nfarmer could sell a contract, a futures contract for corn at least 25 \ncents above the target price? You can do that now. Where is the advance \ndeficiency payment in that situation? Any honest observer of the scene \nwould say there is no deficiency payment. It is 40 percent of zero. \nWhere the new stability and certainty comes for farmers from that \ncalculation, I fail to see.\n  We are so mired in our thoughts about the past that we are unable to \ntake a look at what is presently ahead of us. In fact, the crop year we \nhave just had, the one we are about to have, and about to have after \nthat--to stretch my argument a little farther--you can take a look at \nthe futures market and sell your crop for the year after this one and \nstill get a certain price above the target price for corn.\n  It has been some time since that was possible. But those are the \nrealities now. Where is the advance deficiency payment in years 1 or 2, \nif you take an honest look really at markets at this point?\n  What we are saying, those of us advocating this legislation today, \nfreedom to farm, is that obviously what goes up can come down. In the \n3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th year there might be great uncertainty. And if \nthere is, there is a certain payment, and you still keep your eyes on \nthe market. That is the best course for agricultural producers, those \ncommodities that there is demand for, and to decouple this from the \nnecessity to plant a certain thing to produce a history or to produce a \npayment.\n  So, Mr. President, I oppose the distinguished Democratic leader's \nidea. He has risen to the challenge of offering an alternative, but it \nis not a superior one. The freedom-to-farm bill we have before us, in \nmy judgment, is our best bet. I hope it will have a standing success in \nfinal passage and, meanwhile, that we defeat the Daschle amendment.\n  Mr. President, I see no further debaters on our side. Therefore, I \nyield back all time on our side on this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent, in the presence of the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, that the amendment be temporarily laid aside, as we \nhave pending negotiations on when votes will come.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I just say that if we are going to \ncomplete our work by 4:45, we will have to begin voting, by my \ncalculation, at 3:35. So if there are additional amendments to be \noffered, we have less than a half-hour to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I second the advice of the distinguished \nDemocratic leader and hope that those who still have something to say \nwill come promptly. I will try to expedite the process.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3453 to Amendment No. 3184\n\n(Purpose: Require the Department of Agriculture to allow private sector \n                   to develop farm management plans)\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Kempthorne and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for Mr. Kempthorne, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3453 to amendment No. 3184.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At page 3-25 after line 8 and before line 9 insert the \n     following paragraph so that beginning at line 9 the bill \n     reads:\n       ``(8) Notwithstanding any provision of law, the Secretary \n     shall ensure that the process of writing, developing, and \n     assisting in the implementation of plans required in the \n     programs established under this title be open to individuals \n     in agribusiness including but not limited to agricultural \n     producers, representatives from agricultural cooperatives, \n     agricultural input retail dealers, and certified crop \n     advisers. This process shall be included in but not limited \n     to programs and plans established under this title and any \n     other Department program using incentive, technical \n     assistance, cost-share or pilot project programs that require \n     plans.''\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to comment on my \namendment to the bill now before us. S. 1541 proposes significant \nchange to our national farm policy, with the goal of bringing our \nNation's farmers into a healthy market environment. This amendment will \nfacilitate that transition.\n  Farmers in my State and across the country participate in numerous \nconservation efforts. These include federally directed programs \nincluding conservation compliance requirements of farm program, and \nvoluntary programs like the Conservation Reserve Program and the \nWetlands Reserve Program.\n  The success of these programs is due in large part to a strong \nrelationship with the private sector and agribusiness farm management \nplanners and advisors. These advisors are members of the community, \nthey live and work on a day to day basis with farmers. These advisors \nare qualified with the latest agronomic, conservation technological and \nfarm planning techniques.\n  Mr. President, it would be a shame if we did not ensure that farmers \ncould tap into this resource as they strive to develop the best \nconservation plan possible for their farmland. This amendment ensures \nthat farmers have the not only the freedom to farm, but to farm wisely \nby allowing them the broadest possible source of technical information \nand support.\n  This is particularly important because this bill proposing expanding \nthe criteria for conservation plans from soil erosion control to \ninclude such goals as wildlife management and water quality control.\n  The idea behind the amendment is to cement the private-public \npartnership which already exists. We cannot kid ourselves--Federal \nresources to provide technical assistance to farmers are going to \ncontinue to be limited. This amendment would assure that farmers have a \nstrong local resource to supplement the efforts of the Extension \nService and the Natural Resources Conservation Service.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the amendment I offer on behalf of the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho would ensure that farmers have not \nonly the freedom to farm, but the freedom to farm wisely. The amendment \nmakes sure that farmers can go to the sources they need, including \nagribusiness experts, to develop management plans for their farms to \nmeet Federal conservation requirements.\n  My understanding is that this amendment has been agreed to on both \nsides.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We have no objection, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Idaho.\n  The amendment (No. 3453) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just for a few moments while we are \nwaiting, I thought I might think out loud with a few reflections about \nthis farm bill.\n  I said to my colleague from Vermont and my colleague from Indiana, \nthey have been very cooperative. With the managers' amendment, there \nwill be technical corrections to reflect a decision we made earlier \nthis morning that I am very pleased about as a Senator from Minnesota, \nas a Senator from the Upper Midwest. That is to say we will not have a \nNortheast dairy compact. I will not go over that debate, but I was very \npleased with the vote this morning.\n  It is with some concern that I speak about the direction we are going \nbecause, Mr. President, I think what we are going to see with this \nfreedom-to-\n\n[[Page S1049]]\nfarm approach is a kind of combination of carrot and stick. The carrot \nwill be that farmers will get higher support payments that go with good \nprice that farmers are getting right now. I am pleased to see that good \nprice.\n  But the question becomes in the medium run, in the long run, what \nhappens when farmers no longer get that good price, whether it be \nbecause of the weather, whether it be because of a flood, or whether it \nbe because of the position that farmers are in all too often, not so \nmuch as pricemakers but pricetakers.\n  My concern about the stick is that I think where this takes us \neventually is that farmers are going to find themselves on their own \nwhen it comes to dealing with Cargill, or on their own when it comes to \ndealing with the Chicago Board of Trade. Quite frankly, I wish we had \nAdam Smith's invisible hand. I wish we had real free enterprise in \nagriculture, but I see an industry where, I think, the conglomerates \nhave muscled their way to the dinner table with tremendous \nconcentration of power.\n  So I worry about the cap on the loan rate and farmers not having a \nstrong bargaining position as they look to an oligopolistic and, for \nthat matter, monopolistic market.\n  So I am proud of the vote this morning, 50 to 46. It was extremely \nimportant to my State. I felt like the compact was a poison pill for \ndairy farmers in Minnesota. We still are going to continue--I have been \nat it for 5 years--trying to reform this milk marketing order system. \nAs I look at the overall bill, that was a victory for dairy farmers. I \nhope we will have a milk marketing order system that will be good for \ndairy farmers everywhere in the country. I have to say, I think this \nbill we are about to vote on is, as I said, a great carrot in the short \nrun, good prices and contract payments, but in the long run, I think \nwhat it says to farmers is you are on your own with Cargill, with the \nBoard of Trade. I do not think the farmers in Minnesota or across the \ncountry will fare well with that approach.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am advised the distinguished Senator from Utah has an \namendment. I hope he will offer it presently. We are coming down close \nto the time that the distinguished leader mentioned we will commence \nthe rollcall votes.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3277 to Amendment No. 3184\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to permit participating \n     households to use food stamp benefits to purchase nutritional \n      supplements of vitamins, minerals, or vitamins and minerals)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3277 and ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Harkin be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself, Mr. \n     McConnell, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3277 to amendment No. 3184.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title IV, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 406. NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the dietary patterns of Americans do not result in \n     nutrient intakes that fully meet Recommended Dietary \n     Allowances (RDAs) of vitamins and minerals;\n       (2) children in low-income families and the elderly often \n     fail to achieve adequate nutrient intakes from diet alone;\n       (3) pregnant women have particularly high nutrient needs, \n     which they often fail to meet through dietary means alone;\n       (4)(A) many scientific studies have shown that nutritional \n     supplements that contain folic acid (a B vitamin) can prevent \n     as many as 60 to 80 percent of neural tube birth defects;\n       (B) the Public Health Service, in September 1992, \n     recommended that all women of childbearing age in the United \n     States who are capable of becoming pregnant should consume \n     0.4 mg of folic acid per day for the purpose of reducing \n     their risk of having a pregnancy affected with spina bifida \n     or other neural tube birth defects; and\n       (C) the Food and Drug Administration has also approved a \n     health claim for folic acid to reduce the risk of neural tube \n     birth defects;\n       (5) infants who fail to receive adequate intakes of iron \n     may be somewhat impaired in their mental and behavioral \n     development; and\n       (6) a massive volume of credible scientific evidence \n     strongly suggests that increasing intake of specific \n     nutrients over an extended period of time may be helpful in \n     protecting against diseases or conditions such as \n     osteoporosis, cataracts, cancer, and heart disease.\n       (b) Amendment of the Food Stamp Act of 1977.--Section \n     3(g)(1) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2012(g)(1)) \n     is amended by striking ``or food product'' and inserting ``, \n     food product, or nutritional supplement of a vitamin, \n     mineral, or a vitamin and a mineral''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is the text of a bill, S. 1133, \nauthored by Senators McConnell, Harkin, and myself. Senators McConnell \nand Harkin are chair and ranking member of the Nutrition Subcommittee, \nand we consider this a very important amendment.\n  This is a small amendment, but makes a good deal of sense. It allows \nfood stamps to be used to purchase vitamins and minerals, a practice \nwhich I believe is permissible under current law, but which is not \nallowed due to Agriculture Department policy, a ridiculous policy, I \nmight add. It is time to change it.\n  There is ample evidence to show the nutritional benefits of vitamins \nand minerals. This incontrovertible fact was recognized not once, but \ntwice, by the U.S. Senate in 1993 when it passed the Dietary Supplement \nHealth and Education Act, Public Law 103-417.\n  I need not remind my colleagues that the dietary supplement bill \npassed without a single dissenting vote in either body, abundant proof, \nI believe, as to the safety and public health benefits of both vitamins \nand minerals.\n  For any of my colleagues who remain unconvinced, I direct their \nattention to Senate Report 103-410 which provides numerous references \nto scientific studies supporting the nutritional benefits of dietary \nsupplements.\n  In fact, studies have shown that more than 100 million Americans \nregularly use vitamins and minerals to ensure that their basic \nnutritional requirements are met, to support their health during \nperiods of special risk, and to help protect against chronic disease.\n  Let me point out that there is an ample body of evidence to show that \nmany Americans simply do not have healthy diets, and this is true for \nchildren as well as for men and women.\n  For example, in one Government study of the eating habits of more \nthan 21,000 people, not a single person got the full recommended daily \nallowance of 10 key vitamins and minerals--and that was just one study.\n  Many other studies have shown that the poor and elderly in our \ncountry are especially likely to have low nutrient intakes, often with \nsignificant health consequences. For example, a 1992 study by a world-\nrenowned authority on immune function reported that giving a modest \nmultivitamin with minerals to a group of men and women over the age of \n65 for a period of 1 year cut the number of sick days in this group to \nhalf compared to a similar unsupplemented group.\n  Perhaps the best example is folic acid, which the Food and Drug \nAdministration steadfastly resisted revealing to America's women as a \nsignificant protector against birth defects.\n  So while we all recognize it would be desirable for Americans to eat \nhealthy foods and maintain an adequate diet, that simply is not \nhappening.\n  The purpose of the Food Stamp Program, and let me quote from the \nDepartment's own regulation, is to ``promote the general welfare and to \nsafeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by \nraising the levels of nutrition among low-income households.''\n  I think that just about makes my case. Vitamins and minerals do just \nthat; they raise levels of nutrition.\n  Vitamins and minerals can prevent half of all neural tube defects in \nAmerica.\n  They can protect against heart disease and stroke.\n  They can improve appetite growth in poor children.\n  They can protect against some cancers.\n  They can build bone mass in children. \n  \n[[Page S1050]]\n\n  They can improve mental development in infants.\n  Those are very compelling reasons why the other Senators and I think \nthis is a good amendment.\n  Frankly, I do not know why anyone would have an objection to this \namendment.\n  Indeed, I do not know why the Agriculture Department has chosen to \nexclude vitamins and minerals from food stamp coverage.\n  As I read the applicable regulations, they only state that eligible \nfoods are ``any food or food product intended for human consumption \nexcept alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and hot foods and hot food \nproducts prepared for immediate consumption.''\n  That would certainly seem to include vitamins and minerals which are \nby Federal law considered to be foods. The law to which I refer is the \nDietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, a bill which \npassed this body twice with literally no objection at all.\n  I understand that it is the Food and Nutrition Service Handbook 318 \nwhich prohibits food stamp purchases of vitamins and minerals under the \ntheory that they are deficiency correctors or therapeutic agents. That \ndefinition flies in the face of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which, \nas modified by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 \nconfirms that dietary supplements are--by law--foods. I think many of \nmy colleagues would be astounded to learn that under the Agriculture \nDepartment's interpretation, a food stamp recipient can buy sunflower \nseeds or wheat germ, but not vitamin C or calcium tablets.\n  So we are forced to come to the floor today and correct this agency \nmisinterpretation.\n  To me, the reasons for our amendment are obvious. We want to help \nimprove nutrition, and vitamins and minerals can do just that.\n  As one expert pointed out during House hearings on this issue, food \nstamp recipients have free choice of virtually every food sold in the \nsupermarket--except vitamins and minerals. Let us think about the \nwisdom in that policy.\n  To be fair, some expressed concerns about the wisdom of adopting this \nchange in the law, but I believe there are compelling counter arguments \nwhich this body should consider.\n  For example, I recognize that Ms. Yvette Jackson, Deputy \nAdministrator of the Food Stamp Program, has testified against the \nHouse version of this amendment.\n  Frankly, I am disappointed with the administration's testimony and \ndismayed with its rationale. In the House testimony, Ms. Jackson was \nquoted as saying: ``It is unclear what effect a policy permitting the \nuse of food stamp benefits to purchase vitamin and mineral supplements \nwould have on the ability of recipients to purchase a varied and \nnutritious diet.''\n  I do not see what could be more clear than the fact that dietary \nsupplements can improve the health of the American people.\n  When we passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act last \nyear, and it passed the Senate twice by unanimous consent, it is no \nsecret that the administration, in general, and the Food and Drug \nAdministration, in particular, resisted our efforts.\n  To me, the USDA testimony is but further evidence that this \nadministration cannot, or will not, accept the fact that dietary \nsupplements can benefit the American people.\n  As I mentioned, this was made abundantly clear with the Food and Drug \nAdministration's foot-dragging on approving a health claim for folic \nacid. Even after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made a \nformal recommendation, endorsed by the Public Health Service, the FDA \nheld back. It has been estimated by public health experts that 50 \npercent of neural tube defect cases could be eliminated by consuming \n0.4 milligrams per day of folic acid a day. I fail to see how a food \nstamp policy that allows women to purchase folic acid in pill form can \ndo anything but to further the public health. We are talking about \nhealthy babies. That's what this amendment does.\n  Another argument that the administration and other critics of the \npolicy make is that--and I quote from the administration's own \ntestimony--``Adding more stores and more products would certainly make \nour efforts to fight fraud and abuse more difficult.''\n  First off, I do not see how the argument about adding more products \npasses the laugh test when you consider that each year literally \nthousands of food products and food producers enter the marketplace, \nand virtually all of these products are food stamp eligible, no \nquestions asked.\n  I also don't see how opening up the Food Stamp Program to new \noutlets, presumably health food stores, not already selling some \nconventional products would appreciably increase the incidence of fraud \nor abuse. Query how many retail outlets that sell vitamins and minerals \ndon't also already sell food stamp-eligible products?\n  It seems to me that many grocery store, pharmacy, and health food \nstore already sell food stamp-eligible products. Even if some new \nretail outlets come on line with this change, I think that is a good \nthing.\n  I challenge anyone in this body to present any factual information \nthat supports the proposition that a modest expansion of new stores \nwould necessarily lead to more fraud and abuse.\n  I certainly never have seen this type of argument used to curtail new \nvendors from becoming eligible to participate in a Federal entitlement \nprogram.\n  Let us be honest about it. If one extended this argument to its \nlogical conclusion, we should cut back the 216,000 stores that utilize \nfood stamps.\n  And while we are at it, we should cut back the number of doctors and \nhospitals that provide Medicare and Medicaid services. How many of us \nwould support that approach? That is how ridiculous this is.\n  Let me spend a few moments to review what I hope is a now-undisputed \nfact that dietary supplements are beneficial to health.\n  I mentioned a few of the health benefits of supplements that were on \nthe chart, including protection against heart disease and stroke. This \nis the number one cause of death in this country.\n  We also know that supplements can help promote growth in children. \nAccording to testimony presented by the Council for Responsible \nNutrition, low-income children can particularly benefit from consuming \nthe recommended daily allowances of vitamins and minerals.\n  As the National Nutritional Foods Association has pointed out, we \nknow that supplements can help protect against cancer, help build bone \nmass in children and the elderly, and help improve mental developments \nin infants.\n  Last year, as my colleagues may recall, when we passed the dietary \nsupplement legislation, our findings included these two statements:\n\n       Congress finds that the importance of nutrition and the \n     benefits of dietary supplements to health promotion and \n     disease prevention have been documented increasingly in \n     scientific studies; there is a link between the ingestion of \n     certain nutrients or dietary supplements and the prevention \n     of chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and \n     osteoporosis.\n\n  It seems to me that changing the food stamp laws to encourage low-\nincome people to use these product is good public policy.\n\n  As my colleagues can see from my second chart, it has been estimated \nthat in 1994 about $216 billion was spent by Americans on food products \nin supermarkets.\n  A little over three quarters of this, 77.7 percent, was spent on so-\ncalled core foods; these are foods that, in lay terms, your mother and \nyour health teachers taught you are good to eat.\n  These core foods include produce, dairy products, meat, poultry, \nseafood, baby food, juices, nuts, pasta, rice, bread, and other good \nfood.\n  As the diagram also shows, what some have termed frivolous foods, \nmake up 21.7 percent of food sales in supermarkets. These foods are \nexactly what you think they are: snack foods that are so good to eat \nbut may not be the most healthy choice. If you think about what you ate \nduring the Super Bowl--chips, cookies, candy, soft drinks, and the \nlike, you know what we mean when we use the term frivolous foods. They \nhave a place in our diets, but so do vitamins and minerals.\n  About 22 cents out of every $1 goes to these types of products, which \namounted to some $47 billion in 1994.\n  Compare that substantial amount of purchasing power with the less \nthan 1 percent--about $587 million in 1994--\n\n[[Page S1051]]\nthat was estimated to be spent on vitamins in food stores during the \nsame period.\n  In relative terms, much, much more is spent on what some \nnutritionists would call junk foods than on vitamins.\n  The reason I point this out is not to castigate any particular type \nof food. Rather, since some of my colleagues criticize this amendment \nbecause they say it dilutes the spending power of the food stamp, I \nwould like to point out how very, very small spending on vitamins and \nminerals is compared to all other foods sold in the supermarket \nsetting.\n  And so I think we must question the public health benefit of \ncontinuing a policy that allows for Federal subsidization of frivolous \nfoods but prevents food stamp coverage of valuable dietary supplements? \nIndeed, I think both should be covered, and that is my point.\n  Let me drive this home. As my last chart shows, it is OK under \ncurrent food stamp policy to buy all the soda pop you want--and this \nmay be very refreshing but it probably is not the most healthful \nproduct in the world.\n  At the same time, it is not OK to use food stamps to buy vitamins and \nminerals that generally are agreed upon by health experts to have \nunquestioned health benefits for the people who use them.\n  In other words, a food stamp recipient can use a coupon to purchase a \n50-cent can of soda, but not a 2-cent multivitamin. That is the most \ncompelling argument I know against those who feel that this amendment \nwould dilute the purchasing power of the food stamp.\n  I think our amendment would help recipients to make more wise \npurchases.\n  It seems to me that something is wrong with this picture and what is \nwrong is that vitamins and minerals should be covered by the food stamp \nprogram as well as all other foods.\n  I think it is entirely appropriate, indeed warranted, that any \nparticipant in the food stamp program who wants to improve his or her \nown health be allowed to purchase vitamins and minerals.\n  Why allow parents on food stamps the opportunity to give their \nchildren Cheez Whiz instead of vitamin C? Why not do both?\n  Why allow pregnant women to buy Fritos but not folic acid, which \nprevents neural tube defects?\n  Does this body really stand for the proposition that a Twinkie a day \nis more nutritious than a multivitamin?\n  Mr. President, if there is room in the food stamp program for vanilla \nwafers and Milky Ways, surely, there is room for vitamins and minerals \nas well.\n  I hope our colleagues will support this amendment. We think it is a \nworthwhile amendment. We hope that we can have the support of our \nfriends.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Does the Senator have some time to yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield whatever time I can.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Are we operating on a time limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield a couple minutes?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is there in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes ten seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the side in opposition has not spoken a \nword yet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 4 minutes for the proponents, 15 minutes \nfor the opponents.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am in strong support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Hatch. It is a commonsense amendment that is based \non legislation we introduced last year along with our distinguished \nchairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, Senator McConnell.\n  Today food stamps can be used to buy Twinkies, but not vitamin C. \nThat does not make sense. Poor children and women and elderly often \nhave significant vitamin and mineral deficiencies. For examples, \nstudies have shown that 40 percent of poor children have iron \ndeficiencies and 33 percent have vitamin E deficiencies.\n  Our amendment is supported by a broad coalition of groups and \nnutrition experts. For example, it is backed by the Alliance for Aging \nResearch, the Spina Bifida Association of America, the National \nOsteoporosis Foundation and the National Nutritional Foods Association. \nIt is also supported by nutrition experts and various scientists and \nheads of departments, including Dr. Paul Lachance, chairman of the \nDepartment of Food Science at Rutgers University; Dr. Jeffrey Blumberg \nof Tufts University; Dr. Charles Butterworth, Director of Human \nNutrition at the University of Alabama Birmingham; and Dr. Dennis \nHeldman, chairman of the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition \nat the University of Missouri.\n  Mr. President, there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that people \nwill forego important food purchases to buy vitamins. In fact, you can \nbuy a month's worth of multivitamins for about the price of one can of \nsoda.\n  So I do not think we have to worry that somehow food stamp recipients \nwill be wasting money. Quite the contrary, if the amendment goes \nthrough--they can buy vitamins and minerals. This simply allows the \nfood stamp recipients the right to improve their intake of key vitamins \nand minerals.\n  I make a plea on behalf of pregnant women, especially poor pregnant \nwomen who are on food stamps. We know the evidence is clear that many \nlower income women are more likely to have inadequate intake of key \nnutrients. Women with incomes 130 percent or less of the poverty level \nhave higher rates of deficiencies in vitamins A, D, C, B-6 and B-12, as \nwell as iron and niacin. They need these nutrients to have a healthy \nbaby. And we know the great benefits of this.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I've joined the Senator from Utah, \nSenator Hatch in offering is a commonsense amendment allowing low-\nincome people greater access to nutritional supplements. It is bottom-\nline common sense. Why should we not allow them to buy vitamin A or \nvitamin C, iron and mineral supplements, but allow them to buy Twinkies \nor Cheese Whiz?.\n  I say it is time to say to the people on food stamps, they can have \naccess to vitamin and mineral supplements to improve their health.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there is much in this amendment that sounds \nappealing until you look at it.\n  I have to say I strongly, strongly oppose the idea of the amendment. \nIt would be a major, significant change in our food stamp legislation. \nIt would be done without any debate, really--15 minutes on the floor, \nno hearings, without going through the committee of jurisdiction, \nwithout looking at the complexities of it. At a time when 1 out of \nevery 10 Americans are on food stamps, when the budget is being \nstretched, this makes no sense at all.\n  In fact, many of the families who are on food stamps today find they \nrun out of food by the end of the month. Adding other things they could \npurchase is not going to help. In the 1991 publication of the National \nAcademy of Sciences, they said food, rather than vitamin and mineral \nsubstances, should serve as the sole source of nutrients to meet the \ndietary needs. This is not asking food stamp purchasers to go on a \nyuppie diet fad of the moment that somehow they can just have vitamin \npills, whether they work or not--expensive, they should work--whether \nthey work or not and substitute it for food.\n  We are facing potential food stamp cuts as it is. To cut even more of \nthe amount of money available to food makes very little sense to me. It \nis a significant change in the food stamp legislation that was \ncarefully put together over the years by people on both sides of the \naisle, by the distinguished Republican leader, the senior Senator from \nKansas, by the distinguished senior Senator Lugar, by myself, and \nothers. To willy-nilly change it does not make sense. I would not \nsupport it.\n  I wish that the proponents would withdraw the amendment. If they do \nnot, I will join with others in opposition to it in an effort to defeat \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. How much time remains on both sides of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 12 minutes and 18 seconds; and on \nthe proponents' side, there is no time remaining. \n\n[[Page S1052]]\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I take this moment to ask unanimous consent that \nimmediately following debate on the Hatch amendment regarding vitamins, \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Dorgan amendment \nNo. 3451, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the Daschle \nsubstitute amendment, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the \nHatch amendment.\n  Further, that Senator Lugar be recognized to offer a final amendment \nto include an additional manager's amendment; and following the \nadoption of that, the Senate proceed to vote on the modified Craig-\nLeahy substitute, to be immediately followed by a vote on passage, as \nmodified. And further, there be 1 minute of debate equally divided in \nthe usual form between each of the stacked votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous consent that all votes following the first \nrollcall vote in this sequence be limited to 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I say, with relation to the current amendment, that no one \ndisputes the need for good nutrition, but the amendment obviously opens \nthe door for food stamp recipients to spend scarce food dollars on \nitems other than food. There is no dispute that it is best to get \nvitamins and minerals from food.\n  Therefore, I oppose the amendment. I will not speak further.\n  Mr. DOLE. I hope the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Idaho \nmight let us have hearings on it. It might have a lot of merit. I think \nrather than press it to a vote and lose, it might be preferable to have \na hearing in the Agriculture Committee and the Nutrition Subcommittee. \nI am happy to be there if that would help.\n  Mr. HATCH. I wonder if I could ask the two leaders, is it possible to \nagree to have hearings on this matter?\n  I cannot see for the life of me why this adds anything to the cost of \nfood stamps. It just says that instead of buying pop, you might buy \nvitamins and minerals.\n  Mr. DOLE. It may be a good idea.\n  Mr. HATCH. If you will hold hearings and if we can make a case that \nthis is beneficial--I have no doubt in my mind we will make that case--\nif you will hold a hearing on this specific issue on a bill that we \nwill file, and if we make the case you will help us move the bill, I am \nwilling to withdraw the amendment for now. But if not, we should just \nvote on it.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I pledge to the distinguished Senator, after consultation \nwith my distinguished colleague----\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I might have the attention of the distinguished \nmajority leader, I think having hearings would be a good thing to have \nto look at this proposal. It is something that both Senator Hatch and \nI--and Senator McConnell has a bill in that we are cosponsoring to do \njust this.\n  Hearings are fine. We welcome the hearings. Again, could we have some \nvehicle on which we might be able to move this at some point later, \neither for up or down after the hearings? If we could have some type of \nan agreement to move the bill, the McConnell-Hatch-Harkin bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the leaders will help us move the bill, and the leaders \nwill help call it up, I think we could do it in 10 minutes, because I \nthink we can make more than an adequate case.\n  It is a smart thing to do for the American people. It is hard to \nunderstand how anybody could understand that this is not a good \namendment.\n  We will be happy to do it your way if the leader prefers.\n  Mr. DOLE. If we make a case, that is fine.\n  Mr. LEAHY. My understanding is we would have hearings first.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I have indicated we will have hearings.\n  Mr. HATCH. In a relatively short period of time.\n  Mr. LUGAR. As promptly as we can.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of my cosponsors, we withdraw \nthis amendment and hope it accommodates our colleagues and our leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3277) is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3451\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. We now proceed to the vote on 3451, the Dorgan amendment, \nwith 30 seconds on each side.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question now is the Dorgan \namendment No. 3451. Who yields time on the amendment?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask for the defeat of the Dorgan \namendment. Clearly, the idea that farmers will not utilize the land to \nplant and try to obtain income is not a sound one. The attempt of the \nDorgan amendment, once again, is to couple together payments with \ncontrols. We are opposed to that with freedom to farm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President this is the simplest possible amendment. If \nyou believe payments ought to go to farmers for the purpose of not \nfarming, then you want to defeat this amendment. If you believe this is \na farm bill to help farmers who are farming, then you should support \nit. If you do not want to be making payments to people who simply have \nsome land and a bank account, and do not start a tractor, do not use a \ncombine, and do not plant anything, then you should be for my \namendment. This is not about controls or flexibility. It is a question \nwhether you want a farm program that is going to pay farmers for not \nfarming.\n  I want a farm program that is a good program and that helps farmers \nwho are actually farming the land. If you believe in that, then support \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the Dorgan amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], \nthe Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], and the Senator from Oregon [Mr. \nHatfield] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD.

The question occurs on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 3452 offered by the Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I yield back the remainder of my time. \n  \n[[Page S1053]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIndiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I have a series of amendments that I will \nsend to the desk. They have been cleared on both sides and they will \nrequire voice votes.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3454 to Amendment No. 3184\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment proposed by \nMr. Graham, for himself, and Mr. Mack dealing with crop insurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for Mr. Graham, for \n     himself, and Mr. Mack, proposes an amendment numbered 3454 to \n     amendment No. 3184.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 502, insert the following:\n       (c)(1) Crop Insurance Pilot Project.--The Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall develop and administer a pilot project for \n     crop insurance coverage that indemnifies crop losses due to a \n     natural disaster such as insect infestation or disease.\n       (2) Actuarial Soundness.--A pilot project under this \n     paragraph shall be actuarially sound, as determined by the \n     Secretary, and administered at no net cost to the U.S. \n     Treasury.\n       (3) Duration.--A pilot project under this program shall be \n     of two years' duration.\n       (d) Crop Insurance for Speciality Crops.--Section 508(a)(6) \n     of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(a)(6)) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(D) Addition of specialty crops.--(i) Not later than 2 \n     years after the date of enactment of this subparagraph (i) \n     the Corporation shall issue regulations to expand crop \n     insurance coverage under this title to include Aquaculture; \n     and\n       (ii) The Corporation shall conduct a study and limited \n     pilot program on the feasibility of insuring nursery crops.\n       (e) Marketing Windows.--Section 508(j) of the Federal Crop \n     Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(j)) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(4) Marketing windows.--The Corporation shall consider \n     marketing windows in determining whether it is feasible to \n     require planting during a crop year.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3454) was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3455 to Amendment No. 3184\n\n         (Purpose: To establish a farmland protection program)\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment proposed by \nMr. Santorum, to establish a farmland protection program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for Mr. Santorum, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3455 to amendment No. 3184.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3-3, strike lines 3 through 6 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(B) the wetlands reserve program established under \n     subchapter C;\n       ``(C) the environmental quality incentives program \n     established under chapter 4; and\n       ``(D) a farmland protection program under which the \n     Secretary shall use funds of the Commodity Credit Corporation \n     for the purchase of conservation easements or other interests \n     in not less than 170,000, nor more than 340,000, acres of \n     land with prime, unique, or other productive soil that is \n     subject to a pending offer from a State or local government \n     for the purpose of protecting topsoil by limiting non-\n     agricultural uses of the land, except that any highly \n     erodible cropland shall be subject to the requirements of a \n     conservation plan, including, if required by the Secretary, \n     the conversion of the land to less intensive uses. In no case \n     shall total expenditures of funding from the Commodity Credit \n     Corporation exceed a total of $35,000,000 over the first 3 \n     and subsequent fiscal years.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask that the amendment be considered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have an explanation of the amendment?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the Santorum amendment calls for a land \npreservation--I sent the Santorum amendment to the desk. Mr. President, \nlet me ask the distinguished Senator, does he want an explanation of \nthe Santorum amendment, the amendment that is now pending?\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not know what we are voting on.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Senator Santorum has proposed a farmland protection \nprogram, for which $35 million would be devoted. It would authorize the \nCommodity Credit Purchase Corporation conservation easements of not \nless than 170,000, not more than 340,000 acres of land, subject to a \npending offer from State or local governments. It is cosponsored by \nSenator Leahy and has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand this is open for debate at \nthis time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was 1-minute debate equally divided.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand each amendment is supposed to have half an \nhour, 15 minutes on a side. I have not heard of this amendment. Like \nSenator Byrd, I do not know what this is. I heard an expenditure of $35 \nmillion. Earlier today, amendments were offered and we were told \nbecause they cost additional money, they could not be accepted. All of \na sudden we have an amendment which no one is going to debate or know \nwhat it is and it is going to cost.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will be glad to yield for a response. I want to know \nwhat it costs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield, this was in the Democratic \nalternative, and also the other side thinks it is an excellent idea \nbecause it is going to help us save farmland. It is a conservation \namendment. I hope the Senator will support it. He supported the \nDemocratic alternative.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would not mind supporting conservation. I have been a \nstrong proponent of conservation. We do not know what it is. There has \nbeen no explanation. How many millions of dollars is it going to cost?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is a $35 million item to help preserve \nfarmland so that if there is encroachment on the farmland, the farmers \nare not \n\n[[Page S1054]]\ngoing to lose money. They have a chance to sell and stay in the farming \nbusiness. I think the Senator supported it. It is supported by all the \nenvironmental groups and farm groups, and it was in the Democratic \nalternative.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, have we made any disposition whatsoever of \nthe amendment that has just been talked about that no one seems to know \nanything about?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I advise the Chair I have checked out the \namendment that I knew nothing about, but I have no objection to the \namendment. I hope that the Senate could proceed in its usual fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3455) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I also have a package of amendments that \nhave been worked out with the other side. One on behalf of Mr. \nJohnston, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. Bumpers; another which adds \nthe term ``education'' to the EQUIP program. A third is a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution on methyl bromide and a colloquy between Senator \nLugar and myself.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, Senator Conrad had a \ncouple of amendments. Are they on that list?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understood he had what he wanted. I asked a question of \nhim and I have not heard back.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We need to add those to the list.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 3456 through 3461 en bloc\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have a series of amendments on behalf of \na number of people. I ask that they be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes amendments \n     Nos. 3456 through 3461, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

I ask unanimous consent that the amendments be agreed to, \nen bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendments (Nos. 3456 through 3461) were agreed to, en bloc.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe distinguished chairman so that we may provide assurance to the many \nproducers in the United States that are actively engaged on farms owned \nor operated by persons participating in the Market Transition Program, \nso that they will continue to be eligible for payments and will be \ntreated fairly and equitably under the bill. Specifically, the \nsubstitute provides that the Secretary shall provide adequate \nsafeguards to protect the interest of operators who are tenants and \nsharecroppers who farm land that is enrolled in the Market Transition \nProgram. It also provides that the Secretary shall provide for the \nsharing of contract payments among the owners and operators subject to \nthe contract on a fair and equitable basis. Mr. President, I would \nappreciate the chairman's assurance that it is the intent of the \nsubstitute that all tenants and sharecroppers who are actively engaged \nin farming regardless of whether the tenant or sharecropper is an \noperator of the farm will be eligible for payments, assuming that they \nare producers on a farm with contract acreage that qualifies for \nparticipation in the program. \n\n[[Page S1055]]\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I agree with the distinguished Senator that it is the \nintent of the substitute that all tenants and sharecroppers who are \nactively engaged in farming will be eligible for payments, assuming \nthat they are producers on a farm with contract acreage that qualifies \nfor participation in the program and that they meet the payment \nlimitation provisions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished chairman. In addition, would the \ndistinguished chairman give assurance as well that it is the intent of \nthe substitute that contract payments must be shared with these tenants \nand sharecroppers on a fair and equitable basis.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator is correct, it is the intent of the substitute \nthat all tenants and sharecroppers must be treated fairly and equitably \nin the division of payments under the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3462\n\n    (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Agriculture to establish \n  standards for the labeling of sheep carcasses, parts of carcasses, \n         meat, or meat food products as ``lamb'' or ``mutton'')\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senators Craig and Baucus and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for Mr. Craig for \n     himself and Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 3462.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       After section 857, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 858. LABELING OF DOMESTIC AND IMPORTED LAMB AND MUTTON\n\n       Section 7 of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. \n     607) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f) Lamb and Mutton.--\n       ``(1) Standards.--The Secretary, consistent with U.S. \n     international obligations, shall establish standards for the \n     labeling of sheep carcasses, parts of carcasses, meat, and \n     meat food products as `lamb' or `mutton'.\n       ``(2) Method.--the standards under paragraph (1) shall be \n     based on the use of the break or spool joint method to \n     differentiate lamb from mutton by the degree of calcification \n     of bone to reflect maturity.''.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. The amendment would simply require a national age standard \nbe set for labeling of lamb in the United States and that this standard \nwould be also enforced on imported product. This is a relatively simple \nmeasure that would ensure that lamb coming into the United States is \nactually lamb and not mutton. This amendment would be GATT legal since \nthe requirements are the same on both domestic and imported product.\n  If we are to have a viable lamb and wool industry in the United \nStates something must be done to enhance stability and future growth \nwhile halting the hemorrhaging of our industry's infrastructure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 3462) was agreed to.\n\n\n             commodity supplemental food program amendment\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am today offering an amendment that \nwill provide the necessary flexibility to the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture to carry out the Commodity Supplemental Food Program \n[CSFP].\n  The amendment is very simple. It allows the Food and Nutrition \nService of USDA to use a portion of available carryover funding for \nadministrative expenses. The administration will then have sufficient \nfunds to provide this important nutrition assistance to as many people \nas possible.\n  This is not a new issue to the Senate. This same language was enacted \nas part of the 1995 Second Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions \nAct at my request.\n  The amendment was needed to correct an inadvertent effect of \ncongressional action on the CSFP program in the 1994 Agriculture and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act.\n  When Congress was considering the Agriculture appropriations bill, \nthe Appropriations Committee learned that the program had $25 million \nin funding that could be carried over into 1995. The committee decided \nto reduce the overall CSFP program by $10 million due to the carryover \nfunding.\n  However, while the carryover funds were available to purchase food \ncommodities for distribution, the reduction in overall program funding \nlimited administrative expenses by law to an amount insufficient to \nallow them to be used. This was a particular blow for programs in my \nState that serve a significant rural population; they were short of the \nadministrative funds needed to distribute the commodities that could be \npurchased.\n  This language simply allows 20 percent of the funds carried over from \n1995 into 1996 to be used for administrative expenses. This is the same \npercentage allowed for administrative expenses for new appropriations. \nThe estimated amount of carryover funding is $12.6 million.\n  Mr. President, I have consulted with officials of the Food and \nNutrition Service as to the need for this language. They concur that it \nis needed to carry out an effective Commodity Supplemental Food Program \nthis year.\n  The Senate passed this same language in the fiscal year 1996 \nAgriculture appropriations bill, but it was inadvertently dropped in \nconference. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment and provide \nthe resources necessary to carry out an effective CSFP program.\n\n\n                              Dairy Reform\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee in a discussion on Federal dairy \nreform. It is my understanding that considerable time has been spent in \nan effort to achieve a balanced series of reforms in milk marketing \norders.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator is correct. Unfortunately, the Senate was \nunable to agree on those reforms due to intense regional differences \nover reform proposals.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, could the chairman describe the reforms \nthat were initially negotiated for the information of the Senate?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I will be happy to do so. The negotiations have yielded \nreform in milk marketing orders in three fundamental ways. First, the \nreforms would have mandated a reduction in the number of orders, with a \nconsolidation plan to be decided by the end of 1998 and implemented by \nthe end of 2000. Second, they would have mandated the use of a \nmultiple-basing point pricing system in Federal orders. Third, they \nwould have provided that no Federal funds could be used to administer \nmore than 14 marketing orders after December 31, 2000, if the Secretary \nof Agriculture failed to implement the order consolidation plan, which \nwould have required no fewer than 10 nor more than 14 orders.\n  Mr. GRAMS. While I am pleased with the overall agriculture reforms in \nthe underlying bill, I am disappointed that our efforts regarding real \ndairy reform have not succeeded at this point. I do understand the \nintense, and oftentimes, rigid regional conflicts these proposed dairy \nreforms typically generate in the Senate. Although I would have \npreferred comprehensive reform of the class I differential as well, I \nbelieve the milk marketing order reforms the chairman has just outlined \nwould have provided a major step toward assuring a more market-oriented \nsystem. Will the chairman give his assurance that, in conference with \nthe House, he will work toward adoption of milk marketing order \nreforms?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will. I want to commend the Senator from \nMinnesota for his strong and active interest in reforming the Federal \norder system. His efforts have been positive for Midwestern agriculture \nand the Nation as a whole.\n\n\n                          agriculture research\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to bring a matter to the \nattention of the chairman regarding agriculture research. While it does \nnot require a legislative provision, I believe it deserves some \nattention by the Department of Agriculture, and it seems appropriate to \ndiscuss while we are talking about the farm bill.\n  Is it the chairman's understanding that the Department of Agriculture \nhas an interest in eradicating livestock diseases, and also has funded \nresearch and other programs for the purposes of researching, \ncontrolling, and eradicating disease over the years?\n  Mr. LUGAR. That is my understanding.\n  \n[[Page S1056]]\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Is it the chairman's understanding that scrapie, a \ncontagious and fatal livestock disease, has had a detrimental impact on \nthe sheep industry?\n  Mr. LUGAR. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Would the chairman agree that given the scarcity of \nresources, a way to maximize a tight research budget may be to share \nthe cost with other countries?\n  Mr. LUGAR. That seems to be a commonsense approach given our limited \nresources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I understand that there is a collaborative research \nproject being developed by two well-respected research groups, one in \nthe United States and the other in Scotland, that has the hope of \neventual eradication of this disease by understanding how and when \nscrapie is transmitted. At least two countries, the United Kingdom and \nNew Zealand, have committed to share the cost of funding the research \nproject with the United States. Part of the study will be conducted at \na land-grant university. While the research project does not appear to \nfit squarely into current funding mechanisms at ARS, APHIS, or CSREES \nwithin the Department of Agriculture, would the chairman agree that it \nwould be in the interest of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to \nseriously consider the feasibility of funding such a study?\n  Mr. LUGAR. It seems reasonable for the United States to consider \nproviding funding for a credible study, in light of commitments from \nthe United Kingdom and New Zealand, and I would urge the USDA to look \nseriously at doing so.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the chairman.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Lugar-\nLeahy amendment to S. 1541 contains a provision I authored that will \nprovide a competitive loan rate for soybeans and other oilseeds.\n  Soybeans represent the third largest crop in the United States, with \nthe second largest value of over $14 billion annually. Worldwide, the \ndemand for protein meal and vegetable oil grows about 3 percent each \nyear.\n  Meanwhile, U.S. oilseed acreage has declined by 17 percent since \n1979, from 77 million acres to 63.8 million acres expected in 1996. \nApproximately 3.5 million soybean acres are enrolled in the \nConservation Reserve Program, and an estimated 9.7 million soybean and \nsunflower acres have shifted to corn and wheat production.\n  The point is, that, while worldwide demand for soybeans and oilseed \nproducts increase, acreage dedicated to oilseeds in the United States \nhas decreased. And that means American farmers are losing important \neconomic opportunities when it comes to oilseed exports.\n  One notable cause for the decrease in U.S. oilseed acres has been \nFederal farm policy, which has made wheat and corn planting more \nattractive. Another factor in the loss of oilseed acreage is the lack \nof Government promotion for export and domestic use of vegetable oil. \nExport opportunities for soybeans and sunflower oil under the EEP and \nSOAP will be reduced 79 percent under the Uruguay round. And unlike tax \nincentives for ethanol production, which target corn production, there \nis no Federal program for soy-based biodiesel.\n  This provision, by setting marketing loan rates for oilseeds at 85 \npercent of the Olympic 5-year average price, will help to put soybeans \nand other oilseeds at the same percentage level as other crops. For \nsoybeans, the marketing loan rate would be set at 85 percent of the \nOlympic 5-year average, but no less than $4.92 or no more than $5.26 \nper bushel. For sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, safflower, mustard \nseed, and flaxseed, loan rates would also be set accordingly, but at \nrates no less than $0.087 or more than $0.093 per pound.\n  This provision, which I filed as an amendment to the Lugar-Leahy \nsubstitute amendment to S. 1541, allows the soybean loan rate to rise \nby 5 percent if prices increase, providing some protection for small \nproducers against increased volatility in production and prices that \ncould result from full planting flexibility. It would remove \ndisincentives for planting soybeans, encourage increased soybean \nacreage, and provide an opportunity for reasonable prices and adequate \nsupplies of high-protein meal for pork and poultry producers.\n\n  Mr. President, Illinois leads the Nation not just in the production \nof farm commodities, but also in farm commodity exports. And in my \nconversations with Illinois farmers, one theme resonates time again and \nagain: the future of American agriculture lies in exports, and in \nenhancing the export competitiveness of U.S. agriculture.\n  I agree, and I believe my amendment will help U.S. oilseed producers \nseek out greater export sales, and ensure that market demand, rather \nthan Federal policies, determine how many acres of soybeans are \nplanted.\n  I would like to thank the distinguished majority leader, Senator \nDole, and Senators Lugar, Leahy, Grassley, and Cochran for their \nassistance and support for this amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I first want to compliment the managers \nof the farm bill for their hard work in crafting legislation which \nreforms our Nation's agriculture policies. No longer will the \nGovernment tell farmers which crops to plant and no longer will the \nGovernment tell farmers to leave productive land idle in exchange for a \nFederal handout. I believe giving more flexibility to farmers is a step \nin the right direction and urge my colleagues to support the freedom-\nto-farm legislation.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member for clarifying the sponsors' \nintent with respect to the haying and grazing provision of the \nsubstitute amendment. This technical change allows farmers to continue \nthe haying and grazing flexibility they have under current law and I am \npleased the bill's sponsors agree this traditional freedom should \ncontinue under the reform proposal.\n  Once again, I thank the managers for making this technical change and \nappreciate their leadership on farm policy.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished minority \nleader for his hard work in crafting a bill that meets the needs of \nproduction agriculture, national wide. It's close to an impossible \ntask.\n  I support this compromise farm bill. While I do not agree with \neverything in the bill, I think it has a chance of passing the House \nand being signed into law.\n  In many ways, it is a good bill for Illinois. It offers farmers \nlimited certainty in the area of income protection, provides a safety \nnet for farmers in future years, and protects our conservation \nprograms, as well as important nutrition programs.\n  Illinois is second to Iowa in soybean production, with 9.7 million \nacres planted to soybeans. Exports for soybeans and soybean products \ntotaled $7.9 billion in 1995 making soybeans the largest exporter, in \nterms of value, in U.S. agriculture.\n  With the good work of my colleague Senator Moseley-Braun, this bill \nraises the marketing loan rate for soybeans to 85 percent of an Olympic \nfive-year average, with a cap of $5.26 per bushel. Despite a 3 percent \nannual growth in world demand for vegetable oil and protein meal, U.S. \noilseed acreage has declined by 17 percent since 1979. This slight \nincrease in the marketing loan rate creates some incentive for soybean \nproduction in the U.S., which helps our trade balance and is very good \nfor Illinois farmers.\n  The bill also retains permanent law for farm programs. Good \nagriculture policy protects family farms as well as consumers. The \noriginal freedom-to-farm proposal eliminated permanent law for farm \nprograms, allowing no safety net past the year 2002. With the \nleadership of Senator Daschle, the Democrats were able to push for a \ncompromise that guaranteed a safety net for farmers in year 7.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is time to get the farm bill done. So I \nrise in support of this bill. But I do so with some misgivings.\n  Now, I know that the first rule of medicine is ``Do no harm.'' And I \nam well aware that a lot of Americans have adjusted their expectations \nof this new Congress. A year or so back, they had high hopes. Today, \nthey consider it a good month when the Congress simply decides not to \ndo anything harmful or destructive. They're relieved that we haven't \nshut the Government down in nearly a month, and that the plan to \n\n[[Page S1057]]\nlet Medicare wither on the vine seems to have stalled.\n\n\n                        Our Number One Industry\n\n  So sometimes doing nothing is better than doing harm. But, Mr. \nPresident, with the farm bill, it is just not good enough to wait any \nlonger.\n  Agriculture is the largest industry in my State. Our State statistics \nservice reports that Montana has about 22,000 farms, averaging about \ntwo residents per farm. Those farms support almost 50,000 additional \nMontana jobs in agribusiness and the food industry. So our failure to \nprovide some policy direction puts almost 100,000 people directly at \nrisk, not to mention the tens of thousands of others in small banks, \ngas stations, auto dealerships, and other small businesses who depend \non a strong rural economy.\n  That is true across the country.\n  In rural States, the entire economy depends on successful production \nagriculture.\n  In urban areas, stable, fair and predictable food prices are the key \nto consumer well-being.\n  In international trade, agriculture is one of our bright spots.\n  Our agricultural exports will reach $58 billion in 1996--an all-time \nrecord for any country, and twice our projected $29 billion in imports.\n  And we all know that nobody and no country can be safe or secure \nwithout a reliable supply of food.\n  All this depends on a sound approach to farm policy. And the first \nelement of a sound farm policy is to avoid giving farmers new troubles \nand headaches. Yet, if Congress delays the farm bill any longer, that \nis just what will happen.\n  Farmers all over America are preparing to put their 1996 crop into \nthe ground. In Montana, and across the Great Plains, many already have \ntheir winter wheat planted. If the bitter cold has not destroyed their \ncrop, they will begin harvesting in a few months.\n  These producers need to know what rules they will operate under when \nthat harvest comes in. Because of the dereliction of the Congress, they \nhave no idea what those rules will be. So the time has come to take up \nthis admittedly imperfect bill, get it past the Senate, and ask the \nHouse to follow suit. We need to act now.\n\n\n                    Successes of the 1996 Farm Bill\n\n  Now let me talk for a few moments about the bill. And let us begin \nwith the good news. I would like to mention six points in particular.\n  The most important good news, of course, is that when the 1996 farm \nbill passes, producers will have a few years of certainty and stability \nahead. They will be able to run their businesses without fear that the \nGovernment will make them change horses in midstream.\n  Two, we restore the safety net which the original more radical ideas \nproposed to abolish. That is, it continues the 1949 Agricultural Policy \nAct in case Congress threatens to let farm policy lapse altogether as \nit did last year. Thus, producers have the confidence that a single \nyear of drought, flood, or collapsing prices will not financially ruin \nthem.\n  Three, we include several provisions to assist an industry which has \nsuffered from Government mistakes. That is the sheep industry. In this \nbill we authorize a sheep industry improvement center, which will be a \nclearinghouse to improve research and infrastructure for the industry. \nWe also introduce some fairness into the lamb market by making \nAustralian and other foreign lamb to meet the same freshness \nrequirements as American lamb.\n  Four, we reauthorize the Conservation Reserve Program, one of our \nenvironmental success stories. It also authorizes two other critical \nenvironmental programs--the Livestock Environmental Assistance Program \nand the Environmental Quality Incentive Program--which help producers \nimprove the management of the natural resources on their farms and \nranches, and with it the quality of life in rural America.\n  Five, we reauthorize the nutrition program, meaning a continuing \nguarantee of assistance for children and poorer Americans.\n  And six, in the 1996 farm bill we increase planting flexibility, so \nproducers can base their planting decisions according to the market and \ntheir potential profits, rather than on rules established by the \nbureaucracy.\n\n\n                             The Major Flaw\n\n  Now let us look at what may be the real flaw in the bill.\n  My greatest concern is the so-called decoupling of farm payments from \nprices and volume of production. In essence, a farmer will now get a \nstraight payment regardless of how much he or she produces and \nregardless of the price.\n  Since the forecasts call for a good harvest in 1996, this will be \nvery good for farmers for at least the next year. However, if we get a \nbad year in 1997 or 1998, the payments may be inadequate.\n  Equally serious, but more of a long-term problem, is that by \ndecoupling payments from the market, we may decouple farm policy from \nthe broad public support it has enjoyed since the creation of the farm \nprogram during the Depression.\n  Most Americans can see that agriculture is a volatile business, and \nunderstand the need for some stability from year to year. It may be \nthat the public at large will be less enthusiastic about a straight \npayment that remains high in good years.\n  Only time will give us the answer to that question. But we know that \ndelaying action any longer this year will mean a year of questions, \nuncertainty and difficulty for farmers. So the time has come to pass \nthe 1996 farm bill.\n  I will vote for this bill, and I hope the Senate will pass it. And I \nwould ask the House to act as quickly as possible--to stop toying with \nrevolutionary experiments--to cut their vacation short--and to get the \njob done.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to compliment my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Indiana, for the enormous amount of effort he has \nput into this bill. He and his colleague on the other side have done \ngood work. The legislation that is before the Senate represents a \ncritical change in our farm policy that will do much to move us toward \na market-oriented system. And that is a welcome change indeed.\n  I must say, however, that as enthusiastic as I am about the important \nstructural changes wrought by this bill, I am sorely disappointed that \none provision of particular importance to my State and the New England \nregion was deleted earlier today. It was my understanding that this \nprovision would be included in the final version of the Senate bill. \nThe provision that I am referring to is the New England Dairy Compact--\nwhich has earned broad support from our region's Governors, \nlegislators, and industry. Without congressional authorization, the \ncompact cannot move forward. And today's action to eliminate the \nnecessary congressional consent means moving forward will be extremely \ndifficult.\n  I also regret that the Senate failed to adopt much-needed reforms to \nthe sugar and peanut programs. While the legislation crafted by the \nmanagers revises both of these programs to some extent, those revisions \ndo not go nearly far enough.\n  Therefore, with regret, I will be casting my vote against the \nunderlying bill.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nchange my vote from ``yea'' to ``nay'' on rollcall vote 14, which \npassed earlier today by a vote of 59 to 37. It will not change the \noutcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted against the farm bill today for \na number of reasons.\n  First, while I and other Senators from the Upper Midwest were \nsuccessful in striking from the Leahy substitute the northeast \ninterstate dairy compact, this bill contains no fundamental reform of \nFederal milk marketing orders so badly needed by Wisconsin dairy \nfarmers. Attempts to reach a bipartisan agreement on a moderate order \nreform amendment were ended when regionalism overwhelmed reason. I \nfound that very disappointing.\n  I remain hopeful, however, that there will be an opportunity in the \nconference with the House farm bill to revisit these issues and get \nsome changes that will help create a more level playing field for our \ndairy producers.\n  Second, Mr. President, I was very disappointed at the process under \nwhich the debate over the farm bill took place in the Senate. This is \nan important bill that is considered every 5 \n\n[[Page S1058]]\nyears, and normally consumes several weeks of floor debate following \nextensive and open committee action. This year the bill was rammed \nthrough the Senate in 1 day under tight time controls that allowed \nlittle opportunity for Senators to scrutinize neither the underlying \nbill nor the amendments offered. Furthermore, with only one-half hour \nto debate each amendment, it was difficult for Members to fully analyze \nthe impacts and implications of their votes. One amendment passed by \nthe Senate was over 500 pages long and was the subject of absolutely no \ndebate. Conducting business under those kinds of constraints is \nultimately not good for farmers, consumers, or the taxpayers. We should \ntake the time to debate publicly and examine thoroughly existing farm \nprograms as well as the proposals to change them.\n  At the same time, I recognize the urgency that many in this Chamber \nfelt that some type of farm bill had to move forward quickly so that \nfarmers who are putting seed in the ground right now would have some \nidea of what Federal policies would be in play for this growing season. \nBut Congress should have begun this process a year ago to give farmers \nthe assurances they need. The need for just any bill is no \njustification for voting for a bad bill.\n  Ultimately, I voted against this bill because it failed to reform \nprograms in a way which targets benefits to those family farmers most \nin need, it did little to limit Government payments to the Nation's \nlargest and wealthiest farmers, it provides excessive guaranteed \ngiveaway payments to landowners who never have to plant a crop, and did \nabsolutely nothing to reform Federal milk marketing order to rectify \nthe harms current law imposes on Wisconsin dairy farmers.\n  This farm bill process was fiscally irresponsible policy making. From \na deficit reduction perspective, this bill could have achieved far \ngreater budget savings while still protecting family farms. It is my \nhope that the Senate never again engage in this process for major \nlegislation that affects every farmer, consumer, and taxpayer in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate is about to vote on final \npassage of S. 1541, the farm bill. This vote should have taken place \nlast year, after a full and thorough debate. The House has recently \nrecessed without completing action on the matter, and the Senate's \naction is very late. As a result, farmers are not getting the timely \ninformation they need to make important decisions for the 1996 crop \nyear.\n  Without the Dorgan amendment, which I supported, freedom-to-farm \npayments will be made even to farmers who might choose not to plant a \nsingle seed. This doesn't make any sense and certainly seems like a \npotential waste of taxpayers' money. I am very concerned about the lack \nof market sensitivity in these freedom-to-farm payments.\n  Fortunately, the bill is not all bad. We were successful in removing \nthe northeast dairy compact, which would have established unfair \nbarriers to interstate trade and potentially hurt Michigan milk \nproducers and processors. And, we reformed, without destroying, the \nsugar program. The bill does contain several good provisions that will \nencourage farmland preservation, establish a livestock environmental \nassistance program, and addresses other important trade, research, \ncredit, and conservation matters.\n  On balance, however, I cannot support this bill. I hope the conferees \ncan improve it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I believe the Senate will make a \nmistake today if we pass this farm bill. I think I can understand why \nsome believe this is the best way forward for American agriculture. But \nI profoundly disagree with that judgment.\n  I have been saying for weeks, even months, that I have been prepared \nto debate the farm bill. Today's debate is overdue, and it has not \nexactly been what I had in mind. It has been limited due to time \nconstraints. Our opportunity for amendments has been constricted.\n  I am afraid that the best that can be said about this week's action \non the farm bill is that farmers across the country now can see what \nthis Congress might be delivering for a farm bill. Perhaps the House \nwill act soon, and I expect that their bill will be close in principle \nto this one.\n  I voted in favor of cloture last week. I did so not because I support \nfreedom-to-farm. I do not. I favor long-term policy that would promote \nfamily agriculture and revitalize our rural economy. This is not that. \nI voted for cloture because I believe that American farmers need to \nknow what programs they will be operating under this year. With no farm \npolicy in place, I did not want to block consideration of new farm \nlegislation even though I was quite certain I could not support the \nbill's final passage.\n  Of course, yesterday's vote against cloture was due to the sudden \ninclusion into the bill of the Northeast Dairy Compact, which I have \ncalled a poison pill for Minnesota dairy farmers. I am extremely \npleased, as I have already said here on the floor, that we were able to \nstrike the compact from the bill, and I was proud to lay that amendment \ndown on behalf of myself and other midwesterners late last evening.\n  Let me address the freedom-to-farm proposal. There are some good \nthings in this bill, particularly some of the conservation provisions \nwhich some of us have ensured are in the bill. I am glad that we \nfinally have authorized the enrollment of new acres into the successful \nand popular Conservation Reserve Program [CRP], which I have been \nadvocating for some time. And we Democrats ensured that permanent farm \nlaw is retained, and that oilseeds will be allowed some equity in \nmarketing-loan rates.\n  But freedom-to-farm, which is the core of this farm bill, is \nfundamentally bad policy.\n  I believe freedom-to-farm is a dubious carrot followed by a very real \nstick. If it becomes law, it will likely lead to the elimination of \nfarm programs, ultimately leaving farmers to the tender mercies of the \ngrain companies and the railroads and the Chicago Board of Trade during \nyears when prices are low. In the long term I believe it may have \ndisastrous effects on family farmers and our rural economy.\n  Some farmers believe that freedom-to-farm is the best deal they will \nget from this Congress. I understand that. Many in this Congress oppose \nfarm programs, and those people have made a credible threat to the \nfuture existence of farm programs. This plan offers farmers payments \nthis year even though prices are projected to be strong. And it \npromises to lock in at least some payments for 7 years. For some \nfarmers, even those who know that it is bad policy, that is attractive.\n  I have supported what I consider to be genuine reform of farm \nprograms. I cosponsored a 7-year proposal last year which called for a \ntargeted marketing-loan approach. That plan would provide farmers the \nplanting flexibility they need. But it also would provide needed long-\nterm protection from some of the uncertainties that farmers face--\nuncertainties of weather, and of markets that are dominated by large \nmultinational companies. It also would raise loan rates and target \nfarm-program benefits to family-size farmers.\n  The freedom-to-farm concept entails a transition to what is called \nmarket orientation. I support market oriented farm policy. That is why \nI advocate support for family-size farmers when prices are low--not so-\ncalled contract payments regardless of market conditions and regardless \nof what, or whether anything, is planted. In fact, what I really \nsupport is helping farmers getting a fairer price in the marketplace so \nthat they do not need government payments at all. Fair prices are key \nto improving farm income.\n  It must be remembered that the rationale for the transition payments \nin freedom-to-farm is that farm programs will end. There is no reason \nfor decoupled payments called transition-payments unless farm programs \nwill be ending. So we should not fool ourselves about the gesture of \nleaving permanent farm law in place underneath this bill. We Democrats \nrightly insisted upon that provision, but we have to admit it was a \nmaneuver to help achieve a time agreement and should not be considered \ngenuinely permanent. It may or may not survive conference.\n  This bill will end payments to farmers within a few years. Meanwhile, \nits approach will discredit farm programs forever. High payments to \nfarmers during good-price years will not wash in \n\n[[Page S1059]]\nthe public when we are cutting government spending on other much-needed \nprograms. I am concerned that when prices drop back down, which is \ninevitable--I would say it is encouraged by the capping of loan rates \nin this bill--there may be no farm program there to help. I voted today \nto lift the loan-rate caps. I also note that I voted for amendments to \nretain the Farmer Owned Reserve and raise loan rates. And I voted to \nrequire that a farmer actually plant a crop in order to qualify for a \nso-called contract payment.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe we are finished debating agriculture \nor rural policy. I will continue to speak here on the topic. I intend \nto continue to fight for rural Minnesota.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I voted against final passage of S. 1541 \nbecause, while it was better than some proposals put forth during this \ndebate, ultimately, it was not the package that I believe it should \nhave been.\n  Yesterday, I supported cloture on the Leahy-Dole substitute because I \nfelt strongly that it was essential that Congress act to develop new \nfarm policy reforms as soon as possible. The existing authorization for \nthe numerous nutrition, conservation, and commodity programs that \ncomprise the heart of the farm bill expired during 1995. With the \nexpiration of these programs, the outdated 1949 Agricultural Act became \nthe permanent law governing Federal commodity programs. According to \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture, the 1949 statute, if enacted today, \nwould cost taxpayers $10 billion for 1996 alone, substantially more \nthan the recently expired provisions. I believed then, and remain \nconvinced, that we need a new approach to farm policy. Therefore, I \nsupported cloture to advance the debate on the Leahy-Dole reform \npackage which would have replaced the 1949 statute with a new reform \nprogram to phase out price supports after 7 years and would have \nreauthorized critical nutrition and conservation programs through 2002.\n  However, the package that was before us on final passage, while it \nincluded many important provisions on nutrition and conservation, fell \nshort of true reform because a provision was added to retain the 1949 \nact as the permanent law. By retaining the 1949 statute, the 7-year \nfarm support phaseout provisions of the Leahy-Dole bill become just \nanother price support program. There is no longer a phaseout, only an \ninterim payment plan for the intervening 7 years.\n  Until this package returns from conference, there is always hope that \nthere will be important improvements to the reform provisions while \nretaining critical conservation and nutrition programs upon which \nmillions of Americans depend.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3184\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Leahy \namendment No. 3184, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 3184), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered \nand the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank all Senators for prompt \nconsideration of the farm bill. I think we have an excellent bill. I \nhad wanted to go to the conference with the House and hopefully \nexpedite decisionmaking for farmers throughout the country.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Leahy, who has worked so well, once \nagain, in a bipartisan way, on an important bill. I thank the majority \nleader, Senator Dole, for his very, very strong leadership throughout \nthe cloture battles, as well as all we have experienced today, and the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, who worked to make \ncertain we had both a pathway to success today, and expedited the \ntiming of that.\n  I want to thank, especially, staff members who have done so much, and \nI want to mention them by name.\n  I have Andy Morton, Randy Green, Dave Johnson, Marcia Asquith, Beth \nJohnson, Terri Snow, Michael Knipe, Dave Stawick, Terri Nintemann, \nKatherine McGuire, Darrel Choat, Danny Spellacy, Doug Leslie, Barbara \nWard, Debbie Schwertner, Jill Clawson, Cathy Harrington, Mary Kinzer, \nDavid Dayhoff, Pat Sweeney, Bob Sturm, Bill Sims, Jim Hedrick, and, of \ncourse, Chuck Conner, our chief of staff, who has done a splendid job, \nas always.\n  I thank all of them and all Senators for their support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I also want to thank the distinguished \nmajority leader and the distinguished Democratic leader for all they \nhave done. The distinguished senior Senator from Indiana said he thanks \nthe distinguished Democratic leader for helping us get the pathway to \nbe here. That is true, we would not be here without that help.\n  I know, at least in my 21 years here, I have never known a farm bill \nto go through without some strife. This is probably no exception. But \nthe fact is that we have now brought a farm bill through that we can go \nto the other body with in a conference. I hope we can go to them and \npoint out that on the final vote it was passed on a bipartisan basis. \nIf we did not have one, had it not been passed on a bipartisan basis, I \nwould not hold out much hope for the conference. Instead, we have one \nthat speaks for those who produce our food and fiber but also includes \nprotection for the environment, conservation, nutrition programs, all \nof which are important to get a bill that can eventually be signed.\n  I thank my friend with whom I have worked so many years, Senator \nLugar, on such legislation. I thank him for his help and his staff's \nhelp, and his honesty and openness to it.\n  I also want to thank Pat Westhoff for his outstanding economic \nanalyses of complicated proposals; on our staff, David Grahn, who \nstayed up many nights drafting legal language; Craig Cox, for an \noutstanding job developing one of the most progressive conservation \ntitles; Tom Cosgrove, for handling a very politically sensitive issue, \ndairy, and doing it very, very well; Kate Howard, who has done such a \ngreat job on \n\n[[Page S1060]]\ntrade; Kate DeRemer for her outstanding work on the research title; \nBrooks Preston for all that he has done for the environment and for \nforestry; Nick Johnson for his very hard work on rural development. \nDiane Coates, Kevin Flynn, and Rob Headberg, for all that they have \ndone. Gary Endicott and Tom Cole at the legislative counsel. I would \nespecially like to thank Ed Barron, the Democratic chief of staff, and \nJim Cubie, our chief counsel, who I think have not been to bed in \nseveral days.\n  I would say, if any members of their family are watching, I know \nexactly where they were. They were here all the time, chained to their \ndesks but helping us go through. And also I give my personal thanks to \nmy chief of staff, Luke Albee, who worked so hard with them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee for \nhis outstanding job, Chairman Lugar, and the ranking member's equally \noutstanding job, Senator Leahy. They have worked a long time. This is a \nbipartisan bill. There were 20 Democrats, 44 Republicans who voted \n``aye'' on final passage.\n  I believe there is enough flexibility. The President would certainly \nbe inclined to sign this bill. I hope he might announce that this \nweekend when he is in Iowa. I think it will be very well received \nthere.\n  This has been a long process. There were a lot of frustrating moments \nfor all of us. But, just as farming requires patience and perseverance, \nso does passing farm legislation. It is always very difficult. There \nare so many issues involved, so many different commodities and so many \ndifferent regional interests and State interests, it is hard to put a \npackage together that satisfies everyone.\n  But I believe this is really a historic change, some would say the \nbiggest change we have had in agriculture since the 1930's when Henry \nWallace was Secretary of Agriculture. It seems to me we have made that \nbecause we have had this bipartisan cooperation.\n  I thank the Democratic leader, too, Senator Daschle, for working out, \nlast night, an agreement which permitted us to vote at precisely 4:45. \nThat is when we promised our colleagues we would vote and that is when \nthe vote started.\n  Farmers will finally plant for the market and not the Government. The \nGovernment is going to get out of the supply control business.\n  We can take pride this bill is also good for the environment. The \nConservation Reserve Program is reauthorized. A new program, the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentive Program, is included to provide farmers \nand ranchers a cost-share program as they work to develop ways to \nmanage their farming operations. No doubt about it, another big winner \nin this legislation is the American taxpayer.\n  There is some concern about the transition payments. That has been \nexpressed time after time. I believe we need now to make certain this \nis going to work so we do not have these stories appearing that \nsomebody had a big crop and got a big payment. I think that is a very \nsensitive matter. But I believe, by capping entitlements, it is a \nsensible spending program.\n  It is not an end but a beginning, because there is much more we need \nto do to ensure survival of rural America. One is estate tax relief. I \nthink capital gains tax relief is one. We need to take a look at \nregulation, regulatory reform.\n  I would just conclude by sharing a quote I read last week on the \nfloor, the words of George Washington, over two centuries ago. He said, \n``I know of no pursuit in which more real and important services can be \nrendered to any country than by improving its agriculture.'' I think \nthat is as true today as it was then. I thank all my colleagues for \ntheir patience and their support.\n  Again, I thank the chairman, Senator Lugar, and Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know there are many who want to speak \nso I will be brief. Let me congratulate the chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee for the typical manner with which he has addressed this bill \nand this responsibility. In true fashion he has been cooperative and \naccommodating. I again want to publicly thank him for his effort.\n  Let me also thank our ranking member, Senator Leahy, for his efforts. \nI appreciate very much the work of our two managers in this regard.\n  Working with the majority leader, we were able to accomplish what all \nof us said we wanted to be able to do, finish a farm bill, by a time \ncertain, that would allow some opportunity for farmers to better \nunderstand what may be in store, what they have to decide with regard \nto their own management. This bill, as flawed as I believe it is, will \naccommodate that.\n  I must say, in all my time in the Senate, there has never been a time \nwhen I felt more discouraged, and frankly more concerned about the \nfuture of agriculture, the future of farm policy, than I feel this \nafternoon. I think the Senate has made a very tragic mistake. I think \nit is a mistake that will come back to haunt us. I believe we will be \nhere again in the not too distant future addressing many of the \ndeficiencies that this legislation represents.\n  Obviously, many of us feel very strongly about this. This fight is \nnot over. We will come back. We will revisit many of these issues. We \nwill offer amendments. We will offer additional legislation. We firmly \nbelieve we must continue to make farm policy work better than it will \nwork if this farm legislation becomes law.\n  Finally, let me thank especially Tom Buis, on my staff, for the \nremarkable job he has done. I do not know of anyone who has been more \ndedicated, or given his time and effort more generously, than has Tom \nover the last many days. So, I again thank him, and thank our \ncolleagues for the work that we have done today in spite of the fact \nthat I am so disappointed with the outcome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1001-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1060-S1062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE SENATE SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I just want to make a few remarks about the \nrecess. In fact, we are going on a vacation period when we have not \neven come close to completing the work of the U.S. Senate. I do not \nknow whether people realize it, but if they look at the calendar they \nwill see that we are into the middle of February. I do not think they \nrealize what a short time period we have left to do the business of the \nSenate for this year in 1996. This year there are political party \nnominating conventions, and we will adjourn before the November \nelections. We will not come back in after the elections because that is \njust a lame duck session.\n\n  In effect we are saddled with getting everything done between now and \nthe convention time. If you consider our sine die adjournment which is \nscheduled for October 4, and take out the normal holiday periods of \nEaster, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, August recess, and Labor Day, we \nhave about 85 legislative working days left. And if we go on our normal \n4-day week schedule where we do not come in until Monday noon and go \nout by Friday noon, which makes about a 4-day workweek, it means we \nhave a total of about 65 working days left in this legislative year.\n  I do not think people realize how tight we are on time. We have not \neven begun to complete the work of last year yet. We have five \nappropriations bills--VA-HUD appropriations, Commerce, State, Justice \nappropriations, Interior appropriations, Labor-HHS appropriations, and \nD.C. appropriations. In addition to that, we had hoped to have a \nbalanced budget agreement. We had hoped to have welfare reform. We have \nan absolutely critical debt limit extension that has to be done so that \nthe full faith and credit of the United States is honored around the \nworld. That is not one that we can really put off at all.\n  The continuing resolution and the debt limit expire by March 15. We \nnow are taking off 3 weeks--almost 3 weeks.\n  I find that unconscionable. Then we wonder why the American people \nhave a lack of faith in their Congress to get things done for this \ncountry. \n\n[[Page S1061]]\n\n  I appreciate the fact that there is a Presidential campaign on. But \nwe need a balanced budget agreement. We want welfare reform. The debt \nlimit absolutely has to be passed. We need health insurance reform \nlegislation. We have a continuing resolution to provide funding for \nthose appropriations bills not yet enacted, all of which are limping \nalong below their normally funded levels.\n  Mr. President, these are the leftovers from last year. This does not \neven address the new authorization and appropriations bills that we \nhave to pass in 1996 for fiscal 1997. Here we are out for approximately \na 3-week period, and to avoid a vote on whether we should go out or \nnot--we are going to have pro forma sessions; a couple of them a week \nin which there will be no votes. We will have morning business only. We \nwill come in and make our speeches, and nothing else will be \naccomplished. I find that unconscionable.\n  I never said I am ashamed of the U.S. Senate. But I will tell you \nright at this moment I come closer to it than any other time.\n  Do people realize we only have some 65 to 90 legislative days this \nyear? These are important pieces of legislation. The items that are \nbeing partially funded with the continuing resolution now are limping \nalong, as I said. We have veterans programs that are begging right \nnow--where veterans hospitals are not getting the funding that they \nshould have. We are not getting the new hospitals that were promised to \nbe built.\n  So we know that on February 26, we will not get anything done. Then \nwe will have the 27th, 28th, and the 29th, and the 1st left in that \nweek, if we work all day Friday--which is becoming rare around here. \nThe debt limit expires on March 15 and we will actually have only \nsomewhere around 11 or 12 days to complete the work. That will be the \ntotal time that we will have to work on the continuing resolution to \nprovide for those five appropriations bills left over from last year. \nAnd we know from past experience that there are going to be quid pro \nquos all over the place on the debt limit and any CR's. We know that \nbecause that is what has happened every time they have come up this \nyear. I think we are getting very, very short on time.\n  I think we should stay here. And I think we should be working at the \npeople's business. I think we should be working around the clock on \nthis. And I think we should be working from 9 o'clock on Monday morning \nuntil 6 o'clock Friday afternoon--which is what the people expect of us \nwhen they elected us and sent us here. They do not expect us to come in \nhere and work 3\\1/2\\- or 4-day weeks and then come back home and make \nall sorts of excuses about why we cannot get important legislation \npassed. I do not think people across this country realize we are still \nworking on last year's agenda--five appropriations bills that we do not \nhave done yet, and the new appropriations bills coming up this year. We \nonly have 65 to 85 legislative days left in this year. For us to go out \nnow for whatever purpose and for whatever reason I just think is not \nright.\n  I am sorry we were not able to have a vote on this so we could in \neffect hold people's feet to the fire and say, ``OK. If you want to go \nout, at least have guts enough to vote on it.'' But that is not the way \nthings work.\n  So we are going out. We will not have pro forma sessions next week \nbecause that is President's week. Normally there is a break here. And \nthen the following week we will have two pro forma sessions, as I \nunderstand it; one this Friday on the 9th, and then on the 20th and the \n23d but not with votes. We cannot have any votes on anything important. \nSo we will all come in here and act like we are doing something, and we \nare not. I just do not think that is worthy of the people of this \ncountry who sent us here.\n  Mr. President, in one of these pro forma sessions I will have a great \ndeal more to say about this. I will provide additional examples of \nwhere we are being hurt.\n  Weather forecasting is being degraded. Public safety is jeopardized. \nThe National Weather Service is cutting back for lack of passing a \nCommerce bill. There is a whole number of things that people do not \nnormally think about, programs funded at levels that are one-fourth \nreduced. Advanced Technology, the program Ounce of Prevention Council, \nLocal Climate Change, Cops on the Beat, Drug Courts, AmeriCorps, \nCommunity Development Financial Institutions, HHS Office of Consumer \nAffairs--all of these are things that are being cut back now because we \ndo not stay here and do the job we were sent here to do. I just find \nthat unconscionable.\n  I am so sorry that we are not staying here to take care of these \nthings that we thought were ``must-do'' legislation.\n  One other comment on the debt limit: Do we know what we are dealing \nwith here? Are we to the point where Wall Street and world's financial \ncommunity doubt the true faith and allegiance of the United States \nmonetary system? Most of the nations of the world use our currency as \ntheir reserve currency. They put dollars in the bank depending on them. \nWe put gold in the bank at one time. They put dollars in the bank. They \nhave that kind of faith. Yet, we are going to run right up to the hilt \nagain on this and create a lot of doubt as to whether we are going to \npass a debt limit. And, if the past is any predictor of the future, we \nknow we are going to have a lot of things attached as riders so that \nthe House has its way on the Contract With America. I wish they had a \nContract With America on how to keep faith and allegiance in our \ncurrency, and faith in our Government, because all we have been doing \nso far is creating doubt as to our ability really to manage things. So \nI regret we are going out. I regret we are going to stop having \nproductive sessions here. I would have much preferred that we stay here \nand take care of the Nation's business. It seems to me that is what we \nshould be doing.\n\n  We will have more to say on this later, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, I wish to commend the Senator for pointing out what \nI think is a very, very serious inadequacy, which is to leave here for \nalmost 3 weeks when we have two major threats to this economy which are \nlooming before us, which hang over our heads. One is the extension of \nthe debt limit. In effect, we will be paying our obligations through \nMarch 15, but from then on there is uncertainty. And we are also \noperating on interim funding for critical programs including education, \nthe environment, and a number of other programs which have had major \ncuts. As the Senator from Ohio has pointed out, during this interim \nperiod, a $3 billion cut in education annualized. If that cut continues \nat the current level that we have through March 15, there will be a $3 \nbillion reduction in education programs, everything from title I to \nHead Start to college loan programs to school-to-work programs, and so \nforth.\n  Now, my question of our friend from Ohio is this. One of the big \nissues that is outstanding is whether or not we are going to extend the \ndebt limit so we pay our obligations, just simply pay our obligations. \nThe country has never defaulted on an obligation yet. We have always \npaid interest owing. But as of right now we do not know whether or not \nthere is going to be an extension of our debt limit in time to pay our \nobligations or whether March 15 is going to come and go and we could \ndefault unless we extend that debt limit.\n  Would the Senator from Ohio agree with this, that the fact we leave \nthis issue hanging, the fact that this uncertainty is created, and the \nfact that we are going out effectively for 3 weeks while this \nuncertainty is out there could create a major economic problem for us \neven if at the last minute or in the last few days before March 15 \nthere is a satisfactory resolution; that the act of going out now with \nthe uncertainty that will be created between now and when we \neffectively come back in itself is a danger even if people were \nconfident that somehow or other between the time we come back and March \n15 there would be an extension of the debt limit?\n  Mr. GLENN. I would answer the Senator by saying absolutely, I think \nthere is that danger. We saw a lot of comment in the international \nfinancial press and our own domestic financial press when we extended \nthis to March 15. There was some real concern expressed as to why March \n15, why was it not longer? If we really were confident \n\n[[Page S1062]]\nthat we were taking care of the best interests of the United States and \nour economy, why did we not make it longer? Why did we make it such a \nshort period of time? The closer we get to that deadline, it seems to \nme, the more questions are going to be raised.\n  The Senator makes a very good point. If we ever had a real default, \nif we ever come up and really go into default, it affects our credit \nrating. It raises interest rates, and it would cost future taxpayers \nbillions of dollars in higher borrowing costs. To play around with that \nlike Russian roulette, playing with fire around gasoline on something \nthat important for the future of this country I just think is \nunconscionable. I do not think we should be going out.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Ohio for yielding. I commend him \nfor his statement. I must say that I totally concur, that the threat of \nusing these weapons against our own economy is a very, very dangerous \nthing. That threat should be removed before we go out for what amounts \nto a 3-week recess.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to \nspeak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1060-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1062-S1063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE BUSINESS OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It is a matter of interest and of concern to hear \nquestions raised about the business of the Senate. We have much \nbusiness to conduct. I should just point out that if we are worried \nabout the cost of interest or worried about the finances of this \ncountry, if we are worried about the financial well-being of America, \nthe full faith and credit of the United States, nothing could be more \nimportant than balancing the budget and moving this country in a \nfiscally responsible way toward accountability. We must cease the \npractice of displacing to the next generation the responsibility of \npaying for the programs to which we seem addicted.\n  We have spent a year working hard to try to do that. It is a little \nbit troublesome to hear individuals from the other side of the aisle \nsuggest that the work has not been hard. It has been very hard. Last \nyear, we voted well over 600 times. In the first 5 years of this decade \nwe voted about 320 times on an average per year. I think if we really \ncare about the future of this country, if we really care about interest \nrates, we will balance the budget. We will enact an amendment which \nwill structurally require us to balance the budget and the full faith \nand credit of the United States will not be dependent upon the \nactivities of the Senate and the House. They will be guaranteed by the \nstructure of the Government which we have.\n  I believe that if we are concerned about the debt limit, we ought to \ntake the steps necessary to make sure we do not unreasonably incur debt \nand that we do not irresponsibly continue to displace the costs of \nthose things which we seek to have to the next generation. I am \nperfectly willing to work hard and to stay late, and I believe we all \nare and we all ought to be. But we all ought also to work in good \nfaith. When we see a bill like the farm bill come up and we see a \nthreatened filibuster and several hundreds of amendments proposed, with \na view toward making it difficult to pass and enact the measure, I \nthink those who are concerned about the way in which we spend our time \nhere ought to speak clearly in those instances as well. Because when we \nhave filibustering, whether it be done formally through time spent \nspeaking in the Chamber or through efforts to delay passage of \nlegislation merely by proposing redundant amendments which have nothing \nto do with the legislation, sense-of-the-Senate amendments that are not \nreally germane to our activities, those also impair our progress.\n  So I do believe that we have a great job to do. I think we have to be \nrealistic about doing it. We have to be consistent in working toward \nit. We have to understand if we are, indeed, worried about the cost of \ninterest and the cost of capital in this country and what it does to \nour citizens, we should understand that balancing the budget of the \nUnited States would very likely reduce the average cost of housing in \nthis country to families by a couple thousand dollars a year, and \nreduce the average cost of a car loan by $1,000 or more.\n  That is important. That can happen by balancing the budget. So we \nought to do our work. There are tasks that have been left undone, and \nwe must focus on them. I am eager to get them done.\n  I rise today to point out one of those tasks which remains undone. \nThis task does not remain undone, however, because the Congress has \nfailed to act. The task of welfare reform remains undone because the \nPresident of the United States has vetoed the work product of the \nCongress, and has preferred the status quo, a rather bankrupt welfare \nsystem, the tragedy of which is to be measured most importantly in \nhuman lives and human costs, not in terms of the actual resources in \ndollars and cents, although they are not inconsequential.\n  At the time our Republic was coming into existence, Madison \nenvisioned, in Federalist Paper No. 57, a Congress ``with a habitual \nrecollection of their dependence on the people.'' He wanted Government \nto be dependent on the people. I am afraid we have inverted that. We \nhave people who are now dependent upon Government. And perhaps today's \nbusiness in the agricultural area was a clear indication of that--\nfarmers who clearly would not know how to plant, could not understand \nwhether the Government would allow them to plant or not allow them to \nplant until we passed a new agriculture bill.\n  It is a shame that instead of having a Congress habitually aware of \nits dependence on the people, the people could not even do the most \nfundamental things that citizens are supposed to do without first \nlooking to the Congress. I have to say that I was pleased that the \nagricultural act this year moves us away from that system of \ndependence.\n  It is the freedom to farm act. It begins to say to individuals, \n``Government will not be dictating when you plant, when you reap, \nwhether you plant wheat or whether you plant corn, when you inhale, \nwhen you exhale. The Government does not want you dependent on \nGovernment.'' We need to have a farm program and a system of \nagriculture in America that initiates its activities based on the will, \nthe desire, the creativity of individuals and the demands of the \nmarketplace. So today we took a step away from dependence by the \nagricultural community on Government. We tried to take a step away from \ndependence by many people on Government with welfare reform, moving \npeople from the dependence of welfare to the dignity of industry and \nwork. The President of the United States vetoed that.\n  It is a tremendous problem that our welfare system has encouraged \ndependence on Government. Welfare law has conditioned assistance on \ndependence and irresponsibility rather than promoting the virtues of \nwork, independence, and integrity.\n  We have sent the wrong message. We have said to individuals, ``No \nmatter how irresponsible you are, we will continue your payments.'' As \na matter of fact, it has been worse than that. We have said, ``The more \nirresponsible you are, the more children you bring into the world, \nchildren whom you cannot support, we will increase your payments.'' We \nhave actually provided an incentive for irresponsibility.\n  That has been a pernicious, negative impact of our welfare system \nthat instead of moving us toward the value of independence, it has \nmoved us deeper and deeper into the mire of dependence. The tragedy of \ndependence has not only been in the numerics of a budget that is out of \ncontrol, in an entitlement system, it has been in the tally of \nindividual lives, families and entire communities.\n  When I served as chairman of the National Commission on American \nUrban Families in 1992, I went to some communities where 80 percent of \nthe children were without fathers. That was shocking. But it was almost \nimpossible to comprehend that in some neighborhoods children were born \nand raised who did not know a child with a father. In other words, in \nsome of the neighborhoods in those communities, fatherhood was \nnonexistent. That is a tragedy. That is a consequence of a welfare \nsystem that demands reform, a welfare \n\n[[Page S1063]]\nsystem which we sought to reform, and the reform of which would have \nchanged it substantially to avoid and avert that human tragedy. But \nwhen the rescue was on the way, the reform was vetoed by the President \nof the United States.\n  The number of individuals receiving AFDC has more than tripled--more \nthan tripled--since 1965. The rescue program designed to assist people \nand lift them from poverty has mired them deeper and deeper in the mud.\n  More than 3 million of 5 million welfare recipients will be on the \nrolls for more than 8 years. The average length of stay is 13 years. \nPrograms designed to lift people and help them up have held them down. \nThe hand up has become a web of dependency. You know, a net can either \nbe used as a safety net or a snaring net. Unfortunately, the welfare \nsystem in the United States of America has been a net of snaring rather \nthan a net of safety.\n  Fifty percent of unwed teenage mothers receive welfare within 1 year \nof having a child. Children born into welfare families are three times \nmore likely to be on welfare when they reach adulthood.\n  This tragedy of a welfare system, which is uninterrupted and \ncontinues unreformed because the President of the United States has \nvetoed the work product of this Senate and of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, is a tragedy in no uncertain terms. Perhaps the \ntragedy is compounded in the way that interest compounds on debt--when \nyou cannot pay the interest, you begin to pay interest on unpaid \ninterest, and it snowballs.\n  When you have a welfare system that is intergenerational, you have a \nsnowballing impact of a welfare tragedy, the human cost of which is \nstaggering.\n  I give you an example. Ernesto Ventura, a 4-year-old child from the \ninner city of Boston, MA, was brutally abused and neglected by his \nmother. He is a third generation welfare recipient. His mother Clarabel \nwas 26 years old and pregnant, a mother of six, by five different \nfathers--I should say men because I am not confident they were fathers. \nA crack addict, she sold food stamps and even the family's washing \nmachine to get money to purchase drugs.\n  One day Clarabel went into a rage and plunged Ernesto's arm into \nboiling water. He did not get any medical treatment until paramedics \nfound him 3 weeks later in a back room of his project housing, smeared \nwith his own blood and excrement.\n  Ernesto's family is the story of an intergenerational web of welfare. \nIt is not a web that is a safety net. It is a net of ensnarement. \nFifteen great-grandchildren now comprise the fourth generation of this \nwelfare web. The type of benefits received by the extended family are \nthe alphabet soup of the acronyms of Washington--all perfectly legal, \nand just as perfectly destructive to the human spirit. They were \ndesigned to help, but seem to destroy the one fundamental ingredient in \nthe recipe for recovery that is absent from our welfare system, and \nthat is hope.\n  Ernesto Ventura's grandmother Eulalia has 14 living children, \nvirtually all of whom receive a variety of at least one form of welfare \nbenefits from AFDC, SSI, food stamps, Medicaid, subsidized housing. \nThis does not even count what the grandchildren and great-grandchildren \nand others receive.\n  It is time for us to understand that we need to move welfare reform \nto the top of the agenda. We need to insist that the President \nreconsider his veto of the reform measure which would have dramatically \nchanged this tragedy.\n  Yes, it is a problem whenever we threaten the fiscal integrity and \nfinancial security of the United States. No question about it. There is \na need for us to be fiscally responsible, financially accountable. But \nthere is something even more tragic when we threaten the safety and \nsecurity of the lives of individuals born in this, the greatest nation \non Earth, but ensnared in a web of welfare, a net which was meant for \nsafety but which becomes a net of entrapment.\n  We need to replace the dehumanizing dependence of Government with the \ndignity of work and hope. It is clear that we have had a system for the \nlast several decades which emphasizes debt instead of discipline; it \nhas emphasized the dehumanizing dependence instead of the dignity of \nindustry and work. It has provided for decadence instead of decency, \nand the real cost of our approach has been in human lives.\n  Welfare reform would fundamentally redefine this culture. It is \nsomething about which we must be concerned immediately. From a culture \nof dependence, we must switch to a culture of dignity and hope. And \ndignity and hope come in the dignity and hope of work.\n  We enacted a 5-year limit on benefits to say that welfare was a way \nof helping people up, but not of providing a career. The President \nvetoed our intentions. We said that there should be no entitlement that \nexists forever based on the ability of people to qualify, but instead \nwe should give the States the opportunity to structure welfare reform \nplans which elicit from individuals the kind of behavior that would \nbring them out of welfare. That therapy was similarly vetoed by the \nPresident.\n  We asked that there be a requirement for work and that people prepare \nthemselves for work, that they develop in themselves the capacity to be \nproductive, to lift themselves and their families out of the web of \nwelfare dependency and out of the snare, the entrapping snare of the \nso-called net of safety, which has become a net of capture. And \nrequiring work was vetoed by the President of the United States when he \nvetoed the welfare bill.\n  We passed a welfare bill which confessed the fact that Government \nalone is very unlikely to be able to inspire people to the kind of \nethics and values that will result in their rescue from the tragedy of \nwelfare. We passed a bill that would invite charitable organizations to \ndeliver services because the compassionate capacity of these \norganizations meets the deeper needs of individuals, and these \norganizations tend to view individuals not just as statistics who \nqualify for a governmental program, but as worthy human beings who have \nthe potential of industry and the potential of opportunity and the \npotential of service to themselves and others.\n  Our welfare reform measure included that, and that as well was vetoed \nby the President of the United States.\n  We cannot allow the veto by the President of the United States to \nextinguish the flame of hope that is within us and needs to be \nrekindled across this Nation from county to county, city to city, State \nto State, a flame of hope that says we can do better than what we are \ndoing.\n  The wretched tragedy of the welfare system as it now exists is not \nsomething with which we must live. It is something which we can and \nought to change. It is not simply a debate about restructuring a \nGovernment program. It is a debate about how we will save the \nopportunity for America to continue to reach its potential. It is a \nquestion about rescuing our children and our culture from tragedy.\n  The human costs of what the welfare system has occasioned are beyond \nspeaking, and the examples are hard to recite. But unless we confront \nthem, we will never understand the desperate need we have to change the \nway in which we do business.\n  Every day we fail to reform the welfare system, we are nourishing the \nseeds of cultural disaster in our country. We have the ingredients for \nreform in the bills which we have passed. I believe it is time again \nfor us to act and to call upon the President to change his mind on \nwelfare reform and to endorse a reform which will save a generation and \nprovide an opportunity for security and success in this society in the \nnext century.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1062-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1063-S1066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REPLACING FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I take the floor to speak on a matter of \ngreat importance to this country, to me personally and to, I know, \nevery Senator here. A matter of great importance to \n\n[[Page S1064]]\nall the working men and women of America and to our future, for our \nchildren.\n  This is the first time I am going to speak about it, but I am going \nto speak about it on several occasions in the coming days and weeks.\n  I wanted to begin the process of talking about one of the most \nimportant decisions that President Clinton will be facing during his \nfirst term in office. That decision is pending right now. That decision \nhas to do with who will be the next Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nSystem.\n\n  Will the President renominate Alan Greenspan? Or will the President, \nconsistent with his view that things must change and we must change the \nway we do things in this country, begin the process of looking for new \nleadership at the Federal Reserve System?\n  Mr. President, I believe President Clinton should begin to look for \nnew leadership to head the Federal Reserve System.\n  Raising the living standards and the real wages of ordinary Americans \nis our primary economic challenge. But the policy of the Federal \nReserve under Chairman Alan Greenspan, I regret to say, stands in the \nway. Mr. President, he should not be renominated.\n  Under the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, the \nFederal Reserve is obligated to conduct monetary policies so as to \nreconcile reasonable price stability with full employment and strong, \nstable economic growth. That is the law.\n  But under the Greenspan Fed, job growth and the living standards of \naverage Americans have been sacrificed in the blind pursuit of \ninflation control and the interests of the bond market. The Fed has \nraised interest rates not when inflation was knocking at the door, but \nwhen inflation did not even threaten. In 1994, in the midst of 7 \nstraight rate increases, Chairman Greenspan himself acknowledged that \nthere was no evidence of inflation.\n  It is time for the Federal Reserve to pursue a more balanced policy, \nbased on raising economic growth and increasing jobs, alongside \ncontinued vigilance against inflation. Outgoing Vice Chairman Alan \nBlinder argued for just such a course.\n  With the downsizing of Government spending and its more limited \nability to stimulate the economy, the significance of the Federal \nReserve interest rate policies has grown even larger.\n  Chairman Greenspan is guided by a concept called the ``natural rate \nof unemployment''--the principle that there is some definite rate of \nunemployment below which workers' incomes will rise, leading to rising \ninflation. And, obviously, Mr. Greenspan accepts statistical estimates \nby some economists that tell him the rate is now at, or near, 6 percent \nunemployment. In other words, if we fall below 6 percent unemployment, \ninflation is going to, boom, go up. But unemployment has been just \nbelow 6 percent for over a year, and inflation continues to fall.\n  Unfortunately, the Greenspan policy of slow growth and high interest \nrates rests on one enduring doctrine--that high unemployment is good \nfor the economy. Today, unemployment stands at 5.8 percent. That is far \ntoo high. And 7.7 million unemployed Americans is far too many.\n  But according to Greenspan Federal Reserve Board dogma, there just \nmay not be enough out-of-work Americans. Now, by contrast, Federal law \nsets a goal of unemployment at 4 percent, a goal of 4 percent \nunemployment.\n  Of course, I do not think anyone has all the answers, but it is time \nwe started using some plain common sense for some positive changes.\n  The first step to getting back on the right track is to set our \nsights on a higher rate of economic growth and a lower rate of \nunemployment. And the key to this is to lower interest rates and keep \nthem as low as reasonably possible.\n  Under new leadership, we could look forward to more growth, to lower \nunemployment. But I daresay not under Alan Greenspan. His feet are \nplanted firmly in the past.\n  What about the fear of inflation? Well, we cannot perfectly predict \nthe future or rule out a rise in inflation sometime in the future, so \nwe have to continue to be vigilant and well-prepared. But most \nforecasts are for continued low inflation.\n  Our economy is much more global and open to worldwide competition. We \nhave a new culture of mass discounting in retailing, cost efficiency in \nmanufacturing, some pretty ruthless economies in almost every branch of \ntrade. We have rapid technological changes, especially in computers, \nwhich are playing a role, allowing for lower cost replacements for \ngoods whose costs rise. Oil supplies are high, relative to current \ndemand.\n  Well, what all of this really means is that we can now have fuller \nemployment without inflation--allowing our workers to fully benefit \nfrom their higher productivity with higher incomes--that is, if we push \nfor fuller employment through our monetary policy. That is where it has \nto come from.\n  Real growth to strengthen our economy is essential. Over the last 20 \nyears, our economic growth has fallen by about one-third over what it \nwas previously. That huge drop in our economic growth has cost our \neconomy in the neighborhood of $14 trillion. What that means is \nstagnant incomes for average families, higher unemployment, and a lower \nquality of life in America.\n  Mr. President, I have an article that appeared last year, but I \nthought it summed it up pretty well. Patrick Gaughan, Director of the \nNew Jersey Economic Research Center said:\n\n       We blame Alan Greenspan. Seven interest rate increases are \n     taking their toll. Greenspan's statistics represent picking \n     up effects that are apparent in day-to-day living. People \n     listed as employed are working part-time jobs without \n     benefits. If you lost a six-figure job and got one back at \n     $30,000, you are treated the same in unemployment rates.\n  He goes on to say that he thinks the Fed is preoccupied with \ninflation:\n\n       Whether inflation goes up 1 or 2 percent is far more \n     important in the eyes of Greenspan than whether a person has \n     a full-time versus a part-time job. The average person cares \n     more about having a full-time job than he does about paying a \n     nickel more for a loaf of bread. The Federal Reserve has \n     gotten so insulated it doesn't realize these things.\n  Let me say that last sentence again: ``The Federal Reserve has gotten \nso insulated it doesn't realize these things.''\n  He is not the only one that has been critical. Jerry Jasinowski, head \nof the National Association of Manufacturers said:\n\n       The Fed is fundamentally misreading the American economy. \n     They ought to get out from behind their desks and see what is \n     really happening in plants and on factory floors.\n\n  So it seems, Mr. President, that serious questions are not being \nraised and being asked about the leadership of the Fed under Alan \nGreenspan. I am not here to say that Mr. Greenspan is not a good and \ndecent man, and I am sure he wants what is best for his country. I am \njust saying that his economic theories and his approach are out of \ndate. Maybe some time in the past, but not for today's economy. Not for \nthe rapid changes that are taking place in the world, for American \nworkers whose incomes are stagnant and who need to have their incomes \nraised, because they can have higher productivity. We can have greater \ngrowth in this country than 1 percent or 2 percent, and we can have \nthis growth without the fear of inflation.\n  As I said, Mr. President, I will repeat, over the last 20 years, our \nrate of economic growth has fallen by a third over what it was \npreviously. That has cost us $14 trillion. That has an impact on \naverage families on unemployment, lower jobs, lower quality of jobs, \nlower income.\n  The chairmanship of the Federal Reserve is up soon, next month, I \nbelieve. Mr. President, it is time for a change. President Clinton has \nthe opportunity to bring about positive change by bringing in new \nvision and new leadership to this position. America needs a forward-\nlooking Fed Chairman who recognizes the importance of expanding \nopportunities for our economy and our people in today's global market.\n  We need strong leadership, committed to higher growth and higher \nincomes, fuller employment, and lower, more stable interest rates, to \nimprove the quality of life for average Americans. Mr. President, Alan \nGreenspan's time has passed. It is time for new leadership at the Fed.\n  Mr. President, I have an article here that appeared in the \nInternational Economy in November-December 1995, by William Greider. I \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1065]]\n\n\n            [From the International Economy, Nov.-Dec. 1995]\n\n                        Sleeping With the Devil\n\n\nbill clinton will lose the 1996 election unless he changes his economic \n  strategy. dumping fed chairman alan greenspan would be a good start\n\n                          (By William Greider)\n\n       The killer campaign issue of 1996 is the same old criterion \n     that usually determines the fate of incumbent presidents--\n     incomes and general prosperity--and by that measure Bill \n     Clinton looks like a goner. The financial economists at the \n     Federal Reserve and the White House congratulate themselves \n     for having tamed Americans' unruly appetites by engineering a \n     2-by-2 economy that appears quite satisfying when viewed as \n     abstract policy: 2 percent growth, 2 percent inflation. But \n     the political problem is that in the real world, where most \n     voters live, this slow-growth regime guarantees the \n     continuing erosion of wage incomes for most American \n     families.\n       The last peak in the median family income occurred in 1989, \n     followed by recession and a shrinkage of 7 percent. But \n     although the economy was again growing in 1995 after \n     expanding smartly during 1994, income levels had still not \n     regained the lost ground. Since Clinton's election, wages \n     have been flat or falling (discounted for inflation) for \n     everyone except the top 30 percent of women on the income \n     ladder and the top 20 percent of men. Such beneficiaries are \n     not exactly lunch-bucket Democrats.\n       Clinton's presidency is distinctive in these terms: Unlike \n     previous cycles, most people did not receive the usual bounce \n     in family incomes once the ``good times'' supposedly resumed. \n     The wage declines persisted despite the modest recovery and \n     the healthier growth rate during 1994. Then the Federal \n     Reserve stiffed the president: 4 percent growth, it \n     announced, was dangerously inflationary, and it thus pulled \n     the plug on the Clinton recovery.\n       As in so many other matters, Clinton meekly deferred to the \n     wisdom of his elders. He made not a peep of protest as Alan \n     Greenspan raised interest rates and cast a heavy shadow over \n     his reelection prospects. The White House actually concurred \n     with this move and the president's principal economic \n     advisor, Laura Tyson, even boasted about the depressed labor \n     costs, which were rising in 1993 at one of the lowest annual \n     rates in three decades. ``We see a very well-behaved employee \n     compensation index,'' Tyson announced. Well, in 1996 the \n     president is going to see some very ill-behaved voters--\n     including many of the working-class Democrats who were among \n     his original electoral base of 43 percent.\n       Bill Clinton made his choices and now he has to live with \n     the results. Though elected as a Democrat by talking \n     eloquently about the crisis of declining wages, he opted for \n     a financial-market strategy for governing; trusting the Fed \n     and the bond market to reward him for enacting significant \n     deficit reductions by lowering interest rates. But both of \n     them ran out the door once Clinton had trashed his own \n     campaign promises to increase public investments. When \n     Republicans play to the bond holders, they employ superior \n     timing: They take the hit on the economy early in the \n     presidential term so things will be back on track and growing \n     robustly in time for the next election. The investment \n     bankers Clinton recruited as advisors seem quite naive about \n     electoral cycles (or perhaps indifferent to his fate).\n       My hunch is that Clinton cynically assumed he could get \n     around to helping the folks during the second half of his \n     term, pumping up their gratitude with new programs just in \n     time for his reelection. But that door slammed shut last \n     November when the Republicans took over Congress and \n     rediscovered fiscal prudence.\n       What's occurring is quite explosive for American polities \n     and threatening to both parties. The overall returns from \n     conventional economic growth are no longer being distributed \n     widely through out the society, but rather are skewed upward \n     to a fairly small group of citizens. The implications are \n     devastating for the president, but ultimately also for the \n     ascendant Republicans with their much-celebrated \n     ``revolution,'' since they too have no answer to the wage \n     problem. If most American families continually lose ground \n     during the ``good times,'' is it any wonder national politics \n     is turning weird and unstable?\n       Of course, no president can be expected to singlehandedly \n     reverse the deeper wage trends, but it matters to people \n     whether a politician is pulling for them or against them. \n     Clinton's gravest political error was to sit passively while \n     Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board knocked the steam out \n     of the economy. That decision effectively guaranteed that \n     wages for most people will continue to decline throughout his \n     presidency. By the summer of 1995, Clinton was delivering \n     soulful speeches lamenting the effects that the forces of \n     globalization were having on average American families. But \n     the words are unconvincing since he himself aligned with \n     those forces.\n       The iron law of presidential politics holds that an \n     incumbent needs robust, rising prosperity during his \n     reelection year to win a second term. If the reverse occurs, \n     as it now is, he loses. From Herbert Hoover to George Bush, \n     there have been no exceptions to this rule. Of course, \n     Clinton can perhaps somehow elude these fundamentals with \n     luck and a clever campaign, but it would require an historic \n     levitation of public opinion.\n       The key electoral indicator is real per capita disposable \n     personal income: the money people have left to spend after \n     taxes and inflation have taken their bites. When that \n     indicator is rising sharply it is a reliable ``feel good'' \n     barometer for the nation even if it does not reflect the \n     gross maldistribution of incomes. Last year, disposable \n     income was expanding mildly at about 2 percent until the \n     fourth quarter, when it spurted by a very robust 6.4 percent, \n     due to the surging economic growth. If the economy had \n     continued growing by 4 percent a year, greater and greater \n     numbers of people would have gradually shared the benefits. \n     Instead, the Fed's brakes took hold and personal income \n     growth also began subsiding at an even more rapid pace.\n       By the spring quarter, disposable income was shrinking at a \n     rate of minus 2 percent. I don't know how Clinton's economic \n     wizards expect to reverse such a trend, but they must attempt \n     to do so quickly--or Clinton will join Bush and Jimmy Carter \n     in the one-termers' Hall of Fame.\n       To counter this reality, Clinton has an excellent campaign \n     issue sitting on his desk if he has the nerve to use it: \n     dumping Greenspan. The Federal Reserve chairman, a \n     conservative Republican economist first appointed by Ronald \n     Reagan and reappointed by Bush, completes his second term in \n     March. The smart money says Clinton will reappoint him to \n     another four-year term since--it is assumed--the Republican \n     Senate will refuse to confirm anyone else, especially anyone \n     burdened with such old-fashioned concerns as family incomes.\n       But instead of acceding to this scenario, Clinton ought to \n     discard the old pieties about the supposedly independent \n     Federal Reserve, ignore his own advisors and make a noisy \n     fight of it: ``I am replacing Alan Greenspan because his \n     slow-growth economic policies are hurting average American \n     families.'' If Bob Dole wants to defend the Federal Reserve's \n     noose on the American economy, let him. If Wall Street \n     financial analysts freak out, all the better. If Republican \n     senators refuse to approve a new chairman, Clinton can run on \n     the issue all year long. The central bank will run just fine \n     with a temporary chairman, while politicians debate the gut \n     issue of American politics: the prospects for economic \n     growth.\n       Politics aside, here are three substantive reasons to shake \n     up the central bank:\n       1. Greenspan is an appropriate symbol of the wage disorders \n     and the larger economic debate that ought to engage the \n     nation in 1996. The immediate question for candidates is \n     this: Do you agree with the Federal Reserve's gloomy \n     assumption that the U.S. economy must not grow faster than 2 \n     percent to 2.5 percent a year? If the American economy is \n     permanently constrained to 2 percent growth, forget all the \n     other issues that politicians propose, since most families \n     are certain losers in such a scenario. Which side are you on?\n       2. Greenspan's intellectual explanations for why the Fed \n     had to squelch the [economic] recovery are quite lacking and \n     will not withstand serious scrutiny by intelligent graduate \n     students, much less rank-and-file citizens. ``The chairman \n     has proposed a simple-minded rule for determining what he \n     calls ``the maximal growth of a nation's well-being.'' (Note: \n     He does not say ``maximal economic growth'' or explain whose \n     ``well-being'' will be maximized by his policy.) His rule is \n     that, since the labor force expands by 1.1 percent and \n     productivity by 1.4 percent, that adds up to 2.5 percent \n     growth and that's it. Anything more, he opines, ``would in \n     the end do more harm than good.''\n       What's wrong with his numbers? Usual ideological arguments \n     over growth and inflation aside, the Federal Reserve assumes \n     the economy is already at full employment--that there are no \n     willing workers left to employ. Anyone who spends a few \n     minutes examining the reality knows this is fraudulent: it \n     excludes the millions of involuntary part-time workers and \n     the millions more who are simply not counted. It presumes a \n     static perfection in job markets that will seem ludicrous to \n     anyone who talks to young people looking for jobs (or to the \n     older people who have been restructured out of theirs). \n     Greenspan's 2 percent solution is terrific for the bond \n     holders but terrible for the future security of most \n     families.\n       The Greenspan logic, oddly enough, also excludes the global \n     economy--the competition of low-priced imports that serve as \n     a market restraint on U.S. wages and prices, the gross \n     overcapacity in the worldwide production base and the ability \n     of the multinationals to shift their output from country to \n     country, adjusting to the cycles of supply and demand. The \n     country needs a larger debate on all such matters but it will \n     not receive one as long as politicians defer to the opaque \n     reasoning of the Fed.\n       3. Another strong reason to dump Greenspan is that he has \n     been highly political despite the supposed non-partisan \n     nature of the independent central bank. This Fed chairman has \n     been mucking around in all sorts of political issues far \n     beyond the ken of monetary policy, usually in ways that will \n     injure broad ranks of citizens. First cozying up to Clinton, \n     he is now sucking up to the new Republican majority in \n     Congress. He pushed Clinton to drop his original jobs agenda \n     and instead deal with the deficits. Now Greenspan is \n     collaborating with Republicans so they too can break their \n     promises.\n       Greenspan provided the stimulus for a devious game that is \n     underway to cut Social \n\n[[Page S1066]]\n     Security and raise income taxes--both of which the Republicans promised \n     not to do in their celebrated ``Contract With America.'' \n     Greenspan personally began the proceedings early in 1995 when \n     he announced the Fed's conclusion that--eureka!--the Consumer \n     Price Index overstates inflation by as much as 1.5 percent. \n     Never mind the obvious contradiction this asertion posed for \n     the chairman's own arguments about inflationary dangers and \n     the need to stifle the economy.\n       Greenspan's purpose was to suggest that by adjusting the \n     CPI Congress could lop more than $20 billion from Social \n     Security and other benefit programs and add a similar amount \n     in higher tax revenues. The CPI is used to calculate annual \n     cost-of-living increases for a variety of entitlement \n     programs and to protect taxpayers from being pushed into \n     higher tax brackets by inflation. Adjust it downward and \n     Congress can find $40 billion or $50 billion. Look, no \n     hands--we're cutting Social Security and raising taxes and \n     nobody can see us doing it. This is the type of sleight-of-\n     hand that Americans have come to expect from Washington and \n     it is the reason both parties are loathed. If Republicans try \n     to speak this into legislation late at night. I hope the \n     voters catch them.\n       Clinton could use all of these arguments to explain why he \n     is replacing the Federal Reserve chairman, though I concede \n     it would be out of character for him to do something so \n     provocative and independent of the conventional wisdom. But \n     think of the bumper sticker:\n       ``Dump Greenspan. He's Good for Bonds/Terrible for Wages.''\n       ``Dump Greenspan: The Guy is Standing on Your Paycheck.''\n       ``Dump Greenspan: He Stopped the Party Before You Got Any \n     Punch.''\n       If Clinton doesn't rewrite his hair shirt economic message, \n     he will be stuck in about the same place that Jimmy Carter \n     was in 1980, telling voters: ``Sorry about the economy, \n     folks, but this is about as good as it's going to get.'' \n     Rational voters, given that choice, will usually opt for \n     something else--anything else--even a fairly loopy or nasty \n     alternative.\n       I Remember the Gipper's favorite question: ``Are you better \n     off now than you were four years ago?'' Next year, I expect \n     Republicans to ask that question again, with devastating \n     effect, Once again, they will be able to grab the high ground \n     from the Democratic Party by calling for faster economic \n     growth. Speaker Gingrich occasionally opines that the economy \n     can grow at a 5 percent rate, through he does not explain \n     how, given the obvious contradictions with the austerity \n     provisions of the GOP agenda and the Federal Reserve's \n     assumption that 2 percent growth is ``maximal.''\n       In other words, if the Greenspan era continues for another \n     term, the political questions about economic growth will not \n     go away. The same contraditions--the broad deterioration of \n     incomes and the central bank's doleful logic--will confront \n     Republicans if they win the White House. The Republicans are \n     leaning on the same frail reed that failed Clinton: a vague \n     hope that the Federal Reserve and the bond market will help \n     them by lowering interest rates. They should get Greenspan to \n     put this in writing.\n       The dilemma of the economy's growth rate is at the center \n     of American politics but is seldom directly debated, since \n     almost everyone assumes that faster is better. Even the \n     antigovernment conservatives promote various proposals, such \n     as a capital-gains tax cut or regulatory decontrols, based on \n     the same premise: The measure will produce faster economic \n     growth. But how can they do so, if the Fed insists 2 percent \n     is the most the nation can handle? if voters and politicians \n     ever grasp the contradiction, it may well be triumphant \n     Republicans, not Democrats, who finally have to take on the \n     Fed.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I said, Mr. President, I will be discussing this issue \nat greater length in the days and weeks to come. I guess we are on \nrecess now. I guess the Senate will be in again later this week and I \nguess next week. I do not know when. But I hope to take some more time \non the Senate floor to discuss the Federal Reserve System and why what \nthey are doing and the course of action they are taking is not \nconsistent with the real world. It is what is happening in the global \neconomy, with what is happening to real competition, with what is \nhappening to the need, and not only the need, but the possibility of \nreal economic growth in this country.\n  The growth rate that seems to be acceptable to Mr. Greenspan I do not \nbelieve is acceptable to the rest of this country. From February 1994 \nto February 1995 under Chairman Greenspan interest rates were raised \nseven times--seven times in 1 year, three percentage points. It went \nfrom 3 percent to 6 percent in the year that ended in February 1995.\n  Now, we do have to be vigilant about keeping inflation in check. But \neven Mr. Greenspan said there was no inflation. Inflation has not been \nthreatening, certainly not in the last year, Mr. President. But you \nwould think if that is the case, interest rates would come down. But \nsince February of last year, the Fed has lowered interest rates only \nthree-quarters of a point. So he can raise interest rates 3 percent in \n1 year, but in the next year he can only lower them three-quarters of a \npoint. The recent small reductions may make people feel a little good. \nBut they are still not down to where they were in February 1994.\n  I find it more than passing strange that interest rates can go up 3 \npercent in a year but they can only come down three-quarters of a point \nin the following year when there is no inflation threatening at all. I \nthink it is very important to talk about this because of the \nsignificant impact it has on our economy and the income of average \nAmericans.\n  I know there are other Senators who feel as I do. I know that Senator \nDorgan also wants to take the floor to speak about this issue and about \nthe need for a new policy, for new policy directions at the Federal \nReserve System.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to take the floor to alert my colleagues that \nI will be putting more information in the Record and I will be \ndiscussing this at length in the days and weeks to come. As I said, I \ncertainly hope that President Clinton will see the necessity for new \nleadership, and through guidance at the Federal Reserve System, appoint \nsomeone with a new vision, someone with new vigor and energy who \nunderstands the real world as it is out there and who is not just \nlocked into outdated, outmoded and time-worn economic philosophies that \nhave no bearing or no real relationship to the real world as we see it \ntoday.\n  I am publicly calling on President Clinton to bring new leadership to \nthe Federal Reserve System next month. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1063-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1066-S1068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the increasing public concern about the unlimited amounts of \nmoney that individuals spend from their own private fortunes to gain \npublic office in the United States, which I believe poses a real threat \nto democratic government in our society.\n  I have spoken about this subject in the past and have, along with \nSenator Hollings, supported constitutional amendments, because that is \nwhat is necessary to deal with this campaign finance reform issue, \nbecause the Supreme Court of the United States decided a little more \nthan 20 years ago, on January 30, 1976, in a case captioned Buckley \nversus Valeo, that an individual can spend as much of his or her money \nas he or she chose, notwithstanding spending limitations on everyone \nelse.\n  As I have said on this floor, that case had a substantial personal \nimpact on me because I had declared my candidacy for the U.S. Senate in \nlate 1975 when the campaign finance law had recently been enacted. In \n1974, specified on a population basis for the State, a State the size \nof Pennsylvania had a limit of $35,000, which is about what I had in \nthe bank, having recently returned to private practice after having \nbeen district attorney of Philadelphia.\n  That year I contested a man who later became a very distinguished \nU.S. Senator--he won the election in 1976--a very close personal friend \nof mine, Senator John Heinz, who was able to spend beyond the limits \nestablished under the statute because the Supreme Court of the United \nStates declared the law unconstitutional, on first amendment grounds, \nlimiting the amounts anybody else could spend. My brother, for example, \ncould have contributed substantially but could only spend $1,000 by way \nof contribution.\n  This has become a proliferating, expanding problem in our society, \nwith many Senate seats having been, in effect, bought with enormous \npersonal contributions. Now we are seeing the matter played out on the \nnational level, obtaining a lot of national notoriety, with recent \ndisclosures showing expenditures in excess of $15 million because \npeople are not limited by the Federal laws if they choose to spend \ntheir own money. Those Federal laws on matching funds for the \nPresidency limit the amount that anybody can spend, if they take \nFederal funding, to \n\n[[Page S1067]]\nabout $600,000 in New Hampshire, about $1 million in Iowa. Those funds \nare not the limit for those who spend their own funds.\n  I was fascinated to see on Friday in the New York Times, a column by \nAnthony Lewis, about this precise subject. I was surprised to see it \nbecause Mr. Lewis is well known for his defense of the Constitution and \nhis defense of the first amendment. I think I have that same record, \nconcern about the Constitution, concern about the first amendment.\n  So, when Anthony Lewis wrote a column in effect calling for the \noverruling of Buckley versus Valeo, which was decided on first \namendment grounds, I thought it a very important event. At the \nconclusion of my presentation I will ask this be printed in the Record. \nBut I only want to cite one sentence from it at this time, referring to \nthe current events, on the tremendous expenditures by an individual, \nthat these events may pose. A ``real contribution should be to make us \nthink of ways to overcome the Supreme Court's misguided 1976 decision \nthat limiting how much political candidates can spend on themselves \nviolates their freedom of speech.''\n  I think it worth noting, when Anthony Lewis calls the Supreme Court \ndecision ``misguided,'' he, in effect, joins Senator Hollings and \nmyself and others in calling for a constitutional amendment. On Friday, \nFebruary 2, the day this appeared, I called Mr. Lewis. Before I could \ntell him the purpose of the call, he said, ``I think I know what you \nare calling about.'' He was exactly right.\n  On Sunday in the Philadelphia Inquirer there is an extensive article \nby Mr. Dick Polman, on the same subject, starting off, ``If money \ntalks.'' Again, quoting only one small section, Mr. Polman noted, \nreferring to Buckley versus Valeo:\n\n       The justices ruled that candidates could spend their own \n     money as they wanted, as an exercise of their constitutional \n     right to freedom of expression. Publicly financed rivals, on \n     the other hand, must obey spending ceilings in each state--\n     $600,000 per candidate in New Hampshire, $1 million in Iowa.\n\n  Now, Mr. Polman quotes from a comment by Miss Ellen Miller, who \ndirects the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington, ``That ruling \nmade no sense 20 years ago, and it certainly makes less sense today.''\n  As the Presidential campaign moves forward and we see the impact, I \nam surprised that money could have made as much a difference as it has \nin what has resulted so far as shown by the public opinion polls in New \nHampshire and Iowa. It may really be possible to buy the White House if \nenough money is spent from an individual who reportedly has $400 \nmillion. And if that individual chooses to spend, say $200 or $300 or \n$350 million--what is the difference if you have $50 million more left \nover? You probably have enough for any other contingency--the impact of \nthat kind of spending has really potentially cataclysmic impact on the \nelectoral process in the United States.\n  I do not want to keep the Senate here too late. It is now 6:15. I \nknow the leader wants to wrap up, but I did want to make these brief \ncomments.\n  At this time I ask unanimous consent the full text of these articles \nby Anthony Lewis in the New York Times of February 2, and the article \nby Dick Polman of the Philadelphia Inquirer of February 4 be printed in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Feb. 4, 1996]\n\n              If Money Talks, What Does It Say of Forbes?\n\n                            (By Dick Polman)\n\n       Ask Charles Lewis about the Steve Forbes phenomenon and you \n     get a shake of the head and a sigh of exasperation.\n       ``What's so disturbing,'' he says, ``is that here you have \n     a guy who's pumping his own millions into his presidential \n     campaign--and a substantial number of voters aren't bothered \n     by it. This gnaws away at me a bit.''\n       Lewis is a Washington activist who wants to curb the power \n     of money in politics--witness his new book, The Buying of the \n     President--and that explains why he gets so hot about the new \n     darling of the Republican field.\n       Lewis pursues his point, with a dollop of sarcasm: \n     ``Apparently the answer to our problem is, we should elect a \n     multimillionaire because we think he's not [beholden] to \n     special interests. Well, look at the people who are helping \n     him. Look at the world he lives in. . . . He has come \n     absolutely out of nowhere. At least Bob Dole is familiar to \n     us. But this guy? It's like The Twilight Zone.''\n       In terms of money and moxie, there has never been a \n     presidential candidate like Steve Forbes. Yes, Ross Perot \n     spent $60 million in 1992, but he arrived late in the game \n     and ran as an independent; unlike Forbes, he didn't target \n     the primaries and try to blow out rivals with saturation \n     advertising. And, yes, John F. Kennedy spent his father's \n     money, but JFK was a career politician.\n       Forbes, by contrast, is a career publisher of inherited \n     wealth and conservative bent, whose sole public job was a \n     stint as board chairman of Radio Free Europe. As the hottest \n     ticket in the Republican road show, he is pushing a flat \n     income tax that would put more money in his own pocket, \n     according to an independent analysis sponsored by Lewis's \n     public-interest group, the Center for Public integrity. \n     Despite repeated requests, he refuses to follow Dole's \n     example and release his income tax returns.\n       Most important, his lavish private spending is wreaking \n     havoc among his chief revivals, all of whom are bound by the \n     strict federal spending limits that inhibit those who accept \n     campaign money from the public treasury. Forbes is free to \n     spend, but they are not--thanks to a landmark Supreme Court \n     ruling 20 years ago this week.\n       In fact, the self-financed Forbes candidacy would not exist \n     without Buckley v. Valeo. The justices ruled that candidates \n     could spend their own money as they wanted, as an exercise of \n     their constitutional right to freedom of expression. Publicly \n     financed rivals, on the other hand, must obey spending \n     ceilings in each state--$600,000 per candidate in New \n     Hampshire, $1 million in Iowa.\n       ``That ruling made no sense 20 years ago, and it certainly \n     makes less sense today,'' says Ellen Miller, who directs the \n     Center for Responsive Politics in Washington. ``What Forbes \n     shows is that the `free expression' of a non-wealthy \n     candidate, or a voter who can't afford to contribute money, \n     is drowned out by the free expression of a candidate who can \n     finance himself.''\n       If Forbes' candidacy proves that money talks, the public \n     doesn't appear concerned. The latest survey puts him ahead of \n     Bob Dole by nine points in New Hampshire, which stages the \n     first primary, on Feb. 20; three weeks ago, the survey showed \n     Forbes trailing--by 16. As several New Hampshire voters \n     insisted in interviews last week, Forbes can ``afford'' to \n     be his own man.\n       Some say this sentiment is naive. ``I've run \n     [congressional] campaigns against rich people,'' says an \n     adviser to a Forbes rival, ``and you have to pay attention to \n     the people they socialize with and do business with. In \n     Forbes' case, it's all his magazine advertisers, his vendors, \n     accountants, investors, lawyers--a whole culture.''\n       It is not all Forbes' money. He has also staged fund-\n     raisers--including a Philadelphia event Friday night--and has \n     drawn the corporate elite. Miller complains: ``He's selling \n     himself now. He's breaking the myth that he can't be \n     bought.'' As long as he doesn't seek public matching funds, \n     though, he remains free of restrictions.\n       And the public seems not to mind. Gerry Chevinsky, the \n     pollster who conducted the latest New Hampshire survey, \n     explains the public's growing support: ``We asked people if \n     they thought it was appropriate for a candidate to use his \n     own personal money in a big ad campaign--and 61 percent said \n     yes. They are so turned off to Washington, and to politicians \n     in general, that they're looking for anyone who doesn't play \n     the political game. The support for Forbes is symbolic. He is \n     a sanitized Perot.''\n       Forbes also gets a boost from Steve Salmore, who advises \n     Republican campaigns in Forbes' native New Jersey: ``People \n     see that . . . he's not just saying something in order to \n     pander to people. There's a feeling that if you're spending \n     your own money, that at least you believe in what you say.''\n       Is it unfair that Forbes can outspend everyone else? Not \n     necessarily, argues Salmore: ``The court said, `Spending your \n     own money is a form of speech.' And rightly so. Look, is a \n     businessman who wants to influence [the public] supposed to \n     take time away from his work just to . . . lick stamps? The \n     career politicians already have the advantage.''\n       He says that if campaign-finance reformers are unhappy, \n     they have only themselves to blame. After all, the court in \n     1976 was trying to clean up the reforms adopted in 1974. \n     Referring to good-government activists, Salmore scoffs: \n     ``This is the problem with the `goo-goos.' They put in \n     reforms, and you end up with a system that helps some and \n     hurts others. A classic case of unintended consequences.''\n       Indeed, the system that has soured so many Americans--the \n     ties between politicians and special-interest political \n     action committees (PACs)--evolved as a consequence of the \n     1974 reforms.\n       The congressional reformers, seeking to banish ``fat-cat'' \n     contributors, enacted a law requiring that presidential \n     candidates accept only small amounts--no more than $1,000 \n     from an individual and $5,000 from a group--with the totals \n     then being matched by the federal treasury. This law also \n     decreed that no candidate could spend more than $50,000 of \n     his or her own money.\n       The high court kept the first two provisions (the amounts \n     are the same today), but threw out the cap on personal funds. \n     And here are the results:\n       It takes enormous effort to build a sizable war chest from \n     small contributions. Candidates can do it faster by relying \n     on special-\n\n[[Page S1068]]\n     interest PACs, which is one big reason that the PAC population has \n     exploded over the last two decades. By contrast, someone like \n     Forbes doesn't need to play even this game.\n       And while Forbes can spend whatever he wants wherever he \n     wants, the others must obey the state-by-state ceilings. \n     These ceilings often inspire creative cheating.\n       One veteran strategist says: ``To stay inside the \n     [spending] limit in Iowa, you rent all your cars in Kansas \n     and Nebraska, and charge the accounts there. . . . Charge \n     the cars in states where you know you won't be spending \n     much money. Then bring the cars over to Iowa. Problem is, \n     some poor schlepp has to drive all the cars back.''\n       The big question is whether anything will be done. Salmore \n     likes the idea of allowing publicly financed candidates to \n     keep pace with the rich; if Forbes is spending big money, \n     then remove the ceilings and allow his rivals to raise and \n     spend the same amounts.\n       But Bill Bradley, a Democrat who is retiring from the \n     Senate, is calling for a constitutional amendment that would \n     bypass the court and allow Congress to set spending limits on \n     rich candidates. In a speech last month, Bradley said: \n     ``Money is not speech. A rich man's wallet does not merit the \n     same protection as a poor man's soapbox.''\n       Charles Lewis says: ``Buckley is the biggest roadblock to \n     reform, so we either need a constitutional amendment, or . . \n     . How do we do this in the fairest possible way?\n       ``I have to say, I don't know the answer.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 2, 1996]\n\n                              Less Is More\n\n                           (By Anthony Lewis)\n\n       Boston.--A rich man campaigns for President on a one-plank \n     platform: ``Vote for me to cut my taxes drastically and make \n     many of you pay more.'' The voters respond with enthusiasm.\n       It sounds like fiction, a parody of the American political \n     process. But judging by what is happening in New Hampshire, \n     it is reality. Three weeks before the primary there polls \n     show Steve Forbes, the flat-tax candidate, in the lead.\n       A survey just taken by The Boston Globe and WJZ-TV finds 31 \n     percent of likely voters favoring Mr. Forbes. Senator Bob \n     Dole, who has dominated the figures for a year, is second \n     with 22 percent. Just three weeks ago the same pollsters gave \n     Senator Dole 33 percent, Mr. Forbes 17.\n       Mr. Forbes has poured millions from his personal fortune \n     into television advertising in New Hampshire. In the new poll \n     85 percent of the respondents said they had seen his ads. \n     Most of them are negative, principally attacks on Senator \n     Dole. Just about the only affirmative argument he offers is \n     for the flat tax.\n       The Forbes tax proposal would exclude the first $36,000 in \n     income for a family of four, then tax all earnings above that \n     amount at a rate of 17 percent. Income from investments would \n     not be taxed at all.\n       A change of that kind would be a boon for Mr. Forbes and \n     other wealthy Americans, who now are taxed on investment \n     income and pay a marginal rate of 39.6 percent on income over \n     $256,500 a year. To produce the same revenue as the present \n     system, the flat tax would have to make the middle class pay \n     more.\n       The Treasury Department analyzed a flat tax that would keep \n     government revenue steady, one with a rate of 20.8 percent \n     and excluding the first $31,400. A family of four earning \n     $50,000 a year would pay $1,604 more in taxes, one earning \n     $100,000 an additional $2,683. But a $200,000 family would \n     save $3,469.\n       In fact, the Forbes formula as drafted would cut Federal \n     revenue by $186 billion a year. That would mean an \n     enormous increase in the deficit or severe cuts in Social \n     Security, Medicare and the defense budget. There is not \n     enough discretionary civilian spending to absorb more than \n     a small part of that amount.\n       Why would New Hampshire voters want to inflict such misery \n     on themselves in order to give Steve Forbes and others in his \n     bracket big tax cuts? Many may simply not understand the \n     consequences.\n       Detailed findings of the new poll suggest that the meaning \n     of the Forbes flat tax has not quite sunk in--but is \n     beginning to. Asked whether they supported the Forbes tax \n     plan, 37 percent said yes--down from 54 percent three weeks \n     ago.\n       And of those who said they favored the flat tax, 45 percent \n     said they would not be for it if it exempted investment \n     income so the wealthy could live tax-free. Others in varying \n     numbers dropped out of the group favoring a flat tax if it \n     eliminated deductions for home mortgage interest or local \n     property taxes--as the Forbes plan would.\n       The more attention 17 percent flat tax gets, the less \n     likely voters are to support it. But that need not be the end \n     of Steve Forbes. When New Hampshire supporters were asked why \n     they liked him, the largest category of responses (37 \n     percent) was that he was not a Washington insider. In short, \n     angry Americans--and there are a lot of them--can work off \n     their feelings by voting for Mr. Forbes.\n       The loser in all this is Bob Dole, and that is reason for \n     regret. Even those who disagree with him on this issue or \n     that must recognize that he is a responsible political leader \n     and a serious man.\n       It is hard to take the other Republican candidates \n     seriously. The party has lurched far to the right, but I \n     doubt that it has become suicidal enough to nominate Phil \n     Gramm or Pat Buchanan.\n       As for Steve Forbes, my guess is that he will look \n     increasingly flaky. He told a Boston Globe interviewer this \n     week that much of acid rain ``is created by nature, not by \n     smoke-stacks.'' Mr. Forbes's real contribution should be to \n     make us think of ways to overcome the Supreme Court's \n     misguided 1976 decision that limiting how much political \n     candidates can spend on themselves violates their freedom of \n     speech.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to place in today's Record a \ncopy of a tribute to the late Senior Judge John Pratt, of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, written by his dear friend \nU.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch. I was privileged to serve under \nOliver Gasch as an assistant when he was U.S. attorney for the District \nof Columbia, and I came to know Judge Pratt.\n  Mr. President, the recognition of the many accomplishments and \ncontributions of Judge Pratt to his chosen profession--the law--are too \nnumerous to list. Having served on the bench for 27 years, Judge Pratt \nhelped to shape legal definitions of civil rights and discrimination.\n  Having served during World War II, Judge Pratt was honored as a \ndistinguished member of the U.S. Marine Corps earning the Bronze Star \nand a Purple Heart for his service.\n  Judge Pratt once served as a page in the U.S. Senate. I am pleased to \nask unanimous consent that the tribute in honor of the late Judge John \nHelm Pratt be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tribute was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      A Tribute to John Helm Pratt\n\n       We were all saddened by news of John's passing on August \n     11, 1995. He died at home surrounded by his devoted wife of \n     56 years, Bernice Safford Pratt, and five children, Sister \n     Clare Pratt RSCJ of Rome, Italy; Lucinda Pratt Pearlman of \n     Berkeley, California; John, Jr. of Red Bank, New Jersey; \n     Patricia Pratt Moriarty of Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts; \n     and Mary Pratt Brandenburg of Columbia, Maryland. In an \n     autobiographical sketch written for his 50th Harvard Reunion, \n     he listed the priorities which meant the most to him as: \n     family, friends and career. He added that ``family stability \n     has contributed more than any other factor to whatever \n     satisfactions have been mine.''\n       John Pratt's exceptional and distinguished career can be \n     divided into three segments: first, his education and early \n     legal career; second, his service as a Marine in World War \n     II; and third, his return to private practice and his \n     appointment as a trial judge.\n       John's education was unusual. He attributed it to his \n     mother: Boston Latin School, Gonzaga High School,\\1\\ two \n     years at Georgetown College, his transfer to Harvard College, \n     from which he almost flunked out but graduated two years \n     later with honors at age 19; Harvard Law School, from which \n     he graduated in 1934.\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       After graduation, he became associated with the Washington \n     firm of George Maurice Morris. Mr. Morris was a distinguished \n     tax lawyer and John found himself doing research work on Mr. \n     Morris's cases and his book on corporate tax law. Since John \n     had no special interest in tax law, he was relieved when a \n     highly controversial ``stoker'' case come to the firm. The \n     Brotherhood of Railway Engineers and Firemen had sued the \n     railroads to require installation of automatic stokers on the \n     large steam locomotives. The record before the administrative \n     law judge was approximately 30,000 pages. On this John and an \n     associate worked long hours and with tremendous dedication. \n     Their efforts were rewarded when the Sixth Circuit affirmed \n     the favorable decision of the administrative law judge. \n     Incidentally, one of John's opponents representing the \n     railroads was my late brother-in-law Carleton Meyer, also a \n     Harvard law graduate. Mr. \n\n[[Page S1069]]\n     Morris later became President of the American Bar Association.\n       I got to know John in those days because we were both \n     interested in touch football when the weather got cool and \n     softball during the spring and summer. John was a heavy \n     hitter and extremely skillful at tossing forward passes. \n     Toward the end of this period, our close friendship resulted \n     in our establishing bachelor quarters with two other young \n     lawyers. Our social efforts were directed toward a group of \n     attractive young women who were recent graduates of Vassar \n     and Bryn Mawr and who lived together in a house on 34th \n     Street known as ``The Nunnery.'' We waltzed at the Sulgrave \n     Club and square danced at the Holton Arms gym. Our house was \n     strategically located between those two buildings. John and \n     Phil Herrick were both outstanding tennis players. They were \n     finalists in a competition sponsored by the Junior Board of \n     Commerce. They decided not to play it off for the large \n     silver loving cup but to possess it jointly. I remember \n     perfectly how we used to fill the loving cup with ice and \n     then pour whiskey into it. Our fourth member objected to the \n     assessments for whiskey, which were fairly large. He was \n     overruled.\n       Bachelor quarters were discontinued when John got married \n     to Bernice ``Sissy'' Safford. War came following Pearl Harbor \n     and the Marines were looking for a few good men and they \n     found John, who, as the son of a Marine Colonel, naturally \n     was drawn in that direction.\n       Years later, Sissy persuaded John, when they were \n     vacationing at Squam Lake, to dictate an account of his \n     career including his Marine service. I have had access to \n     these tapes. John was trained as an Aviation Volunteer \n     Specialist, an ``AVS,'' which he described as ``silver in the \n     hair, gold in the mouth and lead in the ass.'' He named some \n     of his associates: Francis Godolphin, later Dean at \n     Princeton; Ted Lyons, the White Sox pitcher, and Ernie \n     Nevers, a Stanford football star. The class was divided in \n     half, some going to Tarawa and John's half going to Kwajalein \n     with the 4th Marine Division. After the capture of Kwajalein, \n     John's unit was assigned to the seizure of Saipan and Tinian, \n     the strategic atoll large enough to contain all the navies \n     of the world. John's description of these landings and \n     particularly seeing the death and destruction of many of \n     his friends is heartrending. The islands were held by \n     40,000 Japanese who wouldn't surrender.\\2\\ He recalled how \n     a piece of shrapnel had struck him in the chest. He \n     observed, at least they awarded me a Purple Heart.\n       Following the capture of these islands, John's unit, after \n     getting some ``R'' in Maui, was assigned to Layte. \n     Incidentally, our paths crossed at the Sentani Strip in New \n     Guinea, where he had learned that I was located. He was on \n     his way up to the Tacloban Strip on Leyte. Our ultimate \n     destination was about five miles from the Tacloban Strip but \n     neither he nor I knew the other's whereabouts. His unit was \n     assigned 82 F4V's, which the Navy had found were unfit for \n     carrier duty. The trouble was the Navy did not supply \n     maintenance personnel. John, as the AVS officer, was briefing \n     these pilots on the details of their next strike. After the \n     briefing, he took a position in his jeep about 50 feet from \n     the runway. The undercarriage on one of these planes gave way \n     and John was suddenly aware that this F4V was headed toward \n     his jeep. The propeller severed John's left arm and he \n     sustained other serious injury. He was ultimately evacuated \n     to Biak, where a Harvard Medical School unit had been set up.\n       John tells the story of an elderly nurse who was attending \n     him. He asked her name and she replied, Peabody. He inquired \n     whether she was related to Endicott Peabody, the Headmaster \n     of Groton School. She replied, he is my father. During the \n     course of this conversation, they were both aware of the fact \n     that another Marine, who had lost a leg, was cursing out the \n     orderly for pain caused in the changing of his dressing. John \n     said to Miss Peabody, you wouldn't hear language like that at \n     Groton School, would you? She replied, without changing her \n     expression, Father does not condone profanity at the school.\n       John's awards, in addition to the Purple Heart, included \n     the Bronze Star and two Presidential Unit Citations.\n       Following these experiences, John ultimately returned to \n     the Morris firm where he subsequently became a partner. He \n     modestly described his experience there as being ``jack of \n     all trades, master of none.'' I remember he had several \n     zoning cases and defended his Marine friend, Colonel Frank \n     Schwable, who had been accused by the Commandant of \n     misconduct, in that while a prisoner of war, the colonel had \n     been coerced into making a confession regarding germ warfare. \n     John won an acquittal. The decision was not popular with the \n     Commandant, who expressed his views extensively. John, with \n     his usual flair for describing the impact of the acquittal on \n     other Marines, told about how, in the Rec Room of another \n     Marine colonel, there were photographs of all the Marine \n     Commandants, except one. That particular photograph was \n     turned to the wall and on the back of it was the official \n     reprimand which the Commandant received as a young Marine, \n     when he, himself, was found guilty of misconduct.\n       John was appointed by President Johnson as a Judge of the \n     U.S. District Court in 1968. I knew from my long association \n     with him that he was a deeply religious person. He never made \n     a show of it. It was a private matter with him. The New \n     Catholic Catechism, distributed to the faithful about two \n     years ago, since it was not in existence 27 years ago when \n     John became a judge, could not have been his guiding light. \n     He was certainly motivated, however, to follow its \n     principles. I quote an excerpt from paragraph 1807, \n     respecting justice: ``Justice toward men disposes one to \n     respect the rights of each and to establish in human \n     relationships the harmony that promotes equity with regard to \n     persons and to the common good. The just man, often mentioned \n     in the Sacred Scriptures, is distinguished by habitual right \n     thinking and the uprightness of his conduct toward his \n     neighbor. ``You shall not be partial to the poor or defer to \n     the great, but in righteousness shall you judge your \n     neighbor.'' (Citation omitted.)\n       In the 27 years that John served on this Court, he never \n     sought publicity or interviews. He let the record speak for \n     itself. He did, however, always seek to let justice prevail. \n     Typical of this is the ``Forest Haven'' case, which he was \n     struggling with at the time of his death. The case concerned \n     the treatment of mentally retarded persons. The evidence \n     disclosed, and John had found, that the city had failed \n     properly to discharge its responsibilities in the care of \n     these people. He had appointed a Special Master to oversee \n     the functioning of his decree.\n       I recall one of his early cases, known as the ``D.C. \n     Nine,'' in which four priests, a nun, a former nun, two \n     Jesuit seminarians and a draft resister broke into the \n     offices of Dow Chemical and poured blood over the files of \n     that company as a protest against the war in Vietnam. Though \n     a devout Catholic, John could not condone such action. they \n     were tried, convicted and sentenced.\n       One of the most highly publicized cases that John tried was \n     the corruption case against the former governor of Maryland, \n     Marvin Mandel. After some three months of trial, because of \n     evidence of jury tampering, John declared a mistrial. Another \n     judge was assigned to the case, which resulted in a \n     conviction. In looking over the extensive list of cases in \n     which John wrote opinions, found in the ``Federal \n     Supplement,'' ``Federal Rules Decisions,'' ``Washington Law \n     Reporter,'' and other publications, I ran across one in which \n     minister Farrakhan was involved. The case concerned a \n     presidential order involving sanctions against Libya and, \n     among other things, precluded travel to that country. \n     Minister Farrakhan denounced the sanctions and announced his \n     intent to travel to Libya. He sought to enjoin prosecution \n     for disobedience of a presidential decree. In granting the \n     government's motion to dismiss, John held, among other \n     things, that plaintiff lacked standing.\n       In Broderick v. SEC, John was confronted with a sex \n     discrimination case. John found that Broderick herself was a \n     victim of sexual harassment by at least three of her \n     supervisors. More importantly, plaintiff was forced to work \n     in an environment in which the managers harassed her and \n     other employees by bestowing preferential treatment on those \n     who submitted to their sexual advances. The court ordered a \n     substantial recovery for Broderick.\n       In Adams v. Bennett, John dealt with a major nationwide \n     desegregation issue for approximately seventeen years. He \n     required schools receiving federal funds to show that their \n     actions were in harmony with requirements promulgated by \n     Congress. In conformity with a 1984 Supreme Court decision \n     \\3\\ which held that federal courts lack standing to serve as \n     continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness of executive \n     action, John dismissed this law suit which he had been \n     administering for many years. The Office for Civil Rights of \n     the Department of Education agreed to continue to investigate \n     thoroughly alleged violations in programs or activities \n     receiving financial assistance.\n       Two owners of the Florida Avenue Grill, the famed ``Soul \n     Food'' restaurant, were sentenced to six months' imprisonment \n     and a fine in connection with fencing activities. The \n     defendants had pleaded guilty to a charge of interstate \n     transportation of stolen goods after the police infiltrated \n     an operation which directed burglaries and thefts against \n     homes and businesses. The police confiscated approximately \n     two million dollars worth of property.\n       While it is true that John was troubled by the concept of \n     mandatory minimum sentences, like many other federal trial \n     judges he continued trying those cases that were assigned to \n     his Court.\n       Before he assumed the responsibilities of a federal judge, \n     John's interest in community affairs is reflected by the \n     following: He was elected President of the Harvard Club of \n     Washington in 1949. In 1952 and 1953, he was elected \n     president of the Associated Harvard Clubs of America. He was \n     the President of Harvard Law School Association of the \n     District of Columbia in 1952 and 1953. He was Chairman of the \n     Montgomery County, Maryland Housing Authority, 1950-1953. He \n     was Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the District of \n     Columbia Legal Aid Agency from 1967 to 1968. He served as the \n     Judge Advocate General 1961-1968 of the Marine Corps Reserve \n     Officers Association. He was elected President of the Bar \n     Association of the District of Columbia in 1965 and President \n     of the Barristers club in 1969. He served as President of The \n     Lawyers' Club in 1987. He served as Chairman of the Judicial \n     Conference committee which has the responsiblity of reviewing \n     extrajudicial income reports of federal judges, known as the \n     Ethics Committee. John, in all his activities, demonstrated \n     the \n\n[[Page S1070]]\n     qualifications of a leader. He was a modest man who seldom raised his \n     voice. He didn't have to. He was completely in control of his \n     courtroom and of any other activity which he undertook. All \n     of us who knew John were amazed by his ability to recall with \n     accuracy names of participants and dates of athletic and \n     other events going back sixty or seventy years. What a mind!\n       Pax vobiscum.\n           With undying respect,\n                                                     Oliver Gasch,\n                                       Judge, U.S. District Court.\n\n                               Footnotes\n\n     \\1\\About this time, John also served as a page in the U.S. \n     Senate.\n     \\2\\``On the southern half of the beaches the 4th Marine \n     Division was having plenty of trouble.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the personnel of \nthe U.S. Capitol Police. During my tenure in the Senate, I have \nwitnessed these officers working in all types of adverse weather \nconditions during all seasons. The dedication and commitment these \nofficers displayed during the ``Blizzard of '96'' is commendable and \nworthy of recognition. I thank the Sergeant of Arms for bringing these \nindividuals to my attention.\n  On Saturday, January 6, the Washington metropolitan area experienced \na winter storm of record proportions. When the storm was over 2 days \nlater, record snowfall blanketed the city. High winds, drifting snow, \nand severe windchill temperatures created a critical emergency \nsituation.\n  Whle roads throughout the area were impassable, the men and women of \nthe U.S. Capitol Police were on duty providing vital public safety and \npolice services within the Capitol complex.\n  Officers who were on duty when the storm began elected to remain on \nduty for extended periods. Some worked for as long as 32 hours to \nensure there were sufficient personnel to perform law enforcement and \nsecurity operations.\n  Several officers used their own funds to stay at local hotels so they \ncould report back to duty on time to relieve fellow officers. Others, \nsuch as Lynne Williams, chose to sleep on the floor of the police \nstation so she would be available for immediate recall.\n  Many officers performed services above and beyond the call of duty. \nOfficer Al Jones worked four consecutive shifts, using his own plow-\nequipped vehicle to clear snow from parking lots, allowing for the \nmovement of police vehicles.\n  Officers Michael Poillucci, Terrell Brantley, Thomas Howard, Terry \nCook, and Angelo Cimini used four-wheel drive police vehicles to \ntransport House and Senate Members to critical official meetings.\n\n  Officer Richard Rudd voluntarily came to work on his day off knowing \nhe would be needed. Officer Michael Mulcahy used plumbing skills to \nrepair a broken water pipe in the police K-9 facility. Sgt. Dennis \nKitchen, Officer Peter Demas, Officer Ellen Howard, and Capt. Edward \nBailor worked extended duty hours in the Operations Division to provide \ncoordination with other congressional and Federal entities during the \nstorm.\n  Officers Ted Tholen, Kevin Weinkauf, James Whitt and freight handlers \nBounteum Sysamout, Barry Pickett, Debora Riddick, Charles Wilson, \nChristopher Westmoreland, Richard Morris, and Thomas Cuthbertson of the \nOff-Site Delivery Center shoveled parking lots and security inspection \nareas to ensure police operations were not disrupted. Mr. Ken Meadows \nof the vehicle maintenance section worked additional duty hours to \nequip police vehicles with chains and respond to motorists in need of \nassistance. In addition, officers assisted countless citizens whose \nvehicles became stuck in the snow, responded to dozens of emergency \ncalls for police assistance, and continued to diligently protect the \nCapitol and congressional office buildings.\n  These are just some examples of the extraordinary effort by the U.S. \nCapitol Police officers to meet and overcome the unique challenges \nposed by this severe snow storm. Their actions reflect the highest \nstandards of public service. We thank the U.S. Capitol Police for their \ncontinued good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1070-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO AOC EMPLOYEES\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on Saturday, January 6, the Washington \nmetropolitan area experienced a winter storm which virtually shut down \nthe city and surrounding areas. The historic snowfall, high winds, and \ncold temperatures caused immeasurable difficulties and crisis \nsituations never encountered before.\n  Despite these dangerous conditions, employees of all units under the \nArchitect of the Capitol, including the Senate restaurants, preformed \ntheir duties to the highest level possible. In many instances key \npersonnel remained in the immediate area and at their posts throughout \nthe storm. Their commitment and hard work resulted in the following \naccomplishments: The removal of ice and snow equal to 19 miles from \nsidewalks, steps, building entrances, and handicapped ramps. \nMaintenance of powerplant operations to ensure delivery of steam to \nheat the Capitol Hill complex. Arrangement for continuous operation and \nemergency maintenance of all mechanical and electrical systems. The \nmaintenance and monitoring of all office communication systems and \nclimate control systems. Response to emergency calls for repair of \nfrozen HVAC coils and building and roof leaks.\n  We should applaud the outstanding efforts these employees made on \nbehalf of all of us during a historic weather event.

Mr. President, the blizzard of 1996 caused untold \ninconvenience and problems to those in the Washington metropolitan \narea. The record snowstorm virtually shut down this city and \nsurrounding Virginia and Maryland suburbs.\n  The infrastructure which supports the U.S. Senate met the challenge. \nI thank the Sergeant at Arms for providing me the facts and the names \nof these individuals. The U.S. Capitol telephone operators who were \nscheduled to work during the weekend storm that struck on January 6 \nknew the forecast. They came to work prepared to stay as long as \nnecessary to keep the Capitol switchboard open and covered. Their \ncommitment to duty resulted in many remaining overnight in their \noffices, carrying on with their duties, as others could not get here to \nrelieve them. Bringing in extra food and clothing, they were prepared \nto work through the weekend. Supervisors of the Capitol switchboard \ncame to work a day early to make certain they would be on duty.\n  While these Capitol switchboard operators and supervisors are \ndesignated ``emergency personnel,'' they consider getting to work under \nextreme weather conditions as simply doing their job.\n  I would like to commend these supervisors and operators for their \nexemplary public service and mention them by name:\n  Barbara Broce, Martha Brick, Joan Sartori, Joan Cooksey, Mary \nQuesenberry, Lisa Thompson, and Laura Williams.\n  Thanks to all of you for your fine efforts and dedication to your \njobs serving the U.S. Congress and our citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1070-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1070-S1072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHINESE NUCLEAR EXPORTS TO PAKISTAN\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues some very disturbing developments in weapons proliferation \nin south Asia. Last year may go down in history as one of the worst \nyears for the cause of nuclear nonproliferation. New evidence released \nthis week merely reinforces this grave conclusion.\n  On February 5 the Washington Times reported that, in 1995, Chinese \ndefense industrial trading companies exported 5,000 ring magnets to \nPakistan. Under the terms of an international agreement with the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, the export of ring magnets is \nstrictly controlled because \n\n[[Page S1071]]\nof the magnets' critical use in the production of nuclear weapons. \nSpecifically, ring magnets are used in gas centrifuges, which are used \nto extract enriched, weapons-grade uranium from uranium gas.\n  Just this morning, Mr. President, the Washington Post reported a \nsimilar story, finding that American intelligence officials believe \nthere is no doubt that the transfers occurred. Chapter 10, section 101, \nof the Arms Export Control Act contains very severe penalties that are \nto be imposed on both the exporting country and the importing country \nfor illicit nuclear transfers of this type. Specifically, the law \nstates that no Federal assistance--economic or military--may be made \navailable to either country. In the case of the receiving country, \nPakistan, this would mean the suspension of economic and military \nassistance, including military training or the transfer of defense \narticles. In the case of the delivering country, the People's Republic \nof China, the operations of the United States Export-Import Bank would \nbe blocked.\n  These shocking revelations raise three fundamental issues:\n  First, numerous officials in the Government of Pakistan have been \nquoted, as recently as 1995, that it was no longer enriching uranium \nfor nuclear weapons production. In other words, Pakistan claimed it had \nfrozen its bomb program. We could never verify those statements, but \nthat was what we were led to believe. We now know differently.\n  Second, the People's Republic of China has made a series of pledges \nto the United States with regards to the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction. Again, we now know differently.\n  Finally, during most of 1995--when the transfer of nuclear technology \nfrom the People's Republic of China to Pakistan was taking place--\nrepresentatives of the Government of Pakistan and the Clinton \nadministration were actively lobbying the Congress to weaken United \nStates non-proliferation law to allow for a one time transfer of \nmilitary equipment valued in excess of $370 million, as well as the \nresumption of nonmilitary aid. As we all know, last year the Senate \npassed the so-called Brown amendment, which authorized the transfer of \nthis military equipment to Pakistan. It also repealed portions of the \nso-called Pressler amendment, a law which prohibited any United States \nassistance to the Government of Pakistan because of its possession of \nnuclear explosive devices.\n  This last point--the passage of the Brown amendment--is particularly \ndisturbing. I opposed the Brown amendment. I opposed it in part because \nit called for the transfer of military equipment without obtaining one \nsingle concession from Pakistan on the issue of nuclear proliferation. \nFrankly, if Members of Congress were aware of the ring sale--this \nviolation of U.S. law --I do not believe the Brown amendment would have \npassed.\n  It is unfortunate enough that our Nation would transfer to Pakistan, \nUnited States-made military equipment without any non-proliferation \nconcession. Now we face the real and embarrassing prospect of having \nweakened United States non-proliferation law for Pakistan's benefit at \nthe same time Pakistan was expanding its nuclear weapons capability in \nviolation of United States law. This irony would be humorous if the \nissue wasn't so serious.\n  Accordingly, in view of the confirmations of these transfers, I have \nwritten today to President Clinton urging that he enforce the law. \nSpecifically, any contemplated transfer of military equipment to \nPakistan, as called for in the Brown amendment, should cease \nimmediately. Further, sanctions called for under the law also should be \napplied to Chinese exporting companies.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it may be worth exploring if officials within \nthe Clinton administration knew of this blatant violation of U.S. \nnonproliferation law while the administration was lobbying to pass the \nBrown amendment. And if they did, in fact, know it would be important \nto determine if they informed Members of Congress of this development. \nI intend to raise this matter with the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee in the very near future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that articles in the \nWashington Times of February 5 and the Washington Post of February 7 as \nwell as my letter to the President of this date be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 5, 1996]\n\n                     China Nuclear Transfer Exposed\n\n\n                    Hill expected to urge sanctions\n\n                            (By Bill Gertz)\n\n       The CIA has uncovered new evidence China has violated U.S. \n     antiproliferation laws by exporting nuclear weapons \n     technology to Pakistan.\n       Evidence that China has transferred ring magnets--used in \n     gas centrifuges that enrich uranium for weapons--is likely to \n     intensify congressional pressure on the Clinton \n     administration to impose sanctions as required by law.\n       Last week, several senators asked the president in a letter \n     if China's sale of advanced cruise missiles to Iran, \n     disclosed Tuesday by Vice Adm. Scott Redd, commander of U.S. \n     naval forces in the Persian Gulf, also violates \n     counterproliferation laws.\n       State Department officials are expected to confront Chinese \n     Vice Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing, who arrives in Washington \n     today, over the nuclear technology and other weapons-\n     proliferation exports.\n       The administration in the past has sought to minimize \n     Chinese nuclear and missile-proliferation activities. But \n     senior State Department officials are said to be very worried \n     that China's proliferation activities can no longer be \n     ignored without undermining the credibility of U.S. efforts \n     to halt the spread of nuclear arms technology and missiles.\n       ``The Chinese are their own worst enemy,'' a White House \n     official said when asked about the new proliferation \n     activities by Beijing.\n       The CIA in 1992 obtained intelligence indicating China had \n     transferred M-11 missiles to Pakistan, including photographs \n     of missile canisters. But the State Department ruled there \n     was no proof missiles were inside, thereby avoiding having to \n     invoke tough sanctions.\n       Instead, the department in 1993 applied much milder \n     sanctions for transferring what is said was M-11 technology, \n     and then lifted the sanctions after a year.\n       According to intelligence sources, the CIA recently \n     notified the State Department that China sold 5,000 ring \n     magnets to the A.Q. Khan Research Laboratory in Kahuta, \n     Pakistan, last year.\n       Officials did not further identify the originating firm in \n     China, but one congressional source said the magnets were \n     probably produced by the China National Nuclear Co., a \n     government-owned firm that makes nuclear-related products.\n       CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield declined to comment when asked \n     about the Chinese transfer of nuclear technology. Spokesmen \n     for the Chinese and Pakistani embassies could not be reached \n     for comment.\n       According to congressional sources, State Department \n     officials believe China's export of ring magnets violates the \n     Arms Export Control Act. Under an amendment to that law, the \n     1994 Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act, the president is \n     required to impose sanctions on any country that ``transfers \n     to a non-nuclear weapon state any design information or \n     component'' used in building nuclear arms.\n       Gas centrifuges are used to extract enriched uranium from \n     uranium gas. Intelligence officials believe the magnets sent \n     to Pakistan will be used in special suspension bearings at \n     the top of a spinning chamber in the centrifuges.\n       ``This is another example of the ruthless way the Chinese \n     are violating every nonproliferation pledge they've made to \n     us,'' said William C. Triplett, former chief counsel of the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n       On Wednesday, Sens. Larry Pressler of South Dakota, Alfonse \n     M. D'Amato of New York, Connie Mack of Florida and Arlen \n     Specter of Pennsylvania wrote to President Clinton about \n     Iran's test-firing a Chinese C-802 advanced anti-ship cruise \n     missile.\n       ``Clearly, Adm. Redd's acknowledgment of the C-802 test-\n     firing would appear to be an official recognition of an \n     illegal transfer to Iran to advanced conventional weapons by \n     Chinese defenses industrial trading companies,'' Mr. Pressler \n     said in a statement. ``This is a vital national security \n     matter and demands immediate attention.''\n       In their letter, the four senators asked the president \n     either to ``enforce the sanctions pursuant to federal law or \n     to seek a waiver.''\n       Under an amendment to the fiscal 1993 defense authorization \n     law, the president is required to impose sanctions on any \n     nation that transfers advanced conventional weapons to either \n     Iran or Iraq. The measure was sponsored by Sen. John McCain, \n     Arizona Republican, and Sen. Al Gore, Tennessee Democrat and \n     now vice president.\n       Mr. McCain, in a separate letter to Undersecretary of State \n     Lynn Davis, the department's top arms-control policy-maker, \n     asked whether the Chinese cruise missile transfer to Iran \n     violates federal law and contributes to Iran's efforts to \n     acquire destabilizing advanced conventional arms.\n       In the House, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat and a \n     member of the House Intelligence Committee, asked the \n     committee last week to hold hearings on China's proliferation \n     activities.\n       It also was a key topic when several members of the House \n     International Relations \n\n[[Page S1072]]\n     Committee met last week with Peter Tarnoff, undersecretary of state for \n     political affairs.\n       The disclosures about export of missile and nuclear weapons \n     components come at a time of increased tensions between \n     Washington and Beijing.\n       The State Department announced last week that it has \n     granted a visa to Taiwan's vice president, Li Yuan Zu. China \n     protested the action and has been threatening to use force to \n     recapture Taiwan, which it regards as a renegade province, \n     not an independent country.\n       Other Chinese activities that have severely eroded support \n     in Congress for a waiver of sanctions:\n       The expulsion last week of three Chinese nationals from \n     Ukraine for trying to obtain secret technology on SS-18 ICBM \n     boosters from a missile-production facility in \n     Dnipropetrovsk.\n       Ongoing copyright violations involving U.S. goods.\n       Continued nuclear weapons testing.\n       Dispatching missile technicians to Pakistan in 1994, \n     indicating the transfer of M-11 technology was still under \n     way at a time when China was denying such activities.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 7, 1996]\n\n                  China Aids Pakistan Nuclear Program\n\n\n    parts shipment reported by cia could jeopardize u.s. trade deals\n\n                         (By R. Jeffrey Smith)\n\n       U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that China sold \n     sensitive nuclear weapons-related equipment to Pakistan last \n     year, an act that could lead the Clinton administration to \n     halt U.S. government financing for nearly $10 billion worth \n     of American business deals in China.\n       President Clinton's advisers are studying the intelligence \n     report to determine how they should respond, according to \n     several officials. Legislation approved by Congress in 1994 \n     requires that he either approve the sanctions, which would \n     block loan guarantees by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, or \n     formally waive the penalties, once such an intelligence \n     report is received.\n       In a previous arms transfer case, involving the alleged \n     sale of Chinese missiles to Pakistan, the State Department \n     ducked imposing sanctions by concluding that the evidence was \n     not strong enough. A senior official commenting yesterday at \n     the State Department about the new report of nuclear aid to \n     Pakistan, said that ``as of now'' the United States has not \n     determined that China has ``done anything that would trigger \n     sanctions under U.S. legislation.''\n       But several other U.S. officials privy to the new \n     intelligence report said there is no doubt about its \n     conclusions, a circumstance that could put the administration \n     in a bind because it prefers to avoid damaging extensive U.S. \n     trade ties with China.\n       The aim of the sanctions would be to punish China for \n     assisting Partisan's production of highly enriched uranium, a \n     key ingredient of nuclear weapons. But U.S. officials say the \n     nuclear transfer is only one of several recent actions by \n     China that may wind up disrupting its commercial and \n     diplomatic relations with the United States.\n       China's export to Iran late last year of anti-ship cruise \n     missiles--confirmed last week by a senior U.S. Navy \n     official--may also qualify as a sanctionable offense, \n     according to some U.S. officials and lawmakers. Another U.S. \n     law requires broad economic penalties against any nation that \n     gives ``destabilizing numbers and types of advanced \n     conventional weapons'' to Iran, which Washington has branded \n     a terrorist nation.\n       U.S. officials said that the number of missiles sold by \n     China may not be large enough to force the drastic cutoff of \n     development bank assistance, technical assistance, military \n     exchanges and sensitive exports mandated by the law. But four \n     senators recently wrote to Clinton to say that either \n     sanctions or a waiver are required in this case.\n       In yet another sign of increasingly rocky U.S. relations \n     with China, some administration officials have raised the \n     prospect of imposing tariffs later this year on billions of \n     dollars in trade to protest China's refusal to halt illicit \n     copying of U.S. trademark goods.\n       Washington is also trying to persuade China to adopt a less \n     threatening posture toward Taiwan. Beijing views the island \n     as a renegade province, but Taiwan receives U.S. arms and is \n     supported by many U.S. lawmakers because of its considerable \n     prosperity and political openness relative to China.\n       ``There's a recognition that this is going to be a very \n     difficult year in U.S.-China relations,'' a senior State \n     Department official said. He explained that with China in the \n     midst of a difficult transition to new political leadership, \n     and ``our own domestic environment'' affected by an upcoming \n     presidential election, the two nations may find themselves \n     being pulled toward opposing positions on matters they \n     previously sidestepped or settled through compromise.\n       Washington has long had concerns about Chinese military \n     assistance to Pakistan, which Beijing regards as an erstwhile \n     political ally and military counter-weight to India. U.S. \n     intelligence officials have long alleged that Pakistan's \n     nuclear arsenal is largely derived from design information \n     supplied by China, a charge that Beijing denies.\n       U.S. intelligence reports have also pinpointed the apparent \n     location in Pakistan of crated, Chinese-made, medium-range \n     missiles, which if confirmed would force a cutoff of billions \n     of dollars worth of U.S.-China trade. But the administration \n     has decided that no sanctions need be invoked until the \n     missiles are sighted outside their crates.\n       The latest Chinese nuclear-related transfer to Pakistan was \n     recently detected by the CIA and first reported publicly in \n     Monday's editions of the Washington Times. It involves a \n     shipment of 5,000 specialized magnets to the Abdul Qadeer \n     Khan Research Laboratory in Kahuta, named for the father of \n     the Pakistani nuclear bomb program.\n       According to two knowledgeable officials, the magnets are \n     clearly meant to be installed in high-speed centrifuges at \n     the plant that enrich uranium for nuclear weapons.\n       Several congressional sources said that the shipment thus \n     triggers provisions of the 1994 Nuclear Proliferation \n     Prevention Act, which forces ``a cutoff of Export-Import Bank \n     assistance'' involving trade with China.\n       Among the large U.S. companies that would be affected by a \n     loan guarantee cutoff are Boeing Co., AT, and Westinghouse \n     Electric Corp.\n       ``We do have genuine concerns about any possible nuclear-\n     related transfers between China and Pakistan and we have \n     raised these concerns . . . at very senior levels,'' the \n     senior official said at the State Department.\n       ``We will do whatever is required under U.S. law, but . . . \n     we have to have a very high degree of confidence in our \n     evidence,'' the official added. ``As of now we have not \n     determined that China . . . has done anything that would \n     trigger sanctions under U.S. legislation. But this is \n     obviously under continual review.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The United States Intelligence \n     Community is confirming on background that the People's \n     Republic of China (PRC) has violated U.S. non-proliferation \n     laws by exporting nuclear weapons technology to Pakistan. \n     According to today's Washington Post, our intelligence \n     officials believe ``there is no doubt'' that an illicit \n     transfer has taken place.\n       Specifically, the Washington Times first reported on \n     February 5 that, in 1995, Chinese defense industrial trading \n     companies sold 5,000 ring magnets to the Abdul Qadeer Khan \n     Research Laboratory in Kahuta, Pakistan. Under an \n     international agreement sponsored by the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency, the export of ring magnets is severely \n     restricted because of their critical use in nuclear weapons \n     production.\n       This reported sale of nuclear technology raises two key \n     concerns many in Congress have held for some time: Contrary \n     to the most solemn declaration of the Government of Pakistan, \n     Pakistan is attempting to expand its supply of weapons-grade \n     enriched uranium, and Chinese companies are actively fueling \n     and profiting from a dangerous nuclear arms race in South \n     Asia.\n       Chapter 10 of the Arms Export Control Act contains a set of \n     specific prohibitions governing illicit nuclear transfers. If \n     the President determines that a country has delivered or \n     received ``nuclear enrichment equipment, materials or \n     technology,'' no funds may be made available to that country \n     under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. This would include \n     all civilian and military equipment, including that provided \n     by the Brown Amendment to the Fiscal Year 1996 Foreign \n     Operations Appropriations Act. The prohibitions also extend \n     to military education and training.\n       I ask that you make the determination called for by Chapter \n     10. Unquestionably, this sale of nuclear technology \n     represents a serious violation of federal law, as well as \n     international nuclear non-proliferation agreements.\n       No issue is more important to the security of all people \n     than nuclear non-proliferation. For that reason, I urge your \n     Administration to take immediate and certain action to \n     enforce the law with respect to this sale of nuclear \n     technology and freeze all assistance, civilian or military, \n     to Pakistan. The sanctions called for under the law should be \n     applied to Chinese exporting companies.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Pressler,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1070-4", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1072-S1073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO RICHARD G. ``DICK'' FIFIELD\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the agricultural community in Alabama and \nthroughout the Southeast have not had a more forceful and competent \nrepresentative than Richard G. ``Dick'' Fifield. For 20 years, this \nloyal friend to has done an outstanding job of directing the Washington \nlegislative operations of the Alabama Farmers Federation--widely known \nas ALFA--as the organization's official liaison to Congress. Dick will \nbe retiring from his position as ALFA's Director of National Affairs \nand Research on March 1, 1996, and will be sorely missed by all of us \nwho have been fortunate enough to know him and work with him over the \nyears.\n  As a long-time member of the Senate's Agriculture Committee, I have \nhad the pleasure of working with Dick Fifield on a great number of \nissues that \n\n[[Page S1073]]\nare important to American farmers, especially those in the South. The \nmajor legislation on which we have worked includes the peanut program; \nthe Food and Agriculture Act of 1981; the Food Security Act of 1985; \nand the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990. The \npeanut, cotton, soybean, dairy, cattle, hog, poultry, and catfish \nprograms have his fingerprints all over them. In each case, Dick's \ncounsel, insight, ingenuity, and strong leadership have contributed not \nonly to their passage and enactment into law, but to their overall \nsuccess during their implementation phase.\n  He has indeed been my mentor and teacher. Practically all of my \nknowledge about American agriculture has come from him. There is no one \nmore knowledgeable. Doctoral degrees are usually given to those in \nacademic circles because of their knowledge about a particular subject. \nI gave Dick the name ``Dr. Fifield'' because I felt he was superior to \nmost PhD's. Not only will I miss him as a mentor and teacher, but also \nas a dear friend.\n  As ALFA's Washington director, he also works extensively with the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture; the U.S. Trade Representative; the \nDepartment of the Interior; the Environmental Protection Agency; the \nArmy Corps of Engineers; the Statistical Reporting Service; the Farmers \nHome Administration; the Soil Conservation Service; as well as other \nagencies which handle agricultural programs and projects. It is no \nsurprise that his friendly face is known far and wide within the \nvarious corners of the Federal Government.\n  He has been an effective representative of farm interests due not \nonly to his God-given talents, but also because of his extensive \nexperience as a college professor, a geologist, a science editor, and a \nhorticulturist. Examples of his influence on Alabama agriculture are \nnumerous and varied. For instance, the State's modern farmers market, \nlocated in Montgomery, was made possible by his submission of the \noriginal design and his work on legislation and grants to raise the $5 \nmillion needed to built the facility. He started annual farmers market \ndays in Montgomery, Huntsville, and Birmingham, establishing a \nproducer-farmer market inside Birmingham's Eastwood Mall.\n  Dick initiated the ALFA's monthly Food Price Survey and he remains \nthe project's director. The food basket report is regarded by the \nbusiness community and the media as one of the State's best economic \nindicators.\n  He represented the peanut industry in efforts to protect Section 22 \nof the GATT negotiations. He is a member of the Technical Advisory \nCommittee of the National Peanut Growers Group; Assistant Director of \nthe Farm Crisis and Transition Committee for Alabama; and has served on \nthe Governor's Agriculture Policy Advisory Committee and the Energy \nAdvisory Committee. Along with the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce \nEnvironmental Task Force, he helped form a State-wide endangered \nspecies task force for Alabama.\n  Dick received his bachelor of science degree in biology and geology \nfrom Beloit College in 1951. He continued his education at the \nUniversity of Hawaii, the Wisconsin Institute of Technology, and the \nUniversity of Wisconsin, receiving his master's degree in 1972 from the \nUniversity of Illinois.\n  Over the course of his career, he served as an instructor of geology \nat the Wisconsin Institute of Technology; as an exploration geologist \nwith the New Jersey Zinc Co.; and as a representative of the college \ntextbook division in sales and as a field editor in science with the \nHoughton Mifflin Company. Also, he served in the U.S. Army in the \ncounter-intelligence corps as an investigative special agent. Before \naccepting his position with ALFA, he was assistant horticulturist with \nthe University of Illinois.\n  Dick Fifield's retirement will leave a void for American agriculture. \nHe is as knowledgeable as anyone I know of as to the complexity of the \nintegral parts of food and fiber production in this country and their \neffects on every phase of the American economy. His goal has been to \nimprove the quality of life for rural America while at the same time \nproviding consumers with a stable, safe, and cost-effective farm \nprograms. I hope he doesn't stray too far, for we will continue to rely \non his counsel even after he retires.\n  I commend Dick for all his outstanding and unwavering service to the \nagricultural community, and wish him and his wonderful wife, Shirley, \nall the best as they retire and enter a new phase of their lives. I \nknow he will enjoy having more quality time with his family and many, \nmany friends. Both ALFA and the Alabama Congressional delegation will \nsorely miss his strong and principled advocacy for agriculture in our \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1072-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ALABAMA PRESS ASSOCIATION REACHES MILESTONE\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the first 10 amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution were ratified on December 15, 1791, forming what we refer \nto as the Bill of Rights. The first amendment covers what we have come \nto consider the most primary and essential element of our freedom as \nAmericans: ``Congress shall make no law * * * abridging the freedom of \nspeech, or of the press.''\n  Thomas Jefferson once wrote that if it were left up to him to decide \nbetween a government without newspapers or newspapers without a \ngovernment, he would not hesitate to choose the latter. This year, we \ncelebrate the 125th anniversary of the Alabama Press Association [APA]. \nFounded in 1871, the APA is the oldest statewide trade association in \nAlabama and one of the oldest State newspaper associations in the \nNation.\n  According to APA information, William Wallace Screws, the editor of \nthe Montgomery Advertiser in 1871, took the initiative and invited \nnewspaper executives from around the State to help build new \ncommunication links among themselves. On March 17 of that year, eight \neditors and publishers met in Screws' office and made plans to organize \nthe press of Alabama. Newspapers represented in that first meeting were \nthe Montgomery Advertiser, the Montgomery Mail, the Evergreen Observer, \nthe Troy Messenger, the Union Springs Times and Herald, the Montgomery \nState Journal, the Talladega Sun, and the Opelika Locomotive.\n  In 1872, at the first convention, 30 editors and publishers from \nevery corner of the State came together to form a new association of \nnewspapermen called the Editors and Publishers Association of the State \nof Alabama. Since those early days, this association has played an \nimportant role in developing the daily and weekly newspapers of Alabama \nand in helping to lead the State's economic and cultural development. \nThe APA has also worked on behalf of the citizenry of Alabama by \nadvocating stronger citizen access to government records and meetings.\n  On February 24 and 25 of this year, editors and publishers from \nAlabama's daily and weekly newspapers will gather for the 125th \nsuccessive year. The site of this anniversary celebration is in \nMontgomery, the same city in which the organization was founded. During \nthis convention, they will hear historians discuss the role of \nnewspapers in Alabama's history while also considering the future role \nof newspapers in the Nation's rapidly changing communications industry.\n  The 1996 APA is led by its president, R. Douglas Pearson, editor and \npublisher of the Daily Mountain Eagle in Jasper. The first vice \npresident is Michael R. Kelley, editor and publisher of the Clanton \nAdvertiser, and the second vice president is John W. Stevenson, editor \nand publisher of the Randolph Leader. APA's executive director is \nWilliam B. Keller.\n  For 125 years, the APA has thrived under its first amendment rights. \nTaken as a whole, freedom of the press in the United States rests upon \nrelatively firm constitutional footing. The media's general right to \npublish material, regardless of potential impacts on government \noperations or other features of national life, has been accepted. \nWinston Churchill eloquently stated the importance of a free press in \nhis own country during the midst of World War II when he said, ``A free \npress is the unsleeping guardian of every other right that free men \nprize; it is the most dangerous foe of tyranny.'' I salute the APA on \nreaching this distinguished milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1073-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1073-S1074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEE SCHELLING MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak out on behalf of \nfreedom of the press in Hong Kong. As we approach Hong Kong's July 1, \n1997 transfer to control under the People's Republic of China, there is \ngreat fear that one of the fundamental tenets of a free society--\nfreedom of the press--will not survive the transition. China's track \nrecord on press freedom leaves much to be desired; the current Hong \nKong Government should be actively working to shore up legal support \nfor the press before it hands over control to Beijing.\n  The grand experiment of democracy in the United States would have \nsurely failed were it not for a free press. Our founders realized that \nits importance was not only for general education, but also for \nexposing the dangers of would-be oppressive officials and prodding \nleaders into more ethical behavior. Our Nation's history has proven \nthat the scrutiny of public light forces public officials both to serve \nthe interests of the public and to serve honestly far better than they \nwould without that scrutiny. Benjamin Franklin once said that ``whoever \nwould overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the \nfreeness of speech.'' It is precisely this fear--that the PRC will \nattempt to overthrow Hong Kong's current way of life by stifling its \npress, with the quiet acquiescence of the current authorities--that I \nwish to address today.\n  Hong Kong boasts of one of the freest media systems in all of Asia, \nwith more than 70 daily newspapers. The press is privately owned, \noffering Hong Kong citizens access to a broad range of political and \nsocial views. But journalists in and out of Hong Kong cite the present \nadministration's sluggish pace in revising anachronistic press laws as \none of their key sources of fear for the press after 1997.\n  Current Hong Kong laws which restrict press freedom are rarely \napplied by the government, but an authoritarian regime could easily use \nthem to prohibit the expression of any objectionable ideas. These \nlaws--which are inconsistent with Hong Kong's own Bill of Rights--\ninclude the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, which gives the Governor \nbroad powers of censorship during loosely defined ``emergencies''; the \nCrimes Ordinance, which defines any publication or speech ``intending'' \nto foster hatred of the government as seditious; and the Official \nSecrets Act, which makes unauthorized publication of information \nillegal. Some of the democratically elected members of the Legislative \nCouncil, along with independent journalists groups such as the Hong \nKong Journalists Association, have repeatedly urged the government to \nrepeal or amend these laws. These same reformers have also urged the \nHong Kong Governor's office to enact legislation which would provide \ngreater access to information, similar to the United States Freedom of \nInformation Act. But the current administration continues to move \nslowly, to the point of delay. There is no reason to believe that the \nsuccessor Chinese administration will be any more willing to undertake \nthese reforms; it is likely to oppose them outright. The time to make \nthese changes is now. Above all, the government should refrain from \nintroducing any new laws which in any way restrict the press' right to \nfunction independently. A recent call by pro-Beijing Legislator Law \nCheung-kwok for hearings to consider regulating newspaper prices, a \nmove that appears to be aimed specifically at controlling the Oriental \nDaily News, is exactly what the Hong Kong government should not be \ndoing.\n  Joseph Pulitzer argued that ``publicity may not be the only thing \nthat is needed, but it is the one thing without which all other \nagencies will fail.'' There is no point of having a freely elected \ndemocratic government if there is no way to freely report on its \nactions and to expose its abuses. A free press is the only guarantor of \nthe people's right to know what their government does and the best \nguarantor of their right to offer alternative views. Hong Kong's press \nmust remain free and unrestricted if the colony's current rights are to \nbe maintained. The colonial government has the immediate responsibility \nof ensuring that it does.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1074-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1074-S1075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PROGRESS AGAINST FRAUD IN POLITICAL ASYLUM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is the first anniversary of a major \ninitiative by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to reduce \nillegal immigration by cracking down on fraudulent asylum claims. One \nyear ago, INS Commissioner Doris Meissner put new regulations into \neffect which have more than doubled the number of asylum officers, \nincreased the number of immigration judges and streamlined the asylum \napplication process.\n  The results have been dramatic. In 1 year, there has been a 57 \npercent reduction in new asylum applications. Clearly, there has been a \nreduction in the filing of fraudulent claims. In addition, 84 percent \nof new asylum claims are now heard by INS within 60 days. This \ninitiative is a major success story in the Clinton administration's \nongoing effort to combat illegal immigration.\n  In coming weeks, the Senate Judiciary Committee will recommend \ncomprehensive immigration reforms. A large part of these reforms focus \non the need to reduce illegal immigration, including steps to deal with \nabuse of the right of asylum.\n  As the INS has shown, asylum abuse can be remedied--without denying \ntrue refugees the right to apply for asylum. They deserve adequate time \nto learn how to apply for asylum, overcome their fear of authority, and \nobtain help with their applications. We must avoid unfair restrictions \nthat result in real harm to true refugees.\n  I ask unanimous consent that recent articles on the major progress \nagainst asylum abuse be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 15, 1996]\n\n                          Some Progress at INS\n\n       A year ago, the Immigration and Naturalization Service put \n     into effect new regulations to control abuse of the political \n     asylum program. Commissioner Doris Meissner recently released \n     figures that indicate progress. The problem has been this: \n     Although immigration law authorizes sanctuary to be given to \n     people in fear of political persecution at home, too many \n     undocumented immigrants had figured out that they could \n     indefinitely postpone deportation merely by requesting \n     asylum. They would be automatically given work permits, and, \n     because of the backlog of cases awaiting adjudication, they \n     could often disappear into the general population without \n     much chance of being found. In 1994, 123,000 new applications \n     were filed (up from 56,000 three years earlier), and the \n     backlog exceeded 425,000.\n       In response, the INS decided to issue work permits only to \n     those granted asylum or waiting more than 180 days for an \n     adjudication. Within a year, applications dropped by 57 \n     percent to 53,000. Then Congress approved a request for more \n     asylum officers and judges, and the new positions--which are \n     still being filled--have enabled INS to complete more than \n     twice as many cases as it did last year. Finally, most \n     individual claims for asylum are heard within 60 days instead \n     of waiting months, or even years, as was the case before. \n     While the backlog remains almost unchanged, the figure is \n     deceptive, inflated by a sizable number of petitions filed \n     pursuant to court order by certain Salvadorans and \n     Nicaraguans.\n       Although some challenge has been made to the claims of \n     progress made by the INS, it is \n\n[[Page S1075]]\n     certain that considerable distance has been covered in improving \n     procedures. And this kind of effective enforcement is, \n     paradoxically, the best way to deal with the anti-immigration \n     political climate. Legal immigrants and those who have valid \n     claims for asylum will be the beneficiaries of policies that \n     make the law work as it is meant to--and should--work.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and \n           Naturalization Service,\n                                  Washington, DC, January 4, 1996.\n\n\n              ins successfully reforms u.s. asylum system\n\n       Washington. DC.--A Clinton Administration initiative to \n     reform the U.S. asylum system has achieved dramatic success \n     in its first year, INS Commissioner Doris Meissner announced \n     today.\n       On the first anniversary of the initiative, Commissioner \n     Meissner said that the unprecedented reforms have \n     substantially lowered the incidence of fraudulent claims by \n     eliminating the virtually automatic issuance of work \n     authorization documents to all asylum applicants. ``INS has \n     removed the primary incentive for baseless asylum claims,'' \n     she said, ``resulting in the fair and prompt adjudication of \n     newly filed cases for the very first time. With this attack \n     on fraud, we have closed a back door to illegal \n     immigration.''\n       Over the past year, the Administration's landmark reforms \n     have reduced the number of new asylum claims filed with the \n     INS by 57 percent. In addition, these initiatives enabled INS \n     asylum officers to double their productivity, completing \n     126,000 cases during 1995 compared with 61,000 in 1994. INS' \n     new regulations to improve productivity and prevent misuse \n     became effective on January 4, 1995.\n       Commissioner Meissner said, ``The U.S. asylum system was \n     broken for many years, but today our asylum system is fair \n     and efficient. The 57 percent reduction in new asylum cases \n     is evidence that the INS has eliminated incentives for asylum \n     abuse. At the same time, we have greatly improved the \n     system's ability to quickly provide protection to those who \n     deserve it.''\n       In response to a mandate from President Clinton in July \n     1993 to overhaul the inefficient and long-neglected U.S. \n     asylum system, INS established asylum reform as a top \n     priority. New regulations which took effect one year ago \n     today eliminated easy access to work authorization and \n     streamlined the process.\n       Applicants for the first time are required to personally \n     appear at an asylum office to receive notification of the \n     asylum decision. At that time, the applicant is granted \n     asylum or is served with charging documents which formally \n     begin deportation proceedings.\n       The Administration also sought the resources necessary to \n     improve and update the system and secured them through the \n     1994 Crime Bill. In addition to more than doubling the \n     authorized number of INS asylum officers from 150 to 325, the \n     Crime Bill significantly increased the number of Immigration \n     Judges from 112 to 179.\n       Additional indications of the success of asylum reform \n     include:\n       Currently 84 percent of individual claims for asylum are \n     heard by the INS within 60 days.\n       In 1995, the issuance of charging documents doubled (from \n     29,000 in 1994 to 65,000 in 1995), placing twice as many \n     applicants directly in deportation proceedings.\n       ``By limiting the availability of work authorization to \n     only those applicants who are granted asylum or are not \n     promptly adjudicated, the Administration has significantly \n     reduced the potential for baseless claims. At the same time, \n     INS has streamlined the entire asylum system. And we will \n     continue to make dramatic progress in resolving this long-\n     standing problem,'' Commissioner Meissner added.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 12, 1995]\n\n                       Don't Gut Political Asylum\n\n                         (By Philip G. Schrag)\n\n       For many years, the United States has granted political \n     asylum to victims of persecution who come to our country and \n     seek our protection. Now, however, Congress is on the verge \n     of abolishing the right of political asylum.\n       Congress is not proposing to repeal the asylum provisions \n     of the Refugee Act of 1980. An outright repeal would probably \n     never pass, because many in Congress, recalling America's \n     sorry treatment of refugees during the Holocaust, accept the \n     humanitarian premises underlying asylum. Rather, the \n     abolition is in the form of a new, apparently innocuous \n     ``procedural'' requirement. The House Judiciary Committee \n     recently adopted, as an amendment to this year's immigration \n     reform act, a proviso that denies asylum to any person who \n     applies for it more than 30 days after arriving in the United \n     States. A Senate subcommittee has approved a similar \n     proposal.\n       If this bill becomes law, the asylum process will shut down \n     because, as a practical matter, it is impossible for an \n     applicant to file that quickly. Most refugees fleeing \n     persecution must give top priority to searching for their \n     American relatives and acquaintances. In many cases, they do \n     not speak English. They are not permitted to hold jobs in the \n     United States. They must immediately find ways to feed \n     themselves and their children. It takes weeks for them to \n     find minimal housing and to achieve the most basic \n     orientation to American culture. Months may pass before they \n     even learn that if they want asylum, they have to file an \n     application with the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     (INS) on Form I-589.\n       After refugees learn about asylum and obtain the form, they \n     will discover the daunting task ahead of them. The form \n     itself is quite complicated: seven pages, plus eight pages of \n     fine-print instructions. It is only available in English and \n     must be completed in English. It requires applicants to prove \n     that they have a well-founded fear, should they be deported, \n     that they will be ``persecuted'' because of their ``race, \n     religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a \n     particular social group''--all legal terms of art that have \n     been interpreted by many courts. Because the legal standard \n     has been embellished by judicial decisions and because a \n     lawyer can help * * * case effectively, an applicant is well \n     advised to have an attorney help compile and organize the \n     supporting documentation. Mistakes can literally be fatal, \n     resulting in deportation into the hands of a persecutor.\n       At present, most asylum applicants need weeks or months to \n     find a lawyer, especially if they need one who will handle \n     the application free of charge. Even now, only a few \n     neighborhood offices that offer free legal help to the poor \n     handle asylum cases, and Congress is slashing the budget of \n     the Legal Services program.\n       Once the applicant finds a willing lawyer, however, more \n     inevitable delays are in store. The instructions for the \n     application form ``strongly urge'' applicants to ``attach \n     additional written statements and documents that support'' \n     their claims, including ``newspaper articles, affidavits of \n     witnesses or experts, periodicals, journals, books, \n     photographs, official documents, other personal statements, \n     or evidence regarding incidents that have occurred to \n     others.''\n       The law students who help prepare these applications under \n     my supervision in an asylum law clinic at Georgetown \n     University Law Center spend at lest a month of nearly full-\n     time work putting together just one application for a client. \n     Obtaining supporting affidavits or even such elementary \n     documentation as birth and death records typically includes, \n     among other things, making repeated telephone calls to people \n     in the country from which the applicant has fled (sometimes \n     with interpreters on the line) and exchanging numerous faxes \n     with witnesses and officials there. These communications are \n     expensive as well as time-consuming.\n       Similarly, obtaining accounts of arbitrary imprisonment, \n     torture, rape and other human rights violations from local * \n     * * many weeks of investigative effort. Finding experts who \n     know about human rights violations against the applicant's \n     tribe or ethnic group is also an arduous and lengthy process.\n       The attachments to support an application can include \n     several hundreds of pages of evidence, and the file can be \n     several inches thick. It is not reasonable to expect a \n     refugee to develop such a file within 30 days after arriving \n     in the United States, with or without the help of a lawyer.\n       A few years ago, the asylum program was abused by large \n     numbers of applicants who were not genuinely eligible for it, \n     but the federal government closed this loophole by ceasing to \n     issue work permits for people whose applications have not yet \n     been approved. In July, Commissioner of Immigration Doris \n     Meissner reported that ``after years in which fraudulent \n     asylum claims were routinely filed as a backdoor way to enter \n     the U.S., INS finally has * * * stopped the abuse.''\n       Congress should preserve the asylum program. At the very \n     least, Congress should not abolish asylum by invisibly and \n     irresponsibly imposing a procedural requirement that is \n     impossible to satisfy. Fewer than one percent of the 900,000 \n     people who immigrate into the United States each year are \n     asylees. This small immigration program poses no serious \n     problems and is worth keeping. When we give sanctuary to \n     victims of oppression we demonstrate to everyone the most \n     humanitarian impulses of the American spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1074-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1075-S1076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRESSMAN FLOYD SPENCE NAMED THE RESERVE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OF THE \n                UNITED STATES 1996 MINUTEMAN OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, on January 24, 1996, my able colleague \nfrom South Carolina, Floyd Spence, the chairman of the House National \nSecurity Committee, received the 1996 Minuteman of the Year Award from \nthe Reserve Officers Association of the United States. He is most \ndeserving of this high honor. Throughout the 25 years that Floyd Spence \nhas served in the House of Representatives, he has been a strong \nadvocate for ensuring that our Nation's defense capabilities are second \nto none, and he has demonstrated great leadership ability as \n\n[[Page S1076]]\nthe chairman of the House National Security Committee in the 104th \nCongress. Floyd Spence is a man of character and integrity, and it is a \nprivilege to work with him. He is truly dedicated to the freedoms that \nwe as Americans hold so dear.\n  Mr. President, I was so impressed with the remarks that Chairman \nSpence made when he received the 1996 Minuteman of the Year Award, that \nI would like to share them with my colleagues. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the address made by Floyd Spence to the Reserve \nOfficers Association of the United States on January 24, 1996, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Address by Congressman Floyd D. Spence to the Mid-Winter Banquet and \nMilitary Ball of the Reserve Officers Association of the United States \n                            January 24, 1996\n\n       It is a privilege for me to be in the presence of so many \n     great Americans this evening, and to join the list of famous \n     people who have received the Minuteman of the Year award from \n     the Reserve Officers Association of the United States. I \n     never thought that I would be honored in this way. I would \n     like to thank you. I also would like to thank God, for it is \n     through him that I received a double-lung transplant in 1988, \n     that has extended my life and allowed me to continue my work \n     in the Congress.\n       It is indeed an honor to be selected as the 1996 Minuteman \n     of the Year. I joined the Navy when I was 17 years old, and \n     after graduating from college, I was commissioned as an \n     ensign in the Naval Reserve. As a retired Captain in the Navy \n     and a member of the Reserve Officers Association, not a day \n     goes by that I do not think about my time in the Naval \n     Reserve and relate it to my work as Chairman of the House \n     National Security Committee. I use those experiences in \n     looking for ways to do what is best for our men and women in \n     uniform and for our National Security. To be recognized as I \n     mark my first anniversary as Chairman, this award really \n     means a lot to me.\n       A Chairman of a Committee, in either the House or the \n     Senate, is only as good as the people that he serves with. \n     Over my 25 years in the House, I have had the privilege of \n     serving with some of the finest Members that the United \n     States Congress has seen. And, although my dear friend and \n     colleague from Mississippi could not be here tonight, due to \n     back surgery, I would like to take a moment to recognize \n     Sonny Montgomery for his infinite support for our veterans, \n     and our Reserve and National Guard programs.\n       Sonny will be retiring at the end of this term after 30 \n     years in the House. But, we, his family of veterans, \n     Reservists and members of the National Guard, can all take \n     comfort in knowing that the Congress is a better place due to \n     his service. I do not need to say any more. I am certain that \n     because of Sonny Montgomery, either you or someone that you \n     know was able to go to college through the Montgomery GI \n     Bill. I will be sure to pass along your warm greeting to \n     Sonny.\n       I am sometimes accused of being too supportive of the \n     military. To my accusers, I say that it is impossible to be \n     too supportive of the military that helped this country to \n     gain and keep its freedom. When I was appointed Chairman, \n     last year, my first proposal was to change the Department of \n     Defense's name to the Department of Offense. When people \n     quote scripture to me, it is often from Isaiah and references \n     the beating of swords into plowshares. My immediate response \n     is to quote Joel 3:9--``wake up mighty men and beat \n     plowshares into swords and pruning hooks into spears.''\n       Article 1, Section 8, of the Constitution gives the \n     Congress the responsibility of providing for the defense of \n     our Nation. We have conducted a survey of the status of our \n     defense, which concludes that defense spending has been cut \n     too deeply and that the President's defense plan underfunds \n     the Bottom-Up Review force structure and the overall National \n     Military Strategy for two major regional contingencies.\n       In my 25 years on the Hill, I have seen leaders come and \n     go; budget fights won and lost; and changes in threat, \n     weapons systems and strategies, and even a ``hollow'' \n     military. I have seen hot wars, cold wars, contingency, \n     peacekeeping and even peace enforcement operations; yet, I \n     have never been more concerned about the state of our \n     National Security than I am now.\n       Unlike during the Cold War, when the consensus on the \n     threat generally dictated our national strategy, forces, \n     budgets and weapon systems decisions, there is no consensus \n     on the threat to our national interest in the post-Cold War \n     world, as we cannot see the threat. As the former Director of \n     the CIA testified several years ago, in the post-Cold War \n     world it is as if a mighty dragon had been slayed and the \n     result is a jungle full of deadly snakes.\n       In this new environment, we still face weapons of mass \n     destruction, low technology and inexpensive delivery systems. \n     We still face a growing range of nationalist, ethnic and \n     religious conflicts that transcend traditional borders. The \n     only people who have seen the end of war are the dead \n     themselves. Whether or not this country will next go to war \n     is not a question of ``if'' but a question of ``when.''\n       Yet, we have cut back too severely over the last decade. \n     For example, over the last decade of declining defense \n     budgets, we have cut back dramatically on modernization \n     spending--procurement spending by 70 percent and research and \n     development spending by 20 percent. As a consequence, there \n     will be a dramatic modernization shortfall beginning early in \n     the next century.\n       As for force structure, just since the end of Desert Storm, \n     we have cut back: active duty force structure by almost 30 \n     percent, Army divisions by 30 percent, combat ships by 32 \n     percent, and warplanes by 36 percent. Currently, many experts \n     doubt that we could conduct another campaign like we did in \n     the Persian Gulf in 1991.\n       One year ago, in an effort to begin revitalizing our \n     National Security, the Chairman of the National Security \n     Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, Bill Young, and \n     I worked with the Republican Leadership to stop the \n     ``hemorrhaging,'' to freeze defense spending and to end the \n     decline. We managed to reach an agreement to add \n     approximately $30 billion to defense over the next 7 years.\n       The defense authorization Conference Report, that the House \n     adopted earlier today, reflects this additional funding, as \n     well as our focus on four basic priorities: improving \n     military quality of life, sustaining core readiness, \n     reinvigorating lagging modernization programs, and beginning \n     long overdue reform of The Pentagon. As this group knows, our \n     Reserves will be critical to this revitalized United States \n     National Security posture.\n       I am sure that you are aware that Congressman Greg Laughlin \n     is working to ensure that the Reserves are an integral part \n     of that National Security posture. As sponsor of the \n     ``Reserve Forces Revitalization Act of 1995,'' Greg has \n     introduced legislation that, if passed in its present form, \n     will result in many substantive changes in the way that the \n     Reserve components are organized and administered.\n       As a retired Naval Reservist, I am acutely aware of the \n     challenges and sacrifices that you face. The ``Reserve Forces \n     Revitalization Act of 1995'' is intended to address many of \n     the administrative and organizational inefficiencies that \n     have developed in Reserve programs, and it is designed to \n     reinforce the ``Total Force Concept.'' As the demands on our \n     active forces are spread thinner than ever across the world, \n     our Committee and The Pentagon are continually looking for \n     ways to increase reliance on the Reserve components of all of \n     the branches of the Armed Services.\n       During the Fiscal Year 1997 authorization cycle, the \n     National Security Committee's Personnel Subcommittee, which \n     is chaired by Congressman Bob Dornan, will conduct hearings \n     on the aspects that fall under the Committee's jurisdiction. \n     But, you do not need to wait until next year. The Fiscal Year \n     1996 Defense Authorization bill, which was passed by the \n     House today by a 287 to 129 vote, has already accomplished a \n     few of the Revitalization Act's objectives. As soon as the \n     President signs the bill, the following programs will become \n     active:\n       Mobilization Income Insurance Program for Ready Reserve \n     members. This new insurance plan is voluntary and will be \n     financed by premiums paid by the participants.\n       Medical and Dental Care for Members of the Selected Reserve \n     for early deploying Army Reserve and National Guard units. \n     The Conference Report also establishes a shared-cost dental \n     insurance program for all members of the Selected Reserve, \n     which will be fully implemented in Fiscal Year 1997.\n       Military Technician Full-Time Support Program. The \n     Committee felt that the Military Technician Full-Time Support \n     Program is essential to Reserve component readiness, and to \n     the Reserve components' ability to relieve active duty units \n     suffering under the duress of consistently high operating \n     tempos. Therefore, the conferees agreed to increase military \n     technician endstrength by 1,400 over the Administration's \n     request and to prohibit reductions below established \n     endstrengths, except for those occurring as a result of force \n     structure changes.\n       Increase in the Number of Members in the Grades of O-4, O-\n     5, and O-6 Authorized to Serve on Active Duty in Support of \n     the Reserves. and\n       Continued Support for the Off-Site Agreement for the Army \n     Reserve and the National Guard.\n       As always, the National Security Committee is fully \n     supportive and will remain fully committed to each of the \n     Reserve components and the National Guard.\n       In closing, I want to thank the members of the Reserve \n     Officers Association for their leadership in Reserve affairs. \n     As Chairman, I look to the ROA for your insight and \n     perspective on all matters relating to the Reserve forces. \n     Thank you for bestowing the honor of being Minuteman of the \n     Year for 1996 upon me. I look forward to working with you as \n     we begin to address the authorization process for the next \n     fiscal year. Thank you. God bless you and our great Country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1075-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1076-S1077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as of the close of business Tuesday, \nFebruary 6, the Federal debt--down to the penny--stood at exactly \n$4,987,288,825,759.77 or $18,930.18 on a per capita basis for every \nman, woman, and child in America.\n\n[[Page S1077]]\n\n\n                           SUSANNE B. WILSON\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to salute Susanne B. \nWilson, who will be honored with the 1995-96 distinguished Tower Award \nby San Jose State University.\n  Since 1972 the Tower Award has been presented to alumni, faculty, and \ncommunity leaders recognizing exceptional and continuous service to San \nJose State and the university community. Continuing the tradition of \nthe award, Susie Wilson is a longstanding leader in Santa Clara Valley \nas a public official--a member of the county board of supervisors and a \nmember of the San Jose City Council--and in her work for numerous \norganizations.\n  Susie's active leadership role at San Jose State University spans \nnearly three decades--first as a student then as a faculty member, and \nnow as a volunteer alumna. She earned her bachelor's degree in \npolitical science in 1976, and later served as a lecturer during the \n1980's. In 1994, she was the first visiting professor in the SJSU \nleader-in-residence program, teaching a senior seminar in the ethical \nissues in politics.\n  Susie was one of the founders of and participants in the Walk for \nWomen of Sparta, which was the largest fundraiser by women for women \nathletes, which raised over $1 million for women's athletic \nscholarships. She has also been active in the Spartan Foundation, a key \nfundraising organization of the San Jose State, and is currently \nserving on the executive committee and board of directors.\n  Susie Wilson built a reputation of leadership as a member of the San \nJose City Council where she served for 6 years, then as a member of the \nCounty of Santa Clara Board of Supervisors. Susie solved problems, \nbrought opposing parties together in compromise, and worked through \nconsensus to prevent political stalemates. It is no surprise that when \nSusie retired from the board she started her own business called \nSOLUTIONS.\n  Susie has continued to be a community leader, lending her insight and \nexpertise to organizations such as the United Way, the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica, and Cambrian Park United Methodist Church, her church of over \n30 years. A champion of social justice, one of her most important \naccomplishments was her success as chair of the YWCA Villa Nueva \nCapital Campaign. Villa Nueva is a 63-family residential housing unit \nfor lower income families which houses transitional and affordable \nhousing, mostly for single parents and their kids. To honor Susie, the \nbuilding was named in her honor when it opened in 1993.

LEON RIEBMAN\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nrecognize one of Pennsylvania's distinguished citizens as he retires \nafter 60 years of service to his community and his country. Dr. Leon \nRiebman has served his country as a naval officer, his community as a \nprofessor at the University of Pennsylvania, and our national defense \nneeds as a founder and long-term chief executive officer of AEL \nIndustries, a premier defense electronics organization.\n  As a naval officer during World War II, Dr. Riebman served at the \nNaval Research Laboratory in Washington, where he conducted research in \nthe then-new science of fire control radar systems. Following his Navy \nservice, Dr. Riebman returned to the University of Pennsylvania for \nadvanced studies, and to serve on the staff as a research associate and \ninstructor.\n  Since 1950, when he cofounded AEL Industries, he has been an active \ncontributor to technological advances in the defense electronics \nindustry. Under Dr. Riebman's leadership, AEL Industries has grown \ncontinually to the point where it now employs 1,300 people in \nPennsylvania and five other States.\n  Dr. Riebman's interest in research and development has resulted in 10 \npatents. In 1966, he was named a fellow of the Institute of Electrical \nand Electronic Engineers, and continues to be an active participant \nthrough service on several committees.\n  I am pleased to have this opportunity to recognize the many \naccomplishments of Dr. Leon Riebman and hope my colleagues will join me \nin tribute on the occasion of his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1077-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                READING OF WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is \nacting so quickly on H.R. 1718, a bill to designate the U.S. courthouse \nin Wilkes-Barre, PA as the Max Rosenn United States Courthouse.\n  Max Rosenn is one of our Nation's most eminent jurists and one of \nPennsylvania's outstanding citizens. Judge Rosenn has dedicated his \nlife to serving the people of Wilkes-Barre, Luzerne County, PA, and the \nUnited States. There is no one more deserving of this great honor.\n  Judge Rosenn was born in Luzerne County in 1910 and raised there. \nAfter graduating from Cornell and the University of Pennsylvania Law \nSchool, he returned to Luzerne County to practice law.\n  In 1941, Judge Rosenn began his distinguished career in the service \nof his community and country by becoming an assistant district attorney \nfor Luzerne County. In 1944, he entered on \n\n[[Page S1078]]\nactive duty with the U.S. Army, serving in the judge advocate general's \ncorps in the South Pacific during World War II. After the war, he \nreturned to Luzerne County, where he resumed the private practice of \nlaw and was active in civic and public matters. From 1964 to 1966, he \nserved as a member of the State Welfare Board and in 1966 was appointed \nby Governor Scranton to be Pennsylvania's Secretary of Public Welfare, \nserving until 1967 after being retained in office by Governor Shafer. \nIn 1969, he was appointed to the Pennsylvania Human Relations \nCommission, a post he held when named a Federal judge.\n  Recognizing Max Rosenn's dedication to his community and his State \nand his legal skill, President Nixon nominated him to serve as U.S. \nCircuit Judge for the Third Circuit in 1970. For over 25 years, Judge \nRosenn has been one of this country's most distinguished appellate \njudges. If the hallmarks of justice are fairness and wisdom, then Judge \nRosenn is a leader in achieving justice, as he is widely recognized for \nboth qualities.\n  Naming the U.S. courthouse in Wilkes-Barre after its most famous and \nrespected lawyer and judge is the most fitting tribute I can imagine. I \nam pleased that the Senate is joining with the House and the members of \nthe legal community in Pennsylvania in recognizing Judge Rosenn's \nachievements.\n  I would like to take the opportunity to thank Representative \nKanjorski, who represents Luzerne County, for introducing this bill in \nthe House and seeing it through to passage there, and Senators Chafee \nand Baucus for their willingness to move the bill so quickly in the \nSenate.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is now \nconsidering legislation to improve the transfer of technology from \nFederal laboratories to the private sector. Two related bills are now \nbefore the Senate: First, S. 1164, which I introduced and have been \njoined as a cosponsor by the distinguished Science Subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Burns, and second, the House-passed companion bill, \nH.R. 2196, introduced by the distinguished chairwoman of the House \nTechnology \n\n[[Page S1079]]\nSubcommittee, Representative Connie Morella. House cosponsors include \nScience Committee chairman, Bob Walker, Science Committee ranking \nmember, George Brown, and Technology Subcommittee ranking, member, John \nTanner. We also have consulted closely with the administration on this \nbill.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will now pass H.R. 2196 with small \nperfecting and clarification amendments worked out in consultation with \ninterested Senators. We have worked with the House on these perfecting \namendments, and I hope that the House can pass the amended H.R. 2196 \nwithout further changes, clearing the bill for transmittal to the \nPresident.\n  The title of the House-passed bill is the National Technology \nTransfer and Advancement Act. The Senate title is similar: the \nTechnology Transfer Improvements Act. The two bills are based on \nearlier legislation that Representative Morella and I introduced in the \nlast Congress and which has been thoroughly checked with all interested \nparties. The current legislation makes valuable amendments in existing \nlaw but contains no authorizations or controversial spending proposals. \nIt has bipartisan support here in Congress, and has the support of the \nadministration. The Senate Commerce Committee approved S. 1164 without \nobjection on November 3 of last year. H.R. 2196 passed the House by \nvoice vote on December 12.\n  Mr. President, this is a constructive bill that has earned the \nbipartisan support now evident. The legislation has three main parts. \nFirst, the heart of both bills is legislation that Mrs. Morella and I \nauthored to help improve the transfer of technology from Federal \nlaboratories to the private sector. The Federal Government spends some \n$20 billion a year on its laboratories. They employ some of the finest \nscientists and engineers in the world, have some of the best facilities \nand new technologies. This bill will cut the time and redtape involved \nin creating joint research projects between companies and these Federal \nlaboratories. And that, Mr. President, will help companies in West \nVirginia and all across the country. The country or countries that can \ndevelop and use new technologies most quickly and efficiently will win \nthe markets of the future. This bill will help speed joint research \nprojects, and increase their number, leading to new technologies that \ncompanies can use to produce new products, revitalize existing ones, \nand build markets. And that means more jobs and a more competitive \nAmerica.\n\n  Second, the bill contains important amendments to the Fastener \nQuality Act of 1990, a law which regulates the manufacture and sale of \nhigh-strength bolts and other fasteners used in safety-related \napplications such as motor vehicles, aircraft, and buildings. These \namendments have been championed here in the Senate by Senator Burns, \nand they will reduce the burden of the law on private industry while \nmaintaining public safety.\n  Third, the House version of the bill now before us contains several \nnonspending measures regarding technical agencies and the use of \nprivate-sector technical standards.\n\n\n            background on the technology transfer provisions\n\n  Mr. President, the heart of the legislation, in both the Senate and \nHouse versions, is section 4, which will improve the transfer of \ntechnology from Federal laboratories by giving both laboratories and \nindustrial partners clearer guidelines on the distribution of \nintellectual property rights from inventions resulting from cooperative \nresearch projects.\n  Specifically, the bill amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology \nInnovation Act, which since 1986 has allowed Federal laboratories to \nenter into cooperative research and development agreements [CRADA's] \nwith industry and other collaborating parties. The laboratories can \ncontribute people, facilities, equipment, and ideas, but not funding, \nand the companies contribute people and funding.\n  As I pointed out when I introduced S. 1164 on August 10, even under \nthe current law the CRADA provision has been a success. Hundreds of \nthese agreements have been signed and carried out in recent years, \nmaking expertise and technology that the Federal Government has already \npaid for through its mission-related work available to the wider \neconomy. But we also have seen a problem. Currently, the law provides \nlittle guidance on what intellectual property rights a collaborating \npartner should receive from a CRADA. The current law gives agencies \nvery broad discretion on this matter, which provides flexibility but \nalso means that both companies and laboratory executives must \nlaboriously negotiate patent rights each time they discuss a new CRADA. \nNeither side has much guidance as to what constitutes an appropriate \nagreement regarding intellectual property developed under the CRADA. \nOptions range from assigning full patent title to the company all the \nway to providing the firm with only a nonexclusive license for a narrow \nfield of use.\n\n  In conversations with company executives, we learned that this \nuncertainty--and the time and effort involved in negotiating \nintellectual property from scratch in each CRADA--was often a barrier \nto working with some laboratories. Companies are reluctant to enter \ninto a CRADA, or, equally important, to commit additional resources to \ncommercialize a CRADA invention, unless they have some assurance they \nwill control important patent rights.\n  In 1993, I began working with Congresswoman Morella on possible ways \nto reduce the uncertainty and negotiating burden facing companies, \nwhile still ensuring that the Government interest remains protected. To \nbegin legislative discussion on this matter, I introduced S. 1537 on \nOctober 7, 1993, for myself and Senator DeConcini, then chairman of the \nSenate Patent Subcommittee. That bill would have directed Federal \nlaboratories to assign to the collaborating party--the company--title \nto any intellectual property arising from a CRADA, in exchange for \nreasonable compensation to the laboratory and certain patent \nsafeguards.\n  S. 1537 also contained a second provision--an additional incentive \nfor Federal scientists to report and develop inventions that might have \ncommercial as well as government value. The General Accounting Office \n[GAO] had recommended that Federal inventors receive more of the \nroyalties received by laboratories as government compensation under \nCRADA's. My bill incorporated that recommendation.\n  Soon after Senator DeConcini and I introduced our bill, Congresswoman \nMorella introduced the companion House bill, H.R. 3590. In subsequent \nHouse and Senate hearings, the bill received strong support from \nindustry, professional societies, trade associations, and the \nadministration. At that point, we also began working closely with \nCommerce Department Under Secretary for Technology Mary Good and her \nstaff, who helped us obtain detailed technical suggestions from \nexecutive branch agencies and other patent experts. We made major \nprogress during the 103d Congress, but in 1994 ran out of time to \ncomplete action on the legislation.\n\n\n           TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER PROVISIONS OF THE CURRENT BILL\n\n  The bills that Representative Morella and I introduced this year are \nbased on this earlier legislation but also reflect suggestions made by \nthe experts. The revised bill continues to focus on the twin issues of \ncompany rights under a CRADA and royalty-sharing for Federal inventors.\n\n  The key CRADA provision of H.R. 2196--as well as S. 1164--is section \n4, which amends section 12 of the Stevenson-Wydler Act. Those section \n12 amendments, in turn, have two key provisions. One deals with \ninventions made, pursuant to a CRADA, solely by the collaborating \nparty's employee. In this case, the laboratory shall ensure that the \ncollaborating party may retain title to that invention. The rationale, \nof course, is that since the collaborating party's employee is solely \nresponsible for the invention, the collaborating party should have the \nright of title.\n  The other key section 12 amendment concerns inventions developed in \nwhole or in part by a laboratory employee under a CRADA. The current \nbill would give a collaborating party a statutory option to choose an \nexclusive license for a field of use for any such invention. Agencies \nmay still assign full patent title for such inventions to the company; \nthe agencies we consulted \n\n[[Page S1080]]\nfelt they needed to retain that flexibility, and our new bill allows \nthem to do so. But the important point is that a company will now know \nthat it is assured of having no less than an exclusive license in a \nfield of use identified through negotiations between the laboratory and \nthe company. This statutory guideline will give companies real \nassurance that they will get important intellectual property out of any \nCRADA they fund. In turn, that assurance will give those companies both \nan extra incentive to enter into a CRADA and the knowledge that they \ncan safely invest further in the commercialization of that invention, \nknowing they have an exclusive claim on it.\n  Senators Domenici and Bingaman have raised an important point about \nthis provision. They and I agree that the relevant field of use for \nwhich a collaborating party has the option of an exclusive license \nshall be selected through a process of negotiation between the \nlaboratory and that collaborating party. As with other provisions of a \nCRADA, the field of use is selected through a process of negotiation \nbetween the two parties. It is a pre-negotiated field of use. As I will \ndiscuss below, we propose a perfecting amendment to clarify this key \npoint.\n  The bill further provides that in return for granting the option of \nan exclusive license in that pre-negotiated field of use, the \nGovernment may negotiate for reasonable compensation, such as \nroyalties. And the Government retains minimal rights to use the \ninvention under unusual but important circumstances, such as when the \nparty holding the exclusive license is unwilling or unable to use the \ninvention to meet important health and safety needs. However, and I \nwant to emphasize this point, we believe strongly that the Government \nshould exercise these rights only under the most exceptional \ncircumstances. As the distinguished Senators from New Mexico have \npointed out, we do not want the existence of these Government rights to \ndeter companies from entering into CRADA's. And I want to assure these \nSenators and industry that these rights would only be used under the \nmost exceptional circumstances. For that reason, as I will discuss \nshortly, I propose a further perfecting amendment to make this point \neven more clear.\n\n  A related point deals with one of the grounds under which the \nGovernment might exercise these rights. We mention that one such \ncircumstance would be that ``the collaborating party has failed to \ncomply with an agreement containing provisions described in subsection \n(c)(4)(B)'' of the existing section 12 of the Stevenson-Wydler Act. \nSubsection (c)(4)(B) says, in part that a laboratory director in \ndeciding what CRADA's to enter into shall ``give preference to business \nunits located in the United States which agree that products embodying \ninventions made under the cooperative research and development \nagreement or produced through the use of such inventions will be \nmanufactured substantially in the United States.* * *''\n  I want to emphasize two points about this provision and its role in \nthe new language giving the Government, under exceptional \ncircumstances, a right to compel a licensee to share its licensed \ntechnology.\n  First, subsection 12(c)(4)(B) of the Stevenson-Wydler Act directs \nlaboratory directors to give preference to those organizations which \nagree to this condition but is flexible enough to envision \ncircumstances where this condition is not practical or appropriate. One \nexample might be the case of a research technique or process that in \nitself is not used to make products. Or in the case of biotechnology, \none might create and license a gene therapy technique which leads to no \nmanufactured product. So this subsection was never intended to require \na substantial U.S. manufacturing agreement in all CRADA's. The second \npoint follows from the first. The absence of such an agreement in a \nparticular CRADA in no way creates grounds for the Government to \nexercise the new exceptional circumstances powers. The new language \nsimply says that if, and only if, a collaborating party voluntarily \nincludes a substantial U.S. manufacturing agreement in its CRADA, and \nalso if it then fails in a truly exceptional manner to comply with that \nagreement, then grounds exist for the Government to exercise these new \npowers. This new provision provides important protection for the \ntaxpayer in the case of that very rare collaborating party which abuses \nits exclusive license, but it, by definition, does not apply to CRADA's \nwhich do not include an agreement regarding substantial U.S. \nmanufacturing.\n  I also want to mention that in order to give a collaborating party \nfull due process in the event that the Government ever decides to \nexercise any of these exceptional circumstances powers, we are offering \nanother perfecting amendment to give collaborating parties a right of \nadministrative and judicial appeal which already exists in one other \nprovision of Federal patent law. I will discuss that amendment, as well \nas the others I have mentioned, in the later part of my statement which \ndeals with the amendments we are offering today.\n\n  Overall, Mr. President, the bill now before the Senate continues the \noriginal purpose we envisioned in 1993--providing guidelines that \nsimplify the negotiation of CRADA's and, in the process, give companies \ngreater assurance they will share in the benefits of the research they \nfund. We expect that this change will increase the number of CRADA's, \nreduce the time and effort required to negotiate them, and thus speed \nthe transfer of laboratory technology and know-how to the broader \neconomy.\n  The legislation now before the Senate also contains a slightly \nrevised version of the provision regarding royalty-sharing for Federal \ninvestors. Under the new bill, agencies each year must pay a Federal \ninventor the first $2,000 in royalties received because of that \nperson's inventions, plus at least 15 percent of any additional annual \nroyalties. By rewarding Federal inventors, we will give them an \nincentive to report inventions and work in CRADA's. The bill involves \nno Federal spending; all rewards would be from royalties paid to the \nGovernment by companies and others.\n\n\n                    fastener quality act amendments\n\n  Mr. President, the second major provision of the bill now before us \nis a set of amendments to the Fastener Quality Act of 1990. That act \nregulates the manufacture and distribution of certain high-strength \nbolts and other fasteners used in safety-related applications, such as \nbuilding, aircraft, and motor vehicles.\n  The Fastener Advisory Committee created under the 1990 law has \nrecommended a series of changes which will continue to ensure the \nsafety of these high-strength fasteners while reducing the regulatory \nburden on business. The Senate first passed these amendments in March \n1994 as part of a larger technology bill. That 1994 bill did not become \nlaw, however, so this year in the Commerce Committee, Senator Burns, \nwho is the Senate leader on this matter, offered these changes as an \namendment to S. 1164. The same amendments were included in H.R. 2196. \nThese changes have been worked out with a very broad set of interested \nparties, including major users of fasteners, and I know of no \ncontroversy in the Senate regarding them.\n\n\n                     other provisions in h.r. 2196\n\n  Finally, the House version of the legislation also contains a set of \nnonspending amendments regarding NIST operations and voluntary industry \nstandards. While these amendments are not currently in S. 1164, they \ndid not lead to any controversy on the House floor.\n  One such provision, section 9, is intended to make it easier for \nFederal laboratories to loan, lease, or donate excess research \nequipment to educational institutions and nonprofit organizations. As I \nwill explain shortly, I will shortly propose a perfecting amendment and \ncolloquy pertaining to section 9.\n  Another provision, section 12(d), would codify an existing Office of \nManagement and Budget circular, OMB Circular A-119. Following the OMB \ncircular, the amendment directs Federal agencies to use, to the extent \nnot inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical, \ntechnical standards that are developed or adopted by voluntary \nconsensus standards organizations. We believe this step will reduce \ncosts for both government and the private sector. For example, if off-\nthe-shelf products meeting a voluntary consensus standards can, in the \njudgment of an Agency, meet its procurement requirements, then the \nAgency \n\n[[Page S1081]]\nsaves money over buying products built to special government \nspecifications and commercial industry benefits from increased sales to \nthe Government.\n  I will shortly discuss the several perfecting amendments that we are \nnow offering to this bill, but here I want to mention that one of these \namendments clarifies the intent and scope of section 12(d). We have \nworked closely with Senators Baucus and Johnston, and their staffs, on \nthis rewrite. And here, based on our discussions with these offices, I \nwant to emphasize five key points about the intent and effect of this \nprovision, as amended, in order to deal with concerns that have been \nraised.\n  First, we are talking here about technical standards pertaining to \nproducts and processes, such as the size, strength, or technical \nperformance of a product, process, or material. The amended version of \nsection 12(d) explicitly defines the term ``technical standards'' as \nmeaning performance-based or design-specific technical specifications \nand related management systems practices. An example of a management \nsystem practice standard is the ISO 9000 series of standards specifying \nprocedures for maintaining quality assurance in manufacturing.\n  In this subsection, we are emphatically not talking about requiring \nor encouraging any agency to follow private sector attempts to set \nregulatory standards or requirements. For example, we do not intend for \nthe Government to have to follow any attempts by private standards \nbodies to set specific environmental regulations. Regular consensus \nstandards bodies do not do that, in any case. But no one should presume \nthat a new private group could use section 12(d) to dictate regulations \nto Federal agencies. The amended version of this subsection makes clear \nthat agencies and departments use ``such technical standards as a means \nto carry out policy objectives or activities determined by the agencies \nand departments.''\n\n  Second, consensus standards are standards which are developed by \nvoluntary, private sector, consensus standards bodies. These \norganizations are established explicitly for the purpose of developing \nsuch standards through a process having three characteristics--First, \nopenness, defined as meaning that participation in the standards \ndevelopment process shall be open to all persons who are directly and \nmaterially affected by the activity in question; second, balance of \ninterest, which means that the consensus body responsible for the \ndevelopment of a standard shall be comprised of representatives of all \ncategories of interest that relate to the subject--for example, \nmanufacturer, user, regulatory, insurance/inspection, employee/union \ninterest); and third, due process, which means a procedure by which any \nindividual or organization who believes that an action or inaction of a \nthird party causes unreasonable hardship or potential harm is provided \nthe opportunity to have a fair hearing of their concerns. In short, a \nlegitimate consensus standards organization provides open process in \nwhich all parties and experts have ample opportunity to participate in \ndeveloping the consensus.\n  Examples include traditional standards organizations, such as the \nAmerican Society of Testing and Materials, as well as newer \norganizations such as the Internet Engineering Task Force which has \neffectively used consensus procedures coupled with real-time \nimplementation and testing to develop the technical standards for \nInternet protocols and technology. Many of these standards development \norganizations are accredited, including those accredited by the \nAmerican National Standards Institute.\n  This provision is not intended to direct agencies and departments to \nconsider standards from organizations that do not meet the criteria of \nopenness, balance of interest, and due process.\n  Third, the amended version of section 12(d) makes clear that if \ncompliance with the requirement to use voluntary consensus technical \nstandards ``is inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise \nimpractical, a Federal agency or department may elect to use technical \nstandards that are not developed or adopted by voluntary consensus \nstandards bodies.'' We intend that these other technical standards may \nbe ones developed by the Agency or such other standards as the Agency \nmay deem appropriate.\n  Fourth, we intend that the determination of what is or is not \n``inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical'' is solely \nthe decision of the agency department involved. We do require that if \nan agency or department does elect to use other technical standards, \nthey notify the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]. But if an Agency \ndecides that no product or process based on voluntary consensus \nstandards meets its requirements, it does not have to get approval from \nanyone before it sets its own specifications. It most certainly does \nnot need approval from any private sector standards organization. \nMoreover, the provision neither provides nor implies any private sector \nveto or review of the agency's decision. Nor does it provide, nor do we \nintend to provide, any legal test or legal standard or decisionmaking \nrequirement that an agency must meet before it decides which types of \ntechnical standards to choose. As a result, section 12(d) provides no \nnew or additional basis for either administrative or judicial review.\n  In other words, the intent of section 12(d) is exactly that of the \nfollowing provision of OMB Circular A-119: It should also be noted, \nhowever, that the provisions of this circular are intended for internal \nmanagement purposes only and are not intended to: First, create delay \nin the administrative process; second, provide new grounds for judicial \nreview; or third, create legal rights enforceable against agencies or \ntheir officers.\n  Fifth and finally, the term ``Federal agencies and departments'' is \nmeant to refer to entities of the executive branch, and not to \nindependent regulatory commissions. Commissions may have their own \nseparate statutory requirements regarding whether or not to use \nconsensus technical standards; one such example is the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission [CPSC]. I want to emphasize that section 12(d) is not \nintended to apply to the CPSC or other independent regulatory \ncommissions.\n\n\n                    additional perfecting amendments\n\n  Mr. President, conversations with interested Senators have led me, \nafter consultation with Chairman Burns, to offer six other small \nperfecting amendments that clarify key provisions of the bill. I want \nto mention them briefly, as well as thank the relevant Senators for \nworking with us on these issues.\n  First, as discussed earlier, we propose to clarify that the field of \nuse for which a collaborating party may get an exclusive license is a \npre-negotiated field of use. That is, the company alone does not pick \nthe field of use. Like other provisions of CRADA, the field or fields \nof use for which a license applies is the result of negotiations \nbetween the company and the laboratory. This has been the intent all \nalong of both the Senate and House sponsors of this legislation, as \nreflected in both House and Senate report language. However, Senator \nDomenici has asked that we make this point explicit in the bill \nlanguage itself, and I am happy to do so.\n\n  Second, as also discussed earlier, we want to make clear that an \nAgency will exercise its rights under the bill to require the holder of \nan exclusive technology to share that technology only in exceptional \ncircumstances. Senators Bingaman and Domenici have requested this \nclarification, and I am pleased to do so because this has been our \nintent all along. We know that there may be some exceptional, and very \nrare, circumstances under which the holder of an exclusive license is \nnot willing or able to use an important technology or use it as \nprovided in the original CRADA agreement. We feel strongly that the \nGovernment must maintain some rights to deal with such a situation, but \nagree with our distinguished colleagues that these rights should be \nexercised only under the most exceptional circumstances. We do not want \nprospective CRADA participants to feel that the Government will \nexercise these rights on a routine or arbitrary basis.\n  Third, Senator Johnston has asked that a provision from other Federal \npatent law--the Bayh-Dole Act--be added to our bill's section regarding \nthe exceptional circumstances under which the Government may exercise \nits right to require a collaborating party, \n\n[[Page S1082]]\nholding an exclusive license to an invention made in whole or in part \nby a laboratory employee, to grant a license to a responsible \napplicant. That provision from the Bayh-Dole is section 203(2) of title \n35, United States Code, and as added here it would provide a \ncollaborating party under these exceptional circumstances a right to an \nadministrative appeal, as described under 37 CFR part 401, and to \njudicial review. In short, if the Government determines that it has \ngrounds to force a collaborating party to grant a license to additional \nparty, according to the criteria set forth in the bill, then that \ncollaborating party will have a right of due process and appeal.\n  Fourth, Senator Glenn, in his capacity as ranking member of the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs, has raised a point concerning \nsection 9's provisions on the disposal of excess laboratory research \nequipment. We delete one part of section 9 and plan to enter into a \ncolloquy with the distinguished Senator from Ohio regarding the \nprocedures under which Federal laboratories may loan or lease research \nequipment.\n  Fifth, the date on which a report required under section 12(c) is due \nis changed from January 1, 1996, to within 90 days of the date of \nenactment of this act.\n  A final amendment clarifies section 12(b), a provision which deals \nwith the role of the National Institute of Standards and Technology \n[NIST] in coordinating government standards activities. The amendment \ncorrects a small drafting error. The original text, in part, implies \nthat NIST is to coordinate private sector standards and conformity \nassessment activities. Of course, we in no way intend that NIST or any \nother part of the Federal Government is to coordinate, direct, or \nsupervise private sector activities. The amendment makes clear that \nNIST is to coordinate with private sector activities.\n\n  I thank Senators Glenn, Domenici, Bingaman, Johnston, and Baucus, and \ntheir staffs, for working with us on these perfecting amendments.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, this bill is a concrete step toward making our \nGovernment's huge investment in science and technology more useful to \ncommercial companies and our economy. Companies in West Virginia and \nother States will not find it easier to partner with Federal \nlaboratories across the country. The winner will be the American \neconomy, which will get more economic benefit out of the billions of \ndollars we invest each year in our Government laboratories. The result \nwill be new technologies, new products, and new jobs for Americans.\n  In closing, I want to thank and compliment my good friends, \nRepresentative Morella and Senator Burns, for their great leadership on \nthis legislation. I also want to thank their staffs, the staffs for \nCongressmen Brown and Tanner, and Chairman Pressler's staff for their \nhard work. Special thanks also goes to Under Secretary of Commerce Mary \nLowe Good and her staff, particularly Chief Counsel Mark Bohannon, for \ntheir work in reviewing the legislation and working with other Federal \nagencies. Numerous technical experts helped us with the legislation, \nand I thank them. I also want to thank Dr. Thomas Forbord, who as a \ncongressional fellow on my staff several years ago drafted the first \nversion of this valuable legislation.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill that will benefit companies in \nWest Virginia, Montana, Maryland, and all other States. It will help \nspeed the creation of new technologies, will help make American \ncompanies more competitive, and will help create and retain good \nAmerican jobs.\n  I urge our colleagues to accept the House-passed version, H.R. 2196, \nwith these minor perfecting amendments, and return the bill to the \nHouse so that they may concur in these minor changes and send the \nlegislation on the President for his signature.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2196, as amended, \nwhich is a bill to amend the Stevenson-Wylder Technology Innovation Act \nof 1980. The Senate version of this bill, S. 1164, was reported out of \nthe Commerce Committee in November of last year. Our system of more \nthan 700 Federal laboratories is one of our most precious national \nassets. These labs conduct important research and development programs \nto keep the United States on the cutting edge of science and \ntechnology.\n  As chairman of the Science Subcommittee, I cosponsored S. 1164 to \nhelp accelerate the transfer of technology from our 700 Federal labs to \nthe private industry, where it can be converted into commercial goods \nand services for the American people. Our cooperative research and \ndevelopment agreements [CRADA's] have proven a very effective way of \naccomplishing technology transfer without increasing Federal spending. \nThese CRADA's enable Government and industry to conduct research \ntogether which hopefully will generate inventions and technological \nbreakthroughs that can be later commercialized. It is the national \ninterest to encourage more of this kind of joint research.\n  With that in mind, this bill seeks to encourage more joint research \nby clarifying the intellectual property rights that the industry \npartner may receive in inventions generated by the joint research. In \nthis way, the company knows going into the arrangement that it will \nhave the right to commercialize the results of its joint research. The \nbill also makes clear that, in exchange for the rights given to the \ncompany, the Government is entitled to reasonable compensation, which \nwould typically involve a share of the royalties from any successful \ncommercialization efforts. So, both the Federal labs and their private \nsector partners in these agreements stand to benefit from this \nlegislation.\n  Equally important, the bill provides greater incentives for the \nFederal lab scientists to commercialize their inventions by increasing \ntheir share of any royalties received from the sale of products arising \nfrom the joint research.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that this bill, as amended, is \nsupported by industry, the Federal lab directors, and the research \ncommunity and has broad bipartisan support in Congress. I urge my \ncolleagues to support H.R. 2196 as amended pass it.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Senator from \nWest Virginia and the Senator from Montana in a colloquy to clarify \ntheir intentions under section 9 of the pending bill. As currently \ndrafted, section 9 would expand Federal laboratory directors' authority \nto dispose of research equipment by allowing them to loan or lease this \nproperty. Under existing law, this property may already be given to \neligible institutions outright as a gift.\n  I would begin by thanking the chairman and ranking member of the \ncommittee for agreeing with me that the original language in this \nsection was overbroad. I very much appreciate their willingness to \namend the House bill.\n  With regard to the remaining loan and lease provision, I would like \nto clarify the committee's intent with respect to the continuing \nFederal liability and responsibility for leased or loaned equipment. \nWhat steps does the committee envision Federal agencies should take in \norder to limit the taxpayer's liability for such equipment?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his \ninterest in this matter, and I respect his judgment on these issues. To \nanswer his question, it is this Senator's intent that, prior to any \nequipment being leased or loaned under this provision, a Federal agency \nshall issue guidance which clearly states the steps a lab director or \nagency head shall take in order to clearly define the Federal \nGovernment's liability and responsibility with respect to the leased or \nloaned property. Such guidance should address issues like: The ongoing \nFederal obligation to maintain or upgrade the leased equipment; the \nnecessary steps to adequately train the recipient in the safe and \nproper use of the equipment; the appropriate inventory controls needed \nto track the equipment which both the lab and the recipient institution \nshould have in place; and whether any financial issues, such as \nequipment depreciation, should be considered in the lease-loan \nagreement.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I agree with the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I thank my friends from Montana and West \nVirginia for their clarification of this matter. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with them to strengthen our Nation's science and \nmath education infrastructure.\n\n[[Page S1083]]\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I am most pleased to join with the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs in \nintroducing, by request, legislation intended to reform the operation \nof VA's health care program. This legislation places into statutory \nlanguage the eligibility reform proposal of the many veterans' service \norganizations who each year prepare and submit to the Congress the so \ncalled independent budget.\n  The successful operation of the VA health care system has become one \nof the most pressing issues faced by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs \nand the Congress. Many observers feel that changing the current \npriorities for health care is the certain key to resolving the problems \nfaced by both VA and the veterans it serves. The proposal we introduce \ntoday is one of at least five different proposals before the Congress \nand introduction of this legislation should be viewed as neither \nendorsement nor opposition to this specific proposal. I join in \nintroduction of the legislation in order to put before the Congress \nboth the proposal and the ideas upon which it is based. I plan to chair \ncommittee hearings on the issue later this spring. Both the committee's \nhearings and legislative process will be much improved if we can view \nthis proposal in legislative format.\n  As a life member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, one of the \norganizations that has prepared the proposal, I understand how \nimportant this issue is to America's veterans, the Congress, to the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and to the American people who must \nfund whatever decision is reached by the Congress.\n  I thank my fine personal friend from West Virginia for the \nconstructive and active role that he played as chairman of the \nVeterans' Committee and continues to play as ranking minority member. \nHe has been most helpful and courteous to me. I always look forward to \nworking with him and the members of the committee as we work together \nto address the difficult questions we face concerning veterans' health \ncare and the future structure of the Veterans Health \nAdministration.\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking Democrat on the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am delighted to join today with the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Simpson, in introducing legislation \nthat would reform eligibility for VA health care. We are doing so at \nthe request of the four veterans service organizations--AMVETS, \nDisabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Veterans \nof Foreign Wars--that develop the so-called independent budget [IB].\n  While it was my policy, as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, to introduce legislation proposed by the administration so \nthat my colleagues and others with an interest would have specific \nbills to which they might direct their attention and comments, I have \nnot done that for entities other than the administration. Senator \nSimpson has followed a similar policy in his two terms as the \ncommittee's chairman. However, in this instance, we have agreed to \nintroduce this legislation so that it might be before the committee \nlater in this session when we take up the issue of the reform of the \ncurrent eligibility criteria for VA health care.\n  In introducing administration-requested legislation, we always \nreserved the right to support the provisions of, as well as any \namendment to, such by-request legislation. Obviously, that same policy \napplies to the bill we are introducing today.\n  While I have been working with representatives of the IB group for \nmany months in an effort to translate the group's narrative description \nof proposed eligibility reform into legislative language, I have done \nso without in any way endorsing the result. I intend to wait to support \nany specific eligibility reform legislation until after the committee \nhas held hearings and the many issues connected with this subject have \nbeen explored in some depth and detail.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 1564. A bill to amend the Small Reclamation Projects Act of 1956 \nto authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide loan guarantees \nfor water supply, conservation, quality and transmission projects, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  S. 1565. A bill to supplement the Small Reclamation Projects Act of \n1956 and to supplement the Federal Reclamation laws by providing for \nFederal cooperation in non-Federal projects and for participation by \nnon-Federal \n\n[[Page S1084]]\nagencies in Federal projects; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n     small reclamation projects act of 1956 amendments legislation\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I introduce two measures to expand \nthe use and availability of the Small Reclamation Projects Act of 1956.\n  The Small Reclamation Projects Act has provided important benefits \nthroughout the reclamation West in the 40 years since it was first \nestablished. Over the past several years, there have been various \ndiscussions of ways to expand the benefits of the program. These two \nmeasures incorporate some of the suggestions that have been made. I \nwant to emphasize that neither of the measures would affect ongoing \nprojects.\n  One of the measures deals with financing. At the present time, the \nSecretary is limited to using grants or loans in fulfilling the \nobjectives of the act. This legislation would expand that authority to \ninclude the use of loan guarantees as a way of stretching the limited \nFederal resources. There has been some discussion among those \nsuggesting this approach that the committee should consider expanding \nthe program under the guarantees outside the 17 reclamation States to \nother States and the territories. While I do not dispute that the \nadvantages of the program could be useful in the territories and other \nStates, I do not want to dilute the program so that is not able to meet \nthe very real needs in the arid West. Therefore, I have not included \nsuch an expansion in this legislation. I do agree that it is a subject \nworth discussing and it should be one of the subjects of our hearings.\n  The other measure is essentially a rewrite of the existing statute to \nexpand the purposes for which assistance can be received from the \nFederal Government. Irrigation remains an authorized purpose, but it \nwould no longer be a required component. The purposes would not include \nthe augmentation and management of local water supplies, conservation \nof water and energy, fish and wildlife conservation, supplemental water \nfor existing supplies, water quality improvements, and flood control. \nThere had been some discussion about the application of interest on any \nallocable irrigation component, and I would support discussing this in \nany hearings. For the moment, however, I have limited the application \nof interest on any loans to those features which are currently \nreimbursable with interest under reclamation law.\n  I also believe that we should explore in our hearings exactly how to \ndeal with investments that further particular Federal objectives, such \nas fish and wildlife enhancement or other features that are normally \nnonreimbursable.\n  Mr. President, neither of these measures should be viewed as a final \nproduct, and they are not mutually exclusive. Given the timing, I \nthought it would be useful to have both measures introduced so that \nthey could be reviewed by the States and water users as well as by the \nadministration and other interested parties with sufficient time to \npermit Congress to consider the concepts this session. While I am not \nprepared to announce a schedule of hearings at this time, I do want to \nindicate to my colleagues that I do intend to have the Subcommittee on \nForests and Public Land Management of the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources conduct hearings early this year.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 1566. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for the vessel Marsh Grass Too; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                     trading privileges legislation\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to direct \nthat the vessel Marsh Grass Too, hull identification number \nAUKEV51139K690, be accorded coastwise trading privileges and be issued \na certificate of documentation under section 12103 of title 46, U.S. \nCode.\n  The Marsh Grass Too was recently constructed in Australia and is a \ncatamaran intended for use as a recreational vessel. The vessel is 28 \nfeet in length, capable of accommodating 12 people, and is self-\npropelled.\n  The vessel is owned by Marsha Hass of South Carolina. Ms. Hass would \nlike to utilize her vessel in the coastwise trade and fisheries of the \nUnited States. However, because the vessel was built in a foreign \nshipyard, it does not meet the requirements for coastwise license \nendorsement in the United States. The Marsh Grass Too is a catamaran, a \nvessel U.S. shipbuilders do not normally build. This particular vessel \nis built of kevlar, a product of DuPont, and would be imported into the \nUnited States as a bare hull. All motors, electronics, and accessories \nwill be purchased and installed in the United States. Coastwise \ndocumentation is mandatory to enable the owner to use the vessel for \nits intended purpose.\n  The owner of the Marsh Grass Too is seeking a waiver of the existing \nlaw because she wishes to use the vessel for recreational charters. Her \ndesired intentions for the vessel's use will not adversely affect the \ncoastwise trade in U.S. waters. If she is granted this waiver, it is \nher intention to comply fully with U.S. documentation and safety \nrequirements. The purpose of the legislation I am introducing is to \nallow the Marsh Grass Too to engage in the coastwise trade and the \nfisheries of the United States.\n\n

UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. INOUYE submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 41\n\n       Whereas on February 9, 1821, the United States Congress \n     chartered Columbian College (renamed The George Washington \n     University in 1904);\n       Whereas President James Monroe signed The George Washington \n     University's charter and attended the University's historic \n     first commencement ceremony;\n       Whereas Congress adjourned to join President Monroe for The \n     George Washington University's first commencement ceremony;\n       Whereas in 1825 The George Washington University added a \n     medical curriculum with facilities that throughout the \n     following years have contributed greatly to the Nation, \n     including conversion of its teaching infirmary into a \n     military hospital during the Civil War;\n       Whereas from that time forward, The George Washington \n     University's medical facilities have provided treatment to \n     patients ranging from kings and presidents to the indigent \n     and the homeless;\n       Whereas The George Washington University has in its 175 \n     years contributed to the educational, cultural, and political \n     enrichment of the Nation through its synergistic associations \n     with the Federal establishment and its branches and agencies;\n       Whereas The George Washington University is now the largest \n     higher education institution in the Nation's capital, \n     providing educational services to some 19,000 undergraduate, \n     graduate, and professional students annually;\n       Whereas The George Washington University has rendered \n     continuing and exemplary service to the country through the \n     achievement of its educational mission; and\n       Whereas The George Washington University's distinguished \n     alumni hold prominent positions in business, law, government, \n     medicine, and the arts and sciences: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) The George Washington University has been and continues \n     to be of exceptional importance to the Nation; and\n       (2) the importance of The George Washington University \n     should be recognized and celebrated through regular \n     ceremonies.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about my alma mater, \nthe George Washington University, chartered by the Congress of the \nUnited States 175 years ago, on February 9, 1821.\n  Those of us who have a George Washington University degree--whether \nit be in law, medicine, engineering, education, business, or \ninternational affairs--have reason to celebrate this occasion. What was \nonce merely a university of convenience usefully located in the \nNation's capital, has in our own time taken its place among the premier \ninstitutions of higher learning in the country.\n  Among this illustrious company, few have had such unpromising \nbeginnings. Some universities come into being endowed by land grants or \ncan boast a distinguished founder like a John Harvard or a Thomas \nJefferson. The George Washington University--or Columbian College, as \nit was called when the Congress chartered it in 1821--owed its origins \nto an obscure Baptist clergyman named Luther Rice. Today, 175 years \nlater, it has achieved a name recognition that is international in \nscope, drawing students and scholars from all quarters of the globe. \nThe university takes great pride in its distinguished graduates, among \nthem: John Foster Dulles, J. William Fulbright, Gen. Billy Mitchell, \nGen. Colin Powell, Gen. John Shalikashvili, and Jacqueline Kennedy \nOnassis, to name a few.\n  I had the privilege of receiving my law degree from the George \nWashington University. My experiences during my legal studies were \nlargely responsible for my decision to enter public life and run for \nelective office. I am grateful that I had the opportunities that come \nfrom studying and living in the Nation's capital as a young man.\n  It is with great pleasure that I submit today a resolution in \ncelebration of the 175th anniversary of the George Washington \nUniversity's illustrious role in our Nation's academic and political \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1085-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1085-S1086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SENATE RESOLUTION 225--RELATIVE TO BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA\n\n  Mr. ROBB submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 225\n\n       Whereas units of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, \n     including military trainers and intelligence officers posing \n     as humanitarian relief officials, are still present in \n     Bosnia-Herzegovina;\n       Whereas the presence of the Revolutionary Guards in Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina violates the peace accord initialed in Dayton, \n     Ohio, on November 21, 1995 and the subsequent treaty signed \n     in Paris, France, on December 14, 1995, which provide that \n     all foreign volunteer troops be withdrawn from Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina within 30 days of the signing of the treaty, that \n     is, January 13, 1996;\n       Whereas the commanders of the NATO Implementation Force in \n     Bosnia-Herzegovina consider the activities of the \n     Revolutionary Guards in Bosnia-Herzegovina, including their \n     espousal and promotion of extremist Islamic fundamentalism, \n     to be one of the most direct threats to the safety of United \n     States forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina;\n       Whereas the continued presence of the Revolutionary Guards \n     in Bosnia-Herzegovina threatens long-term stability in the \n     region; and\n       Whereas the continuation of arms shipments from Iran to \n     Bosnia-Herzegovina could preclude the United States from \n     fulfilling its promise of providing military equipment and \n     training to Bosnia-Herzegovina: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should--\n       (1) pursue all measures necessary, including substantial \n     diplomatic pressure on Bosnia-Herzegovina, to expedite the \n     withdrawal from Bosnia-Herzegovina, of all foreign troops \n     whose presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina violates the peace \n     accord initialed in Dayton, Ohio, on November 21, 1995, and \n     the subsequent treaty signed in Paris, France, on December \n     14, 1995;\n       (2) bring in the United Nations a proposal to ban Member \n     States from importing Iranian oil in order to pressure the \n     Iranian Government into withdrawing the Iranian Revolutionary \n     Guards from Bosnia-Herzegovina; and\n       (3) establish within the NATO Implementation Force in \n     Bosnia-Herzegovina a multi-national task force whose mission \n     shall be, if called upon, to locate and ensure the withdrawal \n     of the Revolutionary Guards from Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, under the leadership of Adm. Leighton \nSmith, the NATO Implementation Force has made marked progress in war-\ntorn Bosnia and Herzegovina during the first 2 months of Operation \nJoint Endeavor.\n\n[[Page S1086]]\n\n  As an aside, I should mention that, as a member of all three national \nsecurity committees, including Armed Services, Foreign Relations, and \nIntelligence, I am privy to significant amounts of classified \ninformation related to Bosnia. For the purpose of this open discussion, \nhowever, I will refer solely to information widely available in the \npublic record.\n  The news media report that much has been accomplished so far in \ncoming to terms with the Dayton Peace Agreement:\n  First, with only a few exceptions, the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-\nCroat Federation have observed the cease-fire.\n  Second, the warring parties have stepped back and are today in \nsubstantial compliance with the 4-kilometer zone of separation.\n  Third, the adversaries have removed their heavy weapons to points \nthat pose no apparent of immediate threat to our forces.\n  Fourth, the locations of roughly a quarter of the estimated 3 million \nland mines that plague Bosnia have been identified. Still, this threat \nto security remains one of the most troublesome--as witnessed by the \nfact that more than a dozen IFOR troops have been killed or wounded by \nmines so far.\n  Fifth, freedom of movement along Bosnia's roads is returning to \nnormal, which is a requisite step to allowing hundreds of thousands of \nrefugees to return to their homes.\n  In short, the Implementation Force has taken the necessary first \nsteps for Bosnia and Herzegovina to get back on its feet as a peaceful \ncommunity in this historically war-ravaged region of Europe.\n  But, even with all of these NATO successes, we must also recognize \nthat all has not gone according to plan. In fact, there remains a clear \ndanger to the peacekeepers.\n  Today, according to published news reports, there remains a band of \nabout 200 Iranian revolutionary guards in northern Bosnia, many \napparently in the United States sector. This band of well-trained \nsoldiers in well-named in that they are Iran's primary instrument for \nexporting its Islamic revolution.\n  For more than 3 years, according to the Reuters News Service, these \nrevolutionary guards have served primarily as military advisers and \ncommanders. They reportedly draw their logistical and other support \nfrom Iran's Embassy in Croatia. They have not only been training a \nbrigade of Bosnian Moslems in military doctrine and tactics, they have \nalso been teaching them the tenets of radical, extremist Islamic \nfundamentalism, according to the Washington Post.\n  Moreover, their continued presence is an indication of the Bosnian \nMoslem government's inability to comply with the provision in the \nDayton Peace Agreement that mandates the expulsion of all foreign \nvolunteer fighters in Bosnia. This presence, combined with Iran's \ncriticism of the Dayton Accord as unjust to the Bosnian Moslems, is \ncause for concern. Their presence sounds the same alarm bells that we \nfailed to heed a decade ago in Lebanon, with tragic consequences.\n  Those bells have tolled even louder in the last few days. According \nto the New York Times, an American who uses the names Kevin Holt and \nIsa Abdullah Ali has been sighted in Bosnia. U.S. troops have been \nordered to arrest him as a possible suspect in the 1983 bombing of the \nMarine barracks in Beirut.\n  The Times also reports that the revolutionary guards have increased \ntheir surveillance of U.S. troop activities and are suspected of \nplanning attacks against U.S. targets there. As a result, NATO forces \nwere put on a state of alert on January 23. According to Secretary of \nDefense William Perry, ``We will continue to maintain an alert.''\n  U.S. commanders consider many of the remaining revolutionary guards \nas intelligence agents and terrorists. There is speculation that they \nhope to retaliate against the United States for its Middle East and \nantiterrorism policies and that they further hope to be able to sway \nthe fragile balance of American public opinion on Operation Joint \nEndeavor.\n  When they believe the time is right, they may try to disrupt our \noperations and in turn, undermine the commitment of the North Atlantic \nAlliance to a peaceful settlement of the Balkans conflict.\n  That is why they must not be allowed to remain. At this point, the \npresence of Iran's revolutionary guards is the single most significant, \nnear-term threat to Operation Joint Endeavor and to lasting peace on \nthe Continent. Landmines will no doubt continue to take their toll on \nthe peacekeeping force, but the revolutionary guards appear to have \noffensive, revolutionary intent and that poses a real danger to our \ntroops.\n\n  That is why, today, I have submitted a Senate resolution that calls \nfor the administration to take three distinct actions:\n  First, it urges the administration to continue to exert strong \ndiplomatic pressure on Bosnia and Herzegovina to comply with the \nprovision of the Dayton Accord that states ``all foreign Forces, \nincluding individual advisors, freedom fighters, trainers, volunteers, \nand personnel from neighboring and other States, shall be withdrawn \nfrom the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.'' We must make it clear \nthat, as Secretary of State Warren Christopher has said, neither \nmilitary equipment and training nor economic reconstruction assistance \nis forthcoming until the Bosnian Moslem government is ``in compliance \nwith the agreement.''\n  Second, it urges the President to take to the United Nations the \nissue of Iran's revolutionary guards remaining in Bosnia in defiance of \nthe Dayton Accord. The members of that international body must weigh \nthe evidence and then take the appropriate action: placing an \ninternational embargo on all importation of Iranian oil until that \nnation recalls all of its military personnel stationed in Bosnia.\n  Third, it urges the administration to establish an operational task \nforce from units of the Implementation Force. Should diplomacy and \nsanctions fail, it could be called upon to locate and ensure the \nwithdrawal of the Iranian revolutionary guards from Bosnia. As stated \nin the Dayton Accord, IFOR troops are authorized to use necessary force \nto ensure compliance. The mere presence of a force specifically honed \nto deal with the revolutionary guards should give Iran both pause about \nterrorist actions in Bosnia and further motivation to withdraw them. To \npreclude the possibility of mission creep, any such task force would be \ndeactivated immediately upon completion of the operation.\n  What is at risk if we do not expel the Iranian revolutionary guards \nfrom Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n  First and foremost, the lives of American troops and other NATO \nsoldiers working to secure a lasting peace in Bosnia.\n  At risk is the security of such neighboring nations as Macedonia, \nAlbania, and our NATO allies should the conflict spread further.\n  And at risk is an emerging security architecture for a post-cold-war \nEurope.\n  Mr. President, I hope all of our colleague can support this \nresolution. Together, we must increase pressure on the Bosnian \nGovernment to expel all foreign volunteer soldiers and in particular, \nthose from Iran.

In determining the \n     amount of a civil penalty, the Secretary of Agriculture shall \n     take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and \n     gravity of the violation, the ability of the violator to pay \n     the penalty, the effect that the assessment would have on the \n     ability of the violator to continue to do business, any \n     history of such violations by the violator, the degree of \n     culpability of the violator, and such other matters as \n     justice may require. An order assessing a civil penalty shall \n     be treated as a final order reviewable under chapter 158 of \n     title 28, United State's Code. The Secretary of Agriculture \n     may compromise, modify, or remit a civil penalty with or \n     without conditions. The amount of a civil penalty that is \n     paid (including any amount agreed on in compromise) may be \n     deducted from any sums owing by the United States to the \n     violator. The total amount of civil penalties assessed \n     against a violator shall not exceed $300,000 for all such \n     violations adjudicated in a single proceeding. The validity \n     of an order assessing a civil penalty shall not be subject to \n     review in an action to collect the civil penalty. The unpaid \n     amount of a civil penalty not paid in full when due shall \n     accrue interest at the rate of interest applicable to civil \n     judgments of the courts of the United States.''.\n\n     SEC. 547.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) popcorn is an important food that is a valuable part of \n     the human diet;\n       (2) the production and processing of popcorn plays a \n     significant role in the economy of the United States in that \n     popcorn is processed by several popcorn processors, \n     distributed through wholesale and retail outlets, and \n     consumed by millions of people throughout the United States \n     and foreign countries;\n       (3) popcorn must be of high quality, readily available, \n     handled properly, and marketed efficiently to ensure that the \n     benefits of popcorn are available to the people of the United \n     States;\n       (4) the maintenance and expansion of existing markets and \n     uses and the development of new markets and uses for popcorn \n     are vital to the welfare of processors and persons concerned \n     with marketing, using, and producing popcorn for the market, \n     as well as to the agricultural economy of the United States;\n       (5) the cooperative development, financing, and \n     implementation of a coordinated program of popcorn promotion, \n     research, consumer information, and industry information is \n     necessary to maintain and expand markets for popcorn; and\n       (6) popcorn moves in interstate and foreign commerce, and \n     popcorn that does not move in those channels of commerce \n     directly burdens or affects interstate commerce in popcorn.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of Congress that it is in the \n     public interest to authorize the establishment, through the \n     exercise of the powers provided in this subtitle, of an \n     orderly procedure for developing, financing (through adequate \n     assessments on unpopped popcorn processed domestically), and \n     carrying out an effective, continuous, and coordinated \n     program of promotion, research, consumer information, and \n     industry information designed to--\n       (1) strengthen the position of the popcorn industry in the \n     marketplace; and\n       (2) maintain and expand domestic and foreign markets and \n     uses for popcorn.\n       (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are to--\n       (1) maintain and expand the markets for all popcorn \n     products in a manner that--\n       (A) is not designed to maintain or expand any individual \n     share of a producer or processor of the market;\n       (B) does not compete with or replace individual advertising \n     or promotion efforts designed to promote individual brand \n     name or trade name popcorn products; and\n       (C) authorizes and funds programs that result in government \n     speech promoting government objectives; and\n       (2) establish a nationally coordinated program for popcorn \n     promotion, research, consumer information, and industry \n     information.\n       (d) Statutory Construction.--This subtitle treats \n     processors equitably. Nothing in this subtitle--\n       (1) provides for the imposition of a trade barrier to the \n     entry into the United States of imported popcorn for the \n     domestic market; or\n       (2) provides for the control of production or otherwise \n     limits the right of any individual processor to produce \n     popcorn.\n\n     SEC. 903.

COMMODITY PROMOTION AND EVALUATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is in the national public interest and vital to the \n     welfare of the agricultural economy of the United States to \n     expand and develop markets for agricultural commodities \n     through generic, industry-funded promotion programs;\n       (2) the programs play a unique role in advancing the demand \n     for agricultural commodities, since the programs increase the \n     total market for a product to the benefit of consumers and \n     all producers;\n       (3) the programs complement branded advertising \n     initiatives, which are aimed at increasing the market share \n     of individual competitors;\n       (4) the programs are of particular benefit to small \n     producers, who may lack the resources or market power to \n     advertise on their own;\n       (5) the programs do not impede the branded advertising \n     efforts of individual firms but instead increase market \n     demand by methods that each individual entity would not have \n     the incentive to employ;\n       (6) the programs, paid for by the producers who directly \n     reap the benefits of the programs, provide a unique \n     opportunity for agricultural producers to inform consumers \n     about their products;\n       (7) it is important to ensure that the programs be carried \n     out in an effective and coordinated manner that is designed \n     to strengthen the position of the commodities in the \n     marketplace and to maintain and expand the markets and uses \n     of the commodities; and\n       (8) independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the \n     programs will assist Congress and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture in ensuring that the objectives of the programs \n     are met.\n       (b) Independent Evaluations.--Except as otherwise provided \n     by law, and at such intervals as the Secretary of Agriculture \n     may determine, but not more frequently than every 3 years or \n     3 years after the establishment of a program, the Secretary \n     shall require that each industry-funded generic promotion \n     program authorized by Federal law for an agricultural \n     commodity shall provide for an independent evaluation of the \n     program and the effectiveness of the program.

Mr. President, I strongly support S. 743, the \nCommercial Revitalization Tax Credit Act of 1995 [CRTC] and today I \njoin several of my colleagues in cosponsoring this bill. I commend \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison for her sponsorship of this legislation \ndesigned to encourage business investment in economically distressed \nareas. I also want to commend my Pennsylvania colleague, Representative \nPhil English who has introduced this same legislation in the House. I \nbelieve this measure will help to create jobs and expand economic \nactivity, in addition to improving the physical appearance and property \nvalues in these areas.\n  Earlier in this session, I introduced legislation to replace our \ncurrent cumbersome Tax Code with a simple and efficient 20-percent flat \ntax. My legislation, the Flat Tax Act of 1995 (S. 488) will bring \ntremendous economic growth to all areas of our country, and especially \nour cities by freeing up capital and lowering interest rates. While I \ncontinue to support the principles and necessity of a flat tax, I \nbelieve that in the interim we must proceed with measures such as the \nCommercial Revitalization Tax Credit Act to bring economic growth to \nour cities immediately.\n  This legislation provides a targeted, limited tax credit to \nbusinesses to help defray their costs of construction, expansion, and \nrenovation in urban areas. The CRTC would be another tool to aid \nlocalities and States in boosting jobs and business investment in \nAmerica's most troubled neighborhoods. If enacted, estimates indicate \nthe CRTC could attract over $7 billion in private sector investment to \nthese communities, create thousands of jobs, and generate new tax \nrevenue.\n  America's urban areas serve an important role as centers of commerce, \nindustry, education, health care, and culture. Yet these urban centers, \nparticularly in the inner cities, also have special needs. As a \nPhiladelphia resident, I have first-hand knowledge of the growing \nproblems that plague our cities. I have long supported a variety of \nprograms to assist our cities such as increased funding for community \ndevelopment block grants, extension of the low income housing tax \ncredit, and legislation to establish enterprise and empowerment zones. \nI have also promoted legislation to provide targeted tax incentives for \ninvesting in minority- or women-owned small businesses.\n  This issue of urban renewal is not new to me. In the 104th Congress, \nI introduced the New Urban Agenda Act of 1995--S. 17--which would \nredress urban decay and decline without massive Federal outlays. S. 17 \nembodies many of the proposals of Philadelphia Mayor Edward G. Rendell. \nThe bill is intended to stimulate the economies of our urban centers. \nIncreased economic growth resulting in increased employment is the key \nto reversing current urban economic conditions. Specifically, my \nlegislation would: First, require certain Federal and foreign aid \npurchases to be made from businesses operating with urban zones; \nsecond, favor distressed cities for the location or relocation of \nFederal facilities; third, expand the historic rehabilitation tax \ncredit, expand the use of commercial industrial development bonds, and \nmodify the arbitrage rebate rules concerning municipal bond interest; \nfourth, study streamlining Federal housing programs into block-grant \nform, and encourage community building by locating original tenants in \nnew units on old sites; and fifth, ease environmental restrictions for \ngovernments, speed up the remediation process, and establish a pilot \npowerplant for the benefit of city residents and energy intensive \nindustry.\n  Mr. President, I believe the CRTC will complement my legislation \nbecause it would encourage new construction and rehabilitation of \nstructures in distressed areas. The CRTC would provide businesses with \nthe option of taking either a one time 20-percent tax credit against \nthe cost of new construction or rehabilitation, or a tax credit of 5 \npercent a year for 10 years. The credit is intended to help encourage \nbusinesses locate to economically distressed areas.\n  The original concept of enterprise zones provided for broad based \nincentives for capital formation. Current these zones primarily \nencourage wage-based tax, and other investment incentives to locate \nwithin the zone. There is no incentive for a business within the zone \nto expand so that larger numbers of employees can be hired. That is a \ngap which the CRTC fills.\n  I believe the CRTC will be an efficient and productive program. The \ntax credit will only be available after private sector investment has \nbeen made and the competed project is generating income. This bill \nauthorizes a maximum of $1.5 billion in tax credits over a 5-year \nperiod. The credits will be allocated to each State according to a \nformula which takes into account the number of localities where over \nhalf the people earn less than 60 percent of the area's median income. \nLocal governments, not the Federal Government, will determine their \npriority projects and forward them to the States which will allocate \nthe tax credits according to an evaluation system which the States \nthemselves establish.\n  Furthrmore, communities which have already been designated as \neconomic revitalization areas by the Federal, State, and local \ngovernments would now become eligible for the CRTC Program. This is \nparticularly good news for Philadelphia, PA, and Camden, NJ, which were \njointly chosen as 1 of 6 urban empowerment zones by the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. The cities of Harrisburg and Pittsburgh, \nand Allegheny County in my home State were also designated as \nenterprise communities and will benefit from S. 743.\n  Last June, the U.S. Conference of Mayors adopted the attached \nresolution sponsored by Edward Rendell, the mayor of Philadelphia, \nwhich endorsed the commercial revitalization tax credit. Other \norganizations which have endorsed this bill include the National \nAssociation of Counties, the American Institute of Architects, the \nNational Association of Industrial Office Properties, the American \nPlanning Association, the American Enterprise Zone Association, the \nLocal Initiatives Support Corporation, the International Downtown \nAssociation, the National Congress of Community Economic Development, \nand the American Society of Landscape Architects.\n  We must address any very serious issues--jobs, teenage pregnancy, \nwelfare reform--if we are to save our cities. It may well be that many \nin America have given up on our cities. That is a stark statement, but \nit is one which I believe may be true, but, I have not given up. And I \nbelieve there are others in this body on both sides of the aisle who \nhave not done so. There must be new strategies for dealing with the \nproblems of urban America. The Commercial Tax Revitalization Tax Credit \n\n\n[[Page S1152]]\nAct is one such strategy that strives toward the ultimate goal of \nrestoring the former vitality of our cities which can only help make \nour country stronger and more competitive. The days of expansive \nFederal aid are clearly past, but that is no excuse for the National \nGovernment to turn a blind eye to the problems of the cities.\n  The resolution follows:\n\n        Resolution No. 62--Commercial Revitalization Tax Credit\n\n       Whereas, many American urban centers and rural areas are \n     plagued by chronic economic distress, including aging \n     infrastructure and business disinvestment; and\n       Whereas, to be successful in breaking the cycle of economic \n     erosion, unemployment and abandonment of older neighborhoods, \n     new measures must be taken to regenerate private investment; \n     and\n       Whereas, new approaches must be fostered to address the \n     problems of our cities; and\n       Whereas, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (TX) has introduced \n     the Commercial Revitalization Tax Credit Act (CRTCA) of 1995 \n     to encourage business investment and reinvestment in \n     specially designated revitalization areas; and\n       Whereas, the CRTCA would offer a 20 percent tax credit in \n     one year, or a 5 percent credit each year for 10 years, to \n     defray the cost of business construction, expansion or \n     rehabilitation in specially designated areas; and\n       Whereas, tax policies designed to target private \n     entrepreneurial activities in declining urban and rural areas \n     enjoy bipartisan support, Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That The United States Conference of Mayors \n     strongly urges Congress to support this session the CRTCA; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That The United States Conference of Mayors urges \n     Congress to approve this credit this session at the full \n     benefit level for which it is proposed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1151-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DIETRICH BONHOEFFER\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to \nthe life of one of the 20th-century's most inspirational leaders, the \nanti-Nazi theologian, Dietrich Bonhoeffer. The author of numerous \nbooks, most notably, ``The Cost of Discipleship'' and ``Letter and \nPapers From Prison,'' Mr. Bonhoeffer spent time in the United States as \na student at Union Seminary in New York.\n  It was after his stay in the United States that Dietrich Bonhoeffer \nreturned to his native Germany and voiced opposition to the practices \nof Hitler and his Nazi regime. As an ardent pacifist, not only did he \nspeak out against Nazi terrors and propaganda, but Mr. Bonhoeffer was \ncentrally involved in transporting Jews from Germany to Switzerland in \nan effort to spare them from the Nazis.\n  In 1943 Mr. Bonhoeffer was arrested and sent to the Buchenwald \nconcentration camp. Then, at the age of 39, on April 9, 1945, just 2 \ndays before the arrival of the Allied forces, Dietrich Bonhoeffer was \nhanged by the Nazis.\n  Despite Dietrich Bonhoeffer's heroics, he is still regarded by German \nlaw as a traitor. Ten years ago, German Parliament condemned Nazi \n``people's courts'' and voided their convictions. However, the \ndeclaration did not pertain to the SS courts, where Mr. Bonhoeffer was \ncondemned. today, I formally urge my colleagues on both sides of the \nisle to support posthumous rehabilitation for Mr. Bonhoeffer and to \nurge the German Parliament to declare that all convictions by the SS \ncourts were illegal.\n  Mr. President, Dietrich Bonhoeffer should serve as an inspiration to \nall of us for he sought change where change often times seemed \nimpossible. He joined his church, and changed it. He lived in Nazi \nGermany where the message of a superior Aryan race separated man from \nman and thus man from God. But, rather than accept the Nazi \ndictatorship, he openly opposed Hitler and the regime. for his \nconviction to justice, equality, and peace, Dietrich Bonhoeffer had his \nlife violently taken from him. Surely he deserves our best efforts to \nlegally clear his name and to celebrate his legacy of courage and \ncommitment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1152-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1152-S1153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PROFESSIONAL SPORTS FRANCHISES IN SEATTLE\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on February 2, the citizens of \nSeattle and of Washington State were dealt yet another low blow in \ntheir continuing struggle to maintain three professional sports \nfranchises in Seattle. Unfortunately, it now seems that just as one \nteam reaches the pinnacle of success in Seattle, another outsider owner \nof a local team decides that he no longer wishes to call Seattle its \nhome. Last Friday, the owners of the Seattle Seahawks announced their \nintention to move the team from Seattle even though they have 10 years \nremaining on their contract with King County.\n  Why are they leaving? The Seahawk owners cite inadequate playing \nfacilities and a lack of local government and community support. Lack \nof support? Consider the numerous years of sell-out crowds in the \nKingdome. Consider the local and State subsidies that have supported \nthis organization. If there is no community support, why did the \nSeahawk organization retire the No. 12 jersey? The number was retired \nin honor of all the Seahwawak fans who have long served as the \n``twelfth man'' on the Seahawks playing field. Lack of support?\n  As many of my colleagues may know, a great deal of my political \ncareer has been focused on maintaining a presence of professional \nsports franchises in Seattle. My involvement started late one evening \nin 1970, when the owners of the Seattle Pilots baseball team loaded \ntheir moving vans and headed east to Milwaukee, WI, after only 1 year \nin Seattle. As Washington State attorney, general, I successfully sued \nthe American League to bring a new baseball club to Seattle in 1977--\nthe Seattle Mariners--a suit that also resulted in the creation of the \nToronto Blue Jays.\n  During its first 17 years of existence, the Mariner organization \nfaced many of the expected challenges that confront any new sports \nfranchise. This young baseball team was only able to produce two \nwinning seasons in its first 17 years. While the adversity continued on \nthe field, the difficulties facing the franchise off the field quickly \nbecame even more owerwhelming. The Mariners organization suffered \nincreasing financial losses, fueling speculation that the team would \nleave Sattle. All of the succession of Mariner owerns were underfunded \noutsiders unable to take the risks necessary for success. Finally in \n1992, the threat became a reality, and the owners of the Mariners \nannounced their intentions to move the baseball team to Florida. The \nfans, myself included reacted. A provision in the Mariners' contract \nwith King County prohibited the midnight-loading of the moving vans. \nThis local-option provision required that prior to any relocation to \nanother city, the team first be put up for sale for 120 days and sold \nto any local buyers with a reasonable offer. With on 2 weeks left \nbefore the 120-day period expired, local business and community \nleaders, myself included, were able to secure the local resources to \npurchase the Mariners and keep the Mariners safe at home.\n  Last fall, after 18 long years, the fans of Washington State, and the \nteam they fought so hard to keep, were finally rewarded when the \nSeattle Mariners won the American League Western Division Title. This \nchampionship fever should be the reward for fans when they dedicate \nthemselves to supporting a professional sports team, not what is \ncurrently happening in Seattle and Cleveland.\n  Unfortunately for the fans of professional sports team, today's \nloyalty and gratitude given to professional teams is being returned \nwith seriously harsh slaps in the face. Looking for news of a sports \nfranchise relocation? Just open a newspaper. Within the last 18 months, \ntwo professional football organizations have moved cities and three \nmore have announced their intentions to move prior to the 1996 season.\n  Mr. President, something has got to be done to bring some stability \nback to professional sports. Some question the role of the Government \nin professional sports leagues. I do not. Professional sports \nfranchises rely on Federal tax dollars, participate in interstate \ncommerce, and affect millions of people across the country. I have no \ndoubt that there is a role for the Federal Government in creating \nstandards and expectations of behavior. That is why I have cosponsored \nthe Fans' Rights Act with my colleagues from Ohio, Senator Glenn and \nSenator DeWine.\n  The Fans' Rights Act, S. 1439, seeks to restore stability and \nintegrity to the current chaos that marks franchise relocations. It \ndoes this by giving professional sports league officials the ability to \nenforce their own rules through a limited antitrust exemption. This \n\n[[Page S1153]]\nlimited exemption will ensure that league officials can block franchise \nrelocations they believe not to be in the best interests of their \nsport. The bill also provides for a 180-day notice period before any \nteam can move. During that time, public hearings must be held, at which \ntime a home community would have the opportunity to induce the team to \nstay. Finally, the Fans' Rights Act would prohibit the outrageous \npractice of teams buying the league's approval of a proposed \nrelocation. Current practices allow the paying of relocation fees to \nthe leagues and individual teams prior to the vote by the individual \nteam owners to approve the move. The bill would require that the \nrelocation fee be paid only after the vote of approval has taken place. \nThe era of professional sports teams moving, only to leave behind fans, \nbusinesses, and communities who have invested emotional and financial \nsupport must come to an end, and this legislation attempts to do just \nthat.\n  As chairman of the Consumer Subcommittee within the Commerce \nCommittee, I intend to hold hearings on Fans' Rights Act sometime in \nearly March. I will seek testimony from commissioners of all four \nprofessional leagues, player representatives, team owners, and elected \nofficials from cities impacted by franchise relocation.\n  When this bill comes to the floor, it is also my intention to offer \nan amendment to include a provision similar to that that kept the \nMariners in Seattle in 1992. Essentially, this provision would require \na team to be put up for sale to local owners for 120 days prior to any \nrelocation at a price to be set by arbitration. Fan loyalty and local \nsupport must be rewarded with local ownership, not the removal of the \nteam.\n  Unfortunately for the Seahawk fans, even if we could enact the Fans' \nRights Act into law tomorrow, this legislation will not reverse the \nclock in Seattle. The decision to relocate the team has been made, \nalthough a lawsuit is pending against the organization is a King County \nSuperior Court, an action I believe likely to succeed. I have been \ninvited by King County Executive Gary Locke to serve on a small task \nforce of business and community leaders who will work together to \nensure that professional football in Seattle does not become part of \nSeattle's fading history.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to commend King County \nExecutive Gary Locke, King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng, and members \nof the King County Council for all of their efforts thus far to save \nthe Seahawks.\n  In closing Mr. President, I would like to send a message to sports \nfans in Washington State and around the country. While we are in the \nmidst of troubling times with sports teams coming and sports teams \nleaving, I would like to assure each of you that your loyalty to \nprofessional sports franchises will not go unrewarded. Throughout the 8 \nweeks of the Mariners playoff excitement this fall, the residents of \nSeattle and the citizens of Washington State were part of an amazing \nroller-coaster ride that reached beyond anything that could ever be \nexpected from professional sports. The great sense of community pride \nand support toward a single team, however, must be rewarded with \nloyalty from the team back to the community. The Seattle Mariners \ndisplayed this loyalty in their final game of the season, when all of \nthe Mariner players came out of the clubhouse 20 minutes after game's \nend, to applaud the 58,000-plus fans who had encouraged the team during \nthe championship run.\n  Mr. President, the Seahawks will not move and, I believe, Cleveland \nwill not be deserted by the NFL either.\n  Mr. President, every fan deserves the opportunity to applaud his or \nher local sports team, and for loyalty from the owners in return. I \nhope that passing the Fans' Rights Act can begin to recognize that fans \nare equal players in the world of sports.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1152-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1153-S1154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE NEED FOR A NATIONAL COMMISSION ON GAMBLING\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would like to call to the \nattention of my colleagues a recent column in the Washington Post. \nCowritten by our former colleague from Maryland, Joseph Tydings, the \ncolumn cogently describes the importance of a national study on the \nsocial and economic impacts of gambling.\n  The impacts of gambling are regional, national, and international in \nscope. Local and State governments simply do not have access to the \ninformation they need to make wise decisions. Although local and State \ntask forces and commissions continue to produce reports, these entities \nare not equipped to deal with the regional and national ramifications \nof local and State policies and tend to focus only on the short term. \nAs the authors suggest, a national commission would help States a great \ndeal.\n  Although the column is focused on Maryland, States and municipalities \nacross the country are facing the same choices. Strapped for cash, many \nturn to casinos, riverboats, and lotteries. Gambling should not be the \nonly choice. Identifying alternative sources of revenue will be \nprominent among the issues considered by a national commission.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the column and to work with me and the \nbipartisan group supporting S. 704, the Gambling Impact Study \nCommission Act.\n  I ask that the Washington Post column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 6, 1996]\n\n                   Casino Gambling: Bring in the Feds\n\n                  (By Joseph Tydings and Peter Reuter)\n\n       The recent opening of slot machines at two Delaware race \n     tracks is a small event in itself but is yet another step \n     along the path to coast-to-coast casinos that many states are \n     reluctantly and uncertainly following. Notwithstanding the \n     pressure from the Delaware move, Maryland's Joint Executive \n     Legislative Task Force to Study Commercial Gambling, on which \n     we served as chair and executive director, recommended \n     against casinos last November.\n       One of the task force's major conclusions has been largely \n     ignored by the media--namely, that the problem of legal \n     casino gambling is a national one; Maryland cannot deal with \n     this on its own. The problem cries out for attention from the \n     president and Congress. Unfortunately, the casino industry \n     has mobilized cash and lobbyists to prevent federal action on \n     the issue.\n       The Maryland Task Force, in its full report, unhappily \n     noted that, lacking a significant federally funded study, it \n     has a very limited basis for making projections of what would \n     happen if Maryland opened its doors to casinos, which \n     nowadays get 70 percent of their revenues from slot machines. \n     Given the limited statistical and economic analysis \n     available, its opposition to casinos reflected a sensible \n     caution.\n       Casinos do provide a credible promise of substantial \n     financial gains to those states that are the first in their \n     region to introduce them. Foxwoods casino in Connecticut \n     (owned by the Mashantucket Pequot tribe under 1988 federal \n     legislation that allows Indian tribes to operate casinos on \n     certain tribal lands) now yields that state $115 million in \n     tax revenues. Most of it comes from residents of \n     Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York who come to play in \n     the world's largest casino. It employs more than 10,000 \n     workers, offering good wages and benefits to many who would \n     otherwise have more menial and unreliable jobs.\n       Not surprisingly, the state of Massachusetts feels it must \n     also allow slots to compete and is now negotiating with the \n     Wampanoag Indians to let the tribe operate a casino. The \n     state of New York, which created a long legislative and \n     referendum process to prevent a rash decision on casinos, has \n     also responded to Connecticut by starting down a path that \n     could lead to their introduction in 1998.\n       But the economic gains that entice states to open their \n     doors to casinos are only substantial if neighboring states \n     aren't competing for the same customers. If Maryland were the \n     only state in its region to allow casinos, it might be able \n     to justify building casinos that relied heavily on spending \n     by Virginians, Pennsylvanians, Washingtonians and West \n     Virginians. However, just as the Foxwoods' success had caused \n     Connecticut's neighbors to move toward casinos, so would \n     Maryland's advantage, if any, be short-lived.\n       The case for casinos has an element of vodoo economics--\n     namely, the claim that providing a new form of entertainment \n     will increase the economic base of the community or state by \n     increasing local spending. Casino expenditures by Maryland \n     citizens would come entirely through reductions in other \n     leisure spending or even in spending on food, shelter and \n     education. Casinos can provide economic development only by \n     attracting spending from other states. Moreover, if casinos \n     lead to greater consumer spending nationally, then clearly it \n     has to come from reductions in people's savings--scarcely a \n     desirable change for a country that chronically undersaves.\n       There are also important social costs to having casinos \n     readily accessible. Many people have difficulty controlling \n     their gambling, particularly in the artificial environment of \n     a casino where liquor is freely offered and the game is \n     available at all hours. Big gambling losses and the obsessive \n     pursuit of gambling opportunities may lead to \n\n[[Page S1154]]\n     family breakdown and loss of productivity and community involvement. \n     Embezzlement would probably rise. Casino patrons might also \n     make attractive victims for criminal offenses. But whether \n     this is a major problem or just a modest incidental to the \n     simple pleasures of millions is still a matter of debate and \n     in need of serious research.\n       The opponents of casinos often weaken their case by making \n     exaggerated claims about the social consequences of gambling. \n     Typical is the claim that ``40 percent of all white-collar \n     crimes come from pathological gambling,'' a hardy perennial \n     that appears in all anti-casino writings. It is supposedly \n     the product of the American Insurance Institute. In fact, no \n     such organization exists, and no one has ever been able to \n     locate a copy of a report documenting the claim. Nor is there \n     much more basis for the frequent claim that each problem \n     gambler costs society $30,000 annually.\n       An authoritative and independent assessment of the economic \n     and social consequences of casinos would help states a great \n     deal. A federal commission needs to do systematic analysis of \n     the kind that state task forces, with their short time \n     horizons and minuscule budgets (ours had six months and a \n     total of $50,000 for its work), cannot muster. There seems to \n     be strong congressional support for such a commission, \n     notwithstanding aggressive lobbying against it by the casino \n     industry.\n       The national commission would also have to focus on the \n     very troubling issue of Indian tribal gambling. Providing \n     Indian tribes with better economic opportunities is clearly \n     an important and legitimate goal, but when those \n     opportunities result in large costs being borne by the entire \n     nation, then the issue needs to be revisited.\n       In the meantime, states like Maryland will feel a constant \n     pressure from their neighbors to avoid having good Maryland \n     money turn into Delaware gambling revenues. The growing \n     burden of social services on state finances as the federal \n     government cuts back its support will increase that pressure, \n     so that in the next downturn many states may reluctantly, but \n     irreversibly, become casino states as well. A federal \n     commission and some sensible national policy are needed, as \n     soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1153-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1154-S1158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    OPEN TOBACCO HEARINGS ARE NEEDED\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments about \nSunday's ``60 Minutes'' program on Dr. Jeffrey Wigand and his \nstatements about what went on inside the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co.\n  Mr. President, for those who did not see this interview, Dr. Wigand \ntold the Nation that Brown & Williamson acknowledged that cigarettes \nare a ``nicotine delivery'' device and that senior management rejected \nhis efforts to make their tobacco products safer.\n  Dr. Wigand also claimed that Brown & Williamson knowingly used \ncarcinogens in their tobacco products.\n  Mr. President, if these allegations were found to be true--if Brown & \nWilliamson knew that nicotine was addictive, if the company knew that \nits products contained carcinogens, if it withheld this information \nfrom the public and this resulted in unnecessary death and disease--it \nwould be absolutely unconscionable.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a transcript of this interview be printed \nin the Record following my remarks.\n  Mr. President, these accusations made by Dr. Wigand are extremely \nserious and I believe that Congress and the American people should \nfully understand the real dangers of tobacco products and all of the \nrecent allegations involving the tobacco industry.\n  Mr. President, there is so much activity and confusion about tobacco \nthese days.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about some of the legal matters that are \ncurrently pending:\n  Five States are actively suing the tobacco companies for Medicaid \ncosts associated with tobacco related illnesses of their residents. \nOther States are seriously considering similar action, including my \nhome State.\n  On the Federal level, I have introduced legislation to recoup all \nMedicare and Medicaid costs spent on tobacco related illnesses, some \n$20 billion a year, directly from the tobacco companies.\n  There is a multibillion-dollar class action suit against the tobacco \ncompanies going on in New Orleans. It is commonly referred to as the \nCastano case. The plaintiffs are former smokers and survivors who claim \nthat the tobacco companies knew that nicotine was addictive and \ndangerous but never told their customers.\n  There is a Justice Department probe underway to investigate whether \nthe seven tobacco companies' CEO's perjured themselves before \nCongressman Waxman's subcommittee when they testified they did not \nbelieve nicotine was addictive.\n  Because of all of these current legal activities, there have been \nnumerous leaks about the dangers of tobacco in the print and television \nmedia. However, Congress and the American people are only getting bits \nand pieces of the entire story because of the intense legal climate \nsurrounding this entire issue.\n  This is why I wrote a letter to Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy asking \nthem to hold hearings in the Labor and Human Resources Committee about \nthe entire tobacco issue. I have spoken personally to Senator Kassebaum \nand she assured me that she would seriously consider this request. I \nalso spoke with Senator Kennedy who is deeply interested in all health \nissues including the health effects of tobacco and would like to set up \nhearings on this subject.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  Mr. President, the Congress, on behalf of the American people, needs \nto find out the truth about the addictive nature of nicotine, the \nhealth effects of tobacco use and all of the recent allegations \ninvolving the tobacco industry. We need this information so that we can \nevaluate the need for legislation regulating the tobacco industry and \ntrying to recoup the cost of tobacco related illnesses.\n  It is clear that the only way for Congress and the American people to \nget all of this information is to have open hearings in the Senate--so \nthat we can secure for the record as much information as possible.\n  On the House side, unfortunately, there is little chance of hearings. \nCongressman Bliley, from Richmond, VA, chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, has indicated that his committee will not permit these \nissues to be aired.\n  I hope that things will be different in the Senate. I hope that both \nDemocrats and Republicans will see the value in holding hearings on \nthis critical issue. Only then, will the Congress and the public be \nfully informed about the dangers of a product that takes over 400,000 \nlives per year.\n  Mr. President, we cannot sit idly by and listen to these types of \nallegations and do nothing.\n  The material follows:\n\n              Transcript From 60 Minutes, February 4, 1966\n\n       Mike Wallace. A story we set out to report six months ago \n     has now turned into two stories: how cigarettes can destroy \n     people's lives; and how one cigarette company is trying to \n     destroy the reputation of a man who refused to keep quiet \n     about what he says he learned when he worked for them. The \n     Company is Brown & Williamson, America's third-largest \n     tobacco company. The man they've set out to destroy is Dr. \n     Jeffrey Wigand, their former $300,000 a year director of \n     research.\n       They employed prestigious law firms to sue him, a high-\n     powered investigation firm to probe every nook and cranny of \n     his life. And they hired a big-time public relations \n     consultant to help them plant damaging stories about him in \n     The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and others. But \n     the Journal reported the story for what they though it was. \n     ``Scant evidence'' was just one of their comments.\n       CBS management wouldn't let us broadcast our original story \n     and our interview with Jeffrey Wigand because they were \n     worried about the possibility of a multibillion dollar \n     lawsuit against us for ``tortions'' interference--that is, \n     interfering with Wigand's confidentiality agreement with \n     Brown & Williamson. But now things have changed. Last week \n     The Wall Street Journal got hold of and published a \n     confidential deposition Wigand gave in a Mississippi case, a \n     November deposition that repeated many of the charges he made \n     to us last August. And while a lawsuit is still a \n     possibility, not putting Jeffrey Wigand's story on 60 minutes \n     no longer is.\n       [Footage of Wigand; Brown & Williamson Tower; cigarettes on \n     machine; of tobacco on conveyor belt; tobacco executives \n     testifying before Congress.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). What Dr. Wigand told us in that \n     original interview was that his former colleagues, executives \n     of Brown & Williamson tobacco, knew all along that their \n     tobacco products, their cigarettes and pipe tobacco, \n     contained additives that increased the danger of disease; and \n     further, that they had long known that the nicotine in \n     tobacco is an addictive drug, despite their public statement \n     to the countrary, like the testimony before Congress of Dr. \n     Wigand's former boss, B chief executive officer Thomas \n     Sandefur.\n       Mr. Thomas Sandefur (Chief Executive Officer, Brown & \n     Williamson). I believe that nicotine is not addictive.\n       Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Testifying Against Brown & Williamson). \n     I believe he perjured himself because----\n     \n[[Page S1155]]\n\n       [Footage of congressional hearing.]\n       Dr. Wigand (Voiceover). I watched those testimonies very \n     carefully.\n       Wallace (Voiceover). All of us did. There was the whole \n     line of people-the-the whole line of CEOs up there, all \n     swearing that----\n       Dr. Wigand: And part of the reason I'm here is I felt that \n     their representation, clearly--at least within Brown & \n     Williamson's representation, clearly, misstated what they \n     commonly knew as language within the company: that we're in a \n     nicotine-delivery business.\n       Wallace. And that's what cigarettes are for.\n       Dr. Wigand. Most certainly. It's a delivery device for \n     nicotine.\n       Wallace. A delivery device for nicotine.\n       Dr. Wigand. Nicotine.\n       Wallace. Put it in your mouth, light it up and you're going \n     to get your fix.\n       Dr. Wigand. You'll get your fix.\n       Wallace. Dr. Wigand says that Brown & Williamson \n     manipulates and adjusts that nicotine fix, not by \n     artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of \n     the nicotine through the use of chemical additive like \n     ammonia. This process is know in the tobacco industry as \n     ``impact boosting.\n       Dr. Wigand. While not spiking nicotine, they clearly \n     manipulate it.\n       [Footage of Brown & Williamson Root Technology handbook.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). The process is described in Brown & \n     Williamson's leaf blender's manual and in other B \n     documents.\n       Dr. Wigand. There's extensive use of this technology, which \n     is called ammonia chemistry, that allows for nicotine to be \n     more rapidly absorbed in the lungs and, therefore, affect the \n     brain and central nervous system.\n       [Footage of documents in file cabinet; computer screen; \n     Williams walking; Glantz; Journal of the American Medical \n     Association.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). And then there are these documents, \n     thousands of pages of confidential scientific reports and \n     legal memoranda from B's secret files, which experts say \n     support Dr. Wigand's claim that Brown & Williamson's \n     executives have had strong reason to believe all along that \n     nicotine is addictive and that their tobacco products cause \n     cancer and other diseases. Most of these documents had been \n     locked away in B's lawyers' confidential files in \n     Louisville, Kentucky, until this man, the paralegal in that \n     law office, Merrill Williams, walked off with them. The \n     documents found their way to Dr. Stanton Glantz, a professor \n     of medicine at the University of California Medical Center in \n     San Francisco. It was Dr. Glantz and a team of scientists \n     from the university who wrote about the documents this past \n     summer in a series of articles in the Journal of the American \n     Medical Association.\n       What is the story that the documents told you?\n       Dr. Stanton Glantz (University of California Medical \n     Center). They told me that 30 years ago Brown & Williamson \n     and British-American Tobacco, its parent, knew nicotine was \n     an addictive drug, and they knew smoking caused cancer and \n     other diseases.\n       [Footage of Glantz.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). And Dr. Glantz says these documents \n     reveal how Brown & Williamson was keeping that knowledge from \n     the public.\n       Dr. Glantz. And they also developed very sophisticated \n     legal strategies to keep this information away from the \n     public, to keep this information away from public health \n     authorities.\n       Wallace. Dr. Wigand said that the cigarette is basically a \n     nicotine delivery instrument. That's what it's really all \n     about.\n       Dr. Glantz. Yes, absolutely. And they--in the documents, \n     they say that over and over and over again.\n       [Footage of smokers.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). And finding a way to deliver that \n     nicotine to the smoker's brain without exposing smokers to \n     disease-causing pollutants, like tar that come with tobacco \n     smoke, is one reason, says Dr. Wigand, that he was hired by \n     B on January 1st, 1989.\n       Dr. Wigand. They were looking to reduce the hazards within \n     cigarettes, reduce the carcinogenic components--or--or list \n     the carcinogens that were within the tobacco products.\n       Wallace. They talked about carcinogens to you?\n       Dr. Wigand. Talked about carcinogens----\n       Wallace. They talked about cancer and heart disease and \n     emphysema and all of those things----\n       Dr. Wigand. They talked about----\n       Wallace. ----and they were going to work toward making a \n     safer cigarette? You must have been very excited.\n       Dr. Wigand. I was enthusiastic and energetic in terms of \n     pursuing that.\n       [Footage of Wigand; a smoker.]\n       Wallace. Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, with a doctorate in \n     biochemistry, had spent nearly 20 years working in the \n     health-care and biotechnology industries. He says his goal at \n     B was to make a cigarette that would be less likely to \n     cause disease.\n       Dr. Wigand (Voiceover). People will continue to smoke no \n     matter what, no matter what kind of regulations.\n       If you can provide for those who are smoking and who need \n     to smoke something that produces less risk for them--I \n     thought I was going to be making a difference.\n       [Footage of newspaper story of Wigand.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). Brown & Williamson made Jeff Wigand \n     vice president for R, paying him more than $300,000 a year \n     in salary and perks.\n       Dr. Wigand. And I was very inquisitive when I came on. \n     ``Have you ever done any nicotine studies? Have you done any \n     pharmacology studies? Have you done any biological studies? \n     Have you looked at the effect of nicotine on the central \n     nervous system?'' And they always, general categorically, \n     ``No, we don't do that kind of work.''\n       [Footage of Brown & Williamson Tower; Wigand.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). But according to those thousands of \n     pages from B and its parent, British-American tobacco's, \n     confidential files, the company had, in fact, done exactly \n     those kinds of studies. Dr. Wigand says he did not suspect \n     there was anything wrong until he attended a meeting of \n     scientists who worked for British-American tobacco companies \n     from around the world. Dr. Wigand says that his colleagues \n     talked about working together to develop a safer, a less-\n     hazardous cigarette, a cigarette less likely to cause \n     disease. But when it came time to write up their ideas, to \n     create a documentary record of their discussion, B's \n     lawyers intervened.\n       Dr. Wigand. The minutes that came in were roughly about 18 \n     pages long describ--the co--I knew what was in the content. \n     The--they were rewritten by Kendrick Wells. They were--\n       Wallace. Who's he?\n       Dr. Wigand. Kendrick Wells was the--one of the staff \n     attorneys at B\n       Wallace. And he rewrote the minutes of the meeting?\n       Dr. Wigand. He rewrote the minutes of the meeting. He \n     edited out the discussions on safer cigarette and, basically, \n     toned the meeting down.\n       Wallace. You're saying that one of the staff attornyes from \n     B, here in the United States, whose name was----\n       Dr. Wigand. Kendrick Wells.\n       Wallace. ----an attorney----\n       Dr. Wigand. Mm-hmm.\n       Wallace. ----rewrote the minutes of this research meeting \n     with all of the research heads of BAT Industries----\n       Dr. Wigand. That's correct.\n       Wallace. ----in order to sanitize it, in a sense.\n       Dr. Wigand. Sanitize it, as well as reduce any type of \n     exposure associated with discussing a safer cigarette. When \n     you say you're going to have a safer cigarette----\n       Wallace. Mm-hmm.\n       Dr. Wigand. ----but that now takes everything else that you \n     have available and say it--it's unsafe, and that from a \n     products liability point of view, gave the lawyers great \n     concern.\n       [Footage of Wells; files; cigarettes on conveyor belt; \n     files.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). Kendrick Wells, the lawyer Dr. Wigand \n     says deleted materials from the minutes of the scientific \n     meeting, is now the assistant general counsel of B Why \n     would B lawyers like Kendrick Wells be so concerned? \n     According to B's own confidential files, any evidence, any \n     documents that show any B tobacco product, like Kools or \n     Viceroys, might be unsafe, those documents would have to be \n     produced in court as part of any lawsuit filed by a smoker or \n     his surviving family. And according to the lawyers, those \n     documents could be disastrous for B So the lawyers took \n     over.\n       Dr. Wigand (Voiceover). The lawyers intervened.\n       And then they purged documents every time there was a \n     reference to a word ``less hazardous'' or ``safer.''\n       [Footage of Wigand.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). But Dr. Wigand says the lawyers' \n     interference, their editing and review of his reports, did \n     not stop him.\n       Dr. Wigand. And I started asking more probing questions and \n     I started digging deeper and deeper. As I dug deeper and \n     deeper, I started getting a bodyguard.\n       Wallace. What do you mean a bodyguard?\n       Dr. Wigand. I went to a meeting; I now was accompanied by a \n     lawyer. My bodyguard was Kendrick Wells.\n       [Footage of Wigand; photo of Sandefur.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). Frustrated by the lawyers' \n     intervention and presence at major scientific meetings, Dr. \n     Wigand says he took his complaints to Thomas Sandefur, then \n     the president of B\n       What'd he say to you?\n       Dr. Wigand. ``I don't want to hear any more discussion \n     about a safer cigarette.''\n       [Still shot of B executive.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). And he says Thomas Sandefur went on to \n     tell him----\n       Dr. Wigand. ``We pursue a safer cigarette, it would put us \n     at extreme exposure with every other product. I don't want to \n     hear about it anymore.''\n       Wallace. All the people who were dying from cigarettes.\n       Dr. Wigand. Essentially, yes.\n       Wallace. Cancer----\n       Dr. Wigand. Cancer.\n       Wallace. ----heart disease, things of that nature.\n       Dr. Wigand. Emphysema.\n       [Still shot of Sandefur; footage of Wigand.]\n       Wallace. (Voiceover). Lawyers representing B and Thomas \n     Sandefur have said that all this, as well as other accounts \n     of conversations with Thomas Sandefur, are absolutely false. \n     We asked Dr. Wigand what his reaction was to what he says was \n     Sandefur's decision to abandon a safer cigarette.\n       Dr. Wigand. I would say I got angry.\n       Wallace. He was your boss.\n       Dr. Wigand. I bit my tongue. I had just transitioned from \n     another--one company to another. I was paid well. It was \n     comfortable. \n\n[[Page S1156]]\n     And for me to do anything precipitous would put my family at risk.\n       Wallace. You were happy to take down the 300,000 bucks a \n     year.\n       Dr. Wigand. I, essentially, yeah, took the money. I did my \n     job.\n       Wallace. So Dr. Wigand abandoned his idea of trying to \n     develop a new and safer cigarette. He turned his attention to \n     investigating the additives, the flavorings, the other \n     compounds in B tobacco products. Many, like glycerol, which \n     is used to keep the tobacco in cigarettes moist, are normally \n     harmless. But when glycerol is burned in a cigarette, its \n     chemistry changes.\n       Dr. Wigand. Glycerol, when it's burnt, forms a--a very \n     specific substance called acrolein.\n       [Footage of book; excerpt from book; smokers.]\n       Wallace. (Voiceover). According to the American Council on \n     Science and Health, acrolin, or acrolEIN, is extremely \n     irritating and has been shown to interfere with the normal \n     clearing of the lungs. Recent research shows that acrolein \n     acts like a carcinogen, though not yet classified as such. \n     And Dr. Wigand says that B continues to add glycerol to \n     their product. But it was another additive that Dr. Wigand \n     says led to the end of his career at B\n       Dr. Wigand. The straw that broke the c--the camel's back \n     for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a \n     compound called coumarin.\n       [Footage of smoker; medical record on mice experiment; B \n     documents.]\n       Wallace. (Voiceover). Coumarin is a flavoring that provides \n     a sweet taste to tobacco products, but is known to cause \n     tumors in the livers of mice. It was removed from B \n     cigarettes, but according to these documents, B continued \n     to use it in its Sir Walter Raleigh aromatic pipe tobacco \n     until at least 1992.\n       Dr. Wigand. And when I came on board at B, they had tried \n     to tend--transition from coumarin to another similar flavor \n     that would give the same taste. And it was unsuccessful.\n       [Footage of Wigand and Wallace; report.]\n       Wallace. (Voiceover). Dr. Wigand says the news about \n     coumarin and cancer got worse. This report by independent \n     researchers, part of a national toxic safety program, \n     presented evidence that coumarin is a carcinogen that causes \n     various cancers.\n       Dr. Wigand. I wanted it out immediately. And I was told \n     that it would affect sales and I was to mind my own business. \n     And then I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating that \n     I could not, in conscience, continue with coumarin, a product \n     that we now knowingly have documentation that is lung-\n     specific, carcinogen.\n       Wallace. Right. Sent the document forward to Sandefur?\n       Dr. Wigand. I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was \n     told that--that we would continue working on a substitute, \n     and we weren't going to remove it because it would impact \n     sales. And that's--that was his decision.\n       Wallace. In other words, what you're charging Sandefur with \n     and Brown & Williamson with is, ``ignoring health \n     considerations consciously''.\n       Dr. Wigand. Most certainly.\n       [Footage of Wigand].\n       Wallace (Voiceover). After his confrontations over \n     coumarin, Dr. Wigand says he was not surprised when, on March \n     the 24th, 1993, Thomas Sandefur, newly promoted to chief \n     executive officer, CEO of B, had him fired.\n       And the reason for firing that he gave you?\n       Dr. Wigand. Poor communication skills, just not cutting it, \n     poor performance.\n       [Footage of Wigand and his family at dinner table.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). When Dr. Wigand, who has a wife and \n     two young daughters, was fired by Brown & Williamson tobacco, \n     his contract provided severance pay and critical health \n     benefits for his family, critical because one of his children \n     requires expensive daily health care. Several months after he \n     was fired, B decided to sue their former head of R and \n     they cut off his severance and those vital health benefits.\n       Dr. Wigand. They said I violated my confidentiality \n     agreement by discussing my severance package.\n       [Footage of Wigand and Lucretia walking.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). Lucretia Wigand says that the firing \n     and B's suspension of benefits was devastating.\n       Mrs. Lucretia Wigand (Dr. Jeffrey Wigand's Wife). We almost \n     lost our family as a unit. Jeff and I almost separated.\n       Wallace. Why?\n       Mrs. Wigand. Because he was under so much stress and sto--\n     so much pressure that it was something that we needed help \n     dealing with. We went to counseling and we worked through it.\n       Wallace. And this was, you think, started--triggered by the \n     business with B?\n       Mrs. Wigand. Yes. I know it was.\n       [Footage of Wigand in his kitchen; document.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). B settled that lawsuit we mentioned \n     and reinstated those critical health benefits, only after Dr. \n     Wigand agreed to sign a new, stricter, lifelong \n     confidentiality agreement.\n       Nontheless, word of Dr. Wigand's battles with Brown & \n     Williamson attracted attention in Washington, where, in the \n     spring of 1994, Democratic Congress and the FDA, the Food & \n     Drug Administration, were investigating the tobacco industry. \n     Dr. Wigand was contacted by their investigators, and after \n     notifying Brown & Williamson, he talked with those \n     investigators. Shortly afterward, he was stunned by a couple \n     of anonymous telephone calls.\n       Dr. Wigand. And in April 1994, on two separate occasions, I \n     had life threats on my kids.\n       Wallace. What?\n       Dr. Wigand. We had life threats on my kids.\n       [Footage of Wigand and Wallace.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). Dr. Wigand told us he doesn't know \n     where they came from, but that, understandably, they \n     frightened him. He described the threats by referring to his \n     diary.\n       Dr. Wigand. ``A male voice that was on the phone that said, \n     `Don't mess with tobacco anymore. How are your kids?' '' Then \n     on April 28th, around 3:00 in the afternoon, relative the \n     same voice--he says, ``Leave tobacco alone or else you'll \n     find your kids hurt. They're pretty girls now.'' So I got \n     scared. I started carrying a gun.\n       Wallace. Really?\n       Dr. Wigand. Yep. Started carrying a handgun.\n       Mrs. Wigand. Someone called and threatened to--to kill him \n     and to hurt the family if he messed with the tobacco \n     industry.\n       Wallace. That was last August. Now in February, Lucretia \n     Wigand has filed for divorce, citing spousal abuse, just one \n     of the accusations Brown & Williamson is using in their full-\n     throated campaign to discredit Jeffrey Wigand. That report \n     when we return.\n       [Commercial break.]\n       Wallace. Today, three years after he was fired by Brown & \n     Williamson, Dr. Jeffrey Wigand is the star witness in a US \n     Justice Department criminal investigation into the tobacco \n     industry, which includes the question of whether B's former \n     CEO lied to the US Congress when he said that he believed \n     that nicotine was not addictive. But Dr. Wigand is paying a \n     heavy price for his decision to testify, as well as for \n     breaking his confidentiality agreement by talking to us. His \n     family life has been shattered, his reputation has been \n     tarnished because of B's massive campaign designed to \n     silence him and to discredit this former research chief \n     turned whistle-blower.\n       They're trying to do what they can to paint you as \n     irresponsible, a liar----\n       Dr. Wigand. Well, I think the word they've used, Mike, is a \n     ``master of deceit.''\n       Wallace. You wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you \n     hadn't blown the whistle?\n       Dr. Wigand. There are times I wish I hadn't done it, but \n     there are times that I feel compelled to do it. I--if you ask \n     me if I would do it again or if it--do I think it's worth it, \n     yeah, I think it's worth it. I think in the end people will \n     see the truth.\n       [Footage of state attorneys general of Florida, Minnesota \n     and Mississippi.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). Well, these three men have seen the \n     same truth as Wigand. They are the state attorney's general \n     of Florida, Minnesota and Mississippi, where Dr. Wigand is \n     testifying in a multibillion-dollar lawsuit against the \n     tobacco industry. Mike Moore is attorney general of \n     Mississippi.\n       Mr. Moore. Jeffrey's testimony is going to be devastating, \n     Mike, to the tobacco industry, so devastating that I fear for \n     his life. I think----\n       Wallace. Are you serious?\n       Mr. Moore. I'm--I'm very serious. The information that \n     Jeffrey has, I think, is the most important information that \n     has ever come out against the tobacco industry. This \n     industry, in my opinion, is an industry who has perpetrated \n     the biggest fraud on the American public in history. They \n     have lied to the American public for years and years. They \n     have killed millions and millions of people and made a profit \n     on it. So I hope that they won't continue to lie and try to \n     destroy Jeffrey like they destroyed the other lives of people \n     all over this country.\n       [Footage of newspaper clippings; Wigand and Wallace; The \n     Investigative Group Inc. sign.]\n       Wallace [Voiceover]. The campaign to destroy Dr. Jeffrey \n     Wigand began over two months ago in the midst of a media \n     frenzy over our failure to broadcast our August interview \n     with him. Brown & Williamson sued Dr. Wigand for talking to \n     us, despite his confidentiality agreement. And they got a \n     court order in Kentucky to try to silence him from speaking \n     out further. Then investigators hired by B fanned out \n     across the country looking for anything they could use to \n     discredit the whistle-blower.\n       Dr. Wigand. They've been going around to my family, my \n     friends, digging up and digging here and digging there.\n       Wallace. Then their lawyers--and B has a half-dozen major \n     firms working on the Jeff Wigand case--their lawyers compiled \n     the results of their nationwide dragnet into a summary that \n     alleges that, in recent years, Dr. Wigand pled guilty to \n     everything from wife-beating to shoplifting. Beyond that, \n     they charged him with a multitude of sins, from fudging his \n     resume to making a false claim three years ago for $95.20 for \n     dry cleaning.\n       [Footage of Scanlon.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). Then Brown & Williamson retained John \n     Scanlon to get their story to the media. Scanlon is a fixture \n     of the New York media scene, who has close, personal \n     relationships with print and television reporters and \n     producers, as well as editors and publishers. We asked him to \n     sit down and discuss the charges he has been \n\n[[Page S1157]]\n     circulating to me and other reporters, but he declined. But Scanlon did \n     make this statement to a CBS News camera crew.\n       Mr. John Scanlon (New York). He's running from cross-\n     examination. His victims have decided to respond and present \n     evidence that he is, in fact, a habitual liar.\n       Dr. Wigand. The smear campaign--it's been very systematic, \n     very organized, very well done.\n       (Speaking to class). My background is I have a PhD in \n     biochemistry.\n       [Footage of Wigand teaching class; news broadcast.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). Today Dr. Wigand is a $30,000 a year \n     science teacher at a Louisville, Kentucky, public high \n     school. And his students, his faculty colleagues and his \n     family were stunned last month when a Louisville television \n     station broadcast some of Brown & Williamson's accusations.\n       Unidentified Reporter (From news broadcast). Court records \n     show Wigand was charged with theft by unlawful taking and \n     shoplifting.\n       [Footage of document; article in The Wall Street Journal; \n     Gordon Smith.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). Then the Brown & Williamson 500-page \n     dossier on Wigand was given to The Wall Street Journal, who \n     investigated the charges. And last Thursday in this front-\n     page story, The Journal reported that, quote, ``a close look \n     at the file and independent research by this newspaper into \n     its key claims indicates that many of the serious allegations \n     against Dr. Wigand are backed by scanty or contradictory \n     evidence.'' And they continued, quote, ``Some of the charges, \n     including that he pleaded guilty to shoplifting, are \n     demonstrably untrue.'' We put that Journal statement to \n     Gordon Smith, an attorney designated by Brown & Williamson \n     to talk to us.\n       The Wall Street Journal went through all of that material. \n     It says that what--the dossier that you put together: ``scant \n     evidence.''\n       Mr. Smith. Mr. Wallace, that's dead wrong. There is not \n     scant evidence. The Wall Street Journal did not----\n       Wallace. It----\n       Mr. Smith. ----did not go over the scores--literally scores \n     of untruths told by Jeff Wigand that we showed to them.\n       [Footage of Smith and Wallace.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). And Gordon Smith went on at some \n     length to say that Wigand's life, quote, ``is a pattern of \n     lies.''\n       Well, I don't understand, frankly, Mr. Smith. I really \n     don't understand. Brown & Williamson must be in a panic if \n     they are going after this man as hard as you are.\n       Mr. Smith. You're wrong. There are no material inaccuracies \n     in that book, none whatsoever.\n       [Footage of performance appraisal document on Wigand; \n     Wigand; letter.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). But not included in that dossier were \n     Brown & Williamson's own personnel records, which showed that \n     Wigand had received good performance appraisals for the first \n     three years from B In his fourth year, however, those \n     appraisals turned sour. But despite that, even after he was \n     fired, he received this letter from Brown & Williamson's \n     personnel director.\n       ``To whom it may concern, Dr. Jeffrey Wigand was \n     instrumental in the development of new products, as well as \n     the major impetus behind a significant upgrade in our R \n     technical capabilities, both in terms of people and \n     equipment. During his tenure at Brown & Williamson, Dr. \n     Wigand demonstrated a high level of technical knowledge and \n     expertise.''\n       And this is on your own stationery, your own man saying bad \n     about him.\n       Mr. Smith. Mike, Brown & Williamson refused to be a \n     reference for Jeff Wigand after he left. This letter was \n     negotiated with his attorney, and it was the only statement \n     Brown & Williamson would ever make about him because Brown & \n     Williamson did not want to be a reference for Jeff Wigand.\n       [Footage of Smith and Wallace.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). And Mr. Smith had this to say about \n     our relationship with Jeffrey Wigand.\n       Mr. Smith. You're being led along by a guy who's not \n     believable. You're getting half the story.\n       Wallace. Well, then why----\n       Mr. Smith. You--you--and you've got--you've got a--a vested \n     interest in making this man credible.\n       Wallace. Why do we have a vested interest?\n       Mr. Smith. CBS has--has paid this guy $12,000.\n       Wallace. For what?\n       Mr. Smith. I believe for consulting.\n       Wallace. Now wait just a moment. Let's get this straight. \n     Paid him $12,000 for what?\n       Mr. Smith. To consult on a story for CBS.\n       Wallace. For the record, as we explained to Mr. Smith, 60 \n     Minutes did, in fact, hire Dr. Wigand two years ago to act as \n     our expert consultant to analyze nearly 1,000 pages of \n     technical documents leaked to us, not from Brown & \n     Williamson, but from inside Philip Morris, another tobacco \n     company. At that time, Dr. Wigand told us he would not talk \n     with us about Brown & Williamson. And he did not, until over \n     a year later.\n       Dr. Wigand. I felt an obligation to tell the truth. There \n     were things I saw, there were things I learned, there was \n     things I observed that I felt--that need to be told. The \n     focus continues to be on what I would call systematic and \n     aggressive ta--tactics to undermine my credibility and my--\n     some of my personal life.\n       Wallace. But you expected that, didn't you?\n       Dr. Wigand. Well, I didn't expect to the extent it would--\n     it's happened, OK? It's--it's disrupted not only my life--I'm \n     in divorce proceedings now.\n       [Footage of state attorneys general.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). These three state attorneys general \n     say that no matter what B's accusations are, they remain \n     convinced that what Wigand has to say about the tobacco \n     industry in general, and Brown & Williamson in particular, is \n     thoroughly credible.\n       They are suing the tobacco industry for the billions of \n     dollars in state Medicaid costs their states have paid to \n     treat people who have become ill from smoking. Minnesota \n     Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III.\n       Mr. Hubert Humphrey III (Minnesota Attorney General). We \n     want to see the full truth come out. We want the deception \n     and fraud and the violations of our state laws stopped. And \n     we want people that are making the money on this product to \n     bear the full cost of the health-care burden that is there.\n       [Footage of state attorneys general.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). Bob Butterworth is the attorney \n     general of Florida.\n       Mr. Bob Butterworth (Florida Attorney General). The issue \n     has been deceit.\n       WALLACE. Deceit.\n       Mr. Butterworth. Pure and simple deceit. The cigarette \n     companies made a decision that they would withhold valuable \n     information from the American public, information that the \n     consumer would need to make a--an intelligent decision as to \n     whether or not they wish to smoke or not to smoke.\n       [Footage of Moore.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). Again, Mississippi Attorney General \n     Mike Moore.\n       Mr. Moore. I'm used to dealing with--with cocaine dealers \n     and--and crack dealers, and I have never seen damage done \n     like the tobacco company has done. There's no comparison. \n     Cocaine kills 10,000, 15,000 people a year in this country. \n     Tobacco kills 425,000 people a year.\n       Mr. SMITH. Mike, it's absurd to suggest that tobacco is any \n     way like cocaine in terms of addiction. It's absolutely \n     absurd to suggest that. Brown & Williamson makes a lawful \n     product. They sell it and make it in a lawful way.\n       Wallace Well, then why do 425,000 people die every year--\n     according to all medical and scientific evaluations, die of \n     smoking cigarettes? Why?\n       Mr. Smith. Mike, 50 million people choose to use tobacco \n     and smoke.\n       Wallace. So on a cost-benefit ratio, it's only 425,000 \n     people who die out of the 50 million?\n       Mr. Smith. No, Mike.\n       Wallace. That's--that's a--a--a small fraction. Is that the \n     point you're making?\n       Mr. Smith. No, Mike, not at all. People choose to smoke. \n     People choose to stop smoking. I think you used to smoke and \n     you chose to stop smoking.\n       Wallace. That's right.\n       Mr. Smith. It's their choice. It's a lawful product. It's \n     marketed and manufactured lawfully.\n       [Footage of Wigand and Wallace.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover). B has questioned Dr. Wigand's \n     character. But he says that's just a smoke screen, and he has \n     some questions for Brown & Williamson.\n       Dr. Wigand. Why don't they deal with the issue of whether \n     they can develop or--a safer cigarette? Why don't they deal \n     with the issue of using--and knowingly using additives that \n     are known to be carcinogenic in order not to influence sales? \n     Why don't we deal with that issue?\n       Wallace. Brown & Williamson did answer some of Dr. Jeffrey \n     Wigand's questions for us. They told us they have removed \n     coumarin--that's carcinogenic flavoring--from their Sir \n     Walter Raleigh aromatic pipe tobacco, but they insist it \n     never posed a health risk to smokers. B lawyer Kendrick \n     Wells declined to talk to us, but he did deny, in testimony \n     last week, Dr. Wigand's charge that he had altered the \n     minutes of that scientific meeting. And B says the truth \n     will come out in the end when they get a chance to cross-\n     examine Dr. Wigand under oath.\n       And they insist that we, CBS, cannot report on this story \n     objectively since we are indemnifying Dr. Wigand in B's \n     lawsuit against him. Two months ago CBS agreed to do that \n     after a leak resulted in the disclosure of Dr. Wigand's \n     identity before he was prepared to go public. Though still \n     unaware of where that leak had come from, CBS decided to take \n     financial responsibility for the impact that leak had on Dr. \n     Wigand because it exposed him to a lawsuit by Brown & \n     Williamson.\n       A footnote.\n       [Footage of That Courier-Journal headline and article.]\n       Wallace (Voiceover).

Nancy L. Kassebaum,\n     Chairwoman, Committee on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy: I am writing to urge \n     you to schedule hearings in your Committee on recent \n     disclosures about the health effects of tobacco products and \n     the nicotine contained in them. I believe that recent legal \n     tactics by the tobacco industry have led to the suppression \n     of vital public health information about Congress. \n     Consequently, Members of Congress have had to rely on leaks \n     and incomplete information concerning the health effects of \n     tobacco and nicotine. It would be an enormous service to \n     Congress for your Committee to hold comprehensive hearings on \n     this matter because there are at least 42 bills affecting the \n     growth, sale and promotion of tobacco products pending before \n     Congress.\n       1995 was a year full of revelations about the tobacco \n     industry and the content of its cigarettes. There were \n     various articles on allegations of nicotine manipulation by \n     tobacco companies. Despite this trickling out of information \n     on the dangers of tobacco, there were two infamous incidents \n     in 1995 that set dangerous precedents.\n       First, Philip Morris sued Capital Cities/ABC for $10 \n     billion over its report that this tobacco giant ``spiked'' \n     its cigarettes with nicotine. R.J. Reynolds later filed a \n     similar lawsuit against Capital Cities/ABC. These two \n     companies pressured Capital Cities/ABC to settle these suits \n     despite the fact that its story appeared to be factually \n     supported by interviews and internal company documents.\n       Second, the CBS news program 60 Minutes canceled an \n     interview with a former Brown and Williamson tobacco \n     executive due to fears of a lawsuit, even though its \n     reporters believed in the accuracy of the interview and the \n     reporting. While CBS has subsequently agreed to air this \n     piece, it apparently has done so only because of a recent \n     leak in the Wall Street Journal involving the same former \n     executive.\n       These two episodes have sent a chilling message to the \n     media about reporting new information on the health \n     consequences of tobacco. If these two major broadcast \n     networks are intimidated by these tobacco companies, then \n     smaller news organizations would seem to face even greater \n     challenges in reporting important stories on the health \n     effects of tobacco and nicotine. The mere threat of legal \n     action will likely force the suppression of critical \n     information on tobacco and nicotine from being reported in \n     the press and subsequently used by Members of Congress. \n     Therefore, it appears that the only way that Congress will be \n     able to get complete information on the health effects of \n     tobacco and nicotine is if your Committee holds comprehensive \n     hearings.\n       I know that you will conduct balanced hearings and I fully \n     expect that you would include witnesses from all points of \n     view, including representatives of the tobacco industry. This \n     will allow Congress, and the American people, to hear all \n     sides and be fully informed about the health effects of \n     tobacco and nicotine. This will also allow Congress to \n     consider pending legislation affecting tobacco in a well \n     educated manner.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this request. I would \n     be happy to work with you so that these hearings can be held \n     as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n     Frank Lautenberg.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1154-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR RECONVENING OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, let me indicate that I think we have \naccomplished a great deal this year in the Senate, and we will \naccomplish a great deal more. Normally there is a period of recess for \nLincoln's birthday so Republicans can go out and do whatever they do \nduring that week, and then there is a later period of a week for \nDemocrats.\n  I regret that we could not adjourn the Senate to accommodate many \nmembers of the staff who will now be required probably to stay here, \nbecause if we take a look at last year, we came in early in January and \nstayed throughout the year with hardly any breaks. I am not complaining \nabout that, but those are the facts. I should know. I think we may have \nset records with the number of votes and the number of hours in \nsession. It was truly a remarkable year, and we accomplished a great \ndeal. We have a great deal more to do this year. I regret that we were \nunable to just recess. There will be no votes until February 27, and \nperhaps members of the staff whom I am looking at now can work out some \nlittle time to have some relaxation and rest because they certainly \ndeserve it. We have had long sessions. We have been in late at night \nand some of us were here during the holidays negotiating with the \nPresident trying to work out a budget agreement. We do not have it yet. \n\n\n[[Page S1159]]\n\n\n  America's Governors may have moved it along a little bit. We are \nstill not in accord with the President, and we hope that might be \npossible. I must say the American people will only accept a good \nagreement, not a game of arithmetic, but policy changes that will mean \na great deal to the American people, bring interest rates down a couple \nof percent so that when you buy a home or car or borrow money for one \nof your children going to college or whatever, you will pay 2 percent \nless interest. The American people can understand that. That is what \nthe first session was all about, and that is what the second session is \ngoing to be all about.\n  In the meantime, today we passed historic farm legislation. We passed \na very significant DOD authorization report. We passed a START II \nTreaty which the President requested in his State of the Union Message. \nWe had all the work done before and we were just waiting for a vote.\n  We also passed the telecommunications bill, probably the biggest jobs \nbill in this decade. We have done all that plus public housing reform, \nwhich was very significant legislation.\n  So I do not want the Record to only reflect the statements I heard \nearlier from my friend from Ohio, Senator Glenn, and the Senator from \nMichigan, Senator Levin, that it has been sort of a waste of time. \nBecause there will be no votes does not mean that there will not be \nhearings and progress, and I am certain my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle will either be here working or be at home working. I think \nthat from time to time it is good to go home and find out what the \npeople are thinking.\n  It is not 3 weeks. It is about 2 weeks--10 days--10 days. So we will \nbe back. In the interim, if there is anything that should be done, \nobviously we are going to be in here on this Friday, and next week \nthere are pro forma sessions, and then we are in again for a couple \nhours each day and we can take care of any business that might come \nbefore the Senate.\n\n  So I want to thank all of my colleagues for their help and their \ncooperation so far this year. It is going to be a long year. There will \nbe a lot of work to do, but I believe we can accomplish what we set out \nto do in the first place--welfare reform, balance the budget, \nregulatory reform, tax relief for families with children, all those \nthings that are so necessary if we are going to get the economy moving \nagain and if we are going to have that hope and optimism that the \nAmerican people are looking for. So I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/07/senate-section/article/S1158-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
