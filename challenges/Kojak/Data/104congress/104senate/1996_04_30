Mr. President, for colleagues who may be watching by \ntheir TV monitors, Senator Chafee and I have taken this time this \nmorning to talk, once again, about the so-called Chafee-Breaux centrist \ncoalition proposal, which I think is monumental legislation in that it \npresents to the Senate a way to achieve a balanced budget in a 7-year \nperiod and do so in a bipartisan fashion.\n  A lot of people have said that something of this nature cannot be \naccomplished in an election year. Our operations and the legislation \nthat we offer proves that it can be done. We have met since October \n1995, last year, on a regular basis, sitting down and discussing the \ndifficult problems that are facing this Congress. It is very clear that \nthe alternative of doing nothing is not a real alternative.\n  Unless we get a handle on entitlement spending, and unless we make \nmajor changes in the entitlement programs, our country is going to be \nin very, very serious trouble. The alternative, I think, is a bright \nfuture for this country and for our children. With a balanced budget, \npeople see a number of benefits that are real, that are tangible, that \naffect their daily lives--lower interest rates on home mortgages, lower \ninterest rates on car notes, more spendable money to spend at home on \nthe things that families need in terms of education and health care.\n  We have presented a package for our colleagues to consider, and we \nhope that after reading our plan, they will join with us in a true \nbipartisan fashion and move on and enact a balanced budget in this \nCongress. It is not too late. It is only too late if we do nothing. It \nis absolutely critical that we take this step in this Congress.\n  I point out that here we talked about how close we are in the various \nproposals. There is much similarity in the administration's latest \nproposal and the proposal from the Republicans and the proposal from \nour centrist coalition, the Chafee-Breaux proposal. There is no reason \nthat, with all of these things that we have already agreed on, we \ncannot take the next step and work out the differences that still \nexist.\n  All three proposals have a balanced budget using CBO numbers. We save \nbetween $600 and $700 billion over the life of this plan, and we do it \nwhile protecting the needs of the must vulnerable in our country--the \npeople on Medicaid, Medicare, and welfare. So it is not to say that you \ncannot save between $600 and $700 billion and not at the same\n\n[[Page S4370]]\n\ntime protect the most vulnerable in our population.\n  Our Medicare proposal is real reform. It is not just cutting \nMedicare, but it is real reform in a major way in the programs, giving \nbeneficiaries more choices, which will increase the solvency of the \ntrust funds. We make reductions in spending. It is not as much as some \nwould like, but it is more than others would like. In Medicaid, we have \nworked with the Governors in a bipartisan fashion to come up with our \nMedicaid plan, which I think has gotten a lot of support from the \nGovernors. Democratic Governors have said they would like this to be \ndone. Republicans, I think, would agree with the direction we are \nmoving in. It maintains flexibility and some of the standards. It is \nbasically a Federal program working with the States.\n  Yes, there should be Federal standards about how the programs are \ngoing to be worked out. On welfare, as President Clinton said, a \nwelfare reform bill should be tough on work but good for kids. Our plan \ndoes that. Our plan takes care of children. It provides more child \nfunding for parents who are working, for child care and day care. At \nthe same time, we have vouchers for children after their parents are \nterminated off of welfare. If the parents are able to work, they should \nwork. Welfare cannot be a permanent way of life. We have time limits. \nWe have a block grant to the States. Yes, there is more cooperation \nbetween the States and the Federal Government as to what they have to \ndo.\n  Yes, we have a tax cut. Some say we need a $245 billion tax cut. \nWell, we have a real $105 billion tax cut, with $25 billion of loophole \nclosings, which I think most people can agree to. We have a tax cut for \nfamilies, $250 per child tax cut, which goes up to $500 per child if \nthey invest in an individual retirement account in that child's name. \nWe have reductions for education. This is a family friendly tax \nproposal in the sense that it helps working families. We have some \nalternative minimum tax relief, which many people will agree we should \nhave. We have a capital gains tax cut, which we think is important to \ncreate economic incentives for individuals and for corporations in this \ncountry.\n  Finally, we have an adjustment in the Consumer Price Index. A lot of \npeople said you cannot do that. Well, we have done that in a bipartisan \nfashion. Economists who are both Republican and Democrat have told us \nthat the CPI, Consumer Price Index, which is the vehicle that is used \nto project all of the cost-of-living adjustments, is overstating what \nthose adjustments should be.\n  So we have taken the step of saying we are going to have a reduction \nof five-tenths of 1 percent, one-half of 1 percent for 2 years and then \nthree-tenths of 1 percent for the remaining years in our budget plan. \nThat saves $110 billion. For a Social Security recipient, it means, \ninstead of getting the normal increase, they would still get an \nincrease in their benefits, but it would be approximately $3 less than \nthey would normally get per month. But what it does is help save the \nsystem.\n  I suggest that most people who are on retirement programs would say \nit is important to save the system, not only for me as a selfish reason \nbut for my children and my grandchildren, and we are asking everybody \nto have a more realistic adjustment in what their increases should be--\nstill get an increase if the cost of living goes up, of course, but \nguaranteed, guaranteed in a better fashion because the system is going \nto be stronger. All of the retirement programs will be stronger and \nmore solvent as a result of our Consumer Price Index adjustment. People \nwill get an increase. The increase will be smaller than it might have \nbeen, but the principle is that the formula is incorrect, and we are \ntrying to correct the formula. What is wrong with that?\n  So, Mr. President, let me reserve my time and conclude by saying that \nthere is going to be an opportunity perhaps in the next couple of weeks \nto present our budget in this Chamber, to have our colleagues take a \nlook at it and to, yes, vote for it because we think it truly \nrepresents the only bipartisan effort that has a real chance of passing \nand getting the job done.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to ask the Senator from Louisiana a \ncouple of questions, if I might, on my time.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Sure.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I should like to say to the distinguished Senator that I \nencounter fellow Senators who say, ``I'm all for your plan except I \ndon't like the tax cut,'' or, ``I am all for your plan except I don't \nlike that change in the Consumer Price Index,'' or, ``That's an \nexcellent plan, but the Medicare number isn't the one I like.''\n  Now, my question to the Senator from Louisiana is, What other vehicle \nis going to be presented that fixes these problems? If they do not \naccept our proposal, the proposal of the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana and I and this wonderful group of bipartisan Senators working \nwith us, if they do not like that, what else has a chance at being \nenacted that is going to balance this budget, not only at the end of \nthe seventh year but in the outyears as well?\n  Mr. BREAUX. If the Senator will yield for a response to the question, \nthe Senator has outlined a formula for failure, a formula for disaster. \nIf every Member comes up and says, ``I like what you have done except \none little item,'' we will never get any agreement. The essence of the \nagreement on this issue is a compromise between those who want to do it \nall one way or all the other way. So, yes, there will be differences, \nas there was--and I know the Senator remembers this--in our own \ndiscussions. The Members said, ``It is a little too far in this \ndirection,'' or, ``It is not far enough in that direction.''\n  What we have shown, however, is that you can come together in a \nbipartisan fashion and reach an agreement that gets the job done. I \nthink it is a genuine compromise. That is the only way the job can get \ndone.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The distinguished Senator from Vermont is here and has \nsome comments on this, and I know he has duties presiding in a few \nminutes, so I would like to yield whatever time he wishes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator very much, my good friend from \nRhode Island. I am pleased to be here again this morning to talk about \nthe importance of adopting a balanced budget in this Congress.\n  As the speakers before me have outlined, it is extremely serious, and \nthis may be the only opportunity we have now that we have a group of \nmoderates who believe very strongly that there is a solution and that \nif we all sit down together and reason, we can have a balanced budget. \nI believe that very strongly.\n  The last time I spoke here, I spoke as a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee and of the dire need with respect to the ability to \nappropriate to bring the entitlements under control. I suggested at \nthat time that we had some difficult decisions to make in that regard. \nIn particular, we have to look at the CPI and also we have to look at \nentitlements, especially those in the area of Medicaid and Medicare, to \nfind ways to better handle them so that we do not continue the rapid \nincrease we have in expenditures, which has made it imperative that we \nget together on a balanced budget.\n  Today I would like to speak to you as the chairman of the Senate \nEducation Committee. Those of us who depend upon discretionary funds to \naccomplish those goals which we have set out look at the future and \nrealize that with the increasing needs we have because of international \ncompetition in the area of education, there is no way we can reach \nthose by depending upon our State and local governments to raise those \nfunds, especially if you take a look at what the present trends show \nwould be necessary to cut back on discretionary spending, especially \nthe nonmilitary discretionary spending.\n  Let me briefly outline to you some of the dire consequences with \nrespect to education.\n  On the one hand, we have recognized now for over a decade the \nincredible need we have to improve our educational system, in \nparticular to meet the demands of international competition. Study \nafter study has shown that if we do not change and improve our \neducational system, then in the next century the United States will no\n\n[[Page S4371]]\n\nlonger be an economic power but will be a second-rate power.\n  What is the rationale and what are some of the reasons for that \nconclusion? First of all, international studies comparing our young \npeople with those of other nations have shown that this country, which \nhas been proud of its educational system, ranks dead last when it comes \nto the ability of our young people with respect to mathematics, with \nChina, a growing economic power, being by far the leader with respect \nto education of its students in mathematics.\n  In addition, even a more horrible situation is the fact of the so-\ncalled forgotten half. The forgotten half are those individuals who are \nnot college bound. We have not paid much attention to that group. In \nfact, studies that have been done by those who measure literacy found \nthat half of our students who graduate from high school are \nfunctionally illiterate. That has to be turned around.\n  That is not even taking into consideration the fact that in some \ncases up to 30 percent of the students have already dropped out of high \nschool. If you add those percentages together, you can see that this \nNation's might with respect to education capacity is not there.\n  What do we do to change that? I am not one who would be up there to \ndisagree with those who say you just cannot throw money at and improve \neducation. That is a fact. What you cannot do is say you must cut back \non education. Now we have suddenly gotten the message, at least from \nthe people as well as from those who are discussing it, that cutting \neducation is the poorest thing we can do.\n  But, again, I wish to point out that if we do not do something about \nbalancing the budget, the impact upon discretionary spending is going \nto be so dramatic we cannot escape the fact we may have to start \ncutting back on education. That would put this Nation in dire peril. \nThe public agrees with this; 86 percent say do not cut education, and \n80 percent of those who said balance the budget said, yes, but do not \ncut education.\n  Congress heard that message this time, and we were able to escape. \nDue to the efforts of the Senator from Maine and others, we were able \nto stop, for instance, the tendency to seriously cut back on funding \nwith respect to higher education. We were able to stop that and to keep \nit steady rather than having the dramatic cuts that were suggested by \nthe other body.\n  In addition to that, the work of the senior Senator from Pennsylvania \nwas very dramatic in the final analysis on the need not to cut back on \neducation, and we finally recognized that we could not and we did not \nthis time cut education. But the pressures in the future are going to \nbe very dramatic.\n  Let me conclude by pointing out again there are dramatic needs in \neducation that must be fulfilled. For instance, if we were to match \nwhat other countries do with respect to days spent in education--China \nspends 250 days a year in education; we spend 180, and all of the other \nnations, our international competition in Asia and Europe, average \nabout 220 days--we would have to appropriate, in order to get even with \nthe average, some $76 billion to spread over the States. That is just \none example. I could go on.\n  Let me just stop and say we have an opportunity here through the \nleadership of Senator Chafee and Senator Breaux to be able to bring \ninto check the decrease in the spending of the discretionary funds \nwhich will be necessary if we do not adopt a plan such as theirs.\n  I commend them for their effort. I intend to work as hard as I can in \norder to bring the spending under control so that we do not have to \nhave the negative impact upon education which we will have to have if \nwe do not do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Chafee, is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, first I would like to thank the Senator \nfrom Vermont for his effective comments.\n  I notice the senior Senator from Pennsylvania is here. I would be \nglad to hear his views on this subject.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able Senator from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Specter, is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island for yielding to me, and I congratulate him and the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, for the \ntremendous amount of work and success which they have brought into a \nprogram for a 7-year balanced budget.\n  My sense is that with a centrist approach, which is represented by \nthe charts which Senator Breaux has spoken about and the one which is \nnext to Senator Chafee, we can have a balanced budget, and we can do it \nwith a scalpel and not with a meat ax.\n  The bill which we passed last week and which was signed by the \nPresident is illustrative, in my judgment, of what we can do if we \nreally set our minds to it. I chair the Subcommittee on Labor, Health, \nHuman Services and Education. And, as I have said on this floor, it has \nbeen an embarrassment to me that that bill could be brought to the \nfloor at a much, much earlier time. I will not review the bidding as to \nwhy it could not be brought to the floor, but suffice it to say that \nthere were riders which kept it from consideration by the Senate.\n  Then Senator Harkin, the ranking member on the subcommittee, and I \ncrafted an amendment to add $2.7 billion, significantly for education, \nbut also for health, human services, and worker safety. That amendment \npassed the Senate by a vote of 84 to 16, which is obviously a very \nstrong bipartisan showing.\n  We then went to conference with the House of Representatives. The \nvery difficult part is finding the figures which will be signed by the \nPresident and which will be acceptable to the House of Representatives. \nWe had 20 hours of negotiations over 2 days, and we finally worked it \nthrough on the House-Senate conference with the House conferees to \nbring it to a narrow 6-to-5 vote, but it was accomplished.\n  I believe that is indicative of what we can do with this centrist \napproach. It is my hope that this will be reduced to bill form and that \nwe will put it forward.\n  I have urged my colleague, Senator Chafee, to bring the proposal to \nthe floor and to bring it to a vote because I believe that there are \nmany Senators, besides the 20 or so who have joined in these meetings, \nwho would be willing to support it if it came to the Senate floor for a \nvote.\n  It is reminiscent of the tremendous job which the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, did on health care back in \n1992, 1993, and 1994. He had so many meetings in his office at 8:30 in \nthe morning every Thursday that most of us should have been lessees. We \nshould have paid rent over there.\n  One of the concerns that I had on the tremendous job which he did was \nthat it never came to the floor for a vote under the time of pressure \nfor which I think we would have enacted that bill. He did set the \nstage, I think, for those of us working with him, and under Senator \nChafee's leadership, for the legislation which was passed last week, \nthe Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. This bill, which is targeted, did not have \nthe problems of the administration's bill which was a complete \nrevolution.\n  So that with this centrist approach, I think we have it. I hope we \nwill bring it to the floor. I think it is the model for accommodation, \nand I am glad to be a part of the team.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues who yielded the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania for his kind remarks and for the wonderful work and help \nwhich he has given us on this.\n  I would like to turn back, if I might, to the Senator from Louisiana \nbecause both of us have encountered, as I have previously mentioned, \nobjections to specifics here. But this is not exactly unknown \nterritory.\n  Let me suggest to the Senator from Louisiana that a bill went through \nthis body which had high tax cuts. It did not have the corrections to \nit in the CPI. And that bill, as I recall, did not get enacted into \nlaw. In other words, one approach was tried which many people here say, \n``Oh, we need more\n\n[[Page S4372]]\n\ntaxes. We do not like this. You only have $130 billion in taxes. You \nought to have $245 billion.'' OK. We tried that.\n  Am I correct in saying that?\n  Mr. BREAUX. The Senator is absolutely correct. We discussed and had \nheated discussions about the size of all of these reductions in \nspending as well as the size of the tax cut. But this is reflective of \na genuine compromise reached between people of differing opinions. But \nit reflects, I think, the only way we can get the job done.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. So when those others say do it this way or do it that \nway, there is no other train leaving the station that I am aware of \nthat is going to reach the terminal point successfully. In other words, \nthe President has indicated that, and the Democratic leadership has \nindicated that they do not want high tax cuts.\n  Am I correct in that?\n  Mr. BREAUX. The Senator is correct. I think both sides have sort of \npolarized on whether to have a tax cut or not. But we have tried to \nlisten to both sides and try to come up with a recommendation that \nmeets the concerns of both sides but reflects a true compromise.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is the point that I would like to get across to our \nlisteners and viewers--that it is easy to be critical. It is easy to \nsay, ``oh, no. Do not fool with that CPI, that Consumer Price Index, \nand the Medicare figure is too high. We do not like what you have done \non welfare. The Republican Governors do not like what you have done \ntotally on welfare an area that has been mentioned before briefly.\n  We make some savings out of Medicare, or actually what we do is we \nreduce the rate of growth over the next 7 years. Medicare, unless \nsomething is done, is truly going to go broke.\n\n  People say, ``Oh, we have heard you people say that around here on \nthis floor before.'' All right, let us just look and see what has \nhappened. We have two recent reports. The New York Times reported last \nTuesday that the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund--which is the \nfund that pays the hospital bills for the elderly--operated at a loss \nfor the first 6 months of this current fiscal year. It fell short, the \noutflow as compared to the income, fell $4 billion short in that brief \ntime.\n  So once upon a time we were bringing in more revenue than we were \nexpending and we built up a surplus. Now the lines on the graph have \ncrossed and the expenditures are exceeding the income. That is not \ngoing to change unless we do some things.\n  Yesterday's Washington Post reported the Congressional Budget Office \nnow believes the Medicare trust fund will become insolvent in the year \n2001. When we started on this exercise just a few months ago we thought \nit was going to go insolvent in 2002, so in just a few months we have \nseen the fiscal situation of the trust fund deteriorate by a year. So, \nunless something is done in this Medicare Program, along the lines that \nwe have suggested, the Medicare trust fund, which pays the hospital \ncosts of the elderly in this Nation, is going to go broke. That is \nsomething we ought to take very, very seriously.\n  I read a comment the other day in the newspaper where somebody said, \n``Oh, don't believe that. We are going to take care of it.'' It is not \neasy to take care of some of these situations once the downward spiral \nstarts and the expenses exceed the income. Once that starts there is \nreally serious trouble ahead.\n  I would like to now touch briefly on the Consumer Price Index. The \nConsumer Price Index has clearly been overstated. What we do, as the \nSenator from Louisiana pointed out, in our group, we say let us state \nthe Consumer Price Index accurately. So that is what we have done. That \nresults, fortunately, in dramatic savings, not just over this 7-year \nperiod, but for the outyears as well. So, a key part of our proposal \nhere is the recognition of the fact that the Consumer Price Index is \noverstated. We hope our fellow Senators, paying attention, listening \nand studying this situation, will come to the conclusion that we have, \nthat it is essential to state the Consumer Price Index in an accurate \nform. That results, as I mentioned, in our calculations, of a $110 \nbillion savings over the 7-year period with dramatic savings in the \noutyears, and which will mean, as the Senator from Louisiana briefly \nsaid, that Social Security and Medicare will be here in the future \nyears.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to ask a question of the distinguished Senator from \nRhode Island, because he was talking about the Consumer Price Index \nadjustment. He and I served on the Senate Finance Committee together. \nWe know we had asked for a study by a commission to report to the \nFinance Committee. I think the commission was asked for by the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, and, at that \ntime, Senator Packwood, to report to us as to whether the CPI, the \nConsumer Price Index, was correctly reporting the cost of living or \nnot. That commission made a preliminary report and said no, it is \nincorrect, in that it overstates inflation by anywhere between 0.7 \npercent up to 2 percent.\n  So what we have done is suggest we make an adjustment, that we make a \ncorrection, that we make it more accurate than it was before. Our plan \nsays we are going to take a low estimate--let us use one-half of 1 \npercent--and make the adjustment there.\n  It seems to me, and I ask the Senator, that what we are suggesting \nmakes such great sense I am wondering if he could comment on why there \nis so much opposition. It seems no one wants to touch this part of our \nplan for fear of the political consequences. Could the Senator shed \nsome light on why something that seems so reasonable is such a problem \nto do?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I think the answer to this is that people really do not \nwant to get into trying to solve these dramatic problems that are out \nthere in connection with the entitlements. The word ``entitlement'' is \none we toss around here, but what are entitlements? Entitlements are, \nprincipally, Social Security. But they are also Medicare, Medicaid, and \nwelfare. We believe--and it is not just us but every serious student of \nthe deficit of this Nation and the direction we are going has said so--\nit is essential to get the expenditures in these entitlement programs \nunder control or there just plain will not be money to pay for them in \nthe future years.\n  So when we began looking into this in the Finance Committee, as the \nSenator from Louisiana indicated, Chairman Alan Greenspan of the \nFederal Reserve came and testified before us and he said you should \nlook into the Consumer Price Index, and whether it is accurately \nstated? It was his view, which was corroborated by further studies, \nthat the Consumer Price Index is overstated and the Consumer Price \nIndex is the basis on which the cost of living adjustments are computed \nfor Social Security, for pensions, indeed, for the Tax Code.\n  So we looked into this further. As the Senator said, we set up a \ncommission to look into what is the accurate Consumer Price Index. As \nthe Senator said, the preliminary report has come back saying that as \ncurrently computed it is overstated somewhere between, on the low side \n0.7 percent, on the high side 2 percent.\n  So we looked at that, here is 2 percent way up here, 0.7 percent \nhere. We said we will not go as high as either of those figures. We \nwill only make an adjustment of 0.5 percent, from the Consumer Price \nIndex. Actually, we would make really tremendous savings if we, for \nexample, took the 2 percent.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Yes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. But we chose not to do that, as the Senator recalls.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Let me thank the Senator for that comment. I want to talk \nabout why we did what we did with regard to the CPI adjustment, because \nit is controversial. But I think, as our colleagues understand better \nwhat it actually does in the real world, they will agree with us that \nit is the right thing to do. I think it is the correct thing to do, not \nonly economically, I think politically it is the correct thing to do \nbecause we are telling senior citizens and everybody else who benefits \nfrom programs that are indexed for inflation, that we are going to take \nthe steps necessary to make sure the program is there for the future. \nUnless some corrections are made, you are\n\n[[Page S4373]]\n\ngoing to have an indexed program that does not have any money in it. So \nif the program is broke, what in the world is the benefit of having it \nindexed to inflation if there is no money left in the Treasury?\n  I will give an example. Just with the Social Security Program, the \nestimates are, by the year 2030, the number of people receiving \nbenefits is expected to rise to 43 beneficiaries for every 100 workers. \nRight now it is 27 beneficiaries for every 100 workers. There is an \nexplosion with the baby boomers who are going to be retiring. What that \nmeans in real terms is that by the year 2013, not that far off--by the \nyear 2013, Social Security benefit payments will exceed the tax \nrevenues dedicated to the program.\n  That simply means we are going to be paying out more than we are \ntaking in. So if we are going to pay out more than we are taking in, \nwhat benefit is it to say it is indexed and I will get an increase \nevery year to make up for inflation? If you do not have any money left \nin the pot, it does not matter it is indexed to any kind of standard \nbecause there is no money left to pay a person.\n  So what we have suggested is a fix in this area. It is not the only \nway to solve the problem, but it is part of a package. Increasing \ngradually the retirement age is part of that suggestion, and that I \nsupport as well.\n  Let me tell you what that means in the real world. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a table which is entitled \n``Impact of 0.5 percent CPI Change on Social Security Beneficiaries.''\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            IMPACT OF 0.5 PERCENT CPI CHANGE ON SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFICIARIES                                           \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                     1995       1996       1997       1998       1999       2000       2001       2002  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAverage Monthly SS Benefit......................................        637        656        676        696        717        738        761        783\nAverage Monthly SS Benefit CPI--0.5 Percent.....................        637        653        669        686        703        721        739        757\nAverage Monthly Difference......................................  .........          3          7         10         14         18         22         26\nAverage Yearly Difference.......................................  .........         38         79        121        166        213        263        315\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. What this simply shows is that it has a very small dollar \nimpact on a retiree when you look at the great benefits of shoring up \nthe system. For instance, the average Social Security monthly benefit \nin 1995 was $637 a month. With no change at all, that will go up to \n$656 a month in 1996.\n  With our change--and people say, ``Oh, it's so difficult. It is \nimpossible to do politically. You will have all the seniors unhappy. It \nis a terrible thing to do''--with our change the person who is \naveraging $637 per month in 1995 will still get an increase next year; \nit will go up to $653 instead of $656. That is $3 less. It still is a \nsubstantial increase.\n  What is more important, it is a more accurate increase because it \nmore accurately reflects what the adjustment should be. How can anyone \nstand up and say, ``Not only am I going to have my benefits increased \nfor inflation, guaranteeing an annual increase, but I want it to be \noverstated, I want it to be inaccurate, and I want it to be a mistake, \nwhich determines how much I get.''\n  How can anyone stand up and say, ``I want an error in the adjustment \nof what the increase should be to determine how much I'm going to get \nfrom my Government,'' putting in jeopardy the entire program for future \ngenerations? I cannot think of a senior who would ever want to stand up \nand say, ``I want more than an inflation adjustment accurately says I \nshould get,'' when it runs the risk of destroying the very program that \ntheir children and grandchildren, as well as themselves, have come to \ndepend on.\n  So we have taken a great, courageous political step, some say. I \nthink it is a factual step that has to be taken in order to preserve \nthe system. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Louisiana \nthat this step is simply the right thing to do. All we are doing is \nsaying, let the Consumer Price Index be accurately stated. That is what \nwe have chosen to do here.\n  Some have labeled that a very courageous step. We did not look on it \nthat way. We think of it as the logical step to take to state the CPI \nmore accurately. Likewise, there is, as the Senator from Louisiana so \naptly stated, a tremendous benefit to doing that. Otherwise, unless we \ndo it, the Social Security system is going to go under water.\n  I see the Senator from Washington here, and I am glad to hear his \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last Thursday, I appeared with the two \ndistinguished Senators from Rhode Island and Louisiana and a large \nnumber of others to speak in favor of their bipartisan balanced budget \nproposal on which I have worked under their tutelage over the course of \nthe last several months.\n  I do not need to repeat the history which led to this point or, for \nthat matter, the details of the proposal itself, except to say, Mr. \nPresident, that this is, in fact, a balanced budget, a truly balanced \nbudget by making real changes in the way in which we manage spending \nprograms in this country, true reforms in entitlement programs, to a \ncertain extent, and, in particular, reforms that were not even included \nin the balanced budget that were passed by this body in December. So \nfrom a substantive point of view, it is very real.\n  Mr. President, the only other comment about the program that I have \nto say is this. At one level, of course, balancing the budget is almost \na moral course of action. It is simply wrong morally and ethically for \nus to continue year after year spending hundreds of billions of dollars \non services that we want but are unwilling to pay for, and then sending \nthe bill for those services to our children and to our grandchildren. \nBeyond it simply being wrong, Mr. President, it is destructive of \nopportunity for future generations.\n\n  We are convinced and we are told by those who are economic experts \nthat a balanced budget, even the clear promise of a balanced budget, \nwith policy changes that will lead to that point, will mean more money \nfor the Federal Government from the present tax system because of lower \ninterest rates and greater prosperity, but, more significantly than \nthat, more money in the pockets of American citizens, more jobs, better \njobs, lower interest rates on homes and automobiles and other major \npurchases people make. There is a tremendous fiscal dividend to be had \nfrom a balanced budget, not only for the Government but more \nimportantly for our citizens.\n  I will conclude, Mr. President, by saying that I believe that the two \nSenators who have led this effort deserve the gratitude not just of the \nMembers of the Senate and of the Congress, but of the American people. \nThey have not to this point gotten the publicity, the public \nacceptance, the public knowledge, for that matter, of this proposal \nthat they deserve. But they have soldiered on to a point at which this \nis a very real alternative and one I hope that Members of both parties \nand the President of the United States will accept.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nthose very generous remarks. I appreciate the kind words he said. Let \nme just say that we cannot go too far wrong if we are doing something \nright for the future generations of this Nation.\n  It is absolutely clear that, if we continue on the present course, \ntrying to fund these entitlements--Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, \nwelfare--without changes, it is clearly going to bankrupt the Nation. \nYou see some projections that estimate an individual\n\n[[Page S4374]]\n\nwill have to pay 80 percent of his or her earnings to the Federal \nGovernment in order to sustain these programs in future years. They are \nclearly out of control.\n  That is why we try to bring them under control. It is not just us \npredicting this. It is already happening, and ahead of schedule, as we \nsee with the Medicare Program.\n  The Senator from Colorado is here, the senior Senator from Colorado. \nI will be delighted to hear his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from \nLouisiana for their leadership on this project.\n  Mr. President, why in the world would you have a budget process going \non separately from the committee? I think there are some simple truths \nthat lay out why. The reality is that this Congress tried to control \nspending. They did it by proposing increases last year of roughly 3-\npercent. That may not sound like cuts to people outside the U.S. \nCongress, but in reality a 3-percent increase was less than the rate we \nhad been on and less than what the natural law provides with the \nautomatic increases in a variety of programs.\n  The President honestly, sincerely felt that we ought to increase \nspending at least 4, 4.5 percent. Thus, they did not reach agreement. \nMr. President, that fact has not gone away. The reality is that the \nPresident of the United States wants much more in the way of an \nincrease in spending than the Republican Congress wants. There is no \nway around that. It is not going to change tomorrow.\n  I think we all hope that the President will sit down with Congress \nand work out an arrangement. But that has been tried, and the reality \nis, the two parties have dramatically different views of what is good \nfor the country. The President sincerely believes we need to increase \nspending more than the Republicans want to increase spending.\n  Mr. President, the only salvation for us is a bipartisan effort in \nCongress that comes up with enough votes to override the President's \nveto. That is a simple reality and a simple fact. If we did not develop \na budget that does that, we did not achieve any progress. That is why I \nthink this proposal has so much merit.\n  It is a bipartisan proposal. Is it as strong as I would like? Of \ncourse not. The reality is we ought to be cutting spending, not \nincreasing it at a slower rate. Anybody who looks at their family \nbudget knows that. But this is dramatically better than no progress at \nall, and it is the one alternative we have this year to make some \nprogress.\n  There are some other facts that are realistic, too. Medicare is going \nto be insolvent. We can debate about whether it is going be 5 years or \n6 years or 4 years, but it is going to be insolvent. The American \npeople are not well served if you let it go to a position where it is \ninsolvent. Social Security is going to be insolvent. It may be 20 \nyears, it may be 25 years, but it will be insolvent.\n  To pretend you are somehow helping the American people by running \nthese trust funds into insolvency is ludicrous. The American people \nknow it is ludicrous. The American people want a Congress that will \ndeal with the problems, not hide from them, not gloss them over, not \npretend they do not exist. They want it done fairly, they want it done \nevenhandedly. Mr. President, this budget offers a bipartisan way to \nresolve our financial difficulties.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator from Colorado for those excellent \nremarks.\n  I yield what time the Senator from Utah needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the two Johns--\nChafee of Rhode Island and Breaux of Louisiana--for the leadership they \nhave shown and for the tenacity which they have maintained throughout \nthis process.\n  As I go home to Utah, I have two reactions from people, as they go \nthrough the process and go through what we have done here. The first \none that comes from people, who are, perhaps, more partisan than some \nothers, is to find some aspect of this thing and complain. ``How can \nyou, Senator Bennett, support''--fill in the gap--and the reaction is, \n``No, I do not support that. You are right, I campaigned against \nthat.'' ``Well, how can you stand here and say that this was a good \nthing that you have been involved in?\"\n  And then we get to the second reaction, which comes from many of the \nsame people, but includes a broader spectrum, and it is summarized, \n``Can you guys not get your act together back there and solve some of \nthese problems?'' ``Why are you so partisan that you cannot address the \nfundamental issues of the country.'' ``Instead of a Democratic or \nRepublican solution,'' one of my constituents said, ``is there not an \nAmerican solution?'' I am not so filled with hubris as to say the \nresult here is the ``American solution'' as opposed to the Republican \nor Democratic solution.\n  I remember something my father used to say when talking about his \nexperience in the Senate. He said, ``We legislate at the highest level \nat which we can obtain a majority.'' I think that is the driving force \nhere--that we have recognized that there will be things in the bill \nthat I will hate. There will be things in the bill that I will really \nlike and that folks on the other side will hate. But we legislate at \nthe highest level at which we can obtain a majority. And the way we \nobtain a majority is to talk to each other and work things out and make \nthe kinds of changes and understandings that we have to make in order \nto get there.\n  Unfortunately, in the circumstance we live in today, a majority is \nnot 51 votes; a majority is 60 votes. And you cannot get 60 votes in \nthe Senate if you do not have some give and take. So I salute the \ntenacity of the folks who have been involved in this process to keep at \nit and to keep both sides together and to keep both sides equal. I \nthink that is a powerful, powerful idea.\n\n  What are we doing, Mr. President? We are trying to solve the \nfinancial problems of the United States. What are the financial \nproblems of the United States? Quite simply, spending exceeds income at \nan increasing rate. That is very fundamental. So we have to address \nways of increasing income and ways of decreasing the growth of \nspending.\n  The thing that I endorse the most out of this is the recognition that \nthere are ways to increase income that defy the wisdom of the computers \nthat make straightforward extrapolations. The willingness of everyone \nto put a capital gains tax cut in this package is the most encouraging \nthing for me. The computers say it is going to cost us money. I know \nthe computers are wrong. I know that when we get actual experience, we \nwill find that cutting the capital gains tax rate, as this package \ndoes, will increase capital gains tax revenue. Every time we have done \nthat in history, that has been the result. Every time we have raised \nthe capital gains tax rate, we have reduced capital gains tax revenue. \nWhy we cannot get the computers programmed to recognize that fact is \nsomething I have quit arguing about, because I have been unable to \nbudge anybody who programs the computers. But the willingness of both \nsides to say, OK, we will score this as a revenue loss, even though I \nknow it is not, and we will pay for it because it is the right thing to \ndo, shows a degree of understanding that I think is terrific.\n  The other thing we do in this package that I salute is that we have \nthe willingness to confront the CPI. We have the willingness to say the \nConsumer Price Index is out of whack. The Consumer Price Index is \ndriving the increase in spending. We have to confront it, even though \nit produces a bonus for a lot of our citizens.\n  I am heartened by the courage of all 22 members of this group, \nDemocrats as well as Republicans, who looked each other in the eye and \nsaid, ``It is time for a little truth telling. Even though the CPI is \npolitically sensitive, it is time to do the right thing.''\n  So, Mr. President, as I said, I salute the two Johns for their \nleadership, and the other 20 members of the group, who stood together \non these crucial issues. I recognized immediately that there are things \nin the deal I do not like. But, ultimately, the direction in which\n\n[[Page S4375]]\n\nit moves us is the direction in which the country must go, in a \nbipartisan manner, lowering the temperature of the partisan arguments \nthat occur on this floor. I am proud to have been a part of the overall \neffort.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I will yield whatever time he needs to the \nSenator from Wyoming. I will conclude by pointing out that I think we \nhave laid out a good package. We have indicated that there will be an \nopportunity in the next week or so to present our package on the floor \nof the Senate as an amendment on a substitute to the Budget Committee \nresolution. We hope that between now and then we will have a chance to \ntalk to our colleagues and go into greater detail with them as to what \nour package contains, to try and answer the questions they have, \nknowing that it is not perfect, but that we think it represents a true \nand fair compromise.\n  With that, I yield to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we continue \nfor an additional 5 minutes in morning business, which will enable me \nto speak 4 minutes and conclude with either Senator Chafee or Senator \nBreaux.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I am pleased to join with Senators Chafee and Breaux, \nand the others of the centrist coalition, in announcing this plan. This \nis very comprehensive. I hope our colleagues will take a very clear \nlook at it. But I just so admire Senators Chafee and Breaux--tireless, \nable, caring, sensible people, trying to do a sensible thing. We cannot \ncontinue this raucous partisanship about who is doing what to who. \nMedicare cannot be touched and now, of course, it is going to go broke \na year, maybe 2 years, earlier than we thought 6 months ago. Here we \nrock along and, finally, we are addressing it in this proposal.\n  I am particularly pleased that we are looking at the Consumer Price \nIndex, and that we propose to reduce that CPI by one-half of a \npercentage point in 1997 and 1998, and by three-tenths of a percentage \npoint after that, for the purposes of computing the COLA's, the cost of \nliving allowances. And, of course, the AARP will shriek like a gut-shot \npanther and leap off their pinnacle down there at their temple, for \nwhich they pay $17 million a year rent. Please go see it. I hope \neverybody goes there. Get your shoes cleaned off before you go in, or \nyou will hurt the marble floors. It is quite a place. They will go \ncrazy on this. They will wail about tearing the back door down and the \nterrible effort to get Social Security benefits. And we are not cutting \nSocial Security benefits. That is not what is driving this issue.\n\n  What we are striving to do is have a more accurate CPI that reflects \nthe true level of inflation. This is the issue that is most important \nto the senior citizens of this country--inflation. This certainly does \ndrive seniors into doubt and concern. That is what we must do. It is \ninflation that eats away the seniors' lifetime savings.\n  So we have had the testimony from Alan Greenspan, and others, who \nbelieve the CPI is off the mark. We think this is a very valid step--\n$110 billion in savings over 7 years. That may not be a popular \nproposal, but it is critically important. If we were to do that for 10 \nyears on a 1 percent, which we are not dealing with, but that would be \n$680 billion over 10 years. The figures are huge and, exponentially, \nthey go on out.\n  So it is a total package. Some are not going to like things here, but \nit is a very good first step. We achieve some really significant \nreversal of what is happening to us as a country. I served on the \nEntitlements Commission, and we all know where we are headed.\n  I like the one about making Medicare eligibility link up with the \nSocial Security retirement age by gradually increasing that eligibility \nage. That acknowledges that life expectancy is higher now.\n  We are going to affluence test Medicare part B. I would have done \nmore of that. We say those who have annual incomes exceeding $50,000 \nand couples who have incomes exceeding $75,000 will be affluence \ntested. I certainly think we could do that at a lower income sometime, \nbut we do not have the votes to do it at this time.\n  We limit Medicaid. I would have liked to have seen more flexibility, \nbut I am not going to let that deter me from supporting this.\n  Everything here will have an objection from somebody, but the \ntotality of it overwhelmingly outweighs the concerns I have about these \nother things.\n  So in many other areas--taxes--I had my concerns. Here is a tax \npackage. I did not think we should just give away $250 for every child \nunder the age of 17, but in the spirit of cooperation and consensus, we \nwere able to address some of my concerns. There was not a single thing \nI addressed that was not met with the finest courtesy and genuine \nregard of what we were trying to do.\n  So I urge all my colleagues to consider the plan. Those who \nautomatically reject the notion of a bipartisan budget will have no \ntrouble at all finding one or two items to oppose it, but I am \nconvinced anyone who approaches the plan with an open mind and a \nrecognition that all true bipartisanship requires a great degree of \ncompromise--compromising an issue without compromising ourselves--will \nconclude this as an impressive plan. No tricks, no gimmickry, none of \nthe usual stuff. It makes the tough, politically unpopular decisions \nRepublicans and Democrats alike have been putting off for far too long.\n  I again thank sincerely Senator Chafee and Senator Breaux. They are \nstatesmen.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from Rhode Island \n[Mr. Chafee] is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, first, I want to thank each of the \nspeakers who took the trouble to come here today in support of this \neffort that Senator Breaux and I have the privilege of leading.\n  Second, I would like to say that what this is all about is future \ngenerations. Unless we do something about these entitlements, this \ncountry of ours is going to be in great financial and economic peril. \nIf we take these steps now that we have outlined, then there is a \nwonderful chance--it is not only a chance, it is a fact--that we can \nreverse the trends that are now underway in our two largest spending \nprograms--Social Security and Medicare--as well as Medicaid and \nwelfare.\n  So this is it. It is easy to criticize, and people, as I mentioned \nearlier, will say, ``I'm all for it, except for the CPI,'' or ``I'm all \nfor it, except for the Medicare number,'' or ``I don't like your tax \nfigure.'' But nobody else has come forward with a program that has the \nsupport of Senators on both sides of the aisle, Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  So this is it, and we hope that everybody, every single Senator in \nthis body will carefully consider what we have come up with. We \nsincerely hope that they will join with us. We want more people. There \nare 22 of us who have worked together on this since October. But 22 is \nnot enough, and it is not enough for Senators to say, ``Well, that's \npretty good. We'll see what else is going to come along.'' Nothing else \nis going to come along that we know of. We have been involved with this \nfor some time.\n  So we do seek support from our fellow Senators on both sides of the \naisle. The beneficiaries will be our children and our grandchildren, \nand that is a pretty worthwhile goal.\n  I thank the Chair and certainly thank my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Breaux, who has been terrific in the leadership he has given to \nthis program right from the beginning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/30/senate-section/article/S4369-6", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4375-S4376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO FORMER JUSTICE RICHARD L. ``RED'' JONES\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, retired Alabama Supreme Court Justice \nRichard ``Red'' Jones passed away on April 22. I had the pleasure of \nserving with him on the court in the mid-1970's, and remember well his \ngreat wit and ability to tell stories. He was also a true legal scholar \nwho approached cases and issues with zeal accompanied by seriousness. \nHe loved the law. He was always tenacious in his determination to \narrive at the correct decision under the law.\n  Red grew up in rural Pickens County, located in west-central Alabama, \nwhere he was known by his initials, ``R.L.'' People there continued to \nrefer to him as R.L. throughout his life, as opposed\n\n[[Page S4376]]\n\nto Richard, Dick, or Red. While he was growing up in this part of \nAlabama, he had an insatiable appetite for reading and for educating \nhimself. He loved to tell of how he took full advantage of the book \nmobiles that would come around during those days bringing books to \nresidents in rural areas.\n  Red attended law school at the University of Alabama. He began \npracticing law in Aliceville, AL, after obtaining his law degree. He \nlater practiced in Fairfield and eventually became a partner in a \nBessemer law firm. He then moved his law office to Birmingham, but had \nclients all over Alabama.\n  Red was an outstanding trial attorney. He handled many cases seeking \ncompensation for lung diseases suffered by coal miners and cotton gin \nworkers, and served for a time as the president of the Alabama \nPlaintiff Lawyers Association, now known as the Alabama Trial Lawyers \nAssociation. As a plaintiff attorney, he was highly regarded as an \nardent advocate by attorneys and judges in both the criminal and civil \nfields.\n  He served on the Alabama Supreme Court for a total of 18 years, from \n1973 to 1991. He was generally known for his keen understanding of the \nlaw and its majesty. He wrote his opinions in clear language so that \nall could understand them. While on the State's high court, he was \nconsistently supportive of all judicial reform efforts. He was a true \nchampion in the area of improving the administration of justice. He \noversaw the establishment of the unified judicial system, the rules of \nprocedure that govern the trials in both civil and criminal cases, and \nthe establishment of training programs for judges, clerks and \nregisters, judicial assistants, and court reporters. He participated in \nthe revision of the Alabama code, serving on the code revision \ncommittee.\n  One of the hallmarks of his esteemed career was his excellent service \nas commissioner of the uniform State law commission. This commission's \njob was to propose State laws which could serve as models for the \nStates, such as uniform commercial codes. He was highly regarded for \nhis work on the commission. As I traveled, I encountered people all \nover the country who praised his accomplishments in developing model \nState laws.\n  Red's sense of self-deprecating humor is something I will always \nremember about him. He had a way of putting people at ease through \nhumor and amusing stories, and often made himself the brunt of his own \njokes. As his pastor at Shades Valley Presbyterian Church said so \ncorrectly of him: ``He was a great talker, a great storyteller, and a \ngreat friend.'' It seemed as if he used humor to put serious problems \nand issues in their proper perspective so that personal passions and \nfeelings would not interfere with his decisionmaking. It helped him \nretain his objectivity when considering a case.\n  He had an abiding interest in serving others by volunteering his time \nin several civic organizations and associations that he felt would \nimprove the communities in which he lived or that he thought would \nadvance his profession. He believed strongly in country, family, and \nfaith.\n  At his funeral, Justice Hugh Maddox gave a warm eulogy to his long-\ntime friend, saying:\n\n       Red Jones had boundless energy, and although Red has passed \n     his baton to those of us who are still in the race . . . he \n     left with us the legacy of how the race should be run. He \n     prepared well, he was totally committed, and he ran with \n     endurance.\n\n  One of his last acts on the court a few years ago was to swear in \nAlabama's newest lawyers--among them his son, Rick Jones--who had \nrecently been admitted to the State bar.\n  Judge Red Jones was an outstanding lawyer, family man, and public \nservant. Everyone liked him and enjoyed his companionship. I will miss \nhim greatly.\n  I extend my sincerest condolences to his wife, Jean, and their entire \nfamily in the wake of this immeasurable and untimely loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/30/senate-section/article/S4375-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LEADERS PROMOTE DEMOCRACY IN VIETNAM\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, last week I hosted a meeting of the \nInternational Committee for a Free Vietnam [ICFV] which resulted in the \ndrafting and presentation of a resolution which promotes democracy in \nVietnam, particularly individual freedoms and human rights. Joining us \nwere Parliamentary leaders from Europe, Canada, and Australia. Since \nVietnamese leaders will hold their Eighth Party Congress in June, it is \nimportant that we communicate the reforms recommended in the resolution \nto the Vietnamese, to continue the dialogue begun as we continue to \nnormalize our relations with Vietnam.\n  While at the meeting, I was disturbed to learn that a distinguished \nmember of the group Col. Bui Tin, a former member of the Vietnamese \nCommunist Party, received a death threat which was alleged to originate \nfrom Vietnamese Government sources. He is not the only one who has \nreceived these threats, but he is the only one with whom I am \npersonally acquainted. It was very disappointing to me to hear this, \njust at the time we hope to improve our relationship with Vietnam.\n  Col. Bui Tin, a resident of Europe, has done nothing but advocate \ndemocratic reforms in Vietnam, consistent with the first-amendment \nrights we have in our country. He does so out of concern for the people \nof Vietnam, where he was a soldier for over 37 years.\n  I join many of my colleagues in urging the leaders of Vietnam to \ncease this kind of threat, which is just as egregious, if not more, as \nthe continuing imprisonment of many political prisoners in Vietnam \ntoday.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the resolution of the ICFV \nadopted on April 24, 1996, be printed in the Record for the information \nof all Senators.\n  There being no objection, the text of the resolution was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n         Resolution of the ICFV, Washington, DC, April 24, 1996\n\n       1. The representatives of the I.C.F.V. present at this \n     conference are united in this support for:\n       1.1. The rule of law, multiparty politics, free elections, \n     the release of political prisoners and prisoners of \n     conscience;\n       1.2. The recognition and implementation of human rights, \n     including the rights of free speech, freedom of association, \n     freedom of religious belief, and freedom from arbitrary \n     arrest, freedom to work; and\n       1.3. The obligation of all governments to consult their \n     people and to govern in accordance with their wishes.\n       2. Thus I.C.F.V. urges all parliamentary democracies to \n     support and extend assistance to the people of Vietnam on the \n     basis that the forthcoming Communist Party Congress \n     recognizes the principles embraced by this conference and \n     that the party and the Vietnamese government implement such \n     principles.\n       3. The conference recognizes the immense importance of \n     accurate and fair information on current events and issues \n     being made available to the people of Asia including Vietnam.\n       4. The conference urges the Parliaments of the countries \n     represented here including Australia, Canada, various \n     European countries and the U.S.A. to make funds available for \n     enlarging existing surrogate home radio services to Asia, to \n     broadcast otherwise unavailable news and current information \n     to the countries of the region.\n       5. The conference urges the government of the United States \n     to promote Radio Free Asia.\n       6. The representative of the I.C.F.V. will seek to open a \n     meaningful, comprehensive dialogue with representatives of \n     the Vietnamese government and Communist party.\n       7. The conference expresses its appreciation for those \n     courageous persons in Vietnam who speak out for truth, \n     democratic values and human rights.\n       8. The conference reaffirms the I.C.F.V.'s commitment to \n     democratic and nonviolent change in Vietnam.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/30/senate-section/article/S4376-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Under the previous order, the hour of 10 a.m. \nhaving arrived, morning business is closed.\n\n[[Page S4377]]\n\n\n\n      IMMIGRATION CONTROL AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1996\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1664, the Immigration Control and Financial \nResponsibility Act, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1664) to amend the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act to increase control over immigration to the United States \n     by increasing border patrol and investigative personnel and \n     detention facilities, improving the system used by employers \n     to verify citizenship and work-authorized alien status, \n     increasing penalties for alien smuggling and document fraud, \n     and reforming asylum, exclusion, and deportation law and \n     procedures; to reduce the use of welfare by aliens; and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n     Pending:\n       Dole (for Simpson) amendment No. 3743, of a perfecting \n     nature.\n       Graham amendment No. 3760 (to amendment No. 3743), to \n     condition the repeal of the Cuban Adjustment Act on a \n     democratically elected government in Cuba being in power.\n       Graham-Specter amendment No. 3803 (to amendment No. 3743), \n     to clarify and enumerate specific public assistance programs \n     with respect to which the deeming provisions apply.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, now may we review the activity. Am I \ncorrect that we have two amendments at the desk of Senator Bob Graham \nof Florida, to which there has been a degree of debate and time has run \non that, and that we are near readiness to vote--not at this time? I \nwill wait until my ranking member, Senator Kennedy, is here to be sure \nwe concur. What is the status of matters?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 3803 is pending, offered by the \nSenator from Florida [Mr. Graham].\n  Mr. SIMPSON. And then, Mr. President, is there another amendment also \npending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is informed No. 3760 has been set \naside.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. That being the first amendment sent to the desk \nyesterday evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment was set aside.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the Chair. Let me just say now, we are embarking \non the issue of illegal immigration. I hope my colleagues will pay very \nclear attention to this debate. This is the critical one. This is where \nwe begin to get something done.\n  I must admit, and I thank my colleagues for their patience in my \nobstreperous behavior to propose to go forward with one or two items \nthat had to do with legal immigration, thinking that I might get the \nattention of my colleagues to do something with regard to chain \nmigration and other phenomenon. That certainly was a message clearly \nconveyed that that will have to come at another time.\n  So I will not be trying to link anything. I have no sinister plan to \nproceed to reconstruct or deconstruct. But the theme of this debate \nmust be very clear to all of our colleagues, and it is very simply \nsaid: If we are going to have legal immigrants come to our country, \nthen those who bring them, who sponsor them will have to agree that \nthey will never become a public charge for 5 years, and then when they \nnaturalize, of course, that will end. That has come through very clear.\n  But every single amendment that you will hear which says that the \nassets of the sponsor should not be deemed to be the assets of the \nimmigrant, then remember that leaves only one person, or millions to \npick up the slack, and those are called taxpayers.\n  So every time in this debate when there is an amendment to say, ``Oh, \nmy, we can't put that on the immigrant, that that asset should be \nlisted as the immigrant's asset,'' every time that will happen, it \nmeans that the obligation of the sponsor becomes less and the \nobligation of the taxpayer becomes greater. You cannot have it both \nways. The sponsor is either obligated, and should be, by a tough \naffidavit of support--and there is a tough one in there--or if they \ncome off the hook, the taxpayers go back on the hook. That is the \nessence of observing this debate.\n  The second part is very attentive to the issues of verification, \nbecause it does not matter how much you want to do something with \nregard to illegal immigration--and let me tell you, this bill does big \nthings to illegal immigration because apparently that is what is \nsought--but you cannot get any of it done unless you have good \nverification procedures, counterfeit-resistant documents, things of \nthat nature, which are not intrusive, which are not leading us down the \nslippery slope, which are not the first steps to an Orwellian society, \nwhich are not equated with tattoos, which are not equated with Adolf \nHitler. That is not what we are about. But you cannot get there, you \ncannot do what people want to do some with vigor intensified, you \ncannot do that unless you have some kind of more counterfeit-resistant \ndocumentation, or the call-in system, or something.\n\n  You must have, I think, pilot projects to review to see which ones \nmight be the best that we would eventually approve, and we would have \nto have a vote on that at some future year as to which one we would \napprove. That is very important.\n  You cannot help the employer by leaving the law to them. The employer \nright now has to look through 29 different documents of identification \nor work authorization. Then, if the employer asks for a document that \nis not on there, that employer is charged, or can be charged, with \ndiscrimination. We have done something about that. We must continue to \ndo that.\n  What we are trying to do is eventually even get rid of the I-9 form. \nBut when somebody in the debate says that employers are going to be \nburdened, remember, they are already burdened in the sense that they do \nthe withholding for us on our Tax Code. That is a pretty big load. They \ndo that. God bless them. On the employment situation, all they do is \nhave a one-page form called an I-9, and they have had that since 1986. \nWe are going to reduce the number of documents that they have to go \nthrough. We are going to reduce it from 29 to 6. We are hopefully going \nto do something with the proper identifiers which eventually will get \nrid of the form I-9. But the whole purpose of this is to aid employers \nin what they are trying to do with regard to employment of others in \nthe work force.\n  Of course, any kind of eventual procedure or verification system that \nwe use will apply to all of us. It will not be just asked of people who \npull for them. That would be truly discrimination. It will be asked of \nthose of us who are bald Anglos, too. Only twice in the lifetime can \none be asked to present or to assist in this verification, and that is \nat the time of seeking a job and at the time of seeking public \nsupport--that is, public assistance or welfare. That is where we are.\n  A quick review of the issues of illegal immigration reform: As I say, \nthis is a plenty tough package. Everyone should be able to \nappropriately thump their chest when they get back to the old home \ndistrict and say, ``Boy, did we do a number on illegals in this \ncountry.'' The answer is, yes, but you will not have done a thing if we \ndo not have strong, appropriate verification procedures. Nothing will \nbe accomplished--simply a glut of the same old stuff showing one more \ntime fake ID's like this, fake Social Security like this. You can pick \nthem up anywhere in the United States. Within 300 yards of this \nbuilding you can pick up any document you want, if you want to pay for \nit. You get a beautiful passport from a little shop not far from here \nfor about 750 bucks. That will fake out most of the folks. That is \nwhere we are.\n\n  You cannot get this done unless we do something with these types of \ngimmick documents which then drain away the Treasury, which then create \nthe anguish with the citizens, which give rise to the proposition 187's \nof the world. If we do not deal with it responsibly, we will have 187's \nin every State in the Union.\n  So those are some of the things that I just wanted to review with my \ncolleagues.\n  To proceed, I will await the appearance of my good colleague, the \nranking Member from Massachusetts. I suggest the absence of a quorum, \nMr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4378]]\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3871 to Amendment No. 3743\n\n  (Purpose: To make a technical correction to sec. 204 of the bill to \n    provide that deeming is required only for Federal programs and \n                       federally funded programs)\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk to \ncorrect a drafting error in section 204(A) relating to an issue within \nour consideration, so it will, as intended, apply only to Federal and \nfederally funded programs.\n  I have cleared this with my ranking member, and it is a technical \namendment returning the language to what it was before the final change \nand to be consistent with the intent of the section and with the \nversion that was used during the Judiciary Committee markup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3871 to amendment No. 3743.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Section 204(a) is amended to read as follows:\n       (a) Deeming Requirement for Federal and Federally Funded \n     Programs.--Subject to subsection (d), for purposes of \n     determining the eligibility of an alien for benefits, and the \n     amount of benefits, under any Federal program of assistance, \n     or any program of assistance funded in whole or in part by \n     the Federal Government, for which eligibility for benefits is \n     based on need, the income and resources described in \n     subsection (b) shall, notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, be deemed to be the income and resources of such alien.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nthe amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 3871) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I make the eternal lament--if our colleagues could \ncome forward with the same vigor in which they produced their \namendments at the last call, as they draped some 100 or so up front at \nthe desk. And, of course, we are limited procedurally. We are limited \nby hours, each of us having an hour. Yielding can take place or \nallocation of that hour.\n  We are ready to proceed. I believe that we need not have too much \nfurther debate. I know Senator Dole would like to speak on the Cuban \nAdjustment Act. I think at the conclusion of that we will close the \ndebate, and then we will stack the votes on the two Graham amendments. \nThen I will go forward with my amendment on phasing in, the issue of \nthe birth certificate and driver's license, which I think is in form \nnow where it does not have budget difficulty with what we have done. Of \ncourse, the birth certificate is the central breeder document of most \nall fraud within the system. That amendment will come up then after \nthat. Then we will go back to an amendment of Senator Kennedy. I \nbelieve Senator Abraham had a criminal alien measure. Then I will go to \na verification amendment.\n  Once those issues, including deeming and welfare, verification and \nbirth certificate discussion, are disposed of--those are central issues \nto the debate--I think that other amendments will fall into appropriate \nalignment with the planets.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  Mr. President, at the time the Graham amendment is disposed of--I \nwill offer the amendment and I will speak to it at the present time \nbecause the subject matter is very closely related to what the Graham \namendment is all about. If his amendment is successful, it will not be \nnecessary. But I want to illustrate why I think the Graham amendment \nshould be supported by outlining a particular area of need that would \nbe included in the Graham amendment but to give, perhaps, greater focus \nto the public policy questions which would be included in my amendment.\n  My amendment would remove the sponsor-deeming requirement for legal \nimmigrants under the bill for those programs for which illegal \nimmigrants are automatically eligible. These programs include emergency \nMedicaid, school lunches, disaster relief, child nutrition, \nimmunizations, and communicable disease treatment. Under my amendment, \nillegals and legals would be eligible for these programs on the same \nbasis, without a deeming requirement.\n  In addition, my amendment exempts a few additional programs from the \ndeeming requirements. These programs were all exempted from deeming in \nthe managers' amendment in the House immigration bill. Let me underline \nthat. What this amendment basically does is put our legislation in \nconformity with what has actually passed the House of Representatives \non these important programs, and for the reasons I will outline \nbriefly. The language of the amendment is identical to the language \npassed by the House. For these programs, it is especially \nunconscionable or impractical to deem the sponsors' income. These \nadditional programs include community and migrant health services, \nstudent aid for higher education, a means-tested program under the \nElementary-Secondary Education Act, and Head Start.\n  This amendment does not exempt any new items. Except for prenatal \ncare, every single program in my amendment is exempted in the House \nimmigration bill. The House saw the importance of these programs. There \nis no reason why the Senate should not do the same. Legal immigrants \nshould not be deemed for programs for which illegals qualify \nautomatically. Let me just underline that. Legal immigrants should not \nbe deemed for that which illegal immigrants qualify automatically.\n  The reason the illegal, primarily children, qualify is because we \nhave made the judgment that it is in the public health interest of the \nUnited States, of its children, that there be immunization programs so \nthere will not be an increase in the communicable diseases and other \nexamples like that. We have made that judgment, and it is a wise one, \nand I commend the House for doing so because it is extremely important.\n\n  We have effectively eliminated the deeming program for expectant \nmothers for prenatal care. Why? Because the child will be an American \ncitizen when that child is born and we want that child, who will be an \nAmerican citizen, to be as healthy and as well as that child possibly \ncan be. So we work with certain States on that. There are a few States \nthat provide that kind of program--we are willing to support those \nStates--after the mother has actually been in the United States for 3 \nyears. So, this is not the magnet for that mother. The mother has to \ndemonstrate residency, to be here for a 3-year period. It makes sense \nto make sure that child gets an early start. We have that in this \nlegislation. But the other programs I have referenced here are closely \nrelated in merit to those programs.\n  Legal immigrants should not be deemed for programs which the illegals \nqualify. For example, legal immigrant children are subject to sponsor \ndeeming before they can receive immunization. Illegals are \nautomatically eligible for immunization. Both legal and illegal \nchildren need immunization to go to school. But if parents cannot \nafford immunization, the legal immigrant child cannot go to school, the \nillegal immigrant can. This is just one of the examples of the \ninequities in this bill.\n  Community and migrant health services, under the Public Health \nServices Act, go to community clinics and other small community \nprograms. These grants are intended to ensure the health of entire \ncommunities, so legal immigrants should continue to be included in the \nprogram to keep the health of the whole community from being \njeopardized.\n  Community and migrant health clinics are the first line of defense \nagainst communicable diseases. These programs get people into the \nprimary health care system. There is no way,\n\n[[Page S4379]]\n\nother than expensive private health insurance, for legal immigrants to \ntake care of illness from the start, such as coughs, sore throats, skin \nlesions. Without this exception, immigrants will be pushed into \nemergency rooms to get treatment. This clogs our Nation's emergency \nrooms and is more expensive. Under this bill, immigrants would have to \nwait until their illnesses were severe enough to warrant a trip to the \nemergency room. This is bad health care policy.\n  This amendment would also exempt from the broad deeming requirements \nFederal student aid programs to legal immigrants to help them to pay \nfor college. Student aid is not welfare. Student aid is not welfare. \nHalf of the college students in this country rely on Federal grants or \nloans to help pay for their college, and many affluent citizens could \nnot finance a college education without Federal assistance. Legal \nresident aliens are no different. Most of them would be unable to \nafford college without some financial help from the Government. A \ncollege graduate earns twice what a high school graduate earns and \nclose to three times what a high school dropout earns--and pays taxes \naccordingly.\n\n  I want to point out, the eligibility has no impact on reducing the \neligibility of other Americans. That is because the Pell and Stafford \nloans are a type of guarantee, so we are not saying that, by reducing \nthe eligibility to take advantage of those programs, we are denying \nother Americans that. That is not the case. That is not the case. That \nis not so. We have some 460,000 children who are in college at the \npresent time who are taking advantage of these programs. Many of them \nhave extraordinary kinds of records. This would be unwise. The \nrepayment programs under the Stafford loans have been demonstrated to \nbe as good as, if not better than, any of the returns that come from \nother students as well.\n  The Nation as a whole reaps the benefits of a better educated work \nforce. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that about 20 percent \nof income growth during the last 20 years can be attributed to students \ngoing further in school. That has been true. In the House of \nRepresentatives they understood this. So this also exempts Head Start \nfrom sponsor deeming requirements.\n  Everyone knows investments in children pay off. Nowhere is it more \ntrue than in Head Start. Head Start is the premier social program, a \nlong-term experiment that works. Study after study has documented the \neffectiveness of Head Start.\n  Legal immigrants should not be subject to more restrictions than \nillegal immigrants. We are punishing the wrong group. These people \nplayed by the rules, came here legally. Over 76 percent of them are \nrelatives, members of families that are here. In instances of citizens \nor permanent resident aliens, they should not have a harsher standard \nthan those who are illegal. In addition, there are certain services \nwhich are vital to the continued health and well-being of this country. \nMy amendment ensures that legal immigrants will still have access to \nthese programs.\n  I want to point out that our whole intention in dealing with illegals \nis to focus on the principal magnet, what the problem is, and that is \nthe jobs magnet. That is why we have focused on that with the various \nverification provisions, which I support, which have been included in \nthe Simpson program; by dealing with other proposals to ensure greater \nintegrity of the birth certificates, an issue which I will support with \nSenator Simpson; the increase of the border guards and Border Patrol--\nagain, to halt the illegals from coming in here. That is where the \nfocus ought to be. We should not say in our assault, in trying to deal \nwith that issue, that we are going to be harsh on the children. That \ndoes not make any sense.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator wished to be yielded 8 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. President, a final point I will make is, I know a quick answer \nand easy answer to this is, ``If the deemers do not provide it, the \ntaxpayers will.'' That is a simple answer. With regard to this program, \nit is wrong. The reason it is wrong is because in the SSI, the AFDC, \nthe other programs, in order to get eligibility, there has to be \npreparedness for financial information in order for eligibility. That \nhas been out there, and it exists at the present time. The deeming \nprograms in those areas have had an important effect.\n  We are going to have to set up a whole new process of deeming, as the \nSenator from Florida has pointed out, because there is no experience in \nthese States for dealing with Head Start or community health centers or \nan emergency kind of health assistance or the school lunch programs or \nteachers dealing with the Head Start.\n  That is going to be a massive new kind of a program that is going to \nhave to be developed in the schools, local communities and in the \ncounties. It is not out there. The cost of that is going to be \nconsiderable and is going to be paid for by the taxpayers. So this is a \nvery targeted program.\n  For those reasons, I am in strong support of the Graham amendment. I \nhope it will be adopted. If not, we will have an opportunity to address \nthis amendment at an appropriate time after the disposition of the \nGraham amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is this the second Graham amendment or the first Graham \namendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are debating both.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Either one.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I would like to speak to the amendment that \nthe Senator from Florida offered last night on behalf of himself and \nothers.\n  First, I listened to the distinguished manager of the bill, Senator \nSimpson. I think he correctly stated we would like to stack those votes \nand have the votes occur after the policy luncheons, because apparently \nthere is a problem with planes getting in and out of New York.\n  Cloture was filed last night on the bill. We would like to have that \ncloture vote later today. If not, then very early in the morning, 8 \na.m. tomorrow morning. So we can either do it late tonight or early \ntomorrow morning. We could wait until midnight to have it 1 minute \nafter midnight. I prefer not to do that. It is our hope we can complete \naction on this bill and move on to other legislation. We have made \nprogress. I think we can probably make a little more.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3760\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for Senator \nSimpson and his work on immigration. I do not often disagree with him, \nbut on one issue I do. Section 197 of this bill repeals the Cuban \nRefugee Adjustment Act. The Cuban Refugee Adjustment Act of 1966 was \nenacted to facilitate the granting of legal permanent resident status \nto Cubans fleeing their homeland. The Cuban Adjustment Act, at its \ncore, is about standing on the side of oppressed people--our \nneighbors--who are fleeing Castro's dictatorship. The United States has \nconsistently stood with the Cuban people. That is why I rise in \nopposition to the proposed elimination of the Cuban Refugee Adjustment \nAct before a democratic transition takes place in Cuba.\n  First of all, conditions in Cuba have not changed since the \nimplementation of the act. In 1996, as in 1966, Castro brutally \nrepresses dissent and systematically abuses human rights. The United \nStates has had a consistent and determined policy of three decades \nsupporting the Cuban people's aspirations for freedom and democracy. A \npolicy that this Congress reaffirmed when it passed the Dole-Helms-\nBurton ``Libertad'' Act of 1996.\n  Mr. President, let me state clearly what this act does and does not \ndo. It essentially allows Cuban refugees who reach United States shores \nto apply, at the discretion of the Attorney General, for permanent \nresidence status without being forced to return to Cuba. It is not a \nmechanism to allow more Cubans to enter the United States. It is not an \nentitlement to permanent residency. It is merely a procedure for those \nalready here and seeking legal status. To repeal this act would give \nthe Castro regime a propaganda victory, but would not measurably affect \nthe number of Cubans reaching America. The Clinton-Castro migration \npact--negotiated in secret and without congressional consultation--\nallows over 100,000 Cuban immigrants to enter the United States over \nthe next 5 years. Repealing the Cuban Refugee Adjustment Act will not \ndecrease this number. Repealing\n\n[[Page S4380]]\n\nthe act will only send the wrong signal to Castro's dictatorship.\n  That is why I, along with Senators Graham, Mack, and Abraham, have \noffered an amendment that states that the Cuban Refugee Adjustment Act \nwould only be repealed when conditions stipulated under the Libertad \nAct have been met, specifically, that a democratic government is in \nplace in Cuba.\n  A repeal of the act at this time is not in the national interest of \nthe United States. Recent events have demonstrated once again that the \nCastro regime remains a threat to security in the Caribbean, America's \nfront yard. Let us once again stand together in sending a strong \nmessage to Fidel Castro and to the Cuban people that we stand for \ndemocratic change in Cuba.\n  It seems to me with this one provision in this bill--I know the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming has worked very hard and has done an \noutstanding job. I respectfully disagree with him on this one aspect. I \nhope the amendment offered by my colleagues from Florida, Senator Mack \nand Senator Graham, myself, and others will be adopted.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Can we have a \ncloture vote if we are under cloture at the present time? Is it \nappropriate to have another cloture vote during the period we are \nacting under the decision of the Senate yesterday afternoon and the 30 \nhours have not run?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate would have to dispose of the \ncurrent cloture item before the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How many hours remain on the cloture item?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains approximately 27 hours.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And does the Chair know how many amendments are out \nthere that have been submitted at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is informed there has been \napproximately 130 amendments filed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I, for one, am very hopeful now that we will have a \nchance to dispose of these amendments. Everyone on this side voted for \ncloture last evening. We have not had a chance to offer amendments. \nSenator Graham stayed last evening and spoke to the Senate on both of \nthese measures, which are timely. Other Members have indicated they \nwish to offer amendments. We want to at least give assurances to \nMembers that it is not in order to order a cloture motion until we have \nthe final resolution on the current matter, as I understand.\n  Parliamentary inquiry. At the time there is final cloture and the \nacceptance of these amendments on the underlying amendment to the bill, \nat that time the bill is open to further amendment, is it not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to indicate, we will offer the minimum wage \namendment at that particular time, since that is the next open \nopportunity to offer the minimum wage. We want to make it very clear--I \nknow that is the position of Senator Daschle--that once we conclude \nthis at a time when we are going to work through the process of cloture \nand Members will have an opportunity to offer their amendments, at that \ntime, the bill itself will be open for amendment, and it is our \nintention to offer the minimum wage amendment at that particular time, \nbecause it will be appropriate to offer it at that particular time.\n  I hope we are not going to have to go through another kind of \nparliamentary procedure where we are going to be blocked from offering \nthe minimum wage at all and then another cloture motion filed, so that \nwe are taking up the better part of a week on a matter that could have, \nquite frankly, been resolved in a couple of days.\n  I thought it at least important to understand what the parliamentary \nsituation is. There is no effort to try and delay the consideration of \nthis legislation. Everyone on our side voted for it. This is the first \nopportunity we have had to offer amendments on it. These amendments are \nall germane, and the floor manager himself indicated he wanted a chance \nto offer some amendments as well.\n  I think it is important to understand that when we conclude this, \nthat there will at least be an effort made by our leader, Senator \nDaschle, myself, Senator Kerry and Senator Wellstone, to offer the \nminimum wage. The leader is in his rights to try and foreclose us from \nthat by working out this other parliamentary procedure where we will be \ndenied the opportunity to vote that for a period of time. I hope that \nwill not be the case. Nonetheless, I just wanted to review where we \nwere from a parliamentary point of view.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we understand the parliamentary situation. \nIt is my hope we can work out some agreement and complete action on \nthis bill. We have been on it a number of days. I think it is a very \nimportant piece of legislation. We would like it to pass. I think it \nhas strong bipartisan support, as indicated by the cloture vote last \nevening.\n  I think it should be limited to germane amendments. We made a \nproposal on minimum wage to the leader on the other side. It has been \ntemporarily rejected. Perhaps it will be revisited.\n  We understand the daily comments about this issue, but we are trying \nto complete action on the immigration bill. If it is determined that is \nnot possible because of an effort to offer nongermane amendments, then \nwe will move on to something else.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just point out at this time that the \namount of Republican amendments that have been offered on this, as I \nunderstand it with a quick review, far exceed the numbers that have \nbeen offered by the Democrats. So maybe that admonition ought to be \ntargeted in terms of Republicans because they have submitted many more \namendments than have been submitted by our Democratic colleagues. I \nthank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, for procedural announcements, first, I \nindicate that the minority leader, Senator Daschle, has transferred 30 \nminutes of his time under the cloture rule to myself.\n  Second, I ask unanimous consent that at such time as we take up \nconsideration of the Graham amendments, the first amendment to be voted \non be No. 3760 and the second amendment voted on be the amendment \nrelative to deeming, which is No. 3803. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that that be the order in which the amendments are considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? Hearing none, without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on \nthese amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if I could comment briefly on the remarks \nthat have just been made by the majority leader and then the remarks \nthat were made earlier by our colleague from Massachusetts. I think \nthey both have gone to the essence of the two amendments that we will \nbe voting on later today.\n  The first amendment relates to the Cuban Adjustment Act. As Senator \nDole has eloquently stated, the conditions in Cuba have not changed in \nthe past 35 years. Therefore, the reason why the Congress in 1966, 30 \nyears ago, adopted the Cuban Adjustment Act continue in place.\n  Those reasons are fundamentally a recognition of the authoritarian \nregime at our water's edge. The fact that, because of that regime, \nhundreds of thousands of people have fled tyranny, it was in the \ninterest of the United States to have an expeditious procedure by which \nthose persons who are here legally in the United States, have resided \nfor 1 year, and have asked for a discretionary act of grace by the \nAttorney General, be given the opportunity to adjust their status to \nthat of a permanent resident. That was a valid public policy when it \nwas adopted in November 1966. It is a valid public policy in April \n1996.\n  I cited yesterday and included in yesterday's Congressional Record, \nMr.\n\n[[Page S4381]]\n\nPresident, an article which appeared in the April 29 Washington Post, \nciting the regress that has occurred in Cuba in recent months, the \nheightened level of assault against human rights advocates, including \njournalists, the inability of human rights organizations to meet, the \nrollback of some of the gains that were made in terms of market \neconomics, all of this at a time when Fidel Castro is saying that Cuba \nis committed to a Socialist-Communist state, will be for another 35 \nyears and for 35 times 35 years.\n  That is the mindset of the regime with which we are dealing today, \nwhich is the same mindset that led this Congress in its wisdom 30 years \nago to provide this expeditious procedure. The amendment before us \nrecognizes that the Cuban Adjustment Act is intended to deal with the \nspecial circumstance, a circumstance that we hope will not be long in \nits future. Therefore, our amendment, the Cuban Adjustment Act, will be \nrepealed, but it will be repealed when there is a democratic government \nin Cuba, not today when there is a government in Cuba which has \nlaunched a new level of repression against its people.\n  The second amendment, Mr. President, Senator Kennedy has \nappropriately gone to the essence of that. That is an amendment which \nstates that, if we are going to require that there be a deeming of the \nincome of the sponsor to the income of a legal alien in making \njudgments as to whether that legal alien and his or her family can be \neligible for literally an unlimited number of programs at the local, \nState, and Federal level, that we ought to be clear what we are talking \nabout.\n  The way in which the legislation before us, S. 1664, describes the \nmatter is to say that for any program which is needs based, that will \nbe the requirement, that the income of the sponsor be attributed or \ndeemed to be the income of the legal alien for purposes of their \neligibility. I cited last night just a short list of what could have \nbeen thousands of examples of programs, from programs intended to \nimmunize children in school, to providing after school safe places, and \nlatchkey avoidance institutions in communities.\n\n  Is it the real intention of the U.S. Senate to say that none of those \nprograms are going to be available to the children of legal aliens? I \nthink not. Therefore, the thrust of this amendment is to say, let us be \nspecific. Let us list which programs we intend this deeming of income \nof the sponsor to apply to.\n  I have listed some 16 programs which I believe are appropriate to \nrequire that deeming. As I said last evening, if it is the desire of \nthe sponsors to modify that list by addition, deletion, or amendment, I \nwill be happy to consider changes. But the fundamental principle, that \nwe ought to be clear and specific as to what it is we intend to be the \nprograms that will be subject to this deeming, I believe, is basic to \nour responsibility to our constituents, our citizen constituents, our \nnoncitizen legal alien constituents, and the institutions, public and \nprivate, that render services. All of those deserve to know what it is \nwe intend to require to be deemed.\n  I say, Mr. President, this is in our tradition. Currently we \nstipulate by statute in great detail which programs require deeming. We \nstipulate, for instance, that the Supplemental Security Income program \nbe deemed. We stipulate that food stamps be deemed. We stipulate that \naid to families with dependent children be deemed. Those are three \nprograms which are in the law today specifically requiring deeming. In \nthat tradition, if we are going to add additional programs, we should \nbe just as specific in the future as we have been in the past.\n  So the challenge to us is to be faithful to our majority leader's \nstatement earlier in this Congress in which he said this Congress is \ngoing to engage in legislative truth in advertising, we are going to \nsay what we mean, mean what we say, and be clear in our instructions to \nthose who will be affected by our actions.\n  So, Mr. President, those are the two amendments that will be voted on \nlater today which I have offered. First the Cuban Adjustment Act, then \nthe truth-in-advertising and deeming amendment.\n  I conclude, Mr. President, by asking unanimous consent that Senator \nLieberman of Connecticut be added as a cosponsor of the Cuban \nAdjustment Act amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I think we are nearly ready to perhaps close the debate \nand stack the votes on these two issues. I see no one further coming to \nspeak on the issue. I will advise my colleagues--yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is my understanding there will be 5 \nminutes on each side immediately prior to the vote.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, that would be perfectly appropriate to \nme.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, prior to the \nvote on each of those amendments, there be 5 minutes allocated to each \nside for closing arguments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do \nnot object to it, I think that I generally want to see if we can vote \nafter the disposition. I think that is a more orderly way. The leader \nhas asked that we stack these. I would like to just see if we could see \nwhat understanding there is between Senator Dole and Senator Daschle.\n  We ought to have at least the minute or two that we always do have. \nBut I would like to inquire if there is no objection from the leaders \non this before going along. So if we could inquire of the leadership if \nthey are satisfied with that time, or make another suggestion, I would \nlike to conform to that.\n  So would the Senator withhold that?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to add one other item. Senator Specter had \nasked to speak on the amendment, the truth in advertising and deeming \namendment. I would like to protect his right to do so prior to the vote \non that amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we will inquire of the majority and \nminority leaders, when we do our stacking, as to what procedure they \nwant to follow in terms of the time. We will make it clear the \nSenator's request, and we will let him know prior to the time of asking \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, we will accommodate the Senator from \nFlorida, but I agree with my colleague from Massachusetts that \ncertainly that will be up to the majority leader and the minority \nleader as to that procedure. We will go forward on that basis.\n  Last night, I rather hurriedly commented on Senator Graham's \namendment. Let me be a little bit more precise at this time. I am \nspeaking now of the Graham amendment to limit deeming to SSI, food \nstamps, AFDC, and housing assistance.\n  I do oppose the Graham amendment. This amendment would reopen a \nsubstantial loophole in our national--and traditional--immigration \npolicy. Again, let me emphasize that before any prospective immigrant \nis approved to come to the United States, that newcomer must \ndemonstrate that he or she is ``not likely to become a public charge.'' \nThat means that the newcomer will never, never, never use welfare--any \nwelfare at all. That is what the law says, and that has been part of \nour immigration law since 1882.\n  Well, despite this stated policy, more than 20 percent of all \nimmigrant households receive public assistance. There is a disconnect \nhere between our Nation's stated policy, which is that no newcomer \nshall use welfare, period, and shall not become a public charge, and \nthe reality in the United States, where one-fifth of our newcomers use \nwelfare.\n  My colleagues could easily wonder, and are wondering, ``How can this \nhappen?'' That is the question of the day. Many individuals show that \nthey will not become a public charge by having a sponsor who is willing \nto provide support if the alien should need assistance of any kind. \nUnder current law, however, this sponsor's promise is only counted when \nthe alien applies for SSI, food stamps, and AFDC. No other welfare \nprograms in the United States look toward the sponsor's promise of \nsupport. I hope that can be heard in the debate.\n  The bill now before the Senate--this is in the bill that is before \nyou, this is\n\n[[Page S4382]]\n\nin the bill that came from the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 13 to \n4--requires that all means-tested welfare programs consider the \nsponsor's income when determining whether or not a sponsored individual \nis eligible for assistance. That is as simple as it can be. The U.S. \nGovernment expects the sponsors to keep their promises in all cases. \nThat is what it is.\n  We should be clear about what deeming does. Deeming is, perhaps, a \nbit confusing. It is a simple word that something is deemed to be. In \nthis case, the sponsor's income is deemed to be that of the immigrant \nfor the purposes of computing these things. Deeming--this is very \nimportant. The bill will not deny welfare to an individual just because \nhe or she is a new arrival. That is not what this bill does. I have \nheard a little bit of that in the debate. I would not favor anything \nlike that, or any approach like that.\n  Instead, the bill requires that the sponsor's income be counted when \ndetermining whether the newcomer is eligible for public assistance. If \nthe sponsor is dead, if the sponsor is bankrupt or otherwise \nfinancially unable to provide support, then this bill provides that the \nFederal Government will provide the needed assistance. That is what \nthis bill before you today says.\n  My colleagues need to know what the Graham amendment does. It is \nsweeping. This amendment would limit deeming to only supplemental \nsecurity income, SSI; aid to families with dependent children, AFDC; \nfood stamps; and the public housing programs. That is it. That is all. \nThis is almost unchanged from current law. It is the current law we are \ntrying to change in this bill--and we do, and we did in Judiciary \nCommittee. I hope we will continue it here because it already requires \ndeeming for SSI and food stamps and AFDC.\n\n  Senator Graham's amendment would exempt Medicaid, would exempt job \ntraining, would exempt legal services, would exempt a tremendously wide \nrange of other noncash welfare programs from the sponsor-alien deeming \nprovisions in this bill.\n  This amendment effectively undermines this entire section of the \nbill--the entire section--because here is what would happen. Under the \nGraham amendment, newcomers would have access to these various \nprograms, and it would not be regarded as part of the sponsor's \nobligation. Newcomers, I think most of us would agree, who are brought \nhere on a promise of their sponsors that they will not become a public \ncharge, should not expect access to our Nation's generous welfare \nprograms--cash or noncash--unless the sponsor, the individual who \npromised to care for the new arrival, is unable to provide assistance. \nIf the sponsor is unable to do that for the various reasons that I just \nnoted, then there is no obligation. The Government does pick up the \ntab. But if that sponsor is still able to do so, that sponsor will do \nso because if that sponsor does not do so, there is only one who will \ndo so, and that is the taxpayers of the United States. There is no \nother person out there to do it.\n  So that is where we are. Our Government spends more on these noncash \nprograms than all of the cash assistance programs put together. To \nexempt them would relieve the sponsors of most of their promise of \nsupport. I see no reason to exempt any sponsor from their promise of \nsupport, unless they are deceased, bankrupt, or cannot do it. If that \nis the case, then a very generous Government will do it, that is, the \ntaxpayers.\n  I must stress that immigrant use of these noncash welfare programs is \ntruly significant. For Medicaid alone, CBO estimates that the United \nStates will pay $2 billion over the next 7 years to provide assistance \nto sponsored aliens, people who were coming only on one singular \nbasis--that they would not become a public charge. This amendment would \nperpetuate the current levels of high welfare dependency among \nnewcomers, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  I have never been part of the ritual to deny benefits to permanent \nresident aliens. I think there is some consideration there to be given \nin these cases. I do not say that illegal immigrants should not have \nemergency assistance. They should. And the debate will take place today \nwhere we will say, ``Well, why is it we do these things for illegal \nimmigrants and we do not do it for legal immigrants?'' The issue is \nvery basic. The illegal immigrant does not have someone sponsoring them \nto the United States who has agreed to pay their bills, and see to it \nthat they do not became a public charge, period. That is the way that \nworks.\n  So it is a very difficult issue because it has to do with compassion, \ncaring, and all of the things that certainly all of us are steeped in. \nBut in this situation it is very simple. The sponsor has agreed to do \nit, and to say that their income is deemed to be that of the immigrant. \nAnd that is the purpose of what the bill is, and this amendment would \neffectively in every sense undermine this aspect of the bill.\n  So I did want to express my thoughts on the debate indeed.\n  Then, finally, the Cuban Adjustment Act, as I said last night, is a \nrelic of the freedom flights of the 1960's and the freedom flotillas of \nthe late 1970's. At those times of crisis Cubans were brought to the \nUnited States by the tens and hundreds of thousands. Most were given \nthis parole status which is a very indefinite status and requires an \nadjustment in order to receive permanent immigrant status in the United \nStates. Since we welcomed those Cubans and intended that they remain \nhere, the Cuban Adjustment Act--a very generous act--provided that \nafter 1 year in the United States all Cubans could claim a green card. \nThat is the most precious document that enabled you to work. They would \nclaim a green card and become permanent residents here.\n  Since 1980 we have thoroughly tried to discourage illegal entry of \nCubans. There is no longer any need for the Cuban Adjustment Act. The \nprovision in the bill which repeals the Cuban Adjustment Act exempts \nthose who came and will come under the current agreement between the \nCastro government and the Clinton administration, and one which Senator \nDole so ably described having been done without any kind of \nparticipation by the Congress. Those 20,000 Cubans per year, who were \nchosen by lottery and otherwise to come here under that agreement, will \nbe able to have their status adjusted under the committee bill \nprovisions. There is no change there at all. However, other than that \none exception, there is no need for the Cuban Adjustment Act and it \nshould be repealed.\n  No other group--I hope my colleagues can understand--nor nationality \nin the world, even among some of our most brutal adversaries, is able \nto get a green card merely by coming to the United States legally, or \nillegally, and remaining here for 1 year. That is what this is. \nMillions of persons who have a legal right to immigrate to join family \nhere are waiting in the backlog sometimes for 15 or 20 years. And it \nwould seem to me it would make no sense to allow a Cuban to come here \non a raft, stay offshore and tell somebody from the INS who checks the \nbox and says, ``We saw you come,'' and 1 year later walk up and get a \ngreen card. That is exactly what is happening under current law. You \ncome here, or to fly in on a tourist visa, to go to see your cousin, or \nsister, in Orlando, and then simply stay for 1 year and go down and get \na green card, having violated our laws to do so, and then are rewarded \nwith a precious green card which takes a number away from somebody else \nwho has been waiting for 10 or 15 years. The Cuban Adjustment Act \nshould be repealed.\n  It has been repealed on this floor three separate times, ladies and \ngentleman. The Cuban Adjustment Act was repealed in 1982. It was \nrepealed in 1986. And it was repealed again I believe in 1990. That \ndate may be imprecise. Each time it had gone to the House and then \nrepeal had been removed.\n  So that is the Cuban Adjustment Act. It is certainly one of the most \narcane and surely one of the most remarkable vestiges of a time long \npast; a remnant.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Yes. I certainly will.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the immigrants come from Cuba under the existing \nexchange agreement, are they denied the other kinds of benefits that \nare available to others that come here as immigrants, or are they \ntreated the same?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, all of those who come under the new \nproposal with the 20,000 per year for the 4 years,\n\n[[Page S4383]]\n\nor the 5, are exempt from this provision. They would continue to come \nunder that agreement between the President and the Cuban Government. \nThey are not part of this.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. President, I support the Senator's opposition, or I support the \nprovisions in the legislation that would repeal it, and oppose the \namendment of the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. President, to move this process forward we have invited other \nMembers of the Senate to come forward and address the Graham \namendments, and we certainly welcome whatever participation they would \nwant to make.\n  I would like to--and I will--introduce other amendments that are \nrelated in one form or another to the Graham amendments because I think \nwe will find that there will be a disposition in favor of it. I hope \nthat the Graham amendments will be accepted. And, if they are accepted, \nat least one of mine then will not. I would ask that we not vote on \nthat because effectively it would be incorporated in the Graham \namendments.\n  There are other provisions that are related to the general idea of \nprograms that would be available to needy people that I would want to \nhave addressed by the Senate.\n  So, Mr. President, I will offer--and I have talked to the floor \nmanager on this issue, and on the amendment that I had addressed the \nSenate earlier on, and that was to eliminate the deeming on those legal \nfor those particular programs that have been included in the House of \nRepresentatives as to be no deeming eligibility for. I ask that the \ncurrent amendments be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. These amendments have the way to address that rather \nfundamental principle which I addressed earlier which requires that \nthere be two amendments.\n  I would ask they be incorporated en bloc. This has been cleared with \nthe floor manager. Then when the vote comes, if it does come on those \namendments, that the one vote would incorporate both those amendments.\n  Effectively, Mr. President, these two amendments amend different \nparts of the bill but they are essentially, as I described earlier, and \nthat is to make the programs consistent here in the Senate bill with \nwhat happened in the House bill where over there they said that there \nwould be no deeming for the essential kinds of programs that primarily \nbenefit children. The reason for that is because it is in the public \ninterest for our own children that would be adversely impacted, if the \nlegal children did not have immunizations and other kinds of emergency \nkinds of services, treatments, and screening programs. I addressed that \nearlier. I will speak to the Senate subsequently. But I ask that that \nfollow the Graham amendment. If the Graham amendment is accepted, then \nI would ask to vitiate the yeas and nays on it.\n  Mr. President, it would be my intention to offer an amendment on the \nMedicaid deeming to title II of the bill. I will send that to the desk \nin just a moment.\n  Let me explain what this amendment would do. I am deeply concerned \nthat for the first time in the history of the program we will begin to \nsponsor deeming for Medicaid for legal immigrants. I recognize that \nthis is a high-cost program of $2 billion for helping legal immigrants \nover the next 7 years. But public health is at stake--not just the \nimmigrants' health. The restriction on Medicaid places our communities \nat risk. It will be a serious problem for Americans and immigrants who \nlive in high immigrant areas. If the sponsor's income is deemed, and \nthe sponsor is held liable for the cost to Medicaid, legal immigrants \nwill be turned away from the program, or avoided altogether. These \nlegal immigrants are not going to go away. They get sick like everyone \nelse, and many will need help. But restricting Medicaid means \nconditions will be untreated and diseases will spread.\n  If the Federal Government drops the ball on the Medicaid, our \ncommunities and States and local governments will have no choice but to \npick up Medicare and pick up the cost.\n  In addition to veterans, my amendment exempts children and prenatal \nand postpartum services from the Medicaid deeming requirements for \nlegal immigrants. The bottom line is we are talking about \nchildren, legal immigrant children who will likely become future \ncitizens. The early years of a person's life are the most vulnerable \nyears for health. If the children develop complications early in life, \ncomplications which could have been prevented with access to health \ncare, society will pay the costs of a lifetime of treatment when this \nchild becomes a citizen.\n\n  Children are not abusing Medicaid. When immigrant children get sick, \nthey infect American citizen children. The bill we are discussing today \neffectively means children in school will not be able to get school-\nbased care under the early and periodic screening, detection and \ntreatment program. This program provides basic school-based health \ncare. Under this bill, every time a legal immigrant goes to the school \nnurse, that nurse will have to determine if the child is eligible for \nMedicaid. The bill turns school nurses into welfare officers. The end \nresult is that millions of children will not receive needed treatment \nand early detection of diseases.\n  Consider the following example. A legal immigrant child goes to her \nschool nurse complaining of a bad cough. The nurse cannot treat the \ngirl until it is determined that she is eligible for Medicaid. \nMeanwhile, the child's illness grows worse. The parents take her to a \nlocal emergency room where it is discovered the little girl has \ntuberculosis. That child has now exposed all of her classmates--\nAmerican citizen classmates--to TB, all because the school nurse was \nnot authorized to treat the child until her Medicaid eligibility was \ndetermined.\n  Or consider a mother who keeps her child out of the school-based care \nprogram because she knows her child will not qualify for the program. \nThis child develops an ear infection, and the teacher notices a change \nin his hearing ability. Normally, the teacher would send the little boy \nto the school nurse but cannot in this case because he is not eligible \nfor Medicaid. The untreated infection causes the child to go deaf for \nthe rest of his life.\n  In addition, the school-based health care program also provides for \nthe early detection of childhood diseases or problems such as hearing \ndifficulties, scoliosis--and even lice checks.\n  Prenatal and postpartum services must also be exempt from the \nMedicaid deeming requirements. Legal immigrant mothers who deliver in \nthe United States are giving birth to children who are American \ncitizens. These children deserve the same healthy start in life as any \nother American citizen.\n  In addition, providing prenatal care has been proven to prevent poor \nbirth outcomes. Problem births, low birthweight babies and other \nproblems associated with the lack of prenatal care can increase the \ncost of a delivery up to 70 times the normal costs.\n\n  In California, the common cost of caring for a premature baby in a \nneonatal unit is $75,000 to $100,000.\n  Many things can go wrong during pregnancy, and in the delivery room \nmany more things will go wrong if the mother has not had adequate \nprenatal care. Without it, we allow more American citizen children to \ncome into the world with complications that could have been prevented.\n  This is not an expensive amendment. According to CBO, the cost of \ncare for children and prenatal services is less than the cost for \nelderly persons.\n  What we are talking about, Mr. President, is $125 million, the cost \nof this amendment--$125 million to deal with the cost to exempt \nchildren under 18, services to mothers, expecting mothers, and \nveterans, from Medicaid deeming--$125 million out of $2 billion. So it \nis a very reduced program. It is, again, for the children, again, for \nthe mothers, and, again, for veterans who have served or who may still \nbe legal immigrants and have served in the Armed Forces and need some \nmeans-tested program.\n  The most outstanding one is prescription drugs. That is really the \nnumber one program, where they be costed out, and these veterans would \nhave difficulty in program terms for that kind of attention.\n  Furthermore, the cost of providing a healthy childhood to both unborn \nAmerican citizens and legal immigrant children is far less than the \ncost to society in treating health complications\n\n[[Page S4384]]\n\nat delivery and throughout the lives of the children.\n  Finally, many legal immigrants serve in our Armed Forces. We \nmentioned that briefly at other times in the debates. Most veterans \nbenefits are means tested. If the sponsor deeming provisions in the \nbill are applied to veterans benefits, some veterans will find \nthemselves ineligible for VA benefits because the sponsor makes too \nmuch money or they are too poor to purchase health insurance.\n  My amendment allows those veterans to receive the health care they \nneed under Medicaid.\n  This bill will make many immigrant veterans ineligible for health \ncare assistance under their VA benefits. Currently veterans who are \nunable to defray the costs of medical care can qualify for means-tested \nbenefits. There are several mandatory VA programs which are means \ntested. These programs provide vets with free inpatient hospital care \nand nursing home care. In addition, these programs help veterans pay \nfor inhome care and out patient care. If these VA programs are deemed, \nMedicaid coverage may be the only safety net an immigrant veteran can \nreceive.\n\n  Are we going to deny the 25,000 immigrants who are in the Armed \nForces today--there are 25,000 of them who are in the Armed Forces \ntoday--who are sacrificing? And no one, I do not believe, was asking \nthem when they joined whether they were being deemed or not being \ndeemed. They were brought into the Armed Forces and served in the \nmilitary. There are 25,000 of them who have served. All we are talking \nabout are those particular ones who are going to have to have some \nspecial needs as I mentioned primarily in the area of prescription \ndrugs. They have been serving this country and serving it well, many 2 \nor 3 or 4 years and even more.\n  So, Mr. President, this amendment effectively says that we will not \nhave deeming when we are talking about children, mothers and veterans--\nchildren, mothers and veterans. We have carved that out of the Medicaid \nprovision. You will not have deeming, one, for the public health \npurposes. I would like to do it because I think the most powerful \nargument is that the children are not the problem. Again, it is the \nproblem of the magnet of jobs in this country and we should not be \nharsh on these children in particular.\n  I know there are those who say, well, the taxpayer has to do it. I am \nsaying that it is a $2 billion tab. We are carving $125 million out of \nthat and saying, both because the children are not the problem and for \nthose who are looking for bottom lines, it is cheaper to have healthier \nchildren. These are children that are going to be American citizens. It \nis worthwhile that they are going to have an early start and we are \ngoing to be sensitive to those who have served under the colors of the \ncountry, the veterans who fall on particularly hard times to be able to \nbenefit from the program.\n  Mr. President, will the clerk report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the pending \namendment will be--\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is my intention that we temporarily set aside the \nGraham amendments, that the two amendments incorporated in the earlier \npresentation that said we are in this bill going to treat those limited \nemergency programs the way that the House of Representatives did and \nsaying we are not going to have a dual standard for the illegals and \nlegals--we are going to treat the legals the same as the illegals--to \nachieve that there had to be two amendments offered to amend two \ndifferent parts of the bill, but it is a rather straightforward \nprovision. Rather than require a vote on each provision, I had talked \nto the floor manager and we had hoped that we would vote on those two \nen bloc.\n\n  And then the second amendment that I have sent to the desk deals with \ncarving out the areas of Medicaid, for mothers, children, and the \nveterans. I believe that amendment has been sent to the desk. I would \nask that my first amendment be temporarily set aside so that we would \nhave that amendment before the Senate.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 3820 and 3823\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the Graham amendment \nwill be set aside and the two en bloc amendments by Senator Kennedy \nwill be considered.\n  The clerk will report those amendments.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes en \n     bloc amendments numbered 3820 and 3823 to amendment No. 3743.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent it be in order for the yeas and \nnays to be ordered on amendment No. 3760.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment \nNo. 3760.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I had not intended to speak further, prior \nto\n\n[[Page S4385]]\n\nthe time immediately preceding the vote on these two amendments, but I \nwould like to respond to some of the comments made by the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  First, on the Cuban Adjustment Act issue, the precise issue is the \none that the Senator from Wyoming has stated, and that is, is the Cuban \nAdjustment Act an anachronism? Is it a dinosaur which served a purpose \nat a time past but is no longer relevant to the future?\n  The fact is, Mr. President, what is an anachronism, what is a \ndinosaur is the Fidel Castro regime in Cuba, a regime which has held \nits people in tyranny for 3\\1/2\\ decades. Until that regime is replaced \nwith a democratic government, the Cuban Adjustment Act continues to \nplay the same positive role as it did when it was adopted in 1966.\n  I am also concerned about the statement that there is no longer a \nneed for the Cuban Adjustment Act. Between 1990 and 1994, prior to the \ncurrent Cuban migration agreement of 1995, there were an average of \n20,000 persons a year who were in the country legally, had resided here \nfor a year, and asked for the discretionary act of the Attorney General \nto have their status adjusted. Assumedly, there continue to be \nthousands of people who arrived prior to the migration agreement of \n1995 who are awaiting eligibility to ask for that discretionary act. \nSo, yes, there is a need.\n  Second, the proposal which is in S. 1664 would only apply to those \npersons who arrived under the migration agreement of 1995 in the status \nof parolees. According to the statistics of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, since that agreement was in effect, \napproximately half of the Cubans who have arrived in the United States \ndid not arrive as parolees. They came as either refugees or as visa \nimmigrants. Under the reading of S. 1664, those persons who came under \nthe migration agreement of 1995, would not be eligible to adjust their \nstatus because they did not come in the specific category of a parolee.\n\n  So the anachronism is in Havana, not in the laws of the United \nStates. The need continues to exist today as it did 30 years ago. I \nurge adoption of the amendment which has been cosponsored by Senator \nDole, Senator Mack, Senator Abraham, Senator Bradley, Senator Helms, \nSenator Lieberman--a broad, bipartisan consensus that the date for the \nchange of the Cuban Adjustment Act is the date when democracy is \nrestored to Cuba.\n  Second, on the amendment relative to truth in advertising and \ndeeming, the Senator from Wyoming says the issue is the fact that we \nare not covering, under the amendment which I have offered, a variety \nof programs for which he thinks deeming should apply. I do not see that \nas being the issue.\n  The issue is, are we going to pass a vague law which states that the \nincome of the sponsor shall be deemed to be the income of the legal \nalien for any benefits under any Federal program of assistance or any \nprogram of assistance funded in whole or in part by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  That is the proposition which is currently before us. I might say, \nhappily, that that represents a restriction, because the original \nversion of S. 1664 applied that same vague language, not just to \nfederally funded programs but to programs by governments at the State \nand the local level. Now at least we are only dealing with federally \nfunded programs, in whole or in part.\n  But the fundamental principle of our amendment is let us be specific. \nLet us tell the American people, let us tell the legal aliens and their \nfamilies who are affected, let us tell those persons who are attempting \nto provide these services in a reasonable way what it is we intend to \nbe covering. Let us list specifically what those programs are in the \nfuture as we have in the past. The current U.S. immigration law lists \nspecifically those programs for which the sponsor's income is deemed to \nbe the income of the sponsored legal alien. I think that was a wise \npolicy in the past, and it is a policy which we should continue into \nthe future. That is the fundamental issue.\n  That is why the major State-based organizations, from the Conference \nof State Legislators, the National League of Cities, the National \nAssociation of Counties--all of those organizations are supporting this \namendment because they say we want to know precisely what it is we are \ngoing to be responsible for administering, since it is going to be our \nresponsibility to do so. That is why those organizations are concerned \nabout the massive, unfunded mandate that is about to fall upon them, \nboth for the administrative costs of arriving at these judgments and \nthe cost when services that are no longer going to have a Federal \npartner will become the obligation of local government.\n\n  The Senator from Wyoming left the inference that there were two \nplaces through which these services for legal aliens could be paid. One \nwas by the Federal Government; second, by the sponsor. I suggest that \nthere is a third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and so forth additional party \nwho will be picking up these costs. Those are the thousands of \nmunicipalities, the 3,000 counties, and the 50 States of the United \nStates that will be responsible.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that, by Federal law, we require a \nhospital emergency room to render service to anyone who arrives and \nrequests that service, regardless of their ability to pay. So, what \ncurrently the law is, is that if it is a legal alien who is medically \nindigent, that cost will be a shared cost, with the Federal Government \npaying a portion and the States paying a portion. With what we are \nabout to do, we are going to make that cost an unreimbursed cost to \nthat hospital. Typically, it will be a public hospital. So it will end \nup being a charge to the taxpayers of that community or that State in \nwhich the legal alien lives. It is for that reason that, in addition to \nthose groups that I listed, the Association of Public Hospitals \nsupports this amendment, the Graham amendment, the truth in \nadvertising, in deeming, amendment. It is also the case this has \nreceived support of the major Catholic organizations which, of course, \noperate substantial health care facilities in many communities in this \ncountry.\n  So, it is not correct to say the only two people who are at the table \nare the sponsor and the Federal Government. The reality is there is a \nwhole array of American interests at the table. Unfortunately, under \nthe amendment as currently written, they do not know what is being \nnegotiated at the table. They do not know what the agenda is at the \ntable. They do not know what their responsibilities are going to be, \nbeyond the vague standard that they have to deem the income of the \nsponsor for any program of assistance funded in whole or in part by the \nFederal Government.\n  So I do not think that is good government. That is not good policy. \nIt is not a respectful relationship with our intergovernmental \npartners, and it is directly contrary to the spirit of the unfunded \nmandate bill which this Senate passed as one of the first acts of the \n104th Congress.\n  So for that reason, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote yes \non each of the two amendments that we will have before us this \nafternoon: First, the Cuban Adjustment Act amendment and, second, the \ntruth in advertising in deeming for legal aliens amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I believe my friend the Senator from \nAlabama would like to speak on his own hour. I certainly yield for \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1664, the \nImmigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act, which was \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee, after a rather long and \narduous process, by a vote of 13 to 4.\n  I especially commend my long-time friend and colleague, Senator Alan \nSimpson, who is chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration \nwho has guided this legislative effort which is aimed at reducing \nillegal immigration in this country. He has the patience of Job, and I \nwill miss his good company when we end our Senate careers, which began \ntogether 18 years ago. Also, I commend Senator Kennedy who has worked \ndiligently on this bill, as he does on so many legislative proposals.\n  I do not believe that there is much question that we need to reduce \nthe high level of illegal immigration in this country, which has been \nan enormous drain on the country's welfare system, its public education \nsystem, as well as other Government resources.\n\n[[Page S4386]]\n\n  The committee report shows that the number of illegal aliens \napprehended each year since 1990 has been over 1 million. This figure \nalone justifies the steps that need to be taken to reduce illegal \nimmigration.\n  The provisions in title I of this bill will strengthen law \nenforcement efforts against illegal immigration. The bill provides for \nadditional law enforcement personnel and detention facilities, \nauthorizes pilot projects to verify eligibility for employment and \ncontains provisions to reduce document fraud.\n  Title I contains higher penalties for document fraud as well as alien \nsmuggling, and it also streamlines exclusion and deportation procedures \nand establishes procedures to expedite the removal of criminal aliens.\n  The provisions in title II relating to financial responsibility of \naliens is very important. I believe that aliens should be able to \nsupport themselves and, in fact, the U.S. law requires that an \nimmigrant may be admitted to the United States upon an adequate showing \nthat he or she is not likely to become a public charge. This has been a \nlongstanding policy of our Nation, and the legislation before this body \nwould strengthen that policy.\n\n  Title II contains certain provisions to reduce aliens being a burden \non our Nation's welfare system. It contains a provision that an alien \nis subject to deportation if she or he becomes a public charge within 5 \nyears from entry into the U.S.\n  Title II prohibits the receipt of any Federal, State or local \ngovernment assistance by an illegal alien, except in rare \ncircumstances, such as emergency medical care, pregnancy service or \nassistance under the National School Lunch or Child Nutrition Act.\n  Further, one of the ways an alien can prove he or she will not become \na public charge is to have a sponsor in the U.S. file an affidavit of \nsupport which, under current law, requires the sponsor to support an \nalien for 3 years. This legislation increases a sponsor's liability to \n10 years, which is the same time it takes any citizen to qualify for \nSocial Security retirement benefits and Medicare. This liability \nagainst the sponsor is reduced if the alien becomes a citizen before \nthe end of the 10-year maximum period.\n  These are some of the highlights of this important legislation. A \nnumber of amendments have been offered to this bill, some of which I \nwill support and others that I will oppose. But I will keep my eye on \nthe overall objective of the bill, which is to support a national \npolicy to reduce illegal immigration and to make it unattractive for \nillegal aliens to come to the United States.\n  In these days of declining governmental resources, we must provide \nfor our own citizens first and foremost. This legislation, under the \nworthy stewardship of Senator Simpson and augmented by Senator Kennedy, \nis a step in the right direction.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, through the years of my work in this \narea, no one has been more available to visit with, to commiserate \nwith, to talk with than my old friend from Alabama, Senator Howell \nHeflin. He has been a wonderful friend and, more appropriate, he has \nlistened attentively to these issues of legal and illegal immigration \nand always, indeed, has been supportive when he could and at least I \nalways understood when he could not. No one could have assisted me more \nthrough the years than the senior Senator from Alabama. I appreciate \nthat very much in many ways.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining on my own time \nbefore seeking time to be yielded from generous colleagues?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 31 minutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, let me speak then on the Kennedy \namendments. I have spoken on the Cuban Adjustment Act, and I have \nspoken on the Graham amendment. Let me speak briefly on the Kennedy \namendment, the Kennedy amendment en bloc, the two that have been joined \nand the next one, a singular one, and I address them together because \nthey are very similar.\n  Let me say that, indeed, I oppose the Kennedy amendment and I go back \nto this singular theme that we must not deviate from: Before a \nprospective immigrant is approved to come to the United States, that \nperson must demonstrate that he or she is not likely at any time to \nbecome a public charge.\n  I know that is repetitive. It was the law in 1882. The individuals \nmeet this public charge requirement by a sponsor's written agreement, \nan affidavit of support. It is to provide support if the alien ever \nneeds support. If the alien needs nothing, the sponsor pays nothing. If \nsuddenly the alien says, ``I can't make it, I'm going to have to go on \nwelfare, I'm going to have to receive assistance,'' the sponsor steps \nin, not the USA. We are trying to avoid the step in these various \namendments to say the sponsor is not in this game and the USA is. We \nsay that if the sponsor is deceased or bankrupt or ill, or whatever it \nmay be, that that person will be taken care of.\n  The committee bill requires all welfare programs to include the \nsponsor's income when determining whether a sponsored individual is \neligible for assistance. In other words, the U.S. Government will \nrequire the sponsors in this bill to keep their promises.\n  CBO has scored this as a significant private-sector mandate. I think \nthat is a most appropriate definition because it should be a private-\nsector mandate. Sponsors should not expect free medical care from U.S. \ntaxpayers for their immigrant relative when they can provide it \nthemselves. That is what we are talking about.\n  If they cannot provide it themselves, I am right with Senator \nKennedy, then this Government could do so. But why let the sponsor off \nthe hook? I think that is a mistake.\n  Senator Kennedy's amendment would exempt Medicaid from any welfare \nrestrictions for a substantial number of cases. We again should be very \nclear what deeming does. It does not deny medical treatment to any \nchild or to any pregnant woman. The stories that touch our heart are \nnot affected. You can get that kind of care. You can get that kind of \nemergency care. It does not deny medical treatment to any child or any \npregnant woman with all of the poignant stories we can tell. But it \ndoes require that the sponsor who promised to provide the assistance \nwill fulfill their pledge if--if--they are capable of doing so.\n  I say that my colleague should know that if a sponsor does not have \nenough money to provide medical assistance, then Medicaid and all other \nwelfare programs are available, all of them. If a sponsor dies, then \nMedicaid and all of the public assistance programs are available to the \nnewcomer. We are not going to throw sick children into the streets or \ndeny xrays or deny care or any of that type of activity. We are only \nasking sponsors to keep their promises and pay the bill, if they have \nthe means.\n  I chair the Veterans Affairs' Committee. I do know how tough it is to \ndiscuss the word ``veterans.'' But I am wholly uncertain why the \nveteran exemption is included at all, because all veterans and their \nfamilies are eligible for medical care through our veterans hospitals--\nall of them. Needy veterans--needy veterans, poor veterans, incompetent \nveterans, whatever, they are provided free medical care, free medical \ncare, through the more than 700 veterans facilities throughout this \ncountry, under a completely separate program, which is not Medicaid. It \nis a huge program. The veterans of this country receive $40 billion per \nyear, which is not Medicaid, not that health care. They have the DOD, \nthe Department of Defense, with CHAMPUS and dependents' health care of \nthose in the military. That is another $4 billion we do not even count. \nWe wonder what is happening.\n  It is because we are generous. We should be generous. No one--no \none--disputes that. But if my colleague wants to provide an exemption \nfor these veterans hospitals, I would certainly try to work something \nout. I share that. But let us not, however, exempt sponsors of a large \nnumber of Medicaid beneficiaries from any responsibility for those they \nhave pledged to support under the guise of fair treatment for veterans.\n  There are 26 million of us who are veterans. We spend $40 billion. \nThe health care portion of that is huge, over half. There are 26 \nmillion of us. We go down in numbers 2 percent per year. You could not \nbe more generous\n\n[[Page S4387]]\n\nto veterans. This is a hook. This is one of those hooks we use to do a \ndebate; mention the word ``veterans'' or ``kids'' or ``seniors.'' That \nis how we got here to a debt of $5 trillion, which is now $5.4 \ntrillion. If we do all the evil, ugly things that will be done or could \nbe done in our discussion, the debt will be $6.4 trillion at the end of \n7 years.\n  So my colleagues know that the Federal Government spends more on \nMedicaid than any other welfare program. Use of this program by recent \nimmigrants is very significant. For Medicaid alone, CBO estimates that \nthe United States will pay $2 billion over the next 7 years to provide \nassistance to sponsored aliens. So I hope we might dispose of that \namendment.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is here and in a time bind. I yield to \nSenator Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I ask, are we on time limits?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. The Senator's own time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 hour under rule XXII.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 7 minutes and hope I do not interrupt \nwhat all of you have been talking about.\n  Mr. President, let me just suggest that if the American people \nunderstood what we have let happen to immigration in the United States \nwith reference to the welfare program, I believe, in spite of their \ngenuine interest in immigration and in letting the mix continue in \nAmerica, I believe they would come very close to saying, ``Stop it \nall.'' I am going to tell you why.\n  First, Senator Domenici from New Mexico is not against letting people \nfrom all over the world come to our country under an orderly \nimmigration process. How could I be against that? I would not be here \nif we did not have such a policy at the turn of the century. Both of my \nparents--not grandparents--came from the country of Italy.\n  In fact, my mother, unknowingly, remained an illegal alien well into \nthe Second World War because the lawyers had told my father that she \nwas a citizen, and she was not because the law had changed. So I \nunderstand all of that. I even witnessed her getting arrested by the \nimmigration people after she had been here 38 years with a family and \nwas a stalwart of the community, because technically a lawyer had told \nmy father she was a citizen, and she was not.\n  I understand how immigrants add to the energizing of this great \nNation. I understand how they provide through their gumption and hard \nwork, how they provide very positive things for America. I am not here \ntalking about changing that or denying that. But I want to just start \nby ticking off a couple of numbers and then telling the Senate what has \nhappened that I think this bill fixes. And welfare reform, as \ncontemplated, completes the job.\n  We tend to think we have a policy that we will not provide welfare to \nlegal aliens who come to America because we think they all want to go \nto work, want to take care of themselves, and we have sort of let the \nprograms develop without any supervision. So let me give you a couple \nof examples.\n  There are 2.5 million immigrants on Medicaid--2.5 million. There are \n1.2 million on food stamps--1.2 million. AFDC, 600,000.\n  It seems to me that, if we have a policy that you bring in aliens and \nsomebody is responsible for them, then how did we let this happen? \nThen, to top it off, let me give you the case with reference to the SSI \nprogram and immigrants. SSI is itself a welfare program. It is paid for \nby the general taxpayers of America, not to be confused with a Social \nSecurity program for disability that is paid for with Social Security \ntrust funds and people had to work a certain number of quarters to earn \nit.\n  I want to say since our earliest days, colonial days, excluding \nlikely public charges has been a feature of our immigration laws.\n  Also, once immigrants are here and they become a public charge, that \nimmigrant could then be deported. Let me repeat. From our earliest \ndays, likely public charges excluded from the welfare system was part \nof the American tradition and law, and once here, if they became a \npublic charge, they would be deported.\n  Data shows that immigrants, in fact, become public charges, and the \nproblem is growing. In testimony before the Budget Committee, George \nBorjas, of Harvard University, presented some startling data showing \nthe immigrants' use of welfare benefits, and showing that it is now \nhigher than that of the general population. Let me repeat. This \nprofessor showed that immigrants are using our welfare system benefits \nin higher percentages than that of the general population.\n\n  Let me take one program on and lay it before the Senate and the \npublic today--the supplemental security program, SSI. That is the \nfastest growing program in the Federal budget. It is the fastest \ngrowing program in the Federal budget. This rapid growth, Mr. \nPresident, is due largely to elderly sponsored immigrants coming onto \nthe rolls. That means elderly immigrants are being brought to America \nunder a law that says Americans who bring them will be responsible for \nthem, and they sign agreements saying that is the case.\n  Now, is it not interesting that if that is what we intend, that \nsomething is going wrong? The American taxpayers, who are asking us to \ntake care of Americans in many areas where we do not have money, are \npaying through the nose for immigrants who came here under the pretense \nthat they would be taken care of, but now we are taking care of them.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, 25 percent of the \ngrowth in SSI--that is the supplemental security income participants--\nbetween 1993 and 1996 is due to immigrants. Now, that is an astounding \nnumber because if you look at the percentage that the immigrants bear \nto that population, the elderly immigrants represent 6 percent of the \nelderly SSI population and, today, 3 percent of the population of older \nAmericans are legal immigrants, but 30 percent of the SSI beneficiaries \nare legal immigrants.\n  Something has gone awry when a large portion of this population is \nimmigrants. That is what this very simple chart shows: 2.9 percent of \nthe general population are immigrants and 29 percent of the SSI-aged \nbeneficiaries are immigrants--10 times the ratio that their population \nbears to the group that would be entitled to SSI. One might say that is \nsuch a gigantic mismatch that it seems like it is almost intentionally \noccurring. Somebody is planning it so that Americans pay for immigrants \nwho come here with a commitment that somebody else will take care of \nthem, but when they get old, the Government takes care of them.\n  I believe that there are data--and they are growing--that maybe \nsponsors bringing their relatives to the United States do so intending \nto put them on SSI. This chart shows that the minute the deeming period \nis over, immigrants apply for SSI. In fact, let us look at this one. \nWithin 5 years of entry into the United States, over half of those on \nSSI have applied. It almost seems that they come here, and those who \nbring them here plan to put them on the public welfare rolls under SSI \nat the very earliest opportunity.\n\n  For those of us who promote family unification, which is one reason \nthey get their elderly parents into America, we are beginning to be \nvery suspicious of whether the promoting of this family unification by \nmany is to bring parents here so the Government of the United States \ncan take care of them as immigrants in the United States. That is \nsomething that none of us really believe should happen.\n  There are over 1 million aliens on food stamps; half a million are on \nAFDC; 2\\1/2\\ million are on Medicaid; and untold hundreds are on small \nmeans-tested benefit programs. Clearly, there is a large number of \naliens receiving public benefits and, therefore, they are now public \ncharges.\n  I want to suggest that it is amazing. The testimony before our \ncommittee said that even though the INS, Immigration and Naturalization \nService, is charged with deporting public charges, through the last 10 \nyears only 13 people were actually deported. Of the millions that came \nin--and hundreds of thousands are obviously public charges in \ndereliction of our Federal law--there was a response of only 13 \ndeportations.\n  So my question is, How does this happen, and will we let it happen \nand continue to grow? My opinion is that this bill goes a long way in \ntrying to\n\n[[Page S4388]]\n\nresolve that issue on the side of American taxpayers, who work hard to \nearn their money and then give it to the Government and find that, in \nturn, there is such dramatic abuses of our welfare assistance to those \nin need, perhaps by aliens who seem almost to be brought here in \ncontemplation of taking advantage of all of this. It seems that simply \nmaking the support affidavit legally enforceable is a legislative wish.\n  Once again, in testimony in front of the Budget Committee, where we \nwere concerned about the skyrocketing costs, there was an analogy drawn \nbetween a sponsor's affidavit of enforcement and child support \nenforcement. I only raise that because child support enforcement is \nalmost one of these things that bear the wrong name because you cannot \nenforce it. You do not have enough bureaucracy or computers to enforce \nit. I think when we are finished, we may find ourselves in the same \nplace again because the enforceability of these affidavits is going to \nbe such a monster job that I am not sure it is going to work. But at \nleast we are on record saying it is to be enforced, and we have set the \nrules in this bill to make this a better opportunity on behalf of our \ntaxpayers.\n  A panelist asked, How can we expect to make enforcement of affidavits \nwork? Then they said the 20 years of experience in the child support \nprogram would indicate it may not work.\n  Does the Immigration Service, or any other entity charged with \nimplementing this bill, have the resources to effectively administer \nthe deeming requirement and enforce the affidavit? I am not sure. \nPerhaps the sponsors can address that in due course.\n  Do we think that there are other steps that should be taken, perhaps \nalong the lines of immigrant restrictions that are in the welfare \nbill--a 5-year ban on receipts, all noncitizens ineligible for SSI and \nfood stamps?\n  Could these steps be an interim solution until we have an effective \nscreening mechanism for public charges, enforcement of support orders \nand deeming requirements?\n  Mr. President, I did not come to the floor to criticize the bill \nbecause, in fact, it makes a dramatic change in the direction of seeing \nto it that the public charge is minimized when indeed it should be \nminimal, not played upon, abused in some instances, and even planned \nabuse to see to it that aliens come and when they get old enough, they \ngo on the public welfare rolls, even though that was never contemplated \nby our laws--either immigration or welfare.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Simpson for yielding the floor so I \ncould use part of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I hope every one of our colleagues have \nheard the remarks of the senior Senator from New Mexico. They were \npowerful, startling, and here is the man whom we entrust with handling \nour budget activities. And who does it with greater skill and dogged \ndetermination than this man? He is citing what has happened to the \nthings that we believe in and that we try to support. I know they have \nbeen so seriously disrupted and distorted. They could not have been \nmade more clear. I thank the Senator. With a few words, and with a \ngraph or two, he placed it in better perspective than I possibly could. \nThe present situation is simply unsustainable, and it is going to \nbecome ever more so.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  I will add one further comment. I am firmly convinced--and I think \nthe Senator from Wyoming is--that if the American people understood \nthis problem they would be on his side on this bill. I do not believe \nwith the budget constraints--and having to look at the many programs \naffecting American citizens and immigrants who become citizens who are \nworking and moving America ahead--that we have this kind of situation \ninvolved with reference to in the broadest sense our welfare programs. \nThat does not mean in every single sense I agree with the Senator's \napproach in this bill. Maybe lunches for school kids may be an \nexception. It is a bit burdensome. But essentially we have to know what \nwe are giving these people, and decide what we can afford. I think that \nis to be the prevailing test. And, frankly, we cannot afford a lot. We \njust cannot. We cannot take care of American citizens in this country.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  I have toyed with the issue of doing something with regard to legal \nimmigration, and that was a rather less effective exercise. Somebody \nelse can deal with that one in the years to come because this is all a \npart of that.\n\n\n Amendments to be Considered En Bloc--Nos. 3855 and 3857 through 3862; \n                           and 3853 and 3854\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar item No. 387, Senate Joint \nResolution 53.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 53) making corrections to \n     Public Law 104-134.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the joint resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n\n\n                International Voluntary Family Planning\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, this resolution makes several \nadjustments to the Omnibus appropriations bill which the President has \nsigned. I would like to take this unexpected opportunity to express my \ndisappointment, and some astonishment, at the way the funding issue on \ninternational voluntary family planning found its conclusion.\n  Though I wrote the language on family planning that this resolution \nrepeals, despite what misgivings I and others may have about this \naction, we made a deal in conference and will stick to it.\n  Since we are all a little battle-weary from consideration of the \nomnibus bill, I will forego a reiteration of the history of the family \nplanning provision, or a reassertion of what has already been stated on \nthe merits of the issue. A few points that were lost in the din of \ndebate, however, deserve a brief note.\n  It is axiomatic that reducing the number of unintended pregnancies in \nthe world will reduce the number of abortions. Conversely, where there \nis no access to family planning, and this will be the case in more \nregions of the world now, the number of abortions and maternal deaths \nwill quickly rise.\n  Through the 85-percent cut in AID's voluntary family planning program \nwhich regrettably is now in the law, we are going to find this out the \nhard way. Of the many ironies which have dogged this matter from the \noutset, among the most painful is that hundreds of thousands of women \nand children are going to die because prolife Members of Congress, many \nof whom understand basic biology, failed to apply their understanding \nto this issue.\n  A related irony is that voluntary family planning has become hostage \nto the politics of abortion. Though AID is prohibited by law from using \nany U.S. money for abortion, the fungibility argument, a slim reed at \nbest, is being used to deny family planning services to millions of \npoor couples overseas. While prolife Members continue to engage in \nfungibility discussions, millions more abortions will occur. This \noffends both decency and common sense, but for now it appears that we \ncan do no better.\n  We all care about vulnerable families, particularly women and \nchildren. I will remind my colleagues, especially those who would fund \nchild survival programs but cut family planning, that UNICEF's ``State \nof the World's Children'' report states that ``Family planning could \nbring more benefits to more people at less cost than any other single \n`technology' now available to the human race.''\n  I assure my colleagues that this matter will not go away. It is my \nhope that Members on both sides of this issue will avoid the temptation \nto let rigid\n\n[[Page S4389]]\n\nideology stand in the way of compassion and common sense in the next \nround of debate, which will surely occur on the fiscal year 1997 \nforeign operations appropriations bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly on the technical \ncorrection bill to the continuing resolution which the Senate is about \nto consider.\n  It is my understanding that the legislation passed last week \ninadvertently included the text of the Hatfield amendment, which \nprovided that the harsh restrictions on the operations of the \ninternational family planning program could be waived if the President \ndetermined that they would interfere with the delivery of such services \nand result in a significant increase in abortions than would otherwise \nbe the case in the absence of such restrictions. That amendment had \nbeen adopted by the Senate by a vote of 52 to 43, but the conferees \nnevertheless evidently decided to abandon the Senate position. That was \na very unfortunate decision, in my view, that will have an adverse \nimpact worldwide on efforts to provide family planning services to \nindividuals in developing countries.\n  It is not my intent, nevertheless, to take advantage of what was a \nclerical error in the actual text of the continuing resolution. I \nrecognize that the comity of the Senate requires that both sides of the \naisle work in good faith in these areas.\n  However, I do want to note for the record, that this courtesy was not \nextended by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee majority to the \nminority when a somewhat similar drafting error occurred during \nconsideration in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of the \ninternational family planning authorization legislation on the foreign \naid authorization bill. At that time, we were advised that although the \nintent of our amendment was clear, a drafting error occurred which did \nnot reflect the intent of the Committee in adopting, by a vote of 11 to \n5, an amendment relating to the international family planning program, \nand that a technical correction would not be permitted without the \nentire committee revisiting the issue. My staff was advised that this \ncomity, which is routinely provided when committee staff are authorized \nto make technical and conforming amendments, would not be extended in \nthis case because the issue involved family planning and abortion which \nwere important to the chairman. Unfortunately, there were other \nincidents involving population issues during the Foreign Relations \nCommittee's deliberations that also damaged the sense of comity that \nhas traditionally characterized the Senate.\n  Mr. President, these issues are very important to me and to many \nMembers of the Senate. Indeed, a majority of the Senate repeatedly \nvoted in favor of the international family planning program in a number \nof votes taken on the foreign operations appropriations bill. The \nposition taken by the conferees on the continuing resolution does not \nreflect the Senate's position on this issue and I very much regret that \nthe Senate conferees did not uphold the Senate's position. I must say I \nam confounded why the anti-abortion movement would try to dismantle the \nvery program that does more to prevent abortions than any other \ncampaign.\n  However, I do not believe that it is appropriate to take advantage of \na clerical error to regain our position. I hope that in the future \nsimilar courtesy will be extended when the shoe is on the other foot--\neven when the issue is of great importance to individual Members or is \nas sensitive as population policy is.\n  I also hope that now that the population program is resolved for this \nyear, that the program--however small it is--be allowed to go forward. \nThere are currently over 50 population program actions that the \nadministration has notified the Congress of, but which cannot proceed \nsince the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee routinely \nputs a hold on all population programs. Even those of us who fervently \noppose these reductions accept we need to live with them; I wish that \nopponents of the program would also try to abide by this compromise, \nand allow what is left of the program to proceed.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, once again I come to the floor about an \nissue of vital importance--international family planning funding.\n  In the fiscal year 1996 foreign operations appropriations bill, a \ndraconian provision was enacted that is decimating our family planning \nprograms worldwide. Under that provision, no new funding can be used \nfor population assistance until July 1, 1996--a full 9 months into the \ncurrent fiscal year. Beginning in July, the program will be funded at a \nlevel reduced 35 percent from the 1995 funding level, to be allocated \non a month-by-month basis for the next 15 months.\n  Mr. President, in dollar figures, the effect of this provision is \ncatastrophic. The net result is to cut funding for family planning \nprograms from $547 million in fiscal year 1995 to $72 million for this \nfiscal year. This is an 86-percent cut in just 1 year. This is \nindefensible. This is foolish. This is wrong.\n  Recognizing the damage being done by these restrictions, Senator \nHatfield sponsored an amendment to the last continuing resolution [CR] \nwhich would have allowed funding for these programs to resume. Senators \nDole and McConnell tried to defeat that amendment but their effort was \noverwhelmingly rebuffed by a bipartisan majority in the Senate. \nUnfortunately, the Hatfield language did not survive in conference. \nOnce again, the Republican majority in the House, which opposes these \nfamily planning programs, refused to accept the Hatfield amendment, or \nin fact any other compromise language offered by the Senate conferees \nto deal with this issue responsibly.\n  In a strange twist of fate, however, the conferees left in Senator \nHatfield's language by mistake. The final bill that was passed by the \nHouse and the Senate would, in other words, remove these intolerable \nand destructive limitations on family planning programs.\n  Now we are being asked to correct that mistake--in effect, to put \nback into place those very restrictions that a majority of us voted \nagainst and which we have worked so hard to overturn. I understand that \nthis is merely the correction of an unintentional mistake. However, I \nwould ask: Would the other side do the same for us if they were in our \nshoes? Would they agree to help us eliminate language they strongly \nsupported? And sadly, the one recent instance I can remember of a case \nlike this in the Foreign Relations Committee is that they did not \naccommodate us. So I think the Senate should be reminded of how far out \non a limb we are going.\n  I will not object to this unanimous-consent request. However, should \nthe situation be reversed, and we err at some time in the future, I \nhope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will extend the same \ncourtesy to us.\n  I want to express my strong conviction that international family \nplanning programs are in America's best interest. Funding for these \nprograms is an investment that will save the lives of thousands of \nwomen and prevent millions of unplanned births and abortions in the \nfuture. These programs will help to ensure that newborn babies will be \nmore healthy and to avert the problem of overpopulation.\n  I joined Senator Simpson in representing the United States at the \n1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, \nwhere the United States played a leadership role in galvanizing the \ninternational community to action. The conference called for a global \neffort to address overpopulation and to work together to promote \nmaternal and child health care, educational opportunities for women and \ngirls, and, most importantly, family planning programs. After pledging \nto provide world leadership in the area of international family \nplanning, we cannot abandon our global partners at this juncture.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to address what I believe is \nclouding the debate about family planning programs. There are some who \nwant to equate family planning with abortion. Let me make clear: Family \nplanning does not mean abortion.\n  In fact, statistics prove that when women have access to voluntary \nfamily planning programs, the incidence of abortion decreases. Through \neducation and contraception, family planning programs help women and \nfamilies living in impoverished countries to begin childbearing later \nin life and to space their children. The issue of helping\n\n[[Page S4390]]\n\nfamilies better plan for children is in the interest of all those \ninvolved.\n  In addition, Federal law prohibits the United States from funding \nabortions abroad. The U.S. Agency for International Development has \nstrictly abided by that law. Those who argue that international family \nplanning programs fund abortions abroad are simply wrong.\n  Mr. President, by denying people access to the family planning \nprograms worldwide by slashing their funding, there will be an \nestimated 4 million more unintended pregnancies every year, close to a \nmillion infant deaths, tens of thousands of deaths among women and--let \nme emphasize to my colleagues who oppose permitting women to choose \nabortions in the case of unwanted pregnancies--1.6 million more \nabortions.\n  These programs provide 17 million families worldwide the opportunity \nto responsibly plan their families and space their children. They offer \na greater chance for safe childbirth and healthy children, and avoid \nadding to the population problem that hurts all of us and hurts the \nunborn generations even more severely.\n  In order to spend the population money the administration will have \nto send the required notifications to the appropriate congressional \ncommittees. When that process begins, I hope that those on the other \nside of the aisle who oppose family planning programs will remember \nthat supporters of family planning programs, on both sides of the \naisle, allowed this technical correction to be made and that they will \nnot use the notification process to prevent the funds from flowing.\n  The Senate has voted time and time again in favor of international \nfamily planning programs. Soon we will begin consideration of the \nfiscal year 1997 budget. Make no mistake about it. Family planning will \nbe an issue and the Senate will continue to fight for its position on \nthis issue. The time is long overdue for the House majority to start \nacting responsibly on an issue that will affect generations to come.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint \nresolution be considered read for a third time and passed, the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nto the resolution appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the joint resolution was considered, deemed read for a third time, \nand passed; as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. President, I will submit the amendment in a moment. As we prepare \nto do that, let me say that I will proceed to an amendment. Senator \nKennedy has certainly accelerated the process. I am very appreciative. \nHe and I intend to deal with the hot button items, and certainly the \none with regard to deeming and public assistance and welfare is one of \nthose. Anything to do with verification is one of those.\n  So now I do not think this one will be exceedingly controversial \nbecause it will deal with the issue of the birth certificate, and the \nbirth certificate is the most abused document. It is the breeder \ndocument of most falsification. I have tried to accommodate the \ninterests of Senator DeWine.\n  I may not have met that test. But I certainly have tried. I have \ntried to meet the recommendations of Senator Leahy, and certainly we \nhave met the test of the issue of cost. Because we have it now so \nprovided that I think we have met those conditions.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 3853 and 3854, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

Mr. President, these series of amendments deal with a \ncertain issue. They are intended to improve section 118 of the bill \nwhich relates to the improvements in the birth certificate and driver's \nlicense. These were contained in a single amendment to this section of \nthe bill, and they have been united en bloc.\n  These amendments in their en bloc form provide for a 6-year phase in \nof the driver's license improvements. It provides that the agency will \ndevelop the new minimum standards for birth certificate copies--the \nagency designated by the President and not necessarily the Department \nof Health and Human Services.\n  The second amendment, or the amendments, eliminate the reference to \nthe phrase ``use by imposters.'' And the purpose here is to remove any \nimplication that fingerprints, or other so-called biometric information \nwill be required. That came up in the debate in committee. I have no \ndesire to go to that intrusive level, and it is not there.\n  It directs the agency developing the new standards for birth \ncertificate copies not to require a single design. That was part of the \ndebate. Surely we cannot require a single design, and we do not.\n  All of the States would not have to conform to this, and it directs \nthe agency to take into account differences between the States and how \nbirth records are kept and copies are produced. And it directs the \nagency developing the birth certificate standards to first consult with \nother Federal agencies as well as with the States.\n  It requires the agency developing the minimum standards to submit a \nreport to Congress on their proposed standards within 1 year of \nenactment, and then it also modifies the definition of ``birth \ncertificate'' to clarify that it includes the certificate of a person \nborn abroad who is a citizen at birth if the birth is registered in a \nState.\n  It also provides new minimum standards for birth certificate copies--\ncopies--which will be in effect beginning 2 years after the report to \nCongress by the agency developing the standards. And it makes a \ntechnical amendment to part of the driver's license provision so that \nit will more accurately reflect the agreement between Senator Kennedy \nand I during the Judiciary Committee markup.\n  That is the essence of the material, but let me add this. The \namendment would phase in the bill's requirements for the improved \ndriver's licenses and State issued ID documents over 6 years beginning \nOctober 1, 2000, the year suggested by the National Governors' \nAssociation.\n  Under my amendment, the improved format would be required only for \nnew or renewed licenses or State issued ID documents with the exception \nof licenses or documents issued in one State where the validity period \nfor licenses is twice as long--12 years--as that in States with the \nnext longest period. This one State would have 6 years to implement the \nimprovements. This is an accommodation that Senator Kennedy is aware \nof. His State has some very interesting and sweeping legislation with \nregard to licenses.\n  Furthermore, the bill's provision that only the improved licenses and \ndocuments could be accepted for evidentiary purposes by Government \nagencies in this country would under the amendment I am now proposing \nnot be effective until 6 years after the effective date of the \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S4392]]\n\n  I wish to give Senator Kennedy an appropriate time to respond before \nthe hour of 12:30 when by previous order we will recess, but what we \nhave tried to do is remind our colleagues once again that fraud \nresistant ID documents will not only make it possible for an effective \nsystem of verifying citizenship or work authorization but also greatly \nreduce illegal immigration.\n  The amendment is in response to the CBO estimate of the current \nrequirement that these documents be implemented prior to October 1, \n1997. The additional costs of replacing all licenses and ID documents \nby 1998, including those that would otherwise be valid for an \nadditional number of years, would be eliminated. So instead of costing \n$80 to $200 million initially, plus $2 million a year thereafter, CBO \nestimates that the total cost of all the birth certificate and driver's \nlicense improvements would be $10 million to $20 million incurred over \n6 years, and the CBO has written a letter to me confirming that fact. I \nask unanimous consent it be inserted in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 1996.\n     Hon. Alan K. Simpson,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Immigration, Committee on the \n         Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As requested by your staff, CBO has \n     reviewed a possible amendment to S. 1664, the Immigration \n     Control and Financial Responsibility Act of 1996, which was \n     reported by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on April \n     10, 1996. The amendment would alter the effective date of \n     provisions in section 118 that would require states to make \n     certain changes in how they issue driver's licenses and \n     identification documents. The amendment would thereby allow \n     states to implement those provisions while adhering to their \n     current renewal schedules.\n       The amendment contains no intergovernmental mandates as \n     defined in Public Law 104-4 and would impose no direct costs \n     on state, local, or tribal governments. In fact, by delaying \n     the effective date of the provisions in section 118, the \n     amendment would substantially reduce the costs of the \n     mandates in the bill. If the amendment were adopted, CBO \n     estimates that the total costs of all intergovernmental \n     mandates in S. 1664 would no longer exceed the $50 million \n     threshold established by Public Law 104-4.\n       In our April 12, 1996, cost estimate for S. 1664 (which we \n     identified at the time as S. 269), CBO estimated that section \n     118, as reported, would cost states between $80 million and \n     $200 million in fiscal year 1998 and less than $2 million a \n     year in subsequent years. These costs would result primarily \n     from an influx of individuals seeking early renewals of their \n     driver's licenses or identification cards. By allowing states \n     to implement the new requirements over an extended period of \n     time, the amendment would likely eliminate this influx and \n     significantly reduce costs. If the amendment were adopted, \n     CBO estimates the direct costs to states from the driver's \n     license and identification document provisions would total \n     between $10 million and $20 million and would be incurred \n     over six years. These costs would be for implementing new \n     data collection procedures and identification card formats. \n     If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. So with respect to birth certificates, the bill already \nrequires, the bill we are debating, that as of October 1, 1997 no \nFederal agency--and no State agency that issues driver's licenses or ID \ndocuments--may accept for any official purpose a copy of a birth \ncertificate unless it is issued by a State or local government rather \nthan a hospital or nongovernmental entity, and it conforms to Federal \nstandards after consultation with the State vital records officials. \nThe standards would affect only the form of copies, not the original \nrecords kept in the State agencies.\n  The standards would provide for improvements that would make the \ncopies more resistant to counterfeiting and tampering and duplicating \nfor fraudulent purposes. An example is the use of safety paper, which \nis difficult to satisfactorily copy or alter.\n  There is no requirement in this bill that all States issue birth \ncertificate copies in the same form, but in response to concerns that \nsome have expressed the amendment I now propose explicitly to require \nthat the implementing regs not mandate that all States use the single \nform for birth certificate copies and require the regs to accommodate \ndifferences among the States in how birth records are kept and how \ncopies are produced.\n  These are the things that this provides. There is more. We will \ndiscuss it in further depth after we return from recess for our \ncaucuses. But these are modifications suggested by the Governors and \nsome of my colleagues, and the real issue is a very simple one. Birth \ncertificates are the breeder document. You get the birth certificate--\nyou can get it by reading the obituaries. Read the obituaries and write \nfor the birth certificate--no proper certifications.\n  I yield to my colleague for any time he would wish on this or any \nother matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just a brief comment on this measure. I \nthink that Senator Simpson has made several valuable changes in the \nbill on the driver's licenses and birth certificates. I strongly \nsupport his proposal in this area to alleviate the concerns that the \nprovisions amounted to an unfunded mandate. He has addressed those \nissues.\n  In addition, Senator Simpson has made important changes in the \nprovision on the birth certificates. The amendment instructs the HHS, \nwhen issuing the guidelines for birth certificates, to not require \nbirth certificates to be one single form for every State, and the other \nmeasures he has outlined.\n  This is a difficult issue for many, but it is an absolutely essential \none. We are not serious in trying to deal with illegals unless we get \nright back to the breeder document, which Senator Simpson has done, and \nalso in terms of a verification program, which we will have an \nopportunity to debate, and also in terms of the Border Patrol. Those \nare the essential aspects.\n  That is where the target is. Jobs are the magnet. This helps provide \nassurances that illegals are not going to get the jobs and legals, \nlegal Americans will be protected. This is an extremely important \nprovision. It is a difficult one and we will have a chance to address \nsome of the related matters later in the afternoon.\n  Just very briefly, Mr. President, on some of the matters that were \ntalked about earlier, I know my good friend from New Mexico talked \nabout the SSI issues and also about how legals have moved into this \nprocess and have been drawing down on the program.\n  This issue of deeming has worked effectively with the SSI, and \nSenator Simpson has addressed that issue as presented in the SSI \nbecause it will go on for some 10 years--10 years. The deeming is an \neffective program, and it will go on for a period of 10 years.\n  So the principal concerns that the Senator from New Mexico has as has \nbeen pointed out here will be addressed in the Simpson program. Many of \nus are looking at other measures where we think the deeming should not \nbe applicable and that is to try and ensure that legal immigrants are \ngoing to be treated identically to illegal immigrants for what are \nbasically programs that will have an impact on the public health.\n  My good friend from Wyoming says we ought to deem those, too. The \nprincipal fact is when you deem those programs, deeming is effective \nand that gets people out of the programs. We do not want children with \ncommunicable diseases out of the program. We want them to be immunized. \nWe want them to have the emergency care so that they will not infect \nother children. There is a higher interest, I would say, in those \nlimited areas. The House of Representatives has recognized it as we do.\n\n  And then in the second proposal that I have put forward we recognize \nthe importance of protecting expectant mothers, children and the \nveterans. Out of the $2 billion, it is $125 million. Again I think for \nthose who have served under the colors of the United States, they ought \nto have at least some additional consideration as well as children. But \nwe will have an opportunity to address those later on in the afternoon.\n  I see my colleague rising. I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nproceed for another 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I think that would be all right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there were two other items. We have tried \nto\n\n[[Page S4393]]\n\nmove this process along. I had hoped that we would be able to go back \nand forth, we would have one from one side, one from the other, and be \nable to intersperse my own amendments in with others. But as often \nhappens around here, our colleagues are committed to important hearings \nover the course of the morning, so I will just finalize the last two \namendments that I have. And then we will have an opportunity to address \nthose in the postlunch period. That will conclude the debate on that.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask the current amendment be temporarily set aside. \nI will send----\n  Mr. SIMPSON.

Let me ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be \nset aside temporarily, and ask unanimous consent amendments 3853 and \n3854 be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Section 274B of such Act shall remain \n     fully applicable to the participants in the project.\n       (B) If the Attorney General makes the determination \n     referred to in subparagraph (A), the Attorney General may \n     require other, or all, employers in the geographical area \n     covered by such project to participate in it during the \n     remaining period of its operation.\n       (C) The Attorney General may not require any employer to \n     participate in such a project except as provided in \n     subparagraph (B).\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3854\n\n  (Purpose: To modify bill section 112 (relating to pilot projects on \nsystems to verify eligibility for employment in the U.S. and to verify \nimmigration status for purposes of eligibility for public assistance or \n certain other government benefits) to define ``regional project'' to \n mean a project conducted in an area which includes more than a single \n          locality but which is smaller than an entire State)\n\n       Sec. 112(a) is amended on page 31, after line 18, by adding \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(i) Definition of Regional Project.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``regional project'' means a project \n     conducted in a geographical area which includes more than a \n     single locality but which is smaller than an entire State.''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3829\n\n    (Purpose: To allocate a number of investigators to investigate \n              complaints relating to labor certifications)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the pending amendment be \ntemporarily set aside and it be in order to consider my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3829.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 8, line 17, before the period insert the following: \n     ``except that not more than 150 of the number of \n     investigators authorized in this subparagraph shall be \n     designated for the purpose of carrying out the \n     responsibilities of the Secretary of Labor to conduct \n     investigations, pursuant to a complaint or otherwise, where \n     there is reasonable cause to believe that an employer has \n     made a misrepresentation of a material fact on a labor \n     certification application under section 212(a)(5) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act or has failed to comply with \n     the terms and conditions of such an application''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, under my amendment, up to 150 of the 350 \nDepartment of Labor wage and hour investigators authorized in the bill \nwill be assigned the task of ensuring that employers seeking immigrant \nhelp do so according to our laws.\n  This amendment simply takes the same enforcement authority that is \navailable to the Labor Department in the temporary worker program and \nmakes it available to the permanent worker program. It does not create \nanything new. Enforcement activities covered under my amendment include \nthe investigations of cases where there is a reasonable cause to \nbelieve the employer has made a misrepresentation of a material fact on \na labor certification application. These enforcement activities are \nvital to reduce the number of immigrant and nonimmigrant victims of \nillegal immigration practices.\n  There is no better example of the need for better DOL enforcement \nthan in the recruitment area. For example, employers currently are \nrequired to recruit U.S. workers first, bringing in permanent \nimmigrants, but the recruitment process result is the hire of a U.S. \nworker only 0.2 of the time. A recently released report of the \nDepartment of Labor's inspector general shows recruitment in the \npermanent employment program is a sham.\n  Another example, the IG reports that during one 6-month period, \n28,000 U.S. applicants were referred on 10,000 job orders and only 5 \nwere hired.\n  I have other amendments to address these problems. At the minimum, \nwhat we should do is increase our capacity to enforce our current law.\n  That is it basically. It is a pretty straightforward issue. We \ndiscussed this issue in general terms during the course of the \namendment debate.\n  Mr. President, I ask it be in order to temporarily set aside the \nexisting amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3816\n\n    (Purpose: To enable employers to determine work eligibility of \n           prospective employees without fear of being sued)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3816.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 37 of the matter proposed to be inserted, beginning \n     on line 12, strike all through line 19, and insert the \n     following:\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (6) of section 274B(a) (8 U.S.C. \n     1324b(a)(6)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(6) Treatment of certain documentary practices as \n     employment practices.--\n       ``(A) In general.--For purposes of paragraph (1), a \n     person's or other entity's request, in order to satisfy the \n     requirements of section 274A(b), for additional or different \n     documents than are required under such section or refusal to \n     honor documents tendered that on their face reasonably appear \n     to be genuine shall be treated as an unfair immigration-\n     related employment practice relating to the hiring of \n     individuals. A person or\n\n[[Page S4394]]\n\n     other entity may not request a specific document from among \n     the documents permitted by section 274A(b)(1).\n       ``(B) Reverification.--Upon expiration of an employee's \n     employment authorization, a person or other entity shall \n     reverify employment eligibility by requesting a document \n     evidencing employment authorization in order to satisfy \n     section 274A(b)(1). However, the person or entity may not \n     request a specific document from among the documents \n     permitted by such section.\n       ``(C) Ability to present permitted document.--Nothing in \n     this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit an individual \n     from presenting any document or combination of documents \n     permitted by section 274A(b)(1).''.\n       (b) Limitations on Complaints.--Section 274B(d) (8 U.S.C. \n     1324b(d)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(4) Limitations on ability of office of special counsel \n     to file complaints in document abuse cases.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Subject to subsection (a)(6) (A) and \n     (B), if an employer--\n       ``(i) accepts, without specifying, documents that meet the \n     requirements of establishing work authorization,\n       ``(ii) maintains a copy of such documents in an official \n     record, and\n       ``(iii) such documents appear to be genuine,\n\n     the Office of Special Counsel shall not bring an action \n     alleging a violation of this section.

This section shall apply, \n     and the person or entity shall not be liable under paragraph \n     (1)(A), if in complying with the requirements of subsection \n     (b), the person or entity requires the alien to produce a \n     document or documents acceptable for purposes of satisfying \n     the requirements of section 274A(b), and the document or \n     documents reasonably appear to be genuine on their face and \n     to relate to the individual, unless the person or entity, at \n     the time of hire, possesses knowledge that the individual is \n     an unauthorized alien (as defined in subsection (h)(3)) with \n     respect to such employment. The term ``knowledge'' as used in \n     the preceding sentence, means actual knowledge by a person or \n     entity that an individual is an unauthorized alien, or \n     deliberate or reckless disregard of facts or circumstances \n     which would lead a person or entity, through the exercise of \n     reasonable care, to know about a certain condition.''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this proposal goes to the heart of the \ndilemma that employers feel they are facing in the hiring of employees, \nmany of whom speak with a different tongue, maybe have a skin color \nthat is different from others. Many employers feel they are caught \nbetween a rock and a hard place. If they are too vigilant about \nensuring they do not hire illegal aliens, they get charged with \ndiscrimination. If they are not vigilant enough, they get socked with \nemployer sanctions.\n  This amendment eliminates that dilemma by amending both the employer \nsanctions and the document abuse provisions. For the first time, there \nis now explicit language guaranteeing that if the employers follow a \nfew simple rules, they cannot be held liable under either the employer \nsanctions provisions or the document abuse provisions.\n  Here are the simple rules: As long as an applicant produces a \ndocument from the accepted list of documents--that will be the reduced \nlist, the six that will be as a result of this bill --and the document \nappears authentic, the employer cannot ask for additional documents to \nprove employment eligibility.\n  If the employer follows these simple rules, my amendment contains \nexplicit language ensuring that the employer is off the hook for \nemployer sanctions on discrimination. If the applicant provides one of \nthe six documents, and it is authentic or looks to be authentic and \nthat person is hired, then effectively this provision will be a good-\nfaith response to any charge that there was any intentional kind of \ndiscrimination against that individual.\n  The document abuse provision now states if the employer follows these \nrules, the Justice Department ``shall not bring an action alleging a \nviolation of this section.'' These are entirely new provisions. \nEverybody agrees there is a serious problem against foreign-looking and \nforeign-sounding American citizens and legal immigrants. Everybody \nagrees also, and studies have confirmed, that employer sanctions have \nbeen used to discriminate.\n  The most widely utilized procedure is when employers see or \nunderstand that a Puerto Rican is applying and they ask for the green \ncard. They ask for the green card, the Puerto Rican does not have a \ngreen card because he or she is a U.S. citizen, and, therefore, they \ndiscriminate against those individuals.\n  What this would say is, if the individual provided any of the six, \nthen that effectively ensures that the employer will not be subject to \nthe charge of discrimination. It basically resolves, I think, in a very \nimportant way, the employer and the applicant's interest.\n\n  It makes no sense to enact a provision that everyone knows can lead \nto possible problems of discrimination. The problems are document fraud \nand the pressure created by the employers by the employer sanction \nprovisions. We already addressed the document fraud problem elsewhere \nin the bill. We are reducing the number of applicable documents from 29 \nto 6, and we are making it harder for criminals to manufacture the \nphony document.\n  This amendment eliminates the pressure on employers created by \nemployer sanctions provisions. It also provides protections for the \napplicants. I think it is a preferable way of dealing with this \nparticular issue. We had discussion on this in the committee and we did \nnot accept these provisions, but it does seem to me that they meet the \nchallenge of protecting us against discrimination and, also, against \nthe employer being subject to employer sanctions.\n  Those are the principal items. As I said, we have had a good \nopportunity. The members of the Judiciary Committee are familiar with \nthese measures. We have been on the legislation for a few days. These \nmeasures are complex, they are difficult, but they are enormously \nimportant because they reach the issues of discrimination. In the last \ninstance, they reach the whole question about the assurance that we are \ngoing to give adequate notice for Americans when there are job openings \nso they can be protected, their interests can be protected, and we can \nensure that when there are openings for American workers and they are \nqualified, that they are going to be able to gain the employment and \nthere is not going to be a circuitous way to effectively undermine the \ninterests of workers.\n  What we have found is that, in so many instances, when there is a \nhiring of a foreign worker the salaries go down and other benefits go \ndown for that worker, so the American worker, first of all, does not \nget the job. And, then, if the foreign worker gets paid less, which \nmeans that an American company on the one hand is competing with this \ncompany and the second company has an advantage because they are paying \ntheir foreign workers less, and therefore they have a competitive \nadvantage, the American workers at the second company lose their jobs, \ntoo.\n  So we want to try, to the extent we can, to make sure the current law \nis being enforced. When we come back to the issues of legal \nimmigration, we will have an opportunity to address some of those \nitems, which I think are very, very high priority.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I have just 5 minutes remaining. We will, \nof course, return to these issues. I appreciate the cooperation of my \nfriend from Massachusetts.\n  The first amendment at the desk--I do not recall the number, but the \none on enforcement of labor conditions--is similar to the one my \ncolleague offered at a subcommittee markup.\n  It concerned me then because of the broad grant of power that it \nmakes to the Secretary of Labor to bring employers before a tribunal, \ndemand various kinds of information and assess substantial penalties, \nand I remain very concerned about the same problems in this amendment.\n  He has argued that it provides investigative authority to the \nDepartment\n\n[[Page S4395]]\n\nof Labor in H-1B nonimmigrant cases, indicating this simply provides \nsimilar investigative authority to the Department of Labor as in labor \ncertification cases, but in this amendment, the DOL can initiate its \nown investigations. It is given authority under section 556 of title V \nwhich it does not have in H-1B cases. There is an array of penalties \nand remedies that is greater than that in 212. I certainly think it \nwould not be appropriate, and I would speak against it.\n  Quickly, with regard to the amendment dealing with the ``intent \nstandard,'' I oppose that amendment. I have heard many more horror \nstories from employers who, when trying in absolute good faith to avoid \nhiring illegal aliens, have for one reason or another required more \ndocuments than the law requires or the wrong documents or fail to honor \ndocuments that appear to be genuine.\n  Here is a common scenario. We often hear scenarios of the aggrieved. \nHere is one.\n  A worker initially submits an INS document showing time-limited work \nauthorization. At a later verification, however, the same employee \nproduces documents with no time limitation--for example, a Social \nSecurity card--to show work authorization and a driver's license to \nshow identity, both of which the employer knows are widely available in \ncounterfeit form. What is the employer supposed to do?\n  Under current law, if the employer asks for an INS work \nauthorization, he or she can be fined, for a first offense, up to \n$2,000 per individual. Yet, if the employer continues to employ the \nindividual, he or she will be taking the chance of unlawfully hiring an \nillegal alien. Remember that compliance with the law requires an \nemployer to act in good faith. Would there be good faith under such \nsuspicious circumstances?\n  Furthermore, in hiring the individual, the employer would be facing \nthe possibility of investing considerable time and resources, including \ntraining, in an individual whom the INS might soon force the employer \nto fire. There is also the loss of the work opportunity for the legal \nU.S. worker, people we speak of here.\n  In another example, a college recruiter cannot ask a job applicant, \n``Do you have work authorization for the next year?'' That is \ndiscrimination because it would discriminate against asylees or \nrefugees with time-limited work authorization. A recruiter may only \nask, ``Are you permitted to work full-time?''\n  Employers cannot even ask an employee what his or her immigration \nstatus is. An employer may only ask, ``Are you any of the following? \nBut don't tell me which.''\n  I oppose any kind of employment discrimination, always have \nthroughout the whole course of years. Employers who intentionally \ndiscriminate in hiring or discharging are breaking the law. Scurrilous. \nBut I do not believe it fair to fine the employers who are trying in \ngood faith to follow the law.\n  Under this amendment, law-abiding employers would continue to be \nthreatened with penalties. The amendment says an employer may not ask \nfor different documents, even when the employer has constructive \nknowledge that the applicant's documents are likely to be false; must \nreverify an employee if their time-limited work authorization expires, \nand must accept documents provided; and will be fined for employer \nsanctions or unfair discrimination unless he or she asks for any \nspecific documents from the alien. This is the same as current law, and \nI think this is unacceptable.\n  We will review and discuss it further. I will have further comments. \nBut I believe, under the previous order, that we will now proceed to \nregular order with the direction of the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/30/senate-section/article/S4390-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me also indicate something that it is \nnot a part of this bill. It is still our intention to work out some \nprocedure where we can take up repeal of the 4.3-cent gas tax. That is \na matter of about $4.8 billion per year. It is our intention to repeal \nit until the end of the year and work on a permanent repeal during the \nbudget process.\n  We believe, with the skyrocketing prices of gasoline, jet fuel, and \nother fuels, that the most certain way to give consumers relief is to \nrepeal the gas tax. That was part of the 1993 $265 billion tax increase \nPresident Clinton proposed, which did not receive a single Republican \nvote in the House or Senate. A permanent repeal of the gas tax is about \n$30 billion.\n  So what we hope to propose, and hopefully on a bipartisan basis, at \nthe appropriate time, is to go ahead and repeal the gas tax for the \nremainder of this year and try to get this done before the Memorial Day \nrecess and deal with permanent repeal during the budget process. Of \ncourse, we would have to find offsets and pay for the repeal. It seems \nto me that we should do that as quickly as we can before the summer \ndriving season starts in earnest.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know the majority leader wants to get \non with the measures. We have been in touch with Senator Simon and \nothers. I understand Senator Simon is coming to the floor, and others. \nI will just mention that, just as the leader wants to get on to the \nissues in terms of the gas tax, many of us would still like to get on \nwith the issues of the minimum wage increase. That, I think, is \nsomething we are all interested in. We are all interested in different \nmatters, and that has been outstanding for some period of time.\n  As I have indicated earlier, I hope that after we finish all of these \namendments, while it is open for amendment, we would at least have the \nopportunity to offer it under the underlying bill. I know that the \nmajority leader has not looked kindly on that in the past. But I wanted \nto at least make sure that we all understood at least what we were \ngoing to attempt to do.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate to the Senator from \nMassachusetts that we have discussed not only minimum wage, but maybe \neven coupling these two items, joining the two, repeal of the gas tax \nand maybe the minimum wage, some increase. We talked about a lot of \ndifferent options and we have not reached a decision.

Mr. President, I will make a quick comment regarding the \ncomments that the leader made on a repeal of the so-called gas tax of \n1993, the 4.3 cents.\n  Well, I think that if you look back in history, when we passed that \n4.3 cents, after it was passed, the price of gas at the pump was \nactually lower than before we passed the tax. It is something called \nsupply and demand, which I had thought the folks on this side of the \naisle were particularly enthusiastic about. It is very clear that there \nare market forces at work here. Repealing the Federal 4.3 cent tax on \ngasoline of 1993 is certainly no guarantee that that is going to mean a \n4.3 cent lower price at the pump for the citizens of this country, \nunless someone is going to start mandating to private industry what the \nprice of fuel is going to be that they sell.\n  I point out, if we remember history, last year at this time, between \nthe months of April and May, the price of gas rose about 6 cents a \ngallon because of greater use and higher crude oil prices in the world. \nDuring the middle of the summer and toward the latter summer, gas \nprices started coming down because of supply and demand. At the end of \nthe year, in December, the price of gas in the country averaged about \n$1.16 a gallon. All of last year, in 1995, the price of gas at the pump \nfor the whole year averaged the lowest it had been since we started \nrecording the price of gasoline in real terms in this country--lower in \nreal terms than it was per gallon in 1920.\n  All of that, I suggest, has a great deal more to do with the price of \ncrude oil in the world. The fact that we had about a 6- to 8-percent \nincrease in heating oil production because of a colder winter, and also \nbecause of the fact that we are now driving faster because of actions \nof this Congress, when we increased the miles per hour people could \ndrive, the speed limit, up to the higher levels that we now see \nthroughout the country.\n  So I just say that if anybody can guarantee that any time we reduce \nthe gas tax it means a lower price at the pump, I think we would be \nwilling to look at it. I do not think history proves that. I think we \nought to know where we are going before we start off in what I think is \na political direction.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In Section 202(a), at page 190, strike line 16 and all that \n     follows through line 25 and insert the following:\n       ``(v) Any State general cash assistance program.\n       ``(vi) Financial assistance as defined in section 214(b) of \n     the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980.''.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, my amendment conforms the Senate amendment \nto a similar provision in the House amendment in terms of being \neligible for deportation if you are here illegally and you use Federal \nprograms of assistance.\n  Under the Senate bill, an immigrant receiving public assistance for \n12 months within his first year in the United States may be deported as \na public charge. That would include, for example, higher education \nassistance. The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Indiana, is on the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee. If a legal resident came in and \ngot job training, under this amendment, unless we conform it to the \nHouse amendment, that would make you subject to deportation. If one of \nyour children got into Head Start, that would do it.\n  My amendment would make this bill precisely like the House bill and \nlimit the assistance to the basis for deportation to AFDC, SSI, and, \nfrankly, SSI is the program that is being abused. As to the other \nwelfare programs, legal immigrants to our country use these programs \nless than native-born Americans. But my amendment would limit the AFDC, \nSSI, food stamps, Medicaid, housing, and State cash assistance.\n  I think it makes sense. I cannot imagine any reason for opposition. \nBut I see my friend from Wyoming is not on the floor right now. I am \nnot sure what his disposition may be on this amendment. But I would be \nhappy to answer any questions that my colleagues have.\n  Mr. President, if no one else seeks the floor, I ask to set aside my \namendment so that I may offer a second amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3760\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wonder if I might speak in opposition to \nthe Graham amendment for 1 minute while we are waiting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator is recognized \nto speak for 1 minute.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues.\n  I just did not realize the language of this amendment was coming up. \nI say to my colleagues here--and I suspect this may carry fairly \noverwhelmingly--I hope people understand this applies to illegal \naliens, not legal aliens. So you illegally arrive anywhere in the \nUnited States from Cuba. You are given a status we do not give anywhere \nelse in the world. You arrive from the People's Republic of China. You \ndo not get this status. You arrive from North Korea. You do not get \nthis status. You arrive from Vietnam, still a Communist country. You do \nnot get this status.\n  So here we are taking one fact situation, no matter how meritorious \npeople may argue, and applying a totally different standard here for \none group of people and not to others. If you come to this country from \nthe People's Republic of China, you have lived under an oppressive \ngovernment, and we are making a case here that if you come out of Cuba, \neven as an illegal, that you get automatic status here. Why do we not \napply that to billions of other people who live under oppressive \nregimes?\n  I would say as well, in 30 additional seconds, if I may, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would say to my colleagues, the people of \nFlorida, too, I might point out, have their economic pressures as well. \nFrankly, having people just show up and all of a sudden given legal \nstatus automatically by arriving, I think is creating incredible \npressures there. And if we are going to do it there, then I would \nsuggest we go to another place.\n  I urge that this amendment be rejected, come back with an amendment \nthat covers people who come from all Communist governments, not just \nthis one. If we are truly committed to that, then people all over this \nglobe who live under that kind of system ought to be given the same \nstatus.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the vote occurs on amendment No. 3760, \noffered by the Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham]. The vote occurs on \nthe conditional repeal of the Cuban Adjustment Act, on a democratically \nelected government in Cuba being in power. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent, was there not \nan opportunity for a minute to present the amendment prior to the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was the understanding of the Chair that \nthat time was subsumed within the additional 30 minutes allocated for \ndebate. Without a unanimous-consent request and agreement----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would ask unanimous consent for 1 minute on the \namendment prior to the vote.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I think it would be appropriate to each \ntake 1 minute, and I would like to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \ntime will be equally divided, 1 minute each, between the majority and \nminority.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to listen to this \nbecause there have been some myths and misstatements with regard to the \nCuban Democracy Act. The Cuban Democracy Act, which has been the law of \nthis land since November 2, 1966, explicitly states that it only \napplies to aliens who have been inspected and admitted or paroled into \nthe United States. You do not get the benefit of the Cuban Adjustment \nAct unless you are here under one of those legal status conditions, \nhave been here for a year, request the Attorney General to exercise her \ndiscretionary authority, and she elects to do so.\n  That is what the current law is. That is the law which I believe \nshould continue in effect until there is a certification that a \ndemocratic government is now in control of Cuba. The law was passed for \nboth humanitarian and pragmatic reasons, to provide a means of \nexpeditious adjustment of status of the thousands of persons who are \ncoming from a Communist regime, not halfway around the world but 90 \nmiles off of our shore. The simple reason that was relevant in 1966 is \napplicable in 1996, and therefore the law should be retained until \ndemocracy returns to Cuba.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, it was never referred to as the Cuban \nDemocracy Act. There is no such provision. It was passed to allow the \nadjustment of hundreds of thousands of Cubans fleeing Castro's \ncommunism. They were welcomed with open arms. We have done that. They \nwere given parole. They needed a means to adjust.\n  You can come here legally and violate your tourist visa, stay for a \nyear, and you get a green card. You can come here on a boat illegally \nand after 1 year get a green card. We do not do that with anyone else \nin the world, and we are trying to discourage irregular patterns of \nimmigration by Cubans. We expect them to apply at our interest section \nin Havana.\n  We do not need it. It is a remnant of the past. We have provided for \nthe Cubans. Please hear this. We have provided in this measure for the \nCubans coming under the United States-Cuba Immigration Agreement that \nwas entered into between President Clinton and the Cuban Government. We \nshould repeal it. It discriminates in favor of Cubans to the detriment \nof all other nationalities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment, No. 3760, offered by Senator Graham of \nFlorida. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3803\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the second amendment relates to the issue \nof deeming, that is, counting the income of the sponsor to that of the \nalien. Under the current law there are three categories in which this \nis done: SSI, food stamps, and aid to families with dependent children. \nWhat is significant is that under the current law, each instance of \ndeeming is specifically listed. Under the legislation that is before \nus, there is a vague standard which says, ``Any program which is in \nwhole or in part funded with Federal funds shall be deemed.''\n  There are literally hundreds, maybe thousands, of those types of \nprograms. This amendment speaks to the principle, let us continue the \npolicy of specifically listing all of those programs that we intend to \nbe deemed. We have suggested 16 programs to be deemed. It is open for \namendment if others wish to offer additional programs to be deemed. But \nlet us not leave this matter open-ended and as obscure as it is in the \nlegislation that is before us.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, the question here is, who should pay for \nassistance to a new immigrant? Should the sponsor who brought the \nperson in the United States and made the promise, the affidavit of \nsupport, or should the taxpayer? The bill before the Senate requires \nthat all means tested--I am talking only about means-tested welfare \nprograms--include the income of the sponsor, the person who promised \ntheir relative would never use public assistance, when determining \nwhether a new arrival is eligible for assistance.\n  That is as simple as it can be. The only exceptions are for soup \nkitchens, school lunch and WIC. That is it. This truth in application, \nthat is it. The U.S. Government expects sponsors to keep their promises \nto care for their immigrant relatives.\n  The Graham amendment would gut the provisions of this bill, would \nlimit sponsored-alien deeming to only SSI, AFDC, food stamps, and \npublic housing programs, that being almost unchanged from current law. \nIt would exempt Medicaid, job training, legal services, a wide range of \nother multibillion-dollar noncash welfare programs from welfare \nprovisions in the bill. I oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3803. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

I further ask that the vote occur on adoption of the \nresolution immediately following the use or yielding back of time and \nthat no amendments or motions be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. And before that procedure, let me just review matters. \nAt the conclusion of this proceeding, Senator Kennedy will go to the \namendments which were discussed this morning, the deeming-parity \namendment, which are two en bloc, and the Kennedy Medicaid amendment. \nThere will be two rollcall votes obviously. There will be the vote on \nthe Klinghoffer matter apparently, and then we will go to further \ndebate, if any, on the two Kennedy amendments. But those will be coming \nshortly, I would believe. I think that debate is pretty well concluded.\n  Then we will go to the debate on the driver's license issue. This is \nnot about verification. This is about driver's licenses. The language \nof the committee amendment and the amendment at the\n\n[[Page S4399]]\n\ndesk is much different. In this amendment we have relieved the burdens \nof some national standard card; we have relieved the burdens of the \nunfunded mandate, and that debate will take place. I urge all who wish \nto engage in that to be prepared for that scenario. I yield to my \nfriend and colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I ask for the yeas and nays on amendments 3820 and \n3823.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what I would like to do since, hopefully, \nthose will be the two measures, is maybe just take 2 minutes now and \nexplain them just briefly so that at the end we will vote on the \nD'Amato resolution and then hopefully vote on these two amendments.\n\n  Do I need consent to be able to proceed for 3 minutes? Do I need \nconsent for that now?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, just a moment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withdraw my request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/30/senate-section/article/S4396-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4399-S4400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DETENTION AND EXTRADITION OF MOHAMMED ABBAS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 253) urging the detention and \n     extradition to the United States by the appropriate foreign \n     government of Mr. Mohammed Abbas for the murder of Leon \n     Klinghoffer.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, this resolution is very straightforward \nand it is long overdue. It calls on the Attorney General of the United \nStates to seek the detention and extradition to the United States of \nMohammed Abbas, otherwise known as Abu Abbas.\n  Abu Abbas was the leader and is the leader of the Palestinian \nLiberation Front. In October 1985, under his leadership and his plan--\nand let me tell you what the Italian courts found. They found that the \nevidence was ``multiple, unequivocal and overwhelming'' that Abbas \ntrained, financed, and chose the targets, as well as the escape, in \nseizing the Achille Lauro. It was his men who killed Leon Klinghoffer \nand threw his body overboard on October 7, 1985.\n  When this question was raised to Mr. Abbas just recently, he said \nthat he was sorry. He said it was ``a mistake.'' And then he went on to \nsay that Mr. Klinghoffer, an American citizen from New York, was killed \nbecause ``he had started to incite the passengers against [the \nkidnappers].'' Imagine that, a 70-year-old man, 70 years old, in a \nwheelchair, totally unarmed, and that is his excuse. And he says it was \n``a mistake.''\n  We owe it to every American citizen, not just to Leon Klinghoffer and \nto his family, but to every American citizen to say to those cowards, \nto those murderers who would target U.S. citizens, that they cannot \nescape justice, that they will be tracked down, that we will seek their \nextradition, that we will seek their detention, and their eventually \nbeing brought to trial for their acts, in this case a cowardly act of \nkilling a man in a wheelchair, a U.S. citizen.\n  Let me tell you again what the Italian courts found when they tried \nAbu Abbas in absentia. They said that the evidence was ``multiple, \nunequivocal, and overwhelming.''\n  I sent a letter to the Justice Department. I ask unanimous consent it \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I sent a letter to the Attorney General in which I \ncalled out for the murderer of Leon Klinghoffer to be extradited, Abu \nAbbas; that Leon Klinghoffer is entitled to justice, as every American \nis, and it has been denied, and, indeed, the Attorney General has the \nduty and obligation to see to it that we look to extradite Abu Abbas, \nLeon Klinghoffer's murderer.\n  Let me conclude by saying this. This is a very simple and \nstraightforward case. If we fail to seek justice in this case, then \nwhat kind of message do we send to other terrorists who would look to \ntarget U.S. interests, U.S. citizens? Are we saying you can get away \nwith this and you can simply offer an apology 10 years from now and say \nit was a mistake? Is that what we are going to be saying?\n  I think it is about time the Justice Department of the United States \nbegan to live up to its name and seek justice in the case of Leon \nKlinghoffer.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 1996.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Attorney General: I am writing to urge you in \n     the strongest terms to seek the immediate extradition of Abu \n     Abbas, the man convicted in an Italian court, in 1986, for \n     the murder of Leon Klinghoffer during the hijacking of the \n     Achille Lauro cruise ship in October 1985. It is absolutely \n     essential that the United States obtain custody of Abbas so \n     that he can stand trial for this brutal murder of a \n     wheelchair-bound innocent American whose body was callously \n     dumped overboard following the murder.\n       Just this week, Abbas, while attending the meeting in Gaza \n     of the Palestine National Council stated that the killing was \n     ``a mistake'' and that Mr. Klinghoffer was killed because he \n     ``had started to incite the passengers against [the \n     kidnappers].'' This pathetic excuse only reinforces our need \n     to gain his extradition. The fact that he remains free is an \n     insult to the memory of Leon Klinghoffer.\n       Abbas was convicted by a Genoan Court and sentenced to life \n     in prison, in absentia, for ``kidnapping for terrorist ends \n     that caused the killing of a person.'' The evidence against \n     Abbas, according to the Italian magistrate, was ``multiple, \n     unequivocal, and overwhelming.'' His actions in training and \n     financing for this operation, and in choosing the target, as \n     well as planning the escape, in the eyes of the magistrate, \n     made Abbas guilty of the murder.\n       Mr. Klinghoffer's murder cries out for justice. For far too \n     long, Abbas has cheated justice. Now it is our duty to \n     locate, apprehend, and return him for trial in this country. \n     Again, I urge you in the strongest of terms, to seek the \n     immediate extradition of Abu Abbas.\n       Sincerely,\n                                               Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me say I have no need for any further \ntime. I am prepared to yield the remainder of my time so we can vote.\n  May I inquire of the President whether or not I have to ask for the \nyeas and nays or whether or not that has been agreed to already?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not yet been requested.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Then those two amendments will be considered and \ntaken up back to back.\n  Then we will lay down and proceed to the amendment, which is already \nin the mix, with regard to birth certificates and driver's licenses. I \ncannot describe when that might come to a vote, but that will be the \nmatter of business.\n  So I urge all who wish to be involved in that debate to please review \nthe complete changed amendment. That is a very different procedure from \nwhat was passed out of the Judiciary Committee with regard to driver's \nlicenses, birth certificates, the breeder document that causes the most \nconcern.\n  So that is the agenda. Then, of course, the time is running, under \nthe constraints after cloture. We will simply proceed. There are many \namendments and no time for many persons to do anything but speak very \nbriefly. Some are listed with no particular topic or subject. Some 20 \nare by one Senator. I hope that the breath of reality will enter the \nscene with regard to some of those.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to give recognition to a very \noutstanding group of young people from my State of Oregon, who \nrepresent the Lincoln High School of Portland, OR.\n  Mr. President, as you know, during the bicentennial of the \nConstitution, there was a commission formed of which Chief Justice \nBurger of the Supreme Court was chair. I was privileged to serve on \nthat commission. In part of that commission's proceedings, we decided \nto develop an ongoing project, bringing a focus to the Constitution of \nthe United States amongst the high school students of our country. That \nstarted in 1987.\n  I want to say that that has been a program that I think has certainly \nbeen worthy of the investment the Federal Government has made \nsustaining that program over the years. I suppose you might call it \nboasting, but I do not really think so. I am merely making a \nrecognition of an extraordinary accomplishment. One high school out of \nthe State of Oregon has not only won the State championship each year \nof the 9 years of this program, it has finished in the top 10 \ncontestants from high schools from every State in the Union here in \nWashington, except for 1 year. It had won the national championship 2 \nyears, until last night when it won it for the third time--one high \nschool.\n  I want to say that this is a high school that is in an urban setting, \nand it is a high school that draws students from many diverse and \nsocial economic backgrounds. The students who compete have varied \nacademic backgrounds, and the team consists of sophomores, juniors, and \nseniors, and they work together as a team.\n  The competition these student participated in was rigorous and very \nmeaningful. Students demonstrated their knowledge of the Constitution \nbefore simulated congressional committees made up of constitutional \nscholars, lawyers, journalists, and government leaders. The panel of \njudges tested the expertise of the classroom teams on a number of \nsignificant questions--questions such as, ``How did the values and \nprinciples embodied in the Constitution shape American institutions, \nand what are the roles of the citizens in an American democracy?''\n\n  Mr. President, these are questions I still contemplate and struggle \nwith. There is something exciting about a room full of high school \nstudents excited themselves about the Constitution, and excited about \nthe Nation's heritage.\n  Senator Pell and I had the privilege of being with this group from \nall over the country last night. The students have worked very hard for \nthis honor, and there are a number of people who have helped them make \nthis achievement a reality. Special recognition must go to Marilyn \nCover, the State coordinator, and Dan James, the district coordinator \nfor the We the People Program.\n  I must also recognize the teachers and volunteers who gave up their \ntime to prepare the students. Dave Bailey and Gailen Norsworthy are \nboth teachers at Lincoln High School and coaches for the constitutional \nteam. Also, Chris Hardman and Chuck Sparks, who are attorneys from the \nlocal community who volunteered to prepare the students for the legal \nrigors of the competition. Also, I must single out the principal of \nLincoln High School, Velma Johnson. She is proud of these students, and \nshe has been extremely supportive of the We the People Program.\n  Mr. President, while it takes a number of outstanding individuals to \nachieve the winning record of Lincoln High School, one individual \nstands out as the catalyst and mentor for this stellar group of young \nscholars--Hal Hart. Hal Hart is an attorney by profession. He has a \nprivate law practice in Portland, but he takes time out of his busy \npractice to teach at Lincoln High School. For Hal, this is a labor of \nlove and an opportunity to give back to the community. He teaches the \nstudents about the intricacies of the Constitution, and based on the \nschool's record of success, he is obviously a master teacher.\n  I also want to individually commend the students by placing a list of \nthe participants from all over this country in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list be printed at this point in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nClass Roster for the 1995-96 Lincoln High School Bicentennial Class on \n           the United States' Constitution and Bill of Rights\n\n       Vasiliki Despina Ariston, age 15; Parents: Dino and Demetra \n     Ariston.\n       Jereme Rain Axelrod, age 15; Parents: Marilyn Couch and \n     David Axelrod.\n       Rebekah Rose Cook, age 16; Parents: Jim and Anne Cook.\n       Tawan Wyndelle Thomas Davis, age 16; Parents: Sylvia Anne \n     Davis.\n       Amanda Hope Emmerson, age 16; Parents: Ron and Ann \n     Emmerson.\n       Tiffany Ann Grosvenor, age 16; Parents: John and Jennifer \n     Grosvenor.\n\n[[Page S4401]]\n\n       William John Hawkins IV, age 17; Parents: Bill and Kit \n     Hawkins.\n       Soren Anders Heitmann, age 17; Parents: Steve Heitmann and \n     Natasha Kern.\n       Stacy Elizabeth Humes-Schultz, age 15; Parents: Kathryn \n     Humes and Duane Schulz.\n       Marissa Tamar Isaak, age 15; Parents: Rabbi Daniel and \n     Carol Isaak.\n       Heather Brooke Johnson, age 17; Parents: Tony and K.C. \n     Johnson.\n       Katherine Mace Kasameyer, age 15; Parents: Kace and Jan \n     Kasameyer.\n       Christopher Michael Knutson, age 18; Parents: Michael and \n     Carol Knutson.\n       Jeanne Marie Layman, age 18; Parents: Charles and Debbie \n     Layman.\n       Daniel Hart Lerner, age 17; Parents: Cheryl Tonkin and \n     Glenn Lerner.\n       Casey James McMahon, age 18; Parents: Patty O'Connor and \n     and Jack McMahon.\n       Lindsay Katrine Nesbit, age 17; Parents: Lee and Deborah \n     Nesbit.\n       Gerald William Palmrose, age 16; Parents: David and Sonu \n     Palmrose.\n       Mary Ruth Pursifull, age 19; Parents: Rajiam and Meidana \n     Pursifull.\n       Catherine Clare Rockwood, age 16; Parents: Theresa Rockwood \n     and David Rockwood.\n       Daniel Boss Rubin, age 15; Parents: Susie Boss.\n       Elizabeth (Liz) Leslie Rutzick, age 16.\n       Mark Richard Samco, age 16; Parents: Rick and Martha Samco.\n       Kathryn Denelle Stevens, age 15; Parents: Steve and Janet \n     Stevens.\n       Simon Brendan Thomas, age 17; Parents: Susan Rosenthal and \n     Bill Thomas.\n       Miles Mark Von Bergen, age 18; Parents: Paul and Jan Von \n     Bergen.\n       Lauren Elizabeth Wiener, age 17; Parents: Julie Grandfield \n     and Jon Wiener.\n       Farleigh Aiken Wolfe, age 17; Parents: Stephen and Jill \n     Wolfe.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I must also recognize the program that generates the \nenthusiasm of the Constitution in these students, the We the People * * \n* The Citizen and the Constitution features an intensive curriculum, \nwhich provides students with a fundamental understanding of the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights and the principles and values they \nembody. The program is designed to promote an understanding of the \nrights and responsibilities of citizens of our constitutional \ndemocracy, and gathered around this particular focus have been more \nthan 22 million students in this country who have participated in the \nprogram, at all levels, during the last 9 years--22 million. Developed \nand administered by the Los Angeles-based Center for Civic Education, \nthe program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education.\n  In discussing the We the People Program, I want to pay special \ntribute to my good friend, Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island. \nSenator Pell's commitment to education is unparalleled in this \ninstitution. He is the father of the We the People Program, and he has \nbeen actively involved in its activities since its inception. Senator \nPell has been a mentor to me and to all of us over the years on the \nissue of education, as well as other issues. The Senate is going to \nmiss his intellect and pragmatic approach to governing. I want to also \nthank a gifted member of Senator Pell's staff, David Evans, for all of \nhis hard work in conjunction with the We the People Program and his \nmany years of faithful service.\n  Mr. President, Lincoln High School has built a dynasty in the We the \nPeople Program. This is a dynasty of success, but, most importantly, a \ndynasty of knowledge--knowledge that will enable them to understand our \ncountry's origins and foundations and knowledge that will help them to \nbe better citizens.\n  Mr. President, I shout from the housetops, congratulations, Lincoln \nHigh School. You have made many people, myself included, very, very \nproud.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a list of all the \nwinners of the 1996 competition--the national winner at the top, \nLincoln High School; second place, Amador Valley High School, \nPleasanton, CA; third place, East High School, Denver, CO; and the \nfollowing honorable mentions, regional awards, and unit awards--printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  We the People . . .

Mr. President, I merely wanted to rise to express my \ngratitude to the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] for his kind words. \nHaving worked with him for thirty years, I have great admiration and \nrespect for the gentleman from Oregon. I have come to know and revere \nhim as a man of courage, conscience, and conviction. It is an honor to \nbe a recipient of the We The People award, it makes it doubly an honor \nto share it with my friend and colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/30/senate-section/article/S4400-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4401-S4418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IMMIGRATION CONTROL AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, let me go forward with the debate on the \nKennedy proposals, so that we might press forward toward the dual votes \nwithin the shortest possible period of time. I will simply go to the \nroot of the matter.\n  Mr. President, with regard to the Kennedy amendment, the American \npeople believe strongly in the principle that immigrants to this \ncountry should be self-sufficient. We continue to emphasize this \nprinciple, as I said several times today. It has been part of U.S. \nimmigration law since the beginning, and the beginning in this instance \nis 1882.\n  There is a continuing controversy on whether immigrants as a whole or \nillegal aliens as a whole pay more in taxes than they receive in \nwelfare, noncash plus cash support. Or whether that is the case with \npublic education and other Government services, there are experts, if \nyou will, on both sides who say that they are a tremendous drain, and \nothers say they are no drain at all. I have been, frankly, disenchanted \nby both sides in some respects, especially on the side that says bring \neverybody in you possibly can because it enriches our country \nregardless of the fact that some may not have any skills, some may not \nhave any jobs, and without jobs there is poverty, and with poverty the \nenvironment suffers in so many ways. But that is another aspect of the \ndebate.\n\n  I believe that, at least with respect to immigrant households--this \nis an important distinction; that means a household consisting of \nimmigrant parents, plus their U.S. citizen children who are in this \ncountry because of the immigration of their parents--there is a \nconsiderable body of evidence that there is a net cost to taxpayers in \nthat situation. George J. Borjas testified convincingly on this issue \nat a recent Judiciary Committee hearing.\n  Mr. President, an even more relevant question, however, may be \nwhether any particular immigrant is a burden rather than immigrants as \na whole. I respectfully remind my colleagues that an immigrant may be \nadmitted to the United States only if the immigrant provides adequate \nassurance to the consular office, the consular officer, and the \nimmigration inspector that he or she is ``not likely at any time to \nbecome a public charge.''\n  Similar provisions have been part of our law since the 19th century, \nand part of the law of some of the Thirteen Colonies even before \nindependence. In effect, immigrants make a promise to the American \npeople that they will not became a financial burden, period.\n  Mr. President, I believe there is a compelling Federal interest in \nenacting new rules on alien welfare eligibility and on the financial \nliability of\n\n[[Page S4402]]\n\nthe U.S. sponsors of immigrants in order to increase the likelihood \nthat aliens will be self-sufficient in accordance with the Nation's \nlongstanding policy, and to reduce any additional incentive for illegal \nimmigration provided by the availability of welfare and other taxpayer-\nfunded benefits.\n  S. 1664 provides that if an alien within 5 years of entry does became \na public charge, which the bill defines as someone receiving an \naggregate of 12 months of welfare, he or she is deportable. It is even \nmore important in this era that there be such a law since the welfare \nstate has changed both the pattern of immigration and immigration--both \nthe pattern of immigration and immigration--that existed earlier in \nour history because, before the great network of social systems, if an \nimmigrant cannot succeed in the United States he or she often returned \n``to the old country.'' This happens less often today because of the \nwelfare safety net. Many back through the chain of history in my family \nreturned ``to the old country'' because they could not make it here. \nThat is not happening today because of the support systems within the \nUnited States.\n\n  The changes proposed by the bill clarify when the use of welfare will \nlead a person to deportability. These changes are likely to lead to \nless use of welfare by recent immigrants, or more deportation of \nimmigrants who do become a burden upon the taxpayer. One of the ways \nimmigrants are permitted to show that they are not likely to become a \npublic charge is providing an ``affidavit of support'' by a sponsor, \nwho is often the U.S. relative petitioning for their entry under an \nimmigrant classification for family reunification.\n  You heard that debate when we spoke briefly of numbers and legal \nimmigration. We talked of that. That is what those classifications, or \npreferences, for family reunification are.\n  Under current law, sponsors agree to provide support only for 3 \nyears. That is current law. Furthermore, the agreement is not legally \nenforceable, because it has been ripped to shreds by various court \ndecisions down through the years.\n  The bill's sponsor provisions are based on the view that the \nsponsor's promise to provide support, if the sponsored immigrant is in \nfinancial need, should be legally enforceable and should be in effect \nuntil the sponsor's alien (a) has worked for a reasonable period in \nthis country paying taxes and making a positive economic contribution \nor (b) becomes a citizen, whichever occurs first.\n  That is the provision. The bill provides that the maximum period for \nthe sponsor's liability is 40 ``Social Security quarters''--about 10 \nyears--the period it takes any other citizen to qualify for benefits \nunder Social Security retirement and certain Medicare programs.\n  The bill also provides that deeming of the sponsor's income and \nassets to the sponsored alien should be required in nearly all welfare \nprograms--all--and for as long as the sponsor is legally liable for \nsupport, or for 5 years, a period in which an alien can be deported as \na public charge, whichever is longer.\n  Remember, we are talking about means-tested programs. We are talking \nabout all programs. Yet, amendments make distinctions, and those things \nhave been addressed as we debated. But it is simply not unreasonable of \nthe taxpayers of this country to expect recently arrived immigrants to \ndepend on their sponsors for at least the first 5 years regardless of \nthe specific terms in the affidavit of support signed by their \nsponsors.\n\n  It was only, I say to my colleagues, on the basis of the assurance of \nthe immigrant and the sponsor that the immigrant would not at any time \nbecome a public charge that the immigrant was even allowed to come to \nour country, to come into the United States of America. It should be \nmade clear to immigrants that the taxpayers of this country expect them \nto be able to make it in this country on their own.\n  I have heard that continually threaded through the debate--that they \ncome here, they want to make it on their own. We are a great country \nfor that; the most generous on the Earth. They do that, and they do it \nwith the help of their sponsors.\n  Again, remember, if the sponsor is deceased, or bankrupt, or unable \nto provide any of the assistance or support, then, of course, the \ntaxpayers step in in a very generous way to do that.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks with regard to the \namendments, unless Senator Kennedy or others wish to address the issue \nanew.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I hope that at some time in the not-too-distant future \nwe might be able to address the two amendments, 3820 and 3823, which I \nhave offered. These amendments are quite different in one respect, but \nthey are also similar in another respect in terms of reflecting what I \nconsider to be the higher priorities of the American people, \nparticularly as focused on children, expectant mothers, and also all \nveterans.\n  Let me describe very briefly, Mr. President, our first amendment that \nwe will offer. That is what we call the ``deeming party'' amendments. \nThese amendments ensure that legal immigrants are eligible for the same \nprograms on the same terms as illegal immigrants. My amendment says \nthat legal immigrants cannot be subject to the sponsor deeming public \ncharge provisions in this bill for programs which illegals get \nautomatically and for other programs such as Head Start and public \nhealth, with a minor exception for prenatal care. This is the same \namendment which was passed in the House of Representatives immigration \nbill.\n  Effectively, Mr. President, this amendment tracks what was accepted \nin the House of Representatives. Why did the House of Representatives \naccept it? Because they understand, as we understand, that when you put \nin effect deeming that cuts down on the utilization of the program. \nThat is why we have supported and I support the deeming in the SSI. \nThat is the particular program where there has been the greatest \nutilization. You have the AFDC and food stamp programs. But the \nprincipal reason for deeming is to reduce the utilization of that \nprogram, and it is effective.\n  The House of Representatives has said, look, there are certain public \nhealth programs, for example, that we ought to permit the illegals to \nbe able to use. Why? Because if they use those particular programs, \nthis will mean that it is healthier for Americans. They do it not \nbecause they want to benefit the illegal children but because they want \nto protect American children.\n  What do I mean by that? I am talking about immunization programs. I \nam talking about emergency health programs--emergency Medicaid, where a \nchild goes into the school, then ends up having a heavy cough, perhaps \nis denied any kind of attention in the school health clinic because he \nis illegal, although he should get it, and eventually goes down as an \nemergency student, stays in the classroom and goes down to the local \ncounty hospital and is admitted for TB, and in the meantime, while that \nchild has not had any kind of attention, has exposed all the other \nAmerican children to the possibility of tuberculosis.\n  That is true with regard to immunization programs. That is basically \nthe type of issue we are trying to look at. It also includes the school \nlunch program, saying that if the children are going to be educated, we \ndo not want to ask the teachers to try and separate out the illegal \nchildren in school lunch programs. That would be very complicated. It \nwould turn our schoolteachers into really agents of INS. It would have \nthe teachers going around and reviewing documents for each and every \nchild to try and identify and then take those children out, separate \nthem out.\n  It seems to me that we ought to understand the broader policy issue. \nThe real problem in dealing with illegal immigration, as the Hesburgh \ncommission found out 15 years ago and as the Jordan commission has \nrestated, the jobs are the magnet that brings foreigners into our \ncountry illegally. Jobs is the magnet.\n  The real problem is, how are we going to deal with that? Senator \nSimpson has, to his credit, worked out an orderly kind of process by \nwhich we are going to reduce the number of breeder\n\n[[Page S4403]]\n\ndocuments and we are going back to the root causes for those breeder \ndocuments, and then we are going to test various kinds of programs in \nterms of what can be most effective in verifying that it is Americans \nwho are getting jobs and not the illegals.\n\n  We are going to have votes on those particular measures. But I am \ngoing to stand with the Senator from Wyoming on those measures because \nthey are a key element if we are serious about dealing with illegal \nimmigration. Then there are provisions dealing with the border and \nBorder Patrol and enhanced procedures. All of those, we believe, can be \neffective in terms of dealing with the job magnet that draws people \nhere.\n  Our problem is not with the children. Our problem is not with the \nexpectant mothers, the expectant mothers who are going to have children \nborn here and will be Americans. In the current bill, we have said that \nthe mother has to be here for 3 years, so we are not encouraging \nexpectant mothers to come over here and take advantage of the program.\n  This particular amendment that I have offered says we will make the \nSenate bill consistent with what has been passed in the House of \nRepresentatives on those key elements that primarily affect children, \nexpectant mothers, and are listed and are structured in order to \nprotect community health and public health issues.\n  That is basically what we are attempting to do with this. This \namendment is effectively the identical amendment in the House of \nRepresentatives. We want to make sure that we are going to say to legal \nimmigrants--these are people, 76 percent of whom are relatives of \nAmerican families. All have played by the rules. All of them have \nwaited their turn to get in and be rejoined with their families, all \nwho have been qualified and may have fallen on some hard and difficult \ntimes, and what we are going to say is in this very limited area which \nthe Congress has made a decision and determination, we are making these \npolicy determinations not to benefit the child but to benefit \nAmericans.\n  Do we understand that? These proposals have been accepted in the \nHouse of Representatives, and I am urging that they be accepted here \nbecause they protect Americans. They should not follow the same deeming \nrequirements as in other aspects of the bill. That is effectively what \nthis proposal does and what it would achieve. I think it is warranted. \nI think it is justified. We have debated it in our Judiciary Committee, \nand I hope it will be accepted.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \nKennedy amendment to S. 1664. I support the Kennedy amendment because \nit would protect the multitudes of students who are eligible for \nFederal student aid under title IV of the Higher Education Act.\n  Under current law, only legal immigrants are eligible to receive \nFederal financial aid to attend college. However, provisions in the \nbill that stands before us today would require that for Federal \nprograms where eligibility is based on financial need, the income and \nresources of the sponsor of a legal immigrant would be deemed to be the \nincome of the immigrant. Simply put, the resources of an immigrant \nstudent would be artificially inflated, therefore, most legal \nimmigrants would not qualify for Pell grants or student loans.\n  I have always sought to expand educational opportunities for the \nstudents of this country. To my mind, any person with the desire and \ntalent should be afforded the opportunity for at least 2 and possible 4 \nyears of education beyond high school. The students that have legally \nimmigrated to this country should not be excluded from the vast \nopportunities that a higher education can provide them.\n  Half of the college students in this country rely on Federal grants \nor loans to help pay for college. Student aid more than pays for itself \nover time. A college graduate earns almost twice what a high school \ngraduate earns--and pays taxes accordingly. Denying a postsecondary \neducation to economically disadvantaged legal immigrants is profoundly \nunfair and economically shortsighted. Legal immigrants pay taxes and \ncan serve in the military. Legal immigrants also contribute \nsignificantly to the national economy. For these reasons I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in support of the Kennedy amendment, therefore, \neliminating the deeming requirements as they apply to Federal student \naid programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur \non or in relation to the Kennedy amendments 3820 and 3823 en bloc at \nthe hour of 4:50 this evening, to be followed immediately by a vote on \nor in relation to the Kennedy amendment 3822.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Reserving the right to object, will the Senator make it \n4:53, so I can get 3 minutes in here?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. We have people apparently going to the White House. I \nwill yield my time to the Senator. Take the 2. I was going to conclude. \nYou may take that, and I will come at my friend with vigor at some \nlater forum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I will try to be more brief than the 3 \nminutes. I think so much of this makes sense. People who are here \nlegally should get the same services as those who are here illegally.\n  What I particularly want to point out is the higher education \nprovision really would devastate many campuses and the future of many \nyoung people. People who came here legally, whose children are going to \nAmerican colleges and universities taking advantage of our programs in \nterms of loans and other programs, we ought to be encouraging that \nhigher education rather than discouraging it. The Kennedy amendments, \nit seems to me, move in the right direction.\n  Finally, to protect pregnant women and children, I think that is kind \nof basic. So I strongly support the Kennedy amendments.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I have about 30 seconds. Let me just say \nwe have already exempted school lunch and WIC in the managers' \namendment which we passed yesterday.\n  This amendment combines several distinct exemptions to the \n``deeming'' requirements in the bill. Everyone should understand what \n``deeming'' does. Deeming requires sponsors to keep their promises.\n  Since 1882, our law has stated that no one may immigrate to this \ncountry if they are ``likely at any time to become a public charge.'' \nMany individuals--about half of those admitted in 1994--were only \npermitted to enter after someone else promised to support that \nnewcomer. The sponsor guarantees that the sponsored immigrant will not \nrequire any public assistance.\n  Senator Kennedy's amendment provides a number of exceptions to this \n``deeming'' rule for:\n  First, emergency Medicaid; second, foster care; third, Headstart; and \nfourth, Pell grants and other federally funded assistance for higher \neducation.\n  On the general issue of exemptions from deeming, I would stress that \ndeeming only prevents a sponsored individual from accessing welfare if \nthe sponsor has sufficient resources to disqualify the applicant. When \na sponsor is not able to provide assistance, then the Government will \nprovide it.\n  I am not certain that there should be any exemptions from deeming. \nWhy should we permit individuals to access our generous social \nservices, when they have sponsors who have promised to provide for them \nand presumably have the wherewithal to provide the needed assistance?\n  Furthermore, I have concerns about exempting Headstart and Pell \ngrants from the deeming requirements. These programs are not open to \nevery American. Even though we spend more than $3 billion on Headstart, \nthe program only serves about 30 percent of poor children ages 3-4. I \nam not certain that we should continue to permit newcomers access \nwithout regard to the incomes of the sponsors that promised to support \nthem.\n  The Government has limited money for Pell grants as well. At a time \nthat college tuition costs are rising, it does not make sense to \nprovide scarce resources to sponsored individuals--who\n\n[[Page S4404]]\n\nhave sponsors that promised to provide support--when many citizens are \nhaving difficulty affording the high costs of college. We have already \nprovided exemptions for those students who are in school--they will \nhave no deeming applied to their financial aid. Are we going to educate \nthose who come from around the world--promising never to use public \nassistance as a condition of coming here--before we provide enough \nfunds to educate all the people who are here right now and who are \nhaving trouble with college expenses right now? It seems most puzzling.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n             vote on amendment nos. 3820 and 3823, en bloc\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendments Nos. \n3820 and 3823, en bloc. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3822\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The question is now on agreeing \nto amendment 3822.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are quite prepared to go to a vote on \nthis. We addressed the Senate and had a short debate and discussion \nearlier today. Effectively, what this is doing is you have deeming for \nall of the Medicaid programs. What we are doing is carving out three \nnarrow areas: children, expectant mothers, and veterans. There is $2 \nbillion for all of the Medicaid programs. This is $125 million in terms \nof cost.\n  For the same reasons we have outlined here, we think that the \nexpectant mothers ought to get the treatment because they are going to \nhave a child that will probably be an American citizen. We think \nveterans--you have 24,000 veterans that will be under a means-tested \nprogram. The reality is those veterans, particularly with regard to \nprescription drugs, ought to be attended to. Obviously, the emergency \nkinds of assistance under Medicaid they should be eligible for.\n  A very narrow carveout. It costs $125 million over the next 5 years \nas compared to $2 billion. That is effectively what the carveout is.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, if Senator Kennedy had an opportunity to \naddress that issue, obviously, I should have the same opportunity. I \nthink all would concur. So I want to have approximately 1\\1/2\\ minutes, \nwhatever that was.\n  First, let me say the veterans are well taken care of in this \ncountry. That one just will not even float. We spend $40 billion for \nveterans. They have their own health care system. This is another hook. \nI yield to Senator Santorum.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, I say to the Senator.\n  I just remind Senators that 87 Members of this Chamber voted for a \nwelfare reform bill that passed the U.S. Senate that said all legal-\nsponsored immigrants receive no deeming. We eliminate deeming. Under \nthe welfare bill we passed there is no deeming. If you are a legal \nimmigrant in this country, sponsored, you are not eligible for welfare \nbenefits until you become a citizen. And 87 Members of the Senate voted \nfor that.\n  This is a much weaker version. What this keeps in place is a deeming \nprovision that says that you are not eligible for benefits unless your \nsponsor cannot pay for it. We had no provision like that. There was no \nfallback. You just were not eligible, period.\n  Under the Simpson bill we are considering, at least there is a \nfallback that says if your sponsor can no longer help you, then we \nwill.\n  So this is a weaker provision under the existing Simpson language \nthan what 87 Members of the Senate voted for previously. So understand \nthat you are falling back already, and those who were support this \namendment would be falling back even further from the changes 87 \nMembers voted for.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n\n[[Page S4405]]\n\n                     Criminal Alien Tracking Center\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate approved an amendment \nthat Senator Hutchison and I offered to bolster one of the strongest \ntools local and State law enforcement agencies have to identify and \ndeport criminal aliens in our country. The Criminal Alien Tracking \nCenter--also known as the Law Enforcement Support Center [LESC]--is the \nonly online national data base available to local law enforcement \nagencies to identify criminal illegal aliens. I am proud that this \nfacility is located in South Burlington, VT.\n  Our amendment will increase the authorization for the LESC in \nrecognition of the need to bring additional States online as well as \nexpand the scope of the work being done at the tracking center. \nPresident Clinton recently signed the Terrorism Prevention Act into \nlaw. The bill identified how important the Tracking Center has become \nand proposed that the Center become the repository for an alien \ntracking system.\n  Even before these additional responsibilities, the LESC staff in \nVermont had demonstrated that the Center is a valuable asset and \nessential to our national immigration policy. The Center provides \nlocal, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies with 24-hour access \nto data on criminal aliens. By identifying these aliens, LESC allows \nlaw enforcement agencies to expedite deportation proceedings against \nthem.\n  The Center was authorized in the 1994 crime bill. The first year of \noperations has been impressive as the 24-hour team identified over \n10,000 criminal aliens. After starting up with a link to law \nenforcement agencies in one county in Arizona, the LESC expanded its \ncoverage to the entire State. In 1996, the LESC is expected to be \nonline with California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New \nJersey, Texas, and Washington.\n  The Tracking Center has become the hub at INS for seamless \ncoordination between Federal, State, and local authorities. I would \nsuggest to Commissioner Meissner, that the facility become the national \nrepository for all INS fingerprint records relating to criminal aliens. \nInformation from the fingerprints would be most accessible if the \nCenter stored this information in an AFIS/IDENT data base with a link \nto FBI data bases.\n  As a former State's attorney, I also know that even the best tracking \nsystem does not work unless there is an adequate system to ensure that \ncriminal files are promptly sent to investigators. That is why it would \nalso make sense to have the LESC serve as the repository for INS A-\nfiles related to aggravated felons and aliens listed in the NCIC \ndeported felon file. Locating these files at the Tracking Center will \nimprove their accessibility to INS agents and U.S. attorney offices \nthroughout the United States.\n  Mr. President, Congress must continue the empowerment of local law \nenforcement agencies in their efforts to identify criminal illegal \nimmigrants. I am pleased that the Senate approved our amendment, No. \n3788, that will increase the authorization for the Tracking Center--a \nresource every State should have in the fight against criminal aliens. \nI thank, in particular, the managers of the bill, Senator Simpson and \nSenator Kennedy, for including these provisions in the manager's \namendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to comment on a provision that is \nincluded in the managers' amendment to S. 1664, the immigration reform \nbill. I am pleased to introduce this amendment, which will require \nverification of citizenship and/or immigration status for those \napplying for housing assistance. The applicant will have 30 days to \nprovide proper documentation, or assistance will not be provided; \napplicants who have failed to provide documentation in that time will \nbe taken off the waiting list. For those who already receive housing \nassistance, a verification of immigration status may be required at the \nannual recertification. Annual recertification for housing assistance \nis already required to determine income levels, and I would urge \nhousing authorities to make good use of this option. If a housing \nauthority requests verification, a household will have a 3-month period \nto obtain proper documentation or assistance will be terminated. Once \nthe 3-month appeal is exhausted, a hearing may be granted in the fourth \nmonth. It is important to note that political refugees and asylum \nseekers are exempt from my proposal. The amendment I offer today passed \nthe House immigration reform bill unanimously as part of the managers' \namendment.\n  In 1980, Congress passed the Housing and Community Development Act, \nwhich included a section prohibiting illegal aliens from receiving \nFederal housing assistance. In 1995, 15 years after the bill passed, \nHUD issued regulations to implement the 1980 changes. Its regulations, \nhowever, will do little to prohibit illegal aliens from continuing to \nreceive taxpayer-supported housing.\n  Under current regulations, illegal aliens can be placed on a waiting \nlist and then granted housing assistance without having to provide \ndocumentation proving that they are eligible to receive the assistance. \nIf a household is not eligible to continue receiving assistance \ncurrently it may appeal the decision in 3-month increments for up to 3 \nyears. That is 3 years of taxpayer assistance for someone who may not \nbe eligible to receive the funds.\n  In my home State of Arizona, officials of the Maricopa Housing \nAuthority (which is primarily Phoenix) told me that, by their \nestimates, fully 40 percent of the people receiving housing assistance \nin Maricopa County are illegal. In Maricopa County, there are 1,334 \nSection 8 units and 917 public housing units available. The waiting \nlist for units has 6,556 on it. If 40 percent of the current occupants \nare illegal, that means 900 housing units should be made available to \nthose citizens or legal immigrants waiting their turn.\n  The problem in Arizona is dramatic; nationwide it is even more \ndramatic. In his report entitled ``The Net National Costs of \nImmigration,'' Dr. Donald Huddle of Rice University estimates that the \ncost of public housing provided to illegal immigrants in 1994 was \nroughly $500 million.\n  Even President Clinton acknowledged that there is a problem. When \nproposing guidelines for public housing this year, he said most public \nhousing residents have jobs and try to be good parents, and, that it is \nunfair to let lawbreakers ruin neighborhoods, especially since there \nare waiting lists to get into public housing. ``Public housing has \nnever been a right,'' he said, but rather ``it has always been a \nprivilege. The only people who deserve to live in public housing are \nthose who live responsibly there and those who honor the rule of law.''\n  The public housing authorities, of course, are the entities that will \nhave to implement any new policy we enact. I contacted the housing \nauthorities of Tempe, Yuma, Tucson, and Maricopa County. Not one of the \nhousing authorities disagreed with my proposal. They all said that once \nan applicant or resident checks on an affidavit that he/she is a legal \ncitizen, they are not allowed to pursue the issue. The housing \nauthorities currently only ask for verification of immigration status \nif the applicant checks that he/she is an immigrant.\n  This amendment will curb the amount of housing assistance--paid for \nby taxpayers--going to illegal immigrants. It will return housing \nopportunities to the people who are here legally. I thank my colleagues \nfor supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, what is the status of things at the \nmoment? I know that is unfair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have several amendments pending in the \nsecond degree. Which amendment would the Senator want to consider?\n\n\n        Amendments Nos. 3855, 3857, 3858, 3859, 3860, 3861, 3862\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. The amendments have been consolidated en bloc; 3855, \n3857, 3858, 3859, 3860, 3861, 3862 all relating to the birth \ncertificate issue and driver's license portion--has my amendment on \nbirth certificates and driver's licenses.\n\n[[Page S4406]]\n\n  Is that the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the pending business.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Let me just briefly and in 1 minute tell you what we \nhave done. In this amendment, we provide that the new counterfeit and \ntamper-resistant driver's license in the bill, whatever they are, \nwhatever State, will be phased in over 6 years, and the new standards \nwill apply only to new, renewed or replacement licenses--not something \nissued 10 or 20 years before.\n  After this change, the bill will no longer be an unfunded mandate. \nCBO has an estimate after total State and local cost of driver's \nlicense and birth certificate improvements, finding it to be $10 to $20 \nmillion spread over 6 years. New minimum standards on birth \ncertificates go into effect only after the Congress has had 2 years to \nreview them, and cannot require all States to use a single form.\n  I talked to the manager of the bill and will now urge the adoption of \nthe en bloc amendment by voice vote.\n  Mr. President, the amendment would phase in the bill's requirements \nfor improved driver's licenses and State-issued I.D. documents over 6 \nyears, beginning October 1, 2000--the year suggested by the National \nGovernors' Association.\n  Under my amendment, the improved format would be required only for \nnew or renewed licenses or State-issued I.D. documents, with the \nexception of licenses or documents issued in one State where the \nvalidity period for licenses is twice as long--12 years--as that in the \nState with the next longest period. This one State would have 6 years \nto implement the improvements.\n  Furthermore, the bill's provision that only the improved licenses and \ndocuments could be accepted for evidentiary purposes by government \nagencies in this country would--under the amendment I am now \nproposing--not be effective until 6 years after the effective date of \nthis section, October 1, 2000. By this time 49 of the 50 States will \nhave the new licenses and I.D. documents without any requirement for \nearly replacement. In one State, some individuals wanting their license \nto be accepted by governments for evidentiary purposes would have to \nrenew earlier than would be required without enactment of the bill, but \nwould still have more time--6 years--than every other State except one, \nwhich would also have 6 years.\n  Thus, the amendment would mean that 6 years after the general \neffective date for this subsection of the bill--October 1, 2000--the \nimproved licenses would have completely replaced the old ones and would \nbe required for evidentiary purposes in all government offices.\n  Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues that fraud-resistant \nI.D. documents will not only make possible an effective system for \nverifying citizenship or work-authorized immigration status--and thus \ngreatly reduced illegal immigration. The improved documents will also \nmake possible an effective system for verifying immigration status for \npurposes of welfare and other government benefits--resulting in major \nsaving to the taxpayers. Additional benefits to law-abiding Americans \nwould come from reduced use of fraudulent I.D. in the commission of \nvarious kinds of financial crimes, voting fraud, even terrorism.\n\n  My amendment is a response to the Congressional Budget Office's \nestimate of the cost of the bill's current requirement that \nimprovements in driver's licenses and I.D. documents be implemented \nOctober 1, 1997.\n  If the amendment is adopted, the additional cost of replacing all \nlicenses and I.D. documents by 1998, including those that would \notherwise be valid for an additional number of years would be \neliminated. Instead of costing $80 to $200 million initially, plus $2 \nmillion per year thereafter, CBO estimates that the total cost of all \nthe birth certificate and driver's license improvements would be $10 to \n$20 million, incurred over 6 years.\n  CBO has written a letter confirming that fact.\n  Mr. President, with respect to birth certificates, the bill now \nrequires that, as of October 1, 1997, no Federal agency--and no State \nagency that issues driver's licenses or I.D. documents--may accept for \nany official purpose a copy of a birth certificate unless (a) it is \nissued by a State or local government, rather than a hospital or other \nnongovernment entity, and (b) it conforms to Federal standards after \nconsultation with State vital records officials. The standards will \naffect only the form of copies, not the original records kept in the \nState agencies.\n  The new standards will provide for improvements that would make the \ncopies more resistant to counterfeiting, tampering, and fraudulent \ncopying. One important example: the use of ``safety paper,'' which is \ndifficult to satisfactorily photocopy or alter.\n  There is no requirement in the bill that all States issue birth \ncertificate copies in the same form. But in response to concerns that \nsome have expressed, the amendment I am now proposing explicitly \nrequires that the implementing regs not mandate that all States use a \nsingle form for birth certificate copies, and requires that the regs \naccommodate differences between the States in how birth records are \nkept and how certified copies are produced from such birth records.\n  The bill provides that the regulations are to be developed after \nconsultation with State vital records officials. Therefore, the \ndifferences between the States in how birth records are kept and how \ncopies are produced will be fully known and accommodated by the agency \ndeveloping the regulations.\n  Mr. President, my amendment also requires a report to Congress on the \nproposed regulations within 12 months of enactment. In addition, the \namendment provides that the regulations will not go into effect until 2 \nyears after the report. This will give Congress plenty of time to \nconsider the report and take action, if necessary, to prevent \nimplementation of the regulations.\n  The amendment also provides for a number of other changes suggested \nby HHS in a written comment sent in March, during the Judiciary \nCommittee markup process:\n  First, the implementing regs will not necessarily be issued by HHS, \nbut by an agency designated by the President--and the agency developing \nthe regs must consult not only with State vital records offices, but \nwith other Federal agencies designated by the President.\n  Second, in the description of the standards to be established in the \nregs, the reference to ``use by imposters'' will be deleted and \nreplaced by the phrase ``photocopying, or otherwise duplicating, for \nfraudulent purposes.'' This change makes clear that there is no longer \nany requirement in the bill for a fingerprint or other ``biometric \ninformation.''\n  Third, funding is authorized for the required HHS report on ways to \nreduce fraudulent use of the birth certificates.\n  Fourth, the definition of ``birth certificate'' is modified to cover \nnot only persons born in the United States, but also persons born \nabroad who are U.S. citizens at birth--because of citizenship of their \nparents--and whose birth is registered in the United States.\n  Fifth and finally, the effective date for the provisions relating to \nthe new grant program for matching birth and death records and the \nrequirement that the fact of death--if known--be noted on birth \ncertificate copies of deceased persons will be 2 years after enactment \nrather than October 1, 1997.\n  These modifications represent most of the changes suggested by HHS.\n  Mr. President, back to the subject of driver's licenses: There is a \ntechnical correction that needs to be made to the grandfathering \nprovision in the driver's license section of the bill. This \ngrandfathering provision is one that my colleague, Senator Ted Kennedy, \nand I agreed to at the Judiciary Committee markup.\n  The agreement was that States would be exempted from the bill's \nrequirement that State driver's licenses and I.D. documents contain a \nSocial Security number, if--at the time of the bill's enactment--the \nState requires that applicants submit a Social Security number with \ntheir application and that a State agency verify the number with the \nSocial Security Administration--but does not require that the number \nactually appear on the license or document.\n  This agreement is not reflected in S. 1664 in its present form. The \namendment I am proposing will correct that.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, these amendments are acceptable on our \nside. We support them.\n\n[[Page S4407]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  The amendments en bloc (Nos. 3855, 3857, 3858, 3859, 3860, 3861, and \n3862) were agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, just to review the matter at this time, \nthe clock is running on the 30 hours. There are many amendments filed \nand few people to come to present them. That is usual procedure. We do \nnot want to inconvenience people.\n  There are several amendments. Senator Kennedy, I believe, does the \ndesk reflect that there are two amendments of Senator Kennedy that are \npending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Two total?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Then there are two of Senator Simon, one of Senator \nShelby. Are those at the desk or have they been presented?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are several Simon amendments at the \ndesk.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. We can proceed with the Simon amendments, discuss those, \ndebate those, and see if we can process those this evening.\n  I would like to get a time agreement if at all possible. We are \ntrying to give our colleagues some indication as to the requirements of \ntheir preparation here.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3829\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the course of the morning earlier \ntoday we offered amendments with regard to labor enforcement and also \non the issues of discrimination. We had a brief interchange on that. We \nhave been ready to move toward a decision on this measure. I know that \nthe Senator from Wyoming has reservations about it, but let me just \nmention briefly again what the substance of this amendment is all \nabout.\n  As I noted in my earlier remarks, this amendment provides the \nDepartment of Labor authority to do in the permanent workers immigrant \nprogram what it can already do on the temporary worker visa program. We \neffectively have two programs. On the temporary workers, even though it \nis called temporaries, it is up to 6 years, and there were about 65,000 \nlast year. Under the permanent program it is 140,000, of which about \n85,000 to 90,000 of those places are used. Within those 85,000, about \n10,000 or 15,000 are individuals that are defined in the regulations of \nwhat we call the best and the brightest. Those are professors at \nuniversities that have a distinguished career. They are business \nmanagers that move from country to country in many of the international \nfields--top researchers and top scientists at the top of their fields--\nand regulations have been established for those individuals to be able \nto come in.\n  But the other segment of those--probably 30,000 to 40,000, it varies \nfrom year to year--there is a process and a procedure to ensure that \nthere will be an invitation for American workers, if they are \nqualified, to fill those jobs before the farm workers are brought into \nthis country.\n  What we have seen in recent times is that process is basically a \nsubterfuge. There were over 10,000 applicants last year, workers that \nwere qualified for those jobs. Only five of them were able to get the \njobs. The issue has been outlined in detail both in the press and in \nthe IG report.\n  So, clearly, what is happening is American workers' interests are not \nbeing attended to. As we are looking at general enforcement areas and \nmechanisms--and we did review the other general enforcement mechanisms \nin the bill which are related to enforcement procedures that apply to \nillegal aliens but also have a reference to legal aliens--what this \namendment does is not very revolutionary. It makes provisions for the \nenforcement of existing laws. What use is a law if it cannot be \nenforced?\n  The Department of Labor inspector general's report, widely reported \nand commented upon, provides all of the additional information \nnecessary, that our laws are not being followed and the American worker \nis the victim. Businesses have said that the enforcement of existing \nlaws should be the focus of our efforts.\n  That is what we want to do. We are providing the Department of Labor \nsufficient numbers of investigative personnel. Out of the numbers that \nhave been included in this bill, we are designating a number of those \nthat will be used for this purpose. It does not make sense to hire \nadditional people and then tie one hand behind their backs. If we are \nserious about enforcing the law to benefit American and foreign \nworkers, the amendment I am proposing is a good place to start.\n  So, Mr. President, effectively that is what this amendment does. All \nit does is enforce existing law. All we are doing is allocating \npersonnel to do for the permanent workers what we do for the temporary \nworkers: to make sure that the provisions of the law are going to be \nrespected. They are not today. It is not just my stating that they are \nnot and reviewing the facts that they are not. I rely on the IG's \nreport of the Department of Labor that spells this out in chapter and \nverse. It has been made public within the period of the last 3 weeks. I \nwill not take the time of the Senate, unless there are Members that \nwant to, and review their various findings, but the bottom conclusion \nis that this law is not being adhered to because it is not being \nenforced.\n  This measure is a very modest program, but it is an important \nprogram. The bottom line is that it will have an impact in giving \ngreater assurance to qualified American workers that when these \nvacancies become available and the American workers are qualified for \nthose vacancies, they will be considered, and considered favorably, for \nthose particular employment opportunities. That is not the case now. \nWhat we have seen from the IG's report is that in many instances these \nworkers are brought in, they are paid less than they are guaranteed, or \nprovided, and they do not qualify for the other kinds of benefits. The \nwages go down. Other workers are brought in in a similar way.\n  So the bottom line is that there is a whole series of professional, \nskilled workers that are working for perhaps two-thirds or a half of \nwhat the American counterpart is earning, and the American counterpart \nis working in an American plant. So Americans are disadvantaged in two \nways: No. 1, they are denied the opportunity to get the job in the \nfirst place; and, second, their brother workers who are working in a \nsimilar plant and earning a fair income, are further disadvantaged by \nthe fact that these wages go down, and the companies are at a \ncompetitive advantage in one sense and disadvantaged in the other as a \nresult of this program.\n\n  The program is on the books. It is not being enforced. The IG, as I \nsaid, has outlined in detail the kinds of circumstances which I have \noutlined, and we are allocating a certain number of those authorized \npersonnel to be available to enforce the law.\n  Mr. President, we have not increased any of the penalties for \nviolations. They will be consistent across the board between those that \nviolate the law under the temporaries as well as those that violate the \nlaw under the permanent. There are questions about that. We can work \nthat out and refer to the sentencing commission so there is uniformity \non similar bills that might apply in other agencies.\n  This is an important program to help protect American workers that \nare qualified, so that they are not effectively being discriminated \nagainst in terms of their job applications as a result of the desire to \nbring in foreign workers and then to pay them less.\n  Mr. President, that effectively is what the amendment is about. I \nwill be glad to either respond to questions or to move forward with the \namendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, the concern here of some of us is the \nconducting of an investigation on the initiative of the Secretary of \nLabor or on the basis of a complaint. I wonder if I might inquire of my \nfriend from Massachusetts, if we were to strike the word ``or \notherwise''--on line 6, where it says the Secretary of Labor to conduct \nan investigation pursuant to a complaint ``or otherwise''--I wonder, if \nwe were to\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\nremove that, my objection would be less. Then you would still have to \nhave reasonable cause to believe the employer has made a \nmisrepresentation of a material fact on a labor certification.\n  I share the Senator's view and the view of the Secretary of Labor \nthat certainly there have been abuses, and there have been, but I think \nthat alone rather lends an uncomfortable aspect to it as to what \n``otherwise'' would mean there.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I respond briefly?\n  I welcome the opportunity to try to find other words that might be \nacceptable, ``or otherwise.'' What we are attempting to address, if we \nstrike ``or otherwise,'' the only way that there would be any kind of \ntriggering of this measure would be on the action of a complaint by the \nindividuals affected. Quite frankly, that is not going to happen \nbecause the minute that happens, this person is on his way--he or she--\nis on his way out of the country.\n  What we are trying to do is to permit at least a degree of \nflexibility as we have in the ``temporary'' where there is reason to \nbelieve. I would be glad if it is ``or otherwise.'' I was looking if it \nis based on receipt of information where there is reasonable cause to \nbelieve.\n  This is what I am concerned about. If we just strike ``otherwise,'' \nwe would be limiting it just to the complaint, who would be the workers \nthemselves, and there would be such pressure on that worker, \neffectively that individual would not bring forth the complaint because \nthe person would be thereby probably subject to the loss of their \nprivilege in this country.\n  It is generally the understanding that there are no protections for \nthat individual, and therefore it would be unrealistic to think that \nwould be the case.\n  I would be glad to try to address what the Senator mentions as being \nsort of a fishing expedition, to try to find words that might define it \nin a way that would not only be relevant to the particular complainant \nbut also on the basis of well-founded information. It is best in this \nsort of circumstance, perhaps, on this measure to suggest a short--\nwell, I will not suggest a quorum but perhaps we might set this one \naside and see if we cannot come up with some words.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I think that is an excellent suggestion. \nThen we could go to the amendments of Senator Simon, because I think we \ncan resolve this. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act it says, \n``Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization, \nincluding the bargaining representatives.'' I have no problem with \nthat. Maybe we can do that. Then, if Senator Simon would proceed with \nhis two amendments, we will have those available for voting later.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Senator from Wyoming--\nand I am sorry; I was off the floor for a short time--are we moving \ntoward any kind of time agreement to stack the votes tomorrow morning \nor something like that?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I would share with my friend, Mr. President, that \napparently we are going to go forward. There is a window--we should \nhave tried to express that--a window between now and 8 o'clock, but \nafter 8 o'clock the leader would prefer to proceed with rollcall votes \non whatever amendments are pending, and the more we can have pending \nthe more we will get on with our work. I hope people will come here to \ndo the work.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3809\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I should like to call up 3809. It has \nalready been offered but it was set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. SIMON. What this does is to change the basis for deportation from \nthe Senate language to the House language. The Senate language, \nfrankly, is so wide open in terms of deporting people. For example, \nsomeone who is a legal immigrant, who receives higher education \nassistance, or, Mr. President, someone in the State of Minnesota who \nwould not be aware of it and got job training assistance under this \namendment, unless it is changed, that person could be deported for \ngetting job training assistance--someone who is here legally, going to \nbecome a citizen. I just do not think that makes sense. If they have a \nchild who gets Head Start, that can be a basis.\n  So what we ought to do is do as the House did. Frankly, that is still \npretty sweeping. AFDC, SSI--and the SSI program is the one that is \nabused. I think all of us who have been working in this area know this \nis the area of great abuse. Overall, those who come into our country \nwho are not yet citizens use our welfare programs less than native-born \nAmericans percentagewise. But limited to AFDC, SSI, food stamps, \nMedicaid, housing, and State cash assistance. This is the language on \nthe House side.\n  I think it makes just an awful lot more sense. If someone, for \nexample, gets low-income energy assistance in the State of Minnesota, \nthat would be a basis for deportation the way the bill reads right now. \nI do not think you want that. I do not think most Members of the Senate \nwant that.\n  So that is what my amendment does. I think it makes the legislation a \nlittle more sensible, and I hope that my colleague, who is, I see, \nscribbling very vigorously over there, is scribbling the word ``OK'' \nand that he would consider accepting this amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I was not scribbling the word ``OK'' on \nthis document, this tattered amendment here.\n  I oppose the amendment. I feel this amendment will create a very \nlarge loophole in our Nation's traditional policy that newcomers must \nbe self-supporting. Under the bill, of course, an immigrant is \ndeportable as a public charge if he or she uses more than 12 months of \npublic assistance within 5 years after entry.\n  All of the means-tested programs, means-tested welfare programs--SSI, \npublic housing, Pell grants--count toward this 12-month total for \ndeportation. An exception is provided only for those programs that are \nalso available to illegal aliens --emergency medical services, disaster \nrelief, school lunch, WIC, and immunization.\n\n  Under the House bill, only certain programs make the immigrant \nsubject to public charge deportation, and those programs are SSI, AFDC, \nMedicaid, food stamps, State cash assistance, and public housing.\n  The Senator's amendment would limit the public charge programs to the \nsame welfare programs as the House bill but all others would not be \nincluded--and that would be Pell grants, Head Start, legal services, \nnoncash--in determining whether an alien should become a public charge.\n  I remain quite unconvinced why any newcomer should be able to freely \naccess the majority of Federal noncash welfare programs within the \nfirst 5 years after entry, given that all aliens must promise not to \nbecome a public charge at any time after entry. It seems most \ninappropriate to exclude most noncash welfare from counting against the \nnewcomer.\n  I oppose it. Our Nation's laws since the earliest days have required \nnew immigrants to support themselves. The first time was in 1645. \nMassachusetts refused to admit prospective immigrants who had no means \nof support other than public assistance. That was in 1645 in the State \nof our Democratic leader of this legislation.\n  In 1882, we prohibited the admission of any person unable to take \ncare of himself or herself. We know those things. I keep repeating \nthem. Likely to become a public charge, section 212 of the immigration \nlaw always saying that those who become dependent on public assistance \nmay be deported. So not only would the immigrant not only promise to be \nself-sufficient before receipt of an immigrant visa, but he or she \nshould remain self-sufficient for any appropriate period after arrival. \nWe set that period.\n  Where all this came about is in a 1948 decision by an administrative \njudge within the Justice Department. Various administrative judges made \nit virtually impossible to deport newcomers who became a public charge. \nUnder the current interpretation of the law, the Government has to \nshow, one, the alien received the benefits; two, the agency requested \nreimbursement from the alien; and, three, the alien failed or refused \nto repay the agency.\n  The decision has rendered this section of the law virtually \nunenforced and unenforceable, and, as Senator Domenici said, we have \ndeported 13 people\n\n[[Page S4409]]\n\nin the past, I think, year as being a public charge. This is despite \nthe fact that research shows more than 20 percent of immigrant \nhouseholds are on welfare--households, not individuals. So the \ncommittee bill restored the public charge deportation. The bill already \nincludes provisions to respond to concerns of some on the other side of \nthe aisle. We have not destroyed the safety net. A generous safety net \nis provided for immigrants who must use more than 12 months of public \nassistance within the first 5 years of entry before becoming deportable \nas a public charge.\n  This new provision for public charge deportation is entirely \nprospective. It is not applicable to anyone who has already emigrated \nto the United States. Only those who come in the future will be \naffected.\n  And the Simon amendment permits future immigrants to receive any \namount of assistance from Federal, State and local governments, as long \nas the newcomer avoids six major welfare programs. Newcomers would be \nable to access almost all noncash welfare programs for the entire time \nthey are in the United States, without ever being deportable as a \npublic charge. That is contrary to the stated national policy that no \none may immigrate if he or she is likely to use any needs-based public \nassistance.\n  I know my friend from Illinois so well, after 25 years, nearly, of \nfriendship. And know in each occasion that he speaks it is in the \nfinest of intent and compassion and caring. This is one of those. But a \ndeal is a deal. If you come here as a sponsored immigrant and somebody \nsays we are not going to let this person become a public charge, that \nis it. You make a person do what I know the Senator from Illinois would \nlike to do: If you have the bucks, you keep your promise. And the \npromise is they not become a public charge. And, if the sponsor cannot \nmeet the debts and goes broke, cannot cut it anymore, then we pick up \nthe slack as taxpayers. But why on Earth would we take up the slack on \nany kind of issue when they said: This person, I promise by affidavit \nof support, will not become a public charge? I would resist the \namendment.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the Senator from Wyoming is correct. It was \nnot ``OK,'' he was scribbling there.\n  We do not do anything about the deeming requirements here. What we \nare simply saying--and I would add the administration supports this \namendment--what we are simply saying is that there are going to be \nprograms that people may be taking advantage of, that are available, \nwith no knowledge it could be a basis of deportation. Let me give an \nexample. In rural Illinois--my guess is in rural Minnesota, rural \nMassachusetts and Wyoming too--there are transportation programs \navailable for the elderly and the disabled. Under this amendment, if \nsomeone takes advantage of those programs for 1 year, that is a basis \nfor deportation. That is crazy. You know, if you have a child in Head \nStart you can be deported. Maybe a spouse abuses someone and they go to \nlegal aid. If they get legal aid they can be kicked out of the country, \nfor getting legal aid.\n  I just think we have to be reasonable. I think the House language \ntakes care of the big program. I know my friend from Wyoming agrees on \nthis, the big program of abuse overwhelmingly is SSI. In addition to \nSSI, it has AFDC, food stamps, Medicaid, housing, and State cash \nassistance.\n  I think this amendment makes sense. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I inquire of the Senator, ask a question?\n  Mr. SIMON. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we had some debate and discussion about \neducation earlier in our amendments. Is the Senator saying if you have \na legal immigrant and that legal immigrant is going to take advantage \nof a Pell or a Stafford loan, and that person goes to the sponsor and \nthey find out that they are still eligible for that loan, so they are \nplaying by the rules--they waited their turn, 76 percent of those are \nmembers of American families, so they have been deemed and they go in--\nand then they take that Stafford loan, for example, for a year, that \nthat subjects that person to deportation?\n  Mr. SIMON. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. \nThese people are preparing themselves to be productive citizens and all \nof a sudden, because they are preparing themselves, they can be \ndeported. If they are under a JTPA program they can be deported.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is even after we have had a good deal of \ndiscussion, I think for the benefit of most Members here--they felt: \nOK, they should be deemed, in terms of the sponsors. And even if they \nplay this by the rules, they waited their turn to get in here, they are \nrejoining their families, they get accepted into the universities and \ncollege in the Senator's State, they run through the process of \nchecking their sponsors to deem their income to theirs and they are \nstill qualified for a Stafford loan, they take that loan to improve \nthemselves and they take that for 1 year, then it is your understanding \nthat under the Simpson proposal that that individual is subject to \ndeportation?\n  Mr. SIMON. That is correct. And it just makes no sense whatsoever. \nThe sponsors may very well have had a medically devastating problem \nthat just wiped them out. So the person who is here legally is eligible \nfor these programs and we ought to be assisting them.\n  Here, let me just remind everyone again, legal immigrants take \nadvantage of these programs, with the exception of SSI, less, as a \npercentage of the people, than native-born Americans. So I would hope \nwe would use some common sense here and accept this amendment.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I feel like somehow I have spoken on \nthis, I think, probably 10 times today, and I am using up my precious \ntime. Let us, if we can all understand this--maybe I do not understand, \nwhich would not be the first time, but I think I do.\n  We are not talking about the poor and the wretched and the ragged \nhere, and people being taken advantage of. We are talking about people \nwho are here under the auspices of a sponsor, a sponsor who signed up \nand said: I promise that this person will not become a public charge. \nThat is who we are talking about.\n  If a person is as ragged as I have heard in the last 15 minutes, \ncannot do this, cannot do that, stumbling around--those people are \ntaken care of under the present law. We are talking about a person who \nis here under the good faith and auspices of a sponsoring person. We \nare not talking about anything that is not means tested. Anything that \nis not means tested somebody is going to get. We are talking about, \nwhen you line up for whatever it is--Stafford or Pell, whatever it is, \nthat is means tested and you line up and say, ``Here I am. I need this \nprogram.'' And they are going to ask you, ``You are an immigrant and \nyou have a sponsor. What assets does your sponsor have?'' And then they \nare going to say, ``Those assets are deemed to be your assets for the \npurpose of receiving this means-tested grant.'' And all we are saying \nis the sponsor is going to be responsible before the taxpayer is \nresponsible. There is no mystery to this. This is not some strange \nthing where we are pulling the rug out from under people.\n  They say why do we do this with legal and not illegal? Illegal \nimmigrants receive the benefits that I have discussed: WIC, emergency \nmedical assistance, immunization. And why? Because they are here and we \nwant to take care of them so they do not become sick and so on. We know \nthat.\n  Then the argument is why do legal persons not get the same benefits \nthat the illegal get? The reason is simple beyond belief. It is because \na sponsor, who had enough assets and resources to take care of them, \npromised to do so. And should. And there is no reason on God's Earth, \nwhy the taxpayer should have to pick it up, unless the sponsor cannot \ncut the mustard anymore, has died, is bankrupt. And we have in the \nbill: Under those conditions the taxpayers will pick up the slack.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could I ask the Senator from Wyoming: You \ncan be eligible for Stafford loans up to $60,000 if you have three kids \nin school.\n  Now, you mean to tell me that if that person, say that individual who \nis the\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\nlegal immigrant, has $10,000 or $15,000 and the sponsor has $30,000, \nyou are still eligible under the Stafford loan program for a Stafford \nloan and to repay it.\n  The way I read this, it talks about ``for purposes of subparagraph, \nthe term `public charge' includes any alien who receives benefits under \nany program described in paragraph D for an aggregate period of more \nthan 12 months.''\n  Then it describes the program. In line 18 it says, ``* * * any other \nprogram of assistance funded in whole or in part by the Federal \nGovernment.''\n  Stafford loans are. That individual may have a higher rate of \nrepayment, be able to get a smaller loan but still would get some kind \nof public help and assistance, because education loans are not \nconsidered to be welfare. The idea is individuals will pay that back. \nSo they can conform with the provisions of the assets of both of them \nand still, as the Senator points out, receive that and under this be \nsubject to the deportation, the way I read it. I think the Senator from \nIllinois has a balanced program here, and I hope that it will be \naccepted.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I do not want to postpone this much longer. \nLet us just say Christopher Reeve was a sponsor, and he went through \nthis devastating accident. Let us say the people he sponsored live in \nOklahoma in a rural community and they take advantage of transportation \nfor the elderly and the disabled. Under this proposal, without my \namendment, they can be deported.\n  I do not think that is what the American people want. I do not think \nthat is what the U.S. Senate wants. I really do not believe even my \ngood friend, Alan Simpson, wants that, upon greater reflection. I hope \nwe will conform the language to the way it is in the House and say on \nthe six programs--AFDC, SSI, food stamps, Medicaid, housing, and State \ncash assistance--if they take advantage of these programs for a year, \nthen they can be deported. That is even harsher, frankly, than I would \nlike, because I think there will be some circumstances that are \nunusual.\n  To just say sweepingly for any kind of Federal program you can be \ndeported, like the Stafford Loan Program, I think is a real mistake. I \nhope the Senate will accept my amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I am going to leave it at that. I am \nusing precious time, but I will just say that all these things do not \ntake place, all these horrible things, little old ladies, veterans, \npeople. Nothing here takes place if there is a sponsor who stepped up \nto the plate and said, ``I'm going to take care of this person, I vow \nthat, I promise that.''\n\n  So anything means tested we are simply saying the assets of the \nsponsor become the assets of the immigrant. If you wish to allow \nnewcomers to come here spending more than 20 percent of their time on \npublic assistance during the first 5 years after entry, that seems \nquite strange to me when people are hurting in the United States. That \nis where we are.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, can we just review where we are? We have \nall received a lot of questions about the order. It was my \nunderstanding that we had the labor enforcement amendment and the \nintentional discrimination amendment. I think we are very close to \nworking out language of the labor enforcement provisions. I hope that \nwe will be able to do that.\n  We have the intentional discrimination amendment, which I hope we can \nin a very brief exchange dispose of, in terms of the time factor. So we \nmight be able to do that.\n  The Simon amendment on public charge, do we feel we are finished with \nthat debate? That is another item. I do not know what the other Simon \namendment is, whether that is going to be brought up. Or is that in \nline?\n  Mr. SIMON. Whatever. We can bring it up tonight. It should be debated \nvery briefly.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, if we could perhaps deal with the intent \nstandard language, which we had discussed earlier, I maybe have another \n5 minutes or so on that. And then Senator Feinstein.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then we can do Senator Feinstein's amendment and see if \nit is possible--I do not know what the length of it is--maybe it is \npossible to add that on as well. Maybe it will not be.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Very short.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That will be what we will try, so Members will have an \nidea of what we are going to do, if that is agreeable. I will just talk \nvery briefly.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, can we say then, at least for the \npurposes of those of us here debating, that we close, informally close, \nthe debate with regard to the Simon amendment, and maybe in a few \nminutes close debate with regard to the intent standard and maybe \nperhaps be in a position to have four or five votes which should \nsatisfy all concerned?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That would be fine.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Would that not be a joy?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would that not be, and then we look forward to tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I will just take a brief time with regard to the \namendment on discrimination and, hopefully, we will be able to get it \nworked out.\n  Let me just ask then, before we do that, on the labor provisions, on \nline 6, if we strike ``or otherwise'' and put in there ``based on \nreceipt of credible material information,'' does that respond to the \nprincipal concerns? I thought that might have been worked out with your \nstaff.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I am not aware of that, Mr. President, but I will \ncertainly inquire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3816\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me then, Mr. President, just address the issues that \nI addressed earlier in the course of the debate, and I will do it \nbriefly.\n  The dilemma is how are we going to assure adequate protection to \nemployers who employ either foreign sounding, foreign looking \nindividuals and ensure that they are not going to be subject to the \neconomic sanctions and, on the other hand, how are we going to try and \nestablish a procedure which will not lend whatever procedure is \nestablished to be utilized in ways that will open up discrimination \nagainst those individuals which, of course, in so many instances would \nbe Americans.\n  I reviewed very quickly some of the more egregious situations where \nthose citizens who came from Puerto Rico were asked to put out a green \ncard. Since they are American citizens, they do not have green cards \nand were subject to forms of discrimination.\n  In any event, there may be differences as to the extent of \ndiscrimination that exists out there. There are many who believe it is \na serious problem. There are others who do not believe so. But I do \nthink we have an opportunity to address both the elements of \ndiscrimination which exist in varying degrees out there and also to \nprovide a mechanism by which the employer is adequately protected and \nestablishes a good-faith defense by accepting any one of the six cards \nthat have been identified in this legislation that are credible.\n  That is effectively what we are attempting to do, Mr. President, to \nsay that if employers have suspicions about an applicant, they already \nhave a host of remedies. If the documents look phony, the employer can \nrefuse to accept them and can refuse to hire the person.\n  If the employee has authorization documents that expire, the employer \ncan ask for reverification of eligibility when the documents expire. \nIndeed, my amendment contains a provision that requires the employers \nto reverify eligibility.\n  If the documents look genuine, but the employer still has concerns, \nthe employer can share these concerns with the applicant. For example, \nthe employer can let the applicant know that it intends to verify the \napplicant's eligibility and will fire the person if it turns out the \nperson is illegal. However, the employer cannot demand that the \napplicant produce additional or specific documents once the applicant \nhas produced an authentic-looking document.\n  That is the fundamental issue. Otherwise, if we were to allow the \nemployer to demand anything he wanted, it would end up with situations \nas I mentioned where employers demand green cards from Puerto Ricans. \nUnder our current law these Puerto Rican victims have a remedy. Under \nsection 117 they are out of luck. If we let employers determine what \ndocuments they will accept, which is effectively what section\n\n[[Page S4411]]\n\n117 does, everyone knows what will happen. Employers will develop \nsuspicions about all foreign-looking and foreign-sounding people, and \nthe discrimination that is already documented will worsen.\n  Keep in mind who these victims are. They are often hard-working \nAmerican citizens. They are legal immigrants who are trying to become \nself-sufficient but are being left out because they look foreign or \nspeak with an accent.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this proposal is a modest program. I \nthink it meets the central challenges of assuring that the idea that \njobs will be preserved for Americans or legal immigrants is real. It \nwill reduce, I think in a very important way, the possibilities and \nreality of discrimination in the workplace.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the Senate will adopt the amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, may I interject here with a unanimous-\nconsent request that we lock in the two amendments? I think this may \nhave been circulated. I will wait so that we might do that.\n  Mr. President, let me go forward briefly and conclude my remarks \nabout the amendment. I spoke on that this morning. I want to readopt \nthe language that I spoke this morning and would be appropriate here, \nand conclude with this.\n  Let me stress for my colleagues that this section of the bill does \nnot permit employers to refuse documents because of an unreasonable \nconcern about their validity. Administrative law judges have already \nfound such a practice constitutes intentional discrimination. The bill \nis not intended to overrule any of those cases of intentional \ndiscrimination.\n\n  Employers should be able to ask an employee for additional documents \nonly when they have reason to suspect that the new employee is an \nillegal alien. We are not interested in burdening employers. In fact, \nthis bill is an extraordinary assistance to employers. No longer 29 \ndocuments to look at, but 6.\n  Employers around the country have been supportive of this measure. \nBut I must also state that some of the numerous examples which are \ngiven in support of the amendment simply do not apply, especially the \none about the Puerto Rican woman. Let us go to that.\n  One example cited by opponents of the provision in the committee bill \nis that a New York watch wholesaler refused to hire a Puerto Rican \nwoman because she did not have a green card. The administrative law \njudge ruled that that action constituted a knowing and intentional \ndiscrimination. Think of that. Simply because the person refused to \nhire a Puerto Rican woman because she did not have a green card, that \nwas knowing and intentional discrimination.\n  Most importantly, the employer in that case was punished under \nsection 274B(a)(1) of the Immigration Nationality Act, a provision \nwhich is unchanged by my bill, not changed, not section 274B(a)(6), \nwhich the committee bill amends. In fact, this case was decided before \nthe Congress enacted the section 274B(a)(6) in late 1990 and decided \nthat merely asking for different documents constituted discrimination--\nmerely asking.\n  This section of the committee bill provides protection only for \nemployers who do not intend to discriminate. That is what the Senator \nis trying to reach. An employer who has constructive knowledge that an \nalien is unauthorized to work is permitted to ask for other documents. \nThat is all we are saying. The employer knows something is wrong with \nthose documents. He knows that, or he or she knows that, an alien is \nunauthorized to work, and they are permitted under this legislation to \nask for other documents.\n  There is one other incorrect argument on behalf of this amendment. \nAccording to the propaganda sheet I have from certain in the Clinton \nadministration, the lawyers of the Clinton administration, the bill \nwould permit a Texas nursing home to fire an African American because \nhe could not produce his birth certificate. That is wrong. That is \nfalse. The decision in that case held that when employers refused to \naccept certain documents because of an unreasonable concern about their \nvalidity, as opposed to a specific, justified concern, that action \nconstitutes intentional discrimination.\n\n  We are talking about the employer. The signals are up. The employer \nknows something is not right. We are saying, he asks for another \ndocument. That is not discrimination. If they are in there to \ndiscriminate, the signals are not up. They are doing their hideous \nracism. That is not what we are talking about.\n  I believe we have to provide some protection from heavy penalties for \nemployers who are attempting in good faith to follow the law. This \namendment provides no relief, and in fact is no more than a detailed \ndescription of current law, the current law which squeezes the American \nbusinessman between the rock of employer sanctions and the hard place \nof intentional discrimination for even deigning to question an \nemployee's documents.\n  So I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. The employers should \nbe able to ask employees, when they have knowledge that a new hire is \nnot legally authorized to work, for additional documentation and \ninquire of that without the huge fines which the administration insists \non levying against employers who have never ever before--ever before--\nintentionally discriminated at all.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take just a very few moments.\n  Mr. President, I will include in the Record the Leadership Conference \non Civil Rights, their support for our amendment. Let me just mention a \nparagraph in here.\n\n       Some employer groups, including the National Federation of \n     Independent Businesses and the nation's agricultural \n     employers, argue that [my amendment] the Kennedy amendment \n     would put employers ``between a rock and a hard place'' when \n     it comes to verifying documents that the employer ``knows \n     constructively'' are not valid. The Kennedy amendment \n     addresses this concern by allowing employers to check the \n     validity of such documents when they have a question about \n     them. An intent standard goes much too far in response to the \n     concerns of some employers. In fact, it immunizes employers \n     against all but the most egregious discrimination claims. \n     There is no need to gut the civil rights protections under \n     IRCA in order to address a concern which can be resolved \n     through more reasonable means.\n       The Leadership Conference strongly urges you to support the \n     Kennedy amendment to strike the intent standard. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that letter dated April \n29, 1996, from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             Leadership Conference\n\n\n                                              on Civil Rights,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Leadership Conference on \n     Civil Rights, we are writing to urge you to support an \n     amendment to the immigration bill, S. 1664 that would \n     preserve the civil rights protections of the nation's \n     immigration laws.\n       Congress added civil rights protections to the Immigration \n     Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) because of concerns \n     that requiring employers to verify the employment eligibility \n     of their workers would lead to discrimination against persons \n     who were perceived as ``foreigners.'' Indeed, the law did \n     result in widespread discrimination, as documented by a U.S. \n     General Accounting Office (GAO) study in 1990 along with more \n     than a dozen separate studies conducted nationwide. S. 1664 \n     adds an ``intent standard'' to these civil rights provisions, \n     which would make it impossible for most Americans suffering \n     discrimination under the law to pursue a discrimination \n     claim. Senator Kennedy will be offering an amendment to \n     strike this intent standard and replace it with language \n     addressing the legitimate concerns raised by employers. The \n     Leadership Conference on Civil Rights strongly urges you to \n     support this amendment and preserve the nation's tradition of \n     equal justice under the law.\n       The GAO report and other studies indicate that most of the \n     widespread discrimination resulting from IRCA stems from \n     employer confusion. For example, some employers insist on \n     seeing green cards from any person who appears ``foreign'', \n     despite the fact that many such individuals are native-born \n     U.S. citizens. When such an employer insists on seeing a \n     green card, these Americans lose jobs. This was the case when \n     Rosita Martinez, a Puerto Rican American, took her employer \n     to court after he insisted that the law obliged him to see \n     her green card before hiring her. Had the intent standard \n     been the law at the time, Ms. Martinez would have lost that \n     job without any remedy under the law.\n       Some employer groups, including the National Federation of \n     Independent Business and the nation's agricultural employers, \n     argue that the Kennedy amendment would put employers \n     ``between a rock and a hard place'' when it comes to \n     verifying documents that the employer ``knows \n     constructively''\n\n[[Page S4412]]\n\n     are not valid. The Kennedy amendment addresses this concern \n     by allowing employers to check the validity of such documents \n     when they have a question about them. An intent standard goes \n     much too far in response to the concerns of some employers. \n     In fact, it immunizes employers against all but the most \n     egregious discrimination claims. There is no need to gut the \n     civil rights protections under IRCA in order to address a \n     concern which can be resolved through more reasonable means.\n       The Leadership Conference strongly urges you to support the \n     Kennedy amendment to strike the intent standard and replace \n     it with language which addresses employers' concerns without \n     wiping out civil rights protections for Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard Womack,\n       Acting Executive Director.\n     Dorothy I. Height,\n       Chairperson.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just wind this up with the story \nof Representative Gutierrez. This was on April 18.\n\n       A Capitol Police security aide refused to accept the \n     congressional identification of Representative Luis V. \n     Gutierrez as he tried to enter the Capitol and told him and \n     his daughter to ``go back to the country you came from,'' the \n     representative said yesterday.\n       Gutierrez . . . said that he was walking into the main \n     visitor's entrance to the Capitol on March 29 with his 16-\n     year-old daughter and 17-year-old niece when he was \n     approached by the security aide.\n       The aide [I will leave that out; it is printed in the \n     story] has been suspended with pay pending an internal \n     investigation, said Sgt. Dan Nichols, Capitol Police \n     spokesman.\n       The Congressman said that he and the girls were carrying \n     Puerto Rican flags during a Puerto Rican appreciation day \n     ceremony and were putting them through an X-ray scanner when \n     Hollingsworth began ``screaming'' at him for allowing the \n     flags to slightly unfurl, he said.\n       ``She said she didn't want to see the flags, and I told her \n     I would take care of them,'' Gutierrez said. ``Then she said, \n     `Who do you think you are?' When I told her I was Congressman \n     Gutierrez, she said, `I don't think so.' ''\n       Gutierrez said that when he presented his congressional \n     identification card, Hollingsworth ``said that my \n     identification must have been a fake. Then she said, `Why \n     don't you all go back to the country where you came from.' \n     She was rabidly angry.''\n       Gutierrez said the confrontation went on for about a minute \n     until a Capitol Police sergeant noticed what was happening \n     and, recognizing the Congressman, and ushered Hollingsworth \n     away.\n       ``From the very first time she was talking to me, she was \n     yelling,'' Gutierrez said. ``She thought we were foreigners \n     from another country, and she was very resentful of that. \n     Twice she told us to go back to our country.''\n\n  That has happened to a Congressman of the United States in the last \nfew weeks here in the Nation's Capitol. What kind of chance is a worker \ngoing to have, out in the boondocks, American worker, trying to get \nthrough, when you run against that kind of an attitude?\n  Mr. President, this is a real problem. It is happening here in the \nNation's Capitol, and it is happening around the country.\n  The provisions which are included in the current law need to be \nchanged. We have outlined a fair, reasonable way of protecting the \napplicant, the worker, and also the employer. It is a better way to go \nthan the current law. I hope the amendment is accepted.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, let me lock in this unanimous-consent \nrequest so our colleagues will know better about the disposition of \ntheir evening activities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on or in relation to \namendment No. 3816 offered by Senator Kennedy at the hour of 8 p.m. \nthis evening and immediately following that vote, the Senate proceed to \na vote on or in relation to the following amendments in the following \norder, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to each vote \nafter the first vote: amendment No. 3809, amendment No. 3829--it may be \nresolved, but I would like to lock those in.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Finally, Mr. President, that is a powerful, poignant \nstory of discrimination and a disgusting activity, but that is not what \nwe are talking about. We are talking about an employer who has in front \nof him someone that he has an idea, and he has seen the documents, he \nknows something is wrong. He has been doing this for years, ever since \n1986, and the signal goes up, and he says, ``I want to ask you for \nanother document,'' and suddenly he has violated the law and is subject \nto tremendous fines. That is not right.\n  That is the purpose of the bill. It is not about such an egregious \nand foul procedure as we have just heard described.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to pay my respects to the Senator \nfrom California today. She was here early like other of our colleagues, \nat her post early today on the Judiciary Committee, and came over here \njust at the lunch hour and has been inquiring, I think every half hour, \nabout when she can be recognized. We wanted to try to move the business \nforward. I want to commend her for her perseverance and look forward to \nher amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3777 to Amendment No. 3743\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for the construction of physical barriers, \ndeployment of technology, and improvements to roads in the border area \n                          near San Diego, CA)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself \n     and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 3777.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 10, strike line 18 and all that follows \n     through line 13 on page 11 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 108. CONSTRUCTION OF PHYSICAL BARRIERS, DEPLOYMENT OF \n                   TECHNOLOGY, AND IMPROVEMENTS TO ROADS IN THE \n                   BORDER AREA NEAR SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated funds not to exceed \n     $12,000,000 for the construction, expansion, improvement, or \n     deployment of physical barriers (including multiple fencing \n     and bollard style concrete columns as appropriate), all-\n     weather roads, low light television systems, lighting, \n     sensors, and other technologies along the international land \n     border between the United States and Mexico south of San \n     Diego, California for the purpose of detecting and deterring \n     unlawful entry across the border. Amounts appropriated under \n     this section are authorized to remain available until \n     expended.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment concerns the proposal \nto build a triple-fence barrier on the Southwest border. Specifically, \nthe amendment I am offering would strike section 108 and replace it \nwith a provision allowing $12 million for the construction and \nexpansion of physical barriers along the border with Mexico, which, in \naddition to fencing, includes all-weather roads, low-light television \nsystems, lighting sensors, and other technology.\n  I think we all know that the border represents the front line of \ndeterrence for illegal entry into the country and that the current \nsituation is inadequate. There is a 14-mile stretch of border that \nseparates San Diego and Mexico, and it is patched with some single \nfencing that is in constant need of repair, has areas with no barriers \nat all, and roads that wash out and become impassable at the first sign \nof rain.\n  The House-passed bill mandates the construction of three parallel \nfences along the existing 14 miles of reinforced steel fence on the \nUnited States-Mexico border in San Diego County. I voted for the \ntriple-fence amendment in the Judiciary Committee because I believed we \nneeded to remedy that situation. After the vote, though, I had a chance \nto meet with representatives from the Border Patrol and the INS.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe National Border Patrol signed by its president, stating:\n\n       A three-tier fence would also create a crime zone within \n     the boundaries of the United States where illegal immigrants \n     would be easy prey for robbers, rapists, and\n\n[[Page S4413]]\n\n     other criminals. The accomplices of these criminals could \n     easily prevent law enforcement officers from responding to \n     these crimes by blocking access roads with nails, broken \n     glass, other debris, [et cetera]. . . .\n       The Border Patrol Council strongly recommends this bill be \n     amended by replacing the requirement with a safer and more \n     effective alternative.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Border Patrol Council, American Federation of \n           Government Employees,\n                                        Campo, CA, April 15, 1996.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The National Border Patrol Council, \n     representing nearly 5,000 Border Patrol employees, is deeply \n     concerned by the provision in S. 1664 (formerly S. 269, the \n     ``Immigration in the National Interest Act of 1995'') that \n     would require the construction of fourteen miles of three-\n     tier fencing in San Diego, California. Such fencing would \n     needlessly endanger the lives of Border Patrol Agents by \n     trapping them between layers of fences and leaving them with \n     no expeditious means of escape from the gunfire, barrages of \n     rocks and other physical assaults that routinely occur along \n     the U.S.-Mexico border.\n       A three-tier fence would also create a crime zone within \n     the boundaries of the United States where illegal immigrants \n     would be easy prey for robbers, rapists, and other criminals. \n     The accomplices of these criminals could easily prevent law \n     enforcement officers from responding to these crimes by \n     blocking access roads with nails, broken glass, other debris, \n     barrages of rocks and/or gunfire.\n       Rather than facilitating the accomplishment of the Border \n     Patrol's mission, a three-tier fence would decrease the \n     effectiveness of its operations, and would make an already \n     dangerous job even more so.\n       The National Border Patrol Council strongly recommends that \n     S. 1664 be amended by replacing the requirement to construct \n     a three-tier fence with a safer and more effective \n     alternative. Those who deal with the problem of illegal \n     immigration on a daily basis should be allowed to decide \n     which technologies, including physical barriers, all-weather \n     roads, low-light television systems, lighting, sensors, and \n     other means, are more appropriate and effective for a given \n     area.\n       Your support of this amendment would be greatly \n     appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      T.J. Bonner,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter dated April 16 from the Department of \nJustice, Office of Legislative Affairs, to the majority leader on this \nsubject.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 1996.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: I write to express the Administration's \n     strong opposition to the proposed requirement for triple-tier \n     fencing contained in S. 269, the ``Immigration in the \n     National Interest Act of 1995.'' This provision requires the \n     construction of second and third fences, in addition to the \n     existing 10-foot steel fence, along the 14 miles of U.S.-\n     Mexico border in the San Diego Border Patrol Sector. The bill \n     also requires roads to be built between the fences. Instead, \n     we support an amendment, to be offered by Senators Feinstein \n     and Boxer, to replace the requirement for triple fencing \n     along portions of the Southwest border with an authorization \n     of funds for the construction and improvement of physical \n     barriers, lighting, sensors, and other technologies to detect \n     and deter unlawful entry.\n       The requirement now in the bill, if enacted, would endanger \n     the physical safety of Border Patrol agents. U.S. Border \n     Patrol agent Joe Dassaro, Public Information Coordinator for \n     Local 1613, U.S. Border Patrol Council, recently stated, \n     ``There is no support from U.S. Border Patrol agents in the \n     field for the three tiered fence. We see it as a dangerous \n     situation. If an agent goes between the three fences and gets \n     into trouble, there is a longer response time for another \n     Border Patrol agent to come to his/her aid . . .'' From a \n     tactical perspective, agents travelling along roads \n     surrounded by fencing present an easy target for alien \n     smugglers and others ready to thwart our enforcement efforts. \n     Our experience has shown that when agents travel in a single, \n     predictable line, they and their vehicles are susceptible to \n     attack with rocks and other objects.\n       Response time to an emergency situation in areas adjacent \n     to fenced in areas will be greatly and unnecessarily \n     increased if this provision is enacted. Agents that patrol \n     between the sections of the fence will not have the ability \n     to quickly and directly get out of the areas at critical \n     times. With triple fencing, smugglers can easily block a \n     Border Patrol vehicle with debris and limit agent mobility to \n     the fixed path bounded by the fence. In addition, the rocky \n     terrain and deep canyons in this region of California make a \n     continuous road impossible to build and use. The challenges \n     presented by this terrain are better met through the other \n     tactics currently deployed in the San Diego Sector.\n       We support physical barriers along the border when and \n     where they are appropriate and have erected 23 miles of \n     fences along the California Border as an important part of \n     our strategic plans. In order to build the fence that is now \n     in place, it was necessary to construct an access road along \n     the border. Rather than specifying barriers, we recommend \n     funding to construct ``all-weather roads'', since the \n     existing roads become impassable after relatively little \n     rainfall. The current situation prohibits the Border Patrol \n     from actually reaching the border and interrupts repair and \n     maintenance on the fence. Rain also precludes the Border \n     Patrol from working close to the border in a high visibility, \n     deterrent posture. Agents must pull back and work from \n     hardpacked or paved streets during these periods. With an \n     all-weather road system, Border Patrol agents would have \n     access to the fence even during the extended rainy season.\n       We fully recognize the usefulness and need for border \n     fencing and have been at the forefront of fencing innovations \n     for many years. Single fencing is a valid deterrent in many \n     areas and we will continue to use this tool at various \n     locations to meet the needs of the San Diego Sector Border \n     Patrol. In some carefully selected areas, multiple fencing \n     may be appropriate. Other deterrence technologies, such as \n     enhanced communications systems, lighting, low light \n     television systems and fixed infrared/daylight cameras also \n     will compliment the existing and planned fencing. In our \n     view, the actual deployment of personnel, physical barriers, \n     technology and operational judgments are decisions best left \n     to the Border Patrol with responsibility for the day-to-day \n     operation at the ground level.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further \n     assistance. The Office of Management and Budget has advised \n     that there is no objection to the submission of this letter \n     from the standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Andrew Fois,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Both these letters, Mr. President, make a strong case \nand, to me, a convincing case that the current $12 million proposal to \nconstruct a triple-fence barrier along the entire 14-mile stretch is \nnot feasible, and would not accomplish the intended goals, and could \npose safety risks for Border Patrol agents.\n  The INS argues that some border areas are not suitable for multiple \nfences and are not sealed off by a single barrier because of the steep \nterrain. They made the case that it would be difficult if not \nimpossible to erect a triple fence in these areas at below a cost of \n$110 million--far above the $12 million in this proposal.\n  This, to me, is overly expensive and a waste of taxpayer money. The \nINS and Border Patrol argue that a triple fence running for 14\\1/2\\ \nmiles would be dangerous and ineffective.\n  Now, what this amendment does is present a sensible, cost-effective \nsubstitute for the triple fence concept. It has the strong support of \nthe INS, the Border Patrol, and the National Border Patrol Council. \nEssentially, what the amendment would do is authorize $12 million for \nconstruction of a vitally needed all-weather road system along the \nborder. It would allow for the low-light television system, more ground \nsensors and infrared night-vision equipment. It would also provide some \nflexibility with respect to the border fence itself.\n  I am told that of the 14 mile area, the INS has located eight \nlocations which it has said could be suitable for three-tier barriers \nthat range in length from half a mile to 3 miles in length. That totals \nabout 9\\1/2\\ miles. Once again, their top priority would be \nconstruction of an all-weather road system in this area.\n  What this amendment does, bottom line, is say, ``INS, use your best \njudgment.'' There is $12 million authorized. Have flexibility. Be able \nto create your all-weather roads, the necessary infrastructure, and use \nthe triple fencing where it is safe and makes sense to do so.\n  I think that is the appropriate way, really, to handle this \nsituation.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n[[Page S4414]]\n\n                Amendment No. 3776 to Amendment No. 3743\n\n     (Purpose: To strike the provision relating to the language of \n                          deportation notice)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself \n     and Mr. Simon, proposes an amendment numbered 3776 to \n     amendment No. 3743.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 99, strike line 10 and all that follows \n     through line 13.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment essentially corrects \nwhat I believe is a mistake in the bill. Present law allows for the use \nof both English and Spanish in deportation orders. The bill, as it came \nout of committee, struck that section. Therefore, only English could be \nused in deportation orders.\n  Frankly, it does not make sense to give somebody a deportation order \nthat they cannot read. And the dominant majority of illegal immigrants \nin the State of California speak Spanish only. Therefore, it would make \nsense that a deportation order be in Spanish and in English.\n  My amendment would simply strike the English-only requirement. I am \njoined by Senator Simon in this amendment that would restore the \nlanguage to its prior situation.\n  If I might, I neglected to mention something, and I would like to \nremedy that, Mr. President. Senator Boxer is a cosponsor on the \nalternative language on the triple fence.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the second amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have asked for a vote on amendment No. \n3865, the one that has been debated at length in this body on other \noccasions--in fact, yesterday, during a time that I obtained the floor, \nI talked about this amendment at some length. This is making female \ngenital mutilation illegal in the United States and a basis for asylum.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Carol Moseley-Braun be added as \na cosponsor and that the senior Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, \nbe added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, over 100 million women and girls have been \nmutilated by this procedure in the world. Six-thousand each day are \nmutilated--7 days a week, 365 days a year. Most girls, of course, are \ntoo young or do not have the means to flee.\n  Mr. President, 3 years ago, Canada made female genital mutilation a \nbasis for asylum. Since that time, two women have been granted asylum \nfor that reason. So for us to think this is going to open the \nfloodgates for people seeking asylum on that basis, it will not happen. \nRemember, most of the people upon whom this procedure is performed are \nlittle girls.\n  So we do not have to fear a wave of immigrants coming and claiming \nthis as a basis for their coming here. But the United States must take \na stand and speak out against this horrid practice. We must make it \nillegal and recognize it as basis for asylum.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. What is the status?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend this, and I should have said this \nearlier, before I answered the Senator's question. I appreciate the \nwork on this immigration bill. I appreciate the work the Senator has \ndone on helping me with\n\n[[Page S4415]]\n\nother amendments and a managers' amendment. I have worked with the \nSenator on this issue and on a number of different pieces of \nlegislation.\n  I asked for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I have spent not so many years with \npeople telling me how helpful they can be, and that is the most \ngratifying thing that I can hardly speak on it through the years. ``I \nwant to help you, Senator Simpson.'' But this amendment is not helpful. \nThis is a very controversial amendment.\n\n  I share the Senator's views about this brutal procedure. It is a \ncultural matter. You get into serious issues that are unresolvable. If \nwe are to give the yeas and nays, is the Senator indicating he wishes \nthat to be discussed or debated tonight? According to many I have \nspoken to, that will take a great deal of debate.\n  Mr. REID. Any time the Senator wishes. I have no desire as to when \nthe matter is discussed.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I then request of my friend, if he wishes to help the \ncause, not request the yeas and nays, and we will work tomorrow on a \ntime appropriate to deal with that issue.\n  Mr. REID. That is fine. I withdraw the request for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the Senator. Certainly, it will not be \nforeclosed. It is a critical issue. It is also one of those issues that \nopens some extraordinary avenues of approach in the United States.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senator wants to move this bill along. But I did \nstate that Canada made this procedure a basis for asylum 3 years ago, \nand they have had two people granted asylum in 3 years.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. That is a very helpful part of the central debate. My \nfriend knows I can trust him and he can trust me.\n  Let me speak quickly on Senator Feinstein's amendment with regard to \nthe fence. I think that that flexibility may be appropriate. I have \ncarried a good deal of water on this. I do not see others here to speak \non it. That flexibility may well be appropriate. But with regard to the \nrequirement of deportation notices in Spanish and English--and that is \nalso the amendment of the Senator from California--I would oppose that \namendment and let me share just briefly why.\n  To require that all deportation notices be in Spanish as well as \nEnglish, when many deportees do not speak Spanish, but rather one of a \nscore of other languages--Spanish is not the language of all people we \ndeport. We deport people from all over the world. Many Spanish speakers \ndo understand English. Many deportees do not speak Spanish and, as I \nsay, it is a puzzle and it is also wasteful. I also believe it is \nimportant. It creates the impression that Spanish is equal to English \nin this country.\n  Spanish is not equal to English in this country as the common \nlanguage that is the United States of America. We are going to vote on \nthat soon. I did not vote to make English the official language of the \nUnited States when it came up years ago. I will do so now because I \nthink there have been some adjustments, some understandings that will \nbe helpful. But this creates the impression that Spanish is, as I say, \nequal to English in this country. We should not mandate that our \nGovernment conduct its business in any language other than English.\n\n  It is in the INS' interest to guarantee that the subject of a \ndeportation order understands its contents. I agree with that, having \nbeen a lawyer for 18 years. Therefore--please hear this --the INS does, \nand should, provide translations, or translators whenever necessary, \nand not just into Spanish, but into whatever language is most \nappropriate.\n  My colleagues should know section 164(a) does not impair the due \nprocess rights of any alien in a deportation proceeding--none. So, as I \nsay, I am puzzled at that, unless we are going to ignore scores of \nother languages and that is apparently what we would do in this \ninstance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from California still \non the floor. As I understand it, current law is English and Spanish, \nbut there is also the current practice of also printing that in other \nlanguages that are related to the language of the individual that would \nbe subject to the deportation. That is my understanding of what \ncurrently exists.\n  That seems to be the way that it makes most sense. I do not know \nwhether we are trying to make a problem here. I support the Senator. It \nis my understanding they print it in other languages as necessary. I do \nnot know whether we are making a problem here that does not exist. That \nhappens to be sort of the current situation. I intend to support the \nSenator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, just to respond very briefly to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, the present act refers to this: Each order \nto show cause, or other notice in this subsection, shall be printed in \nEnglish and Spanish and shall specify that the alien may be represented \nby an attorney in deportation proceedings, et cetera.\n  All we are putting back in is the reference to English and Spanish. \nThe real fact is that, if on the California border someone is going to \nget a deportation notice, it really should be in Spanish if one expects \nthem to read it and understand it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield. As I understand it, the \neffect of the amendment is to restore current law.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So supporting the Senator's amendment would effectively \nrestore the current law, which has been well explained by the Senator \nfrom California. That permits the English, Spanish, and also the \nlanguage of the individual that is going to be affected. It seems to me \nthat restoration of the current law is desirable.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3829, As Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I had introduced earlier amendment 3829 \nthat is pending and has been temporarily set aside. I would like to--it \nis not the minimum wage--I had actually put that out of my mind for \nnow.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. It will come back.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It will come back.\n  Mr. President, on 3829, the amendment which was to try to strengthen \nthe protections for certain workers, I send to the desk a modification \nto the amendment and ask, I believe since the yeas and nays have been \nordered, unanimous consent that it be in order to amend the amendment \nand to amend it as designated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is their objection to modifying the amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3829), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 8, line 17, before the period insert the following: \n     ``except that not more than 150 of the number of \n     investigators authorized in this subparagraph shall be \n     designated for the purpose of carrying out the \n     responsibilities of the Secretary of Labor to conduct \n     investigations, pursuant to a complaint or based on receipt \n     of credible material information, where there is reasonable \n     cause to believe that an employer has made a \n     misrepresentation of a material fact on a labor certification \n     application under section 212(a)(5) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act or has failed to comply with the terms and \n     conditions of such an application''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it now, with those \nchanges which had been suggested by my friend and colleague, hopefully, \nit will be acceptable to the Senate. When we reach the hour of 8 \no'clock and we begin the consideration, I will ask for a voice vote on \nthis amendment. I will also ask unanimous consent that a colloquy \nbetween the Senator from Wyoming and myself be put in place.\n  I thank the Senator for his assistance in working this through. I \nthink it is a very constructive suggestion, and we welcome his \nrecommendations. Hopefully, it will be accepted in the Senate.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I believe there is one other possible \nobjection on my side of the aisle with regard to that. I will have that \ninformation in a few moments. With regard to the colloquy, it is \nperfectly appropriate for me. It resolves the issue.\n  I say to my friend from California--if I might have the attention of \nmy friend from California, Senator Feinstein, if I could just have a \nmoment with my friend from California, I commend her for her \nextraordinary work in this field. But what we are trying to avoid here \nby what we did in the bill is that the law does not give an option to \nput it in Spanish or English. The present law says that it ``shall be'' \nin English and Spanish. ``Each order to show cause, or other notice \nunder this subsection, shall be in English and Spanish,'' which seems \nabsurd when you are\n\n[[Page S4416]]\n\npresenting it to Chinese or someone else. That is why we dropped it.\n  It was not so we could be sinister. It is absolutely bizarre that \nsomeone from any other country on Earth, non-Spanish-speaking country, \nis presented with this order in English and Spanish which is a waste of \nresources of the INS. Our provision would simply allow the translators \nand interpreters to be there, and they would. They are there. You can \nrequire that in any language of the dozens or hundreds of the world. \nThat is what that was. It was a requirement. There was no option to it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Yes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. My concern is that if this is removed from the bill, \ndeportation notices, particularly in California, will go out in English \nonly, and the great bulk of them go to Spanish. So we are taking out \nthe requirement that it be--just as the Senator said, and as I believe \nI read--in English and Spanish, but we are replacing that with silence. \nMy concern is that the silence will be interpreted and in English \nonly. Therefore, we will have people who will not be able to read their \nnotice.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I respectfully say that the INS has \ntranslators in each of these situations. There is a clear understanding \nbecause a deportation notice is a serious issue, and the current law \nrequires--demands--and says ``shall'' even if the alien does not speak \nSpanish. If the alien does speak Spanish, there is someone there from \nthe INS, and it does not matter what language. That person is then \nprovided with the translation and the translators to be certain that \nthey heard what was said.\n  If you remember the Medvid issue, the Soviet ship jumper, we not only \nhad a person there speaking Russian; we had a person there speaking \nUkraine.\n  That is what we do in this situation. All we are saying is it seems \nrather puzzling to know that, though we are going to have deportees \nfrom the wide world over, we still then have presented something that \nis printed in English and Spanish regardless of who they are.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if a \nrollcall vote on amendment 3829 is required, it occur following the \nseries of votes that have already been ordered to begin at 8 o'clock.\n  That is already part of the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will now occur on----\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that we have 2 more minutes so \nthat the floor manager can list the order of the various amendments for \nthe information of the Members of the Senate.\n  Mr. HELMS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I will agree if the Senator will agree to have 10-minute \nvotes after the first one in the series that the unanimous-consent \nrequest would follow.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, that is more than fine with me. That \nwould be a decision I would leave to the majority, but it is more than \nfine with me.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Let me say, Mr. President, to my friend from North \nCarolina, it is perfectly appropriate with me that every succeeding \nvote will be 10 minutes in duration. But I have a bit of a problem with \nregard to the amendment, the first amendment of Senator Feinstein. One \nof our Members who would like to speak on that issue has been a great \nsupporter of the amendment as it left the Judiciary Committee, and so I \nwould ask that that simply not be part of the vote, and it is not. We \nwere going to possibly accept that, but there will be further debate on \nthat at least from one Member on our side.\n  So we will have four amendments to vote on so that our colleagues \nwill know the lay of the land. The first amendment is a Kennedy \namendment to determine work eligibility of prospective employees. The \nsecond is a Simon amendment to adjust the definition of ``public \ncharge.'' The third is to allocate a number of investigators with \nregard to complaints.\n  Now, that one we may get taken care of with a colloquy.\n  And then the fourth one, and I would ask unanimous consent that a \nvote occur with respect to the Feinstein amendment No. 3776 last in the \nsequence under the same terms as previously entered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would ask the Senator from Wyoming \nto withhold the unanimous-consent request until we act on the \nunanimous-consent request of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Does the Senator from North Carolina object?\n  Mr. HELMS. I will object unless it is made clear in the unanimous-\nconsent request that the first vote be 15 minutes and the succeeding \nthree be 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I would certainly add that.\n  Mr. HELMS. Very well. In that case, I have no objection, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, we move fast. Let me just say that if \nsomeone on the other side of the aisle were late for the first 15-\nminute vote, it might be a problem. It is not to me. But let the record \nshow that there is also 2 minutes equally divided on each of these \namendments, so that our colleagues will be aware of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on \n3816?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, they have been ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3816\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3816. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber who desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 32, nays 67, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 96 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--32\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--67\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Cohen\n       \n  So the amendment (No. 3816) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3809\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On amendment No. 3809, there will now be 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. May we have order, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, so that our colleagues will know the \nprocedure and the schedule, we have three amendments with a 10-minute \ntime agreement. One of those may be resolved within a few minutes. So \nthe maximum will be three, unless the leader has something further. The \nminimum will be two.\n  Mr. President, now we are on the Simon amendment No. 3809 with 1 \nminute on each side. I yield to my friend, Senator Simon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. This is an amendment, my colleagues, that conforms the \nSenate bill to the House bill for the basis\n\n[[Page S4417]]\n\nof deportation. Under the language that is now in the bill, without \nthis amendment, any kind of Federal assistance may be a basis for \ndeportation if you receive it for 1 year.\n  For example, a student who would get a student loan, where the \nsponsor either had to have gone bankrupt or did not have the income, \ntogether with the income of the family that came in, that would be a \nbasis for deportation. If in rural Kentucky or Illinois someone got \nrural transportation for elderly and the disabled, that would be a \nbasis for deportation. That just does not make sense. We keep the AFDC, \nSSI, food stamps, Medicaid, housing, and State cash assistance. If you \nget any of those for 1 year, you can be deported, but not any general \nFederal program.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, one of the improvements made by the bill \nis in the definition of ``public charge'' and ``affidavits of \nsupport.'' The bill defines ``public charge'' with reference to \ntaxpayer-funded assistance for which eligibility is based on need.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this definition is quite consistent \nwith the general policy requiring self-sufficiency of immigrants. \nPrograms should not be limited to cash programs. The noncash programs \nare also a serious burden on the taxpayers. If the immigrant uses such \ntaxpayer-funded assistance, he or she is a public charge. How else \nshould the term ``public charge'' be defined than someone who has \nreceived needs-based taxpayer-funded assistance? That person has not \nbeen self-sufficient, as the American people had a right to expect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there will not be a necessity for two \nmore rollcall votes. Only one will be required.\n\n\n                           amendment no 3829\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, it is my understanding that under the \nrevised language the Department of Labor cannot initiate a compliance \nreview, random or otherwise, on its own initiative.\n  If the Department of Labor receives credible, material information \ngiving it reasonable cause to believe that an employer has made a \nmisrepresentation of a material fact on a labor certification \napplication under section 212(a)(5) of the INA, or had failed to comply \nwith the terms and conditions of such an application, then the \nDepartment of Labor may investigate that complaint, but only that \ncomplaint.\n  The credible, material information may come from any source outside \nthe Department of Labor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I urge the amendment be adopted.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope we could have a voice vote on this \namendment. We have adjusted the amendment to respond to some of the \nconcerns.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. On behalf of our majority leader, I announce this will \nbe the last vote this evening.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all this amendment does is provide equal \ntreatment for the temporary workers and the permanent workers in terms \nof the enforcement procedures. There has been a recent IG report \noutlining the difficulties and complexity. We have modified the \namendment, and I would hope that it would be adopted.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator's amendment is \nagreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 3829) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3776\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment No. 3776 \noffered by the Senator Feinstein. The yeas and nays have been ordered, \nand there will be 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the present law states that \ndeportation notices will be sent out in Spanish and English. The bill \ncoming out of committee deletes this. So deportation notices would be \nsent out in English, essentially. There is no requirement in the law.\n  What we would do in this amendment is strike what is recommended and \ngo back to present law, so that deportation notices are required to be \nsent out in Spanish and English. The reason is because the great \nmajority of illegal immigrants penetrating across the Southwest border \nspeak Spanish, and the overwhelming bulk of them do not speak English. \nTherefore, when they receive a deportation notice, they should be able \nto read it. So we would retain the language of present law.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, to require that all deportation notices \nbe in Spanish, as well as in English, when many deportees do not speak \nSpanish but rather one of other scores of languages, and many Spanish \nspeakers do understand English, I think makes little sense.\n  I think you have to remember that it is in the INS's interest to \nguarantee that the subject of a deportation order understands what it \nis. Therefore, today, all the INS does is provide translations, or \ntranslators, whenever necessary in any language, not just Spanish, but \ninto whatever language is most appropriate. That is the essence. So \nthat we remove the word ``shall.'' It is difficult to have someone \ndelivered a deportation notice in English or Spanish when they are \nChinese. There is no requirement for it. They will be taken care of by \nthe INS through all types of deportation procedures, including \ntranslators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 16 years ago, we in Congress passed the \nLow-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. This bill gave the States the \nresponsibility of developing permanent repositories for this Nation's \nlow-level nuclear waste. Now the Clinton administration wants to take \naway that authority.\n  For 8 years, South Dakota, as a member of the Southwestern Compact, \nalong with North Dakota, Arizona and California, has worked to fulfill \nits duty to license a storage site. It did the job.\n  Ward Valley, CA is the first low-level waste site to be licensed in \nthe Nation. After countless scientific and environmental studies and \ntests, the State of California and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \napproved Ward Valley as a safe and effective place to store the \nSouthwestern Compact's low-level radioactive waste.\n  However, there is one problem. Ward Valley is Federal land. It is \nmanaged by the Bureau of Land Management.\n  The Southwestern Compact has requested that Ward Valley be \ntransferred to the State of California. The Clinton administration \nrefuses to take action. Instead, it has stalled--again, and again, and \nagain.\n  First, the Secretary of the Interior ordered a Supplemental \nEnvironmental Impact Statement. Then, he ordered the National Academy \nof Sciences to perform a special report on the suitability of Ward \nValley for waste storage. Each study presented the Southwestern Compact \nwith a clean bill of health for Ward Valley. Yet, the administration \nstill delays.\n  Now, the administration has ordered additional studies on the effects \nof tritium--studies the State of California already intended to \nperform, but not until the land transfer was complete. Also, I would \nnote, the National Academy of Sciences made no mention that such \nstudies should be a prerequisite to the land transfer.\n  Instead, the Academy believes that this type of study should be \nongoing--conducted in conjunction with operation of the waste storage \nfacility. Unfortunately, I suspect that even if California gives in to \ndemands and performs these tests, the administration will just think up \nnew demands--anything to keep the Ward Valley waste site from becoming \nreality.\n  So who benefits from these delays? No one. This is yet one more \nexample of the Clinton administration's pandering to the environmental \nextremists--extremists intent on waging a war on the West.\n  Scientific evidence shows that Ward Valley is a safe location for \nlow-level radioactive waste storage. Neither public health nor the \nenvironment will be at risk. In fact, most of the waste to be stored at \nWard Valley is nothing more than hospital gloves and other supplies \nwhich may have come in contact with radioactive elements used by \nhealthcare providers.\n  By contrast, continued delays creates risks--both to public health \nand the environment. Currently, low-level waste is simply stored on \nsite--at hospitals, industries, or research institutions. In the four \nStates of the Southwestern Compact, there are over 800 low-level \nradioactive waste sites. These sites were not meant to be permanent \nfacilities. Thus, there have been no environmental studies, no long-\nterm monitoring systems, nothing to guarantee safe storage of the \nwaste.\n\n  With no regional low-level radioactive waste storage sites available, \nSouth Dakota is forced to transport its low-level radioactive waste \nacross the country to a disposal facility in Barnwell, S.C.\n  Clearly, the costs of transporting this waste across the country are \ngreat--from the monetary cost to the waste generators, to the legal \nramifications of transporting hazardous waste,\n\n[[Page S4419]]\n\nto the potential Superfund liability incurred by the State and the \ngenerators. This is far too costly a price--one my State can't continue \nto bear.\n  That is why, Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of legislation pending \nin the Senate to convey Ward Valley to the State of California, and to \nallow the construction of the Ward Valley low-level radioactive waste \nstorage site to continue unimpeded. The Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee voted in favor of this bill.\n  This legislation is ready for Senate action. This legislation is \nnecessary only because politics got in the way of good science. \nTransferring land such as Ward Valley is a common procedure for the \nadministration. However, because of a political fight waged by \nenvironmental extremists, this conveyance has been held up for more \nthan 2 years. This fight, this continued delay, will continue unless \nCongress acts.\n  We have the opportunity to institute a rational approach to the \nprocess. By approving this legislation, we can allow the Southwestern \nCompact--and the rest of the States--to comply with the law we created. \nI urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and to allow good \nscience to prevail, rather than politics.\n  Mr. President, I ask that correspondence between South Dakota \nGovernor Janklow and Gov. Pete Wilson of California regarding the Ward \nValley low-level radioactive waste storage site be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        State of South Dakota,\n\n                                        Pierre, SD, April 2, 1996.\n     Hon. Pete Wilson,\n     Governor, State of California, State Capitol, Sacramento, CA.\n       Dear Governor Wilson: Thank you for your letter concerning \n     the Southwestern Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact \n     and the site of the facility in Ward Valley. While the site \n     in Ward Valley is currently owned by the federal Bureau of \n     Land Management, the bureau has for about 10 years declared \n     its intent to sell to California.\n       I, too, am concerned and upset with the continuing needless \n     delays imposed by the U.S. Department of the Interior on the \n     Ward Valley land transfer. California has made tremendous \n     efforts attempting to comply with the federal Low-Level \n     Radioactive Waste Disposal Act and its Amendments. While \n     these efforts have resulted in the issuance of the first \n     license to construct a new low-level disposal site in this \n     nation's recent history, implementation of this license has \n     been set back again and again by the federal government. If \n     these delays cause our generators within the Southwestern \n     Compact to ship wastes across the United States to Barnwell, \n     South Carolina for disposal, I fully agree that the federal \n     government must comply with those stipulations you set forth \n     in your letter.\n       Study after study has shown the proposed facility at Ward \n     Valley to be protective of human health and environmentally \n     safe. The U.S. Congress has it right the first time; the \n     Southwestern Compact can solve the problem of disposal of the \n     low-level radioactive wastes generated within its states. \n     But, we can do it only if the federal government will \n     transfer the site and let us get on with it.\n       While I agree that the latest actions of the U.S. \n     Department of the Interior appear to confirm the notion that \n     the Clinton Administration is trying to usurp the states' \n     duly delegated power to regulate low-level waste disposal, I \n     am still hoping the transfer can occur soon. If the delays by \n     the Department of the Interior were to result in repeal of \n     the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Act and place the \n     responsibility for trying to manage this problem, in the \n     federal government, that would be a huge step backwards.\n       Thank you again for your letter and for your efforts on \n     behalf of the entire state of California and the other states \n     in the Southwestern Compact to develop a responsible and safe \n     disposal site for low-level waste.\n       Sincerely,\n                                               William J. Janklow,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                               Sacramento, CA,\n\n                                                February 16, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Janklow,\n     Governor, State of South Dakota, Pierre, SD.\n       Dear Bill: As the host state for the Southwestern Low-Level \n     Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact, California has labored \n     diligently for ten years to establish a regional disposal \n     facility in accordance with the federal Low-Level Radioactive \n     Waste (LLRW) Policy Act. This facility would serve generators \n     of LLRW in you state and the other compact states. In the \n     absence of this facility, these generators have no assured \n     place to dispose of their LLRW.\n       To fulfil its obligations, California carefully screened \n     the entire state for potential sites, evaluated candidates \n     sites and selected Ward Valley from those candidates as the \n     best site in California for the regional disposal facility. \n     Although the site is on federal land, the Bureau of Land \n     Management has for about ten years now declared its intent to \n     sell it to California. We identified a qualified commercial \n     operator to apply for a license to construct and operate a \n     facility at that site, and took steps to acquire this land \n     from the federal government. We subjected the application for \n     the license to a scrupulous review to ensure that the \n     facility would satisfy in every respect the health and safety \n     requirement established the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n       A comprehensive Environmental Impact Report was prepared \n     for the project, and an Environment Impact Statement (EIS) \n     and Supplemental EIS were prepared for the land transfer. We \n     subsequently became the first state to license a regional \n     disposal facility under the LLRW Policy Act, and have \n     successfully concluded our defense of that license and \n     related environmental documents in the State courts. In \n     short, California has in good faith has done all it can to \n     fulfil its obligations to your state under the Compact and \n     federal law.\n       The sole obstacle to the completion of this project is the \n     failure of the U.S. Department of the Interior to transfer \n     the Ward Valley site to California. After abruptly canceling \n     the agreed-to transfer almost completed by former Secretary \n     Manuel Lujan, Interior Secretary Babbitt has created a series \n     of procedural delays ostensibly based upon his own health and \n     safety concerns. He demanded a public hearing, then abruptly \n     canceled it. He asked the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) \n     to review site opponents' claims, then ignored NAS \n     conclusions that these claims are unfounded and that the site \n     is safe. He has unreasonably and unlawfully demanded that \n     California agree to continued Department of the Interior \n     oversight of the project after the transfer. Now, according \n     to the attached press release, he intends to have the \n     Department of Energy conduct independent testing at Ward \n     Valley, and then will require another Supplemental EIS before \n     deciding upon the conditions for transfer.\n       Every person and organization which has anxiously followed \n     California's decade-long effort has concluded from this \n     latest set of demands that the Clinton Administration has no \n     intention of transferring land to California for our regional \n     disposal facility. I cannot help but agree. There is no \n     scientific basis for further testing prior to construction or \n     legal requirement for a Supplemental EIS. These demands are \n     purely political, and made for the sole purpose of delaying, \n     if not terminating, the Ward Valley project. It is clear \n     that, once these demands are met, more demands will be made. \n     In short, because President Clinton doesn't trust the states \n     to assume the obligations which Governor Clinton asked \n     Congress to give the states, he has proven that the LLRW \n     Policy Act does not work. Faced with this lack of political \n     will to implement the policy he himself once supported, many \n     now question the wisdom of expending further resources in a \n     futile effort to further that policy.\n       The intransigence of the Clinton Administration in \n     connection with the Ward Valley land transfer leaves me few \n     options as Governor of California. The Ward Valley site is \n     clearly the best site in California for LLRW disposal, a fact \n     upon which my predecessor Governor Deukmejian and former \n     President Bush agreed. All other sites, including the \n     alternative site in the Silurian Valley, present potential \n     threats to public safety not found at the Ward Valley site. \n     The Silurian Valley site is also located on federal land, and \n     there is no reason to believe that the Clinton Administration \n     has any greater motivation to transfer that site.\n       Consequently, to continue the effort to establish a \n     regional disposal facility, California would need to identify \n     a site on privately-owned land which would be technically \n     inferior to Ward Valley and would be unlikely to license in \n     accordance with California's and my own uncompromisingly high \n     standards for the protection of public health and safety. For \n     these reasons, I would personally oppose identifying any \n     other potential disposal site in California.\n       Therefore, as Governor of California, I am compelled to \n     inform you that, because the Clinton Administration has made \n     compliance with our obligations impossible, California will \n     be unable to provide a regional disposal site for your state \n     and the other states of the Compact during the tenure of this \n     president. California will continue to seek title to the Ward \n     Valley land, but will devote greater resources to a repeal of \n     the LLRW Policy Act, and to the enactment of federal \n     legislation making the federal government responsible for the \n     disposal of LLRW.\n       The Department of the Interior has formally announced that \n     California's LLRW generators are not harmed by its \n     interference with the opening of the Ward Valley LLRW \n     disposal facility because they have access to the disposal \n     facility in Barnwell, South Carolina. Given the public safety \n     threat to the good citizens of South Carolina, and the \n     additional costs and exposure to liability to users, I find \n     this suggestion questionable. Nevertheless, in order to make \n     this an even marginally acceptable solution, I am calling \n     upon the federal government to do all of the following:\n       Assume responsibility for assuring continued access for all \n     California generators of LLRW to Barnwell;\n       Subsidize the amount of any transportation costs to \n     Barnwell which exceed transportation costs to Ward Valley;\n       Ensure that California generators obtain any necessary \n     permits for transportation across the United States and to \n     Barnwell;\n\n[[Page S4420]]\n\n       Indemnify California generators and transporters for any \n     liability which might result from the necessity to transport \n     California waste from coast to coast; and most importantly;\n       Hold California generators, including the University of \n     California and other state entities, harmless from any \n     federal or state cleanup related (Superfund or CERCLA) \n     liability which they might potentially incur as a result of \n     using a waste facility which is on a substantially less \n     protective site than Ward Valley and which has already \n     experienced tritium migration to groundwater.\n       If LLRW generators in your state have problems with storage \n     or with use of Barnwell similar to those of California \n     generators, I urge you to join with me in demanding similar \n     relief.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pete Wilson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/30/senate-section/article/S4418-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WETLANDS AND THE NEW FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy \nwith the Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, who is the chairman of \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and who was a \nmanager of the recent conference on H.R. 2854, the 1996 farm bill.\n  As the Senator from Indiana knows, we had a problem in Iowa in 1994 \nand 1995 with the Natural Resources Conservation Service delineating \nwetlands. It is my understanding that NRCS used aerial photography and \nsoil surveys to review prior wetland delineations. In most cases, NRCS \nfound additional wetland acreage on the farmland subject to this \nreview.\n  This caused a lot of anxiety and uncertainty for these landowners. \nThey had accepted the initial delineation, changed their farming \npractices accordingly and then, through no action of their own, \nreceived a new, more expansive delineation.\n  The Senator will recall that because of this situation I introduced a \nmoratorium on new delineations until passage of the new farm bill. This \nmoratorium passed the Senate by unanimous consent and was later \naccepted by the Department of Agriculture.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I would respond to my friend from Iowa that I am fully \naware of the situation that he refers to in his State.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am concerned that a change made to the Conference \nReport shortly before it was filed in the House may result in a similar \nsituation occurring in the future. It is my understanding that the \nConference Committee intended to give farmers certainty in dealing with \nwetlands. One way of accomplishing this goal was to allow prior \ndelineations of wetlands to be changed only upon request of the farmer.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, this is also my understanding.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. After the conferees met, while the legislative language \ncarrying out the various agreements was being finalized, the Department \nof Agriculture suggested a technical correction to this provision. \nSection 322 of the bill amends section 1222 of the 1985 farm bill to \nsay that ``No person shall be adversely affected because of having \ntaken an action based on a previous certified wetland delineation by \nthe Secretary. The delineation shall not be subject to a subsequent \nwetland certification or delineation by the Secretary, unless requested \nby the person * * *. ''\n  My concern is that this could read to allow the Department to change \ndelineations that have not yet been certified. I don't argue with this, \nper se. I am sure there is a need for granting NRCS this authority in \nsome specific situations.\n\n  But again, I do not want a repeat of this situation in Iowa in 1994 \nand 1995. Specifically, I do not want the NRCS to use this language to \nconduct a massive review of wetland delineations. This will just cause \nfurther uncertainty and confusion in the farm community. It can only \nlead to ill will between our farmers and the NRCS and should be avoided \nat all cost.\n  Under the able leadership of Chairman Lugar, we have made some very \npositive changes in the 1996 farm bill that will lead to a more \ncooperative relationship between farmers and the NRCS. I hope this \nprogress will not be undermined by the provision I mentioned.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, we expect that the Department of \nAgriculture will be mindful of the need to balance the very legitimate \nconcerns that the Senator from Iowa raises today with the desires of \nproducers for certainty in the identification of wetlands. In addition, \nthe rights of producers to appeal decisions should be protected. The \nAgriculture Committee will monitor developments as the Department \ndevelops regulations to carry out the provisions of the newly enacted \nfarm bill, Public Law 104-127. I also encourage my colleague from Iowa \nand all concerned parties to contribute their input when the \nregulations are put out for comment.\n  In summary, while we realize that some administrative formalities \nwill be necessary to give producers certainty regarding the boundaries \nof wetlands, we do not expect large-scale, wholesale reviews of \nexisting wetland determinations as a result of the new legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/30/senate-section/article/S4420-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4420-S4423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WHO NEEDS AMBASSADORS?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Richard N. Gardner, the U.S. Ambassador \nto Spain, recently addressed the American Society of International Law \non the subject, ``Who Needs Ambassadors?''\n  Ambassador Gardner, who served in the Department of State under \nPresident Kennedy, as Ambassador to Italy under President Carter, and \nnow as President Clinton's Ambassador to Spain, is among the Nation's \nmost highly regarded experts on international relations, and is \nuniquely qualified to answer this important question.\n  Ambassador Gardner is rightly concerned about the fervor of some to \nslash our already small foreign policy budget because of the simplistic \nview that the Nation's foreign policy requirements are less significant \nthan during the cold war.\n  Ambassador Gardner emphasizes that our foreign policy before the cold \nwar was ``trying to create a world in which the American people could \nbe secure and prosperous and see their deeply held values of political \nand economic freedom increasingly realized in other parts of the \nworld.'' He also reminds us that this is still the purpose of our \nforeign policy.\n  There is a tendency by some to suggest that there is a lesser need \nfor a U.S. presence abroad, and that in an era of instantaneous \ninformation, a fax machine is all we need to conduct foreign policy. As \nAmbassador Gardner points out, however, our embassies serve many \nimportant functions, not least of which are to build bilateral and \nmultilateral relationships for mutual benefit, serve as the eyes and \nears of the President and the State Department, and carry out U.S. \npolicy objectives abroad. As Ambassador Gardner notes: ``Things don't \nhappen just because we say so. Discussion and persuasion are necessary. \nDiplomacy by fax simply doesn't work.''\n  The foreign policy budget of this country is only about 1 percent of \nour total budget. Yet some in Congress propose to reduce it even \nfurther. As Ambassador Gardner states, further cuts ``will gravely \nundermine our ability to influence foreign governments and will \nseverely diminish our leadership role in world affairs.''\n  Global interdependence is a fact of life. The United States foreign \npolicy is best served by actively engaging with other nations, rather \nthan reacting at greater cost to events we don't see coming because we \nare trying to conduct foreign policy on the cheap.\n  Mr. President, I believe that my colleagues will be interested in \nAmbassador Gardner's remarks and I ask unanimous consent that his \naddress be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Who Needs Ambassadors?\n\n                        (By Richard N. Gardner)\n\n       I was tremendously honored and pleased when Edith Weiss \n     asked me to be the banquet speaker at this year's ASIL \n     meeting.\n       Honored because I know how many illustrious statesmen and \n     scholars have preceded me in this role. Pleased because your \n     invitation gives me the chance to return from my diplomatic \n     assignment in Madrid to be with many old friends, such as my \n     Columbia Law School colleagues Oscar Schachter, Louis Henkin \n     and Lori Damrosch, and with President Edie Weiss who took one \n     of my seminars some twenty years ago when she came to \n     Columbia Law School as a Visiting Scholar.\n       Edie, your Presidency of this Society is a splendid \n     recognition of your achievements as teacher, public servant, \n     and scholar. My congratulations also to Charles Brower, your\n\n[[Page S4421]]\n\n     President-elect, one of the world's leading experts in \n     international arbitration, whose service as Judge in the \n     Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal earned the admiration of us all.\n       This Society is now 90 years old. I came to my first annual \n     meeting when the Society was just half its present age--in \n     1951, to be exact. I was in my third year at Yale Law School \n     and had fallen under the hypnotic spell of Myres McDougal and \n     Harold Lasswell. My exposure to them and to the other \n     ``greats'' of your 1951 meeting persuaded me to make a career \n     in international law. I have never regretted this decision.\n       Fourteen years after my first annual meeting, in 1965, you \n     made me one of your two banquet speakers. The other banquet \n     speaker was Secretary of State Dean Rusk. Louis Sohn was the \n     Toastmaster and explained to me that I was on the program in \n     case the Secretary of State didn't show up.\n       That did not in the least diminish my pleasure in being on \n     that podium. I delivered a brief summary of what I'm sure was \n     a rather too detailed lecture about U.N. decision-making \n     procedure and power realities.\n       Secretary Rusk delivered his speech on Vietnam, which \n     provoked a lively discussion period. I recall that one of the \n     questions to the Secretary was about the possible role of \n     fact-finding in the Vietnamese conflict. It was asked by a \n     young international lawyer named Thomas Franck. At the end of \n     the evening Secretary Rusk asked me: ``Who is that young man? \n     I think he'll go far.''\n       When President Jimmy Carter appointed me U.S. ambassador to \n     Italy, my son--then 13 years old--said, ``Dad, you mean \n     you're going to be ambassador to Italy, and also get paid for \n     it?'' Thanks to President Clinton, I'm now one of only three \n     Americans in history who have been privileged to serve as \n     ambassador in both Rome and Madrid. I feel very fortunate, \n     indeed, to be in Madrid, although I'm also pleased that I am \n     being paid for it.\n       But I also come to you as a deeply troubled ambassador. I \n     am troubled by the lack of understanding in our country today \n     about our foreign policy priorities and the vital role of our \n     embassies in implementing them. I sometimes think that what \n     our ambassadors and embassies do is one of our country's best \n     kept secrets.\n       During the Cold War there was also confusion and ignorance, \n     but at least there was bipartisan consensus on the need for \n     American leadership in defending freedom in the world against \n     Soviet aggression and the spread of totalitarian communism.\n       Much of my work as ambassador to Italy was dominated by \n     this overriding priority. At a time when some Italian leaders \n     were flirting with the compromesso storico--a government \n     alliance between Christian Democrats and an Italian Communist \n     Party still largely oriented toward Moscow--I was able to \n     play a modest role in making sure the Italians understood why \n     the United States opposed the entry of Communist parties into \n     the governments of NATO allies.\n       When the Soviet Union began threatening Europe by deploying \n     its SS-20 missiles, it was vitally important for NATO to \n     respond by deploying the Pershing 2 and cruise missiles. It \n     soon became clear that the deployment could not occur without \n     a favorable decision by Italy. Our embassy in Rome was able \n     to persuade an Italian Socialist Party with a history of \n     hostility to NATO to do an about-face and vote for the cruise \n     missile deployment in the Italian Parliament along with the \n     Christian Democrats and the small non-communist lay parties.\n       Some years later Mikhail Gorbachev said it was the NATO \n     decision to deploy the Pershing and cruise missiles--not the \n     Strategic Defense Initiative as some have claimed--that \n     helped bring him to the realization that his country had to \n     move from a policy based on military threats to one of \n     accommodation with the West.\n       So at the height of the Cold War, it did not take a genius \n     to understand the need for strong U.S. leadership in the \n     world and for effective ambassadors and embassies in support \n     of that leadership.\n       Today, however, there is no single unifying threat to help \n     justify and define a world role for the United States. As a \n     result, we are witnessing devastating reductions in the State \n     Department budget which covers the cost of our embassies \n     overseas.\n       Hence the title of my speech tonight, ``Who Needs \n     Ambassadors?'' I am sure this audience needs no lecture on \n     the subject. But let's face it--the world view of the people \n     in this room is not the world view of most Americans.\n       The constructive international engagement we all believe in \n     will continue to be at risk until we all do a better job of \n     explaining its financial requirements to the American people \n     and the Congress.\n       Now that there is no longer a Soviet Union and a Communist \n     threat, what is our foreign policy all about? And what is the \n     current need for ambassadors and embassies?\n       We need to give simple and understandable answers to these \n     questions, showing how foreign policy and diplomacy impact on \n     the values, interests and daily lives of ordinary Americans. \n     in giving my own answers tonight, I'll be saying many things \n     you will find obvious. But as Adlai Stevenson once said: \n     ``Mankind needs repetition of the obvious more than \n     elucidation of the obscure.'' This is particularly true in \n     this new world of complexity and unprecedented change.\n       A common refrain heard today is that American foreign \n     policy lacks a single unifying goal and a coherent strategy \n     for achieving it. But precisely because the post Cold War \n     world is so complex, so rapidly evolving, and characterized \n     by so many diverse threats to our interests, it is difficult \n     to encapsulate in one sentence or one paragraph a definition \n     of American foreign policy that has global application.\n       Perhaps we should start by recalling what our foreign \n     policy was all about before there was a Cold War. It was \n     about trying to create a world in which the American people \n     could be secure and prosperous and see their deeply held \n     values of political and economic freedom increasingly \n     realized in other parts of the world. Well, that is still the \n     purpose of our foreign policy today.\n       Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, with broad \n     bipartisan support from Republicans like Wendell Wilkie and \n     Arthur Vandenberg, sought to implement these high purposes \n     with a policy of practical internationalism, which I define \n     as working with other countries in bilateral, regional and \n     global institutions to advance common interests in peace, \n     welfare and human rights.\n       Our postwar ``founding fathers'' in both political parties \n     understood the importance of military power and the need to \n     act alone if necessary in defense of U.S. interests. But they \n     also gave us the United Nations, the Bretton Woods \n     organizations, GATT, the Marshall Plan, NATO and the Point \n     Four program as indispensable instruments for achieving our \n     national purposes in close cooperation with others.\n       Why did they do these things?\n       Because they understood the growing interdependence between \n     conditions in our country and conditions in our global \n     neighborhood.\n       Because they understood that our best chance to shape the \n     world environment to promote our national security and \n     welfare was to share costs and risks with other nations in \n     international institutions.\n       And because they understood that our national interest in \n     the long run would best be served by realizing the benefits \n     of reciprocity and stability only achievable through the \n     development of international law.\n       Listening to much of our public debate, I sometimes think \n     that all this history has been forgotten, that we are \n     suffering from a kind of collective amnesia. I submit that \n     the basic case for American world leadership today is \n     essentially the same as it was before the Cold War began. It \n     is a very different world, of course, but the fact of our \n     interdependence remains. Obviously, in every major respect, \n     it has grown.\n       In his address to Freedom House last October, President \n     Clinton spelled out for Americans why a strong U.S. \n     leadership role in the world is intimately related to the \n     quality of their daily lives:\n       ``The once bright line between domestic and foreign policy \n     is blurring. If I could do anything to change the speech \n     patterns of those of us in public life, I would almost like \n     to stop hearing people talk about foreign policy and domestic \n     policy, and instead start discussing economic policy, \n     security policy, environmental policy--you name it.\n       ``Our personal, family, and national security is affected \n     by our policy on terrorism at home and abroad. Our personal, \n     family and national prosperity is affected by our policy on \n     market economics at home and abroad. Our personal, family and \n     national future is affected by our policies on the \n     environment at home and abroad. The common good at home is \n     simply not separate from our efforts to advance the common \n     good around the world. They must be one and the same if we \n     are to be truly secure in the world of the 21st century.''\n       What are the specific foreign policy priorities in the \n     Clinton Administration? In a recent speech at Harvard's \n     Kennedy School, Secretary of State Warren Christopher \n     identified three to which we are giving special emphasis--\n     pursuing peace in regions of vital interest, confronting the \n     new transnational security threats, and promoting open \n     markets and prosperity.\n       The broad lines of American policy in these three priority \n     areas are necessarily hammered out in Washington. But our \n     embassies constitute an essential part of the delivery system \n     through which those policies are implemented in particular \n     regions and countries.\n       This includes not only such vital multilateral embassies as \n     our missions to the UN in New York, Geneva and Vienna, and to \n     NATO and the European Union in Brussels, but also our \n     embassies in the more than 180 countries with which we \n     maintain diplomatic relations.\n       Americans have fallen into the habit of thinking that \n     ambassadors and embassies have become irrelevant luxuries, \n     obsolete frills in an age of instant communications. We make \n     the mistake of thinking that if a sound foreign policy \n     decision is approved at the State Department or the White \n     House, it does not much matter how it is carried out in the \n     field.\n       This is a dangerous illusion indulged in by no other major \n     country. Things don't happen just because we say so. \n     Discussion and persuasion are necessary. Diplomacy by fax \n     simply doesn't work.\n       Ambassadors today need to perform multiple roles. They \n     should be the ``eyes and ears'' of the President and \n     Secretary of State; advocates of our country's foreign policy \n     in the upper reaches of the host government; resourceful \n     negotiators in bilateral and multilateral diplomacy. They \n     need to build personal relationships of mutual trust with key \n     overseas decision-makers in government and the private \n     sector. They should\n\n[[Page S4422]]\n\n     also radiate American values as intellectual, educational and \n     cultural emissaries, communicating what our country stands \n     for to interest groups and intellectual leaders as well as to \n     the public at large.\n       In a previous age of diplomacy, U.S. ambassadors spent most \n     of their time dealing with bilateral issues between the \n     United States and the host country. Bilateral issues are \n     still important--assuring access to host country military \n     bases, promoting sales of U.S. products, stimulating \n     educational and cultural exchanges are some notable examples. \n     And every embassy has the obligation to report on and analyze \n     political and economic developments in the host country that \n     may impact on U.S. interests.\n       But most of the work of our ambassadors and embassies today \n     is devoted to regional and global issues--indeed, to acting \n     upon the three key priorities identified by Secretary \n     Christopher in his Kennedy School speech. Let me give you \n     some examples based on my experience in Madrid and with my \n     fellow ambassadors in Europe:\n       On the first priority: pursuing peace in regions of vital \n     interest:\n       We are working with our host countries to fashion common \n     policies on the continued transformation of NATO, Partnership \n     for Peace, NATO enlargement, and NATO-Russia relations.\n       After having secured host country support for the military \n     and diplomatic measures that brought an end to the fighting \n     in Bosnia, we are now working to assure the implementation of \n     the civilian side of the Dayton Agreement, notably economic \n     reconstruction, free elections, the resettlement of refugees, \n     and the prosecution of war crimes.\n       We are working with host governments to restore momentum to \n     the endangered Middle East peace process by mobilizing \n     international action against the Hamas terrorists and their \n     supporters, providing technical assistance and economic aid \n     to the Palestinian authority, encouraging the vital Syrian-\n     Israeli negotiations, and promoting regional Middle East \n     economic development.\n       We have been consulting with key European governments such \n     as Spain as well as with the EU Commission in Brussels on how \n     to achieve a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba.\n       Although they share this common objective, the Europeans \n     generally oppose the U.S. embargo and the Helms-Burton \n     legislation, while doing nothing to limit investment in Cuba \n     by their citizens. Our embassies are increasingly busy trying \n     to promote allied unity on measures that will increase the \n     pressure on Castro to end his repressive regime.\n       On the second priority: confronting the new transnational \n     threat:\n       Having worked successfully with our host governments for \n     the unconditional and indefinite extension of the Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty--a major diplomatic achievement--we are \n     focusing now on building support for a Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Agreement, on keeping weapons of mass destruction out of the \n     hands of countries Like Iran, Iraq and Libya, and on securing \n     needed European financial contributions for the Korean Energy \n     Development Organization, an essential vehicle for \n     terminating North Korea's nuclear weapons program.\n       We are working to strengthen bilateral and multilateral \n     arrangements to assure the identification, extradition and \n     prosecution of persons engaged in drug trafficking, organized \n     crime, terrorism and alien smuggling, and we are building \n     European support for new institutions to train law \n     enforcement officers in former Communist countries, such as \n     the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest.\n       And we are giving a new priority in our diplomacy to the \n     protection of the global environment, coordinating our \n     negotiating positions and assistance programs on such issues \n     as population, climate change, ozone depletion, \n     desertification, and marine pollution. For we have learned \n     that environmental initiatives can be vitally important to \n     our goals of prosperity and security: negotiations on water \n     resources are central to the Middle East peace process, and a \n     Haiti denuded of its forests will have a hard time supporting \n     a stable democracy and keeping its people from flooding our \n     shores.\n       On the third priority: promoting open markets and \n     prosperity:\n       Having worked with out host countries to bring a successful \n     conclusion to the Uruguay Round, we are now busily engaged in \n     discussing left-over questions like market access for \n     audiovisuals, telecommunications, and bio-engineered foods, \n     and new issues like trade and labor standards, trade and \n     environment, and trade and competition policy.\n       We are also encouraging the enlargement of the European \n     Union to Central and Eastern Europe and we are reporting \n     carefully on the prospects of the European Monetary Union by \n     the target date of 1999 and on the implications of an EMU for \n     U.S. interests.\n       You can see from this still incomplete catalogue of our \n     activities that our embassies in Europe are in a very real \n     sense global embassies engaged on global as well as on \n     bilateral and regional problems. You might even say we are \n     busy carrying out the foreign policy of the president and the \n     Secretary of State from ``platform Europe.''\n       In carrying out this rich global foreign policy agenda we \n     will be greatly assisted by the agreement that was reached in \n     Madrid last December between President Clinton, Prime \n     Minister Felipe Gonzalez and President Jacques Santer of the \n     European Commission on the ``New Transatlantic Agenda'' and \n     its accompanying ``U.S.-EU Action Plan.''\n       These documents were a major achievement of Spain's EU \n     presidency. They represent an historic breakthrough in U.S. \n     relations with the European Union, moving those relations \n     beyond consultation to common action on almost all of the \n     foreign policy questions I cited earlier and many others I \n     have no time to mention.\n       A senior-level group from the United States, the European \n     Commission and the EU Presidency country (currently Italy) is \n     responsible for monitoring progress on this large agenda and \n     modifying it as necessary.\n       Just as our embassy in Madrid had a special role in U.S.-EU \n     diplomacy during Spain's EU Presidency, Embassy Rome now has \n     special responsibilities. The action will pass to Embassy \n     Dublin when Ireland takes the EU presidency in the second \n     half of the year.\n       The Madrid documents commit the U.S. and the EU to building \n     a new ``Transatlantic Marketplace.'' We have agreed to \n     undertake a study on the reduction or elimination of tariffs \n     and non-tariff barriers between the two sides of the \n     Atlantic. Even as the study proceeds, we will be looking at \n     things that can be done rather promptly, such as eliminating \n     investment restrictions, duplicative testing and \n     certification requirement, and conflicting regulations. This \n     means more work not only in Brussels and Washington but in \n     each of our embassies.\n       We will also be following closely the EU's \n     Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) that is now opening in \n     Turin. The common foreign and security policy provided for in \n     the Maastricht Treaty is still a work in progress. Although \n     the EU provides substantial economic aid and takes important \n     regional trade initiatives, it has so far proved unable to \n     deal with urgent security crises like those in the former \n     Yugoslavia and the Aegean.\n       The IGC offers an opportunity to revise EU institutions and \n     procedures so that a common foreign and security policy can \n     be made to work in an EU whose membership could grow from 15 \n     to 27 in the decade ahead. We hope that opportunity will be \n     seized.\n       What changes the IGC should make in the Maastricht Treaty \n     is exclusively for the EU countries to decide, but the United \n     States is not indifferent to the outcome. We believe our \n     interests are served by continuing progress toward European \n     political as well as economic unity, which will make Europe a \n     more effective partner for the United States in world \n     affairs.\n       I have tried to provide a sense of what U.S. foreign policy \n     is all about in 1996, especially in Europe, and of the \n     critical role that ambassadors and embassies play. I have \n     chosen examples from Europe both because Europe plays a \n     global role and because Europe is currently my vantage point, \n     but you would undoubtedly learn about a rich menu of activity \n     from my ambassadorial colleagues in other key regions of the \n     world if they were here with us tonight.\n       The question that remains to be answered is whether the \n     American people and the Congress are willing to provide the \n     financial resources to make all this activity possible. The \n     politics of our national budget situation has ominous \n     implications for our foreign policy in general and our \n     international diplomacy in particular.\n       Let us begin with some very round numbers. We have a Gross \n     Domestic Product of about $7 trillion and a federal budget of \n     about $1.6 trillion. Nearly $1.1 trillion of that $1.6 \n     trillion goes to mandatory payments--the so-called \n     entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and social \n     security and also federal pensions and interest on the \n     national debt. The remaining $500 billion divides about \n     equally between the defense budget and civilian discretionary \n     spending--which account for some $250 billion each.\n       Of the $250 billion of civilian discretionary spending, \n     about $20 billion used to be devoted on the average of years \n     to international affairs--the so-called 150 account. This \n     account includes our assessed and voluntary payments to the \n     UN, our bilateral aid and contributions to the international \n     financial institutions, the U.S. Information Agency's \n     broadcasting and educational exchange programs, and the State \n     Department budget.\n       Congressional spending cuts have now brought the \n     international affairs account down to about $17 billion \n     annually--about 1 percent of our total budget. Taking \n     inflation into account, this $17 billion is nearly a 50 \n     percent reduction in real terms from the level of a decade \n     ago. For Fiscal Year 1997, the Congressional leadership \n     proposes a cut to $15.7 billion. Its 7-year plan to balance \n     the budget would bring international affairs spending down to \n     $12.5 billion a year by 2002.\n       Keep in mind that about $5 billion of the 150 account goes \n     to Israel and Egypt--rightly so, in my opinion, because of \n     the priority we accord to Middle East peace. So under the \n     Congressional balanced budget scenario only $7.5 billion \n     would be left four years from now for all of our other \n     international spending.\n       These actual and prospective cuts in our international \n     affairs account are devastating. Among other things, they \n     mean:\n       That we cannot pay our legally owing dues to the United \n     Nations system, thus severely undermining the world \n     organization's work for peace and compromising our efforts \n     for UN reform.\n       That we cannot pay our fair share of voluntary \n     contributions to UN agencies and international financial \n     institutions to assist the world's poor and promote free \n     markets, economic growth, environmental protection and \n     population stabilization;\n\n[[Page S4423]]\n\n       That we must drastically cut back the reach of the Voice of \n     America and the size of our Fulbright and International \n     Visitor programs, all of them important vehicles for \n     influencing foreign opinion about the United States;\n       That we will have insufficient funds to respond to aid \n     requirements in Bosnia, Haiti, the Middle East, the former \n     Communist countries and in any new crises where our national \n     interests are at stake;\n       That we will have fewer and smaller offices to respond to \n     the 2 million requests we receive each year for assistance to \n     Americans overseas and to safeguard our borders through the \n     visa process.\n       And that we will be unable to maintain a world-class \n     diplomatic establishment as the delivery vehicle for our \n     foreign policy.\n       A final word on this critical last point. The money which \n     Congress makes available to maintain the State Department and \n     our overseas embassies and consulates is now down to about \n     $2.5 billion a year. As the international affairs account \n     continues to go down, we face the prospect of further cuts. \n     The budget crunch has been exacerbated by the need to find \n     money to pay for our new embassies in the newly independent \n     countries of the former Soviet Union.\n       In our major European embassies, we have already reduced \n     State Department positions by 25 percent since Fiscal Year \n     1995. We have been told to prepare for cuts of 40 percent or \n     more from the 1995 base over the next two or three years.\n       In our Madrid embassy, to take an example, this will leave \n     us with something like three political and three economic \n     officers besides the ambassador and deputy chief of mission \n     to perform our essential daily diplomatic work of advocacy, \n     representation and reporting in the broad range of vitally \n     important areas I have enumerated. Our other embassies face \n     similarly devastating reductions.\n       I have to tell you that cuts of this magnitude will gravely \n     undermine our ability to influence foreign governments and \n     will severely diminish our leadership role in world affairs. \n     They will also have detrimental consequences for our \n     intelligence capabilities since embassy reporting is the \n     critical overt components of U.S. intelligence collection. In \n     expressing these concerns I believe I am representing the \n     views of the overwhelming majority of our career and non-\n     career ambassadors.\n       I know this conclusion will be greeted with incredulity by \n     people who see hundreds of people in each of our major \n     embassies overseas. What is not generally realized is that 80 \n     percent of more of these people are from agencies other than \n     the State Department. They are from the Department of \n     Defense, Commerce and Agriculture, the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration and the FBI, the IRS and the Social Security \n     Administration, and so forth. And most of the 20 percent that \n     is the reduced State Department component of the embassies is \n     performing either consular work or administrative tasks in \n     support of the largely non-State diplomatic mission.\n       Do not misunderstand me. The non-State component of an \n     embassy is very important to our overseas interests. But the \n     agendas of the non-State agencies are narrow and specialized. \n     As the State Department component is slashed in relation to \n     other agencies, it inevitably eviscerates our core diplomatic \n     mission and diminishes the capacity of an ambassador to \n     direct and coordinate the varied elements of his embassy in \n     pursuit of a coherent foreign policy. Moreover, the drastic \n     reduction in foreign service positions discourages the entry \n     of talented young people and forces the selection out of many \n     senior officers with experience and skills we can ill afford \n     to lose.\n       Under the pressure of Congressional budget cuts, the State \n     Department is eliminating 13 diplomatic posts, including \n     consulates in such important European cities as Stuttgart, \n     Zurich, Bilbao and Bordeaux. The Bordeaux Consulate dated \n     back to the time of George Washington. Try explaining to the \n     French that we cannot afford a consulate there now when we \n     were able to afford one then when we were a nation of 3 \n     million people.\n       The consulates I have mentioned not only provided important \n     services to American residents and tourists, they were \n     political lookout posts, export promotion platforms, and \n     centers for interaction with regional leaders in a Europe \n     where regions are assuming growing importance. Now they will \n     all be gone.\n       Closing the 13 posts is estimated to save about $9 million \n     a year, one quarter of the cost of an F-16 fighter plane. \n     Bilbao, for example, cost $200,000 a year. A B-2 bomber costs \n     about $2,000 million. I remind you that $2 billion pays \n     nearly all the salaries and expenses of running the State \n     Department--including our foreign embassies--for a year.\n       Let us be clear about what is going on. The commendable \n     desire to balance our national budget, the acute allergy of \n     the American people to tax increases (indeed, their desire \n     for tax reductions), the explosion of entitlement costs with \n     our aging population, and the need to maintain a strong \n     national defense, all combine to force a drastic curtailment \n     of the civilian discretionary spending which is the principal \n     public vehicle for domestic and international investments \n     essential to our country's future.\n       Having no effective constituency, spending on international \n     affairs is taking a particularly severe hit within the \n     civilian discretionary account and with it the money needed \n     for our diplomatic establishment. The President and the \n     Secretary of State are doing their best to correct this state \n     of affairs, but they will need greater support from the \n     Congress and the general public than has been manifest so far \n     if this problem is to be properly resolved.\n       I submit that it will not be resolved until there is a \n     recognition that the international affairs budget is in a \n     very real sense a national security budget--because diplomacy \n     is our first line of national defense. The failure to build \n     solid international relationships and treat the causes of \n     conflict today will surely mean costly military interventions \n     tomorrow.\n       As a unique fraternity of international lawyers you know \n     all this. I'm restating the obvious tonight because what is \n     obvious to us does not seem obvious to our body politic. And \n     let's not forget that you can't advance the cause of \n     international law without international diplomacy.\n       Along with other constituencies adversely affected by the \n     hollowing out of our foreign affairs capability--businessmen, \n     arms controllers, environmentalists, citizen groups concerned \n     about human rights, disease, poverty, crime, drugs and \n     terrorism--you must make your voices heard in the Congress \n     and the mass media.\n       I close this lugubrious discourse with a story. Danielle \n     and I recently invited two bright third graders from the \n     American School of Madrid to be overnight guests in our \n     residence. During dinner Danielle asked one of them, a \n     precocious little boy of 8, if he knew what ambassadors do.\n       The little boy looked puzzled for a moment, then smiled and \n     said, ``Save the world.''\n       As you can imagine, I was pleased by that answer. But then \n     the little boy thought some more and asked: ``Just how do you \n     save the world?''\n       I don't claim that ambassadors save the world. But until \n     our country can answer the question ``Who needs \n     ambassadors?''--and who needs embassies--we will be heading \n     for big trouble.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/30/senate-section/article/S4420-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 6:01 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.J.

and\n       (B) no amendment to the Convention enters into force \n     without the approval of the United States.\n       (2) Presidential certification on data declarations.--(A) \n     Not later than 10 days after the Convention enters into \n     force, or not later than 10 days after the deposit of the \n     Russian instrument of ratification of the Convention, \n     whichever is later, the President shall either--\n       (i) certify to the Senate that Russia has complied \n     satisfactorily with the data declaration requirements of the \n     Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding; or\n       (ii) submit to the Senate a report on apparent \n     discrepancies in Russia's data under the Wyoming Memorandum \n     of Understanding and the results of any bilateral discussions \n     regarding those discrepancies.\n       (B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``Wyoming \n     Memorandum of Understanding'' means the Memorandum of \n     Understanding Between the Government of the United States of \n     America and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist \n     Republics Regarding a Bilateral Verification Experiment and \n     Data Exchange Related to Prohibition on Chemical Weapons, \n     signed at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on September 23, 1989,\n       (3) Presidential certification on the bilateral destruction \n     agreement.--Before the deposit of the United States \n     instrument of ratification of the Convention, the President \n     shall certify in writing to the Senate that--\n       (A) a United States-Russian agreement on implementation of \n     the Bilateral Destruction Agreement has been or will shortly \n     be concluded, and that the verification procedures under that \n     agreement will meet or exceed those mandated by the \n     Convention, or\n       (B) the Technical Secretariat of the Organization for the \n     Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will be prepared, when the \n     Convention enters into force, to submit a plan for meeting \n     the Organization's full monitoring responsibilities that will \n     include United States and Russian facilities as well as those \n     of other parties to the Convention.\n       (4) Noncompliance.--If the President determines that a \n     party to the Convention is in violation of the Convention and \n     that the actions of such party threaten the national security \n     interests of the United States, the President shall--\n       (A) consult with, and promptly submit a report to, the \n     Senate detailing the effect of such actions on the \n     Convention;\n       (B) seek on an urgent basis a meeting at the highest \n     diplomatic level with the Organization for the Prohibition of \n     Chemical Weapons (in this resolution referred to as the \n     ``Organization'') and the noncompliant party with the \n     objective of bringing the noncompliant party into compliance;\n       (C) in the event that a party to the Convention is \n     determined not to be in compliance with the Convention, \n     request consultations with the Organization on whether to--\n       (i) restrict or suspend the noncompliant party's rights and \n     privileges under the Convention until the party complies with \n     its obligations;\n       (ii) recommend collective measures in conformity with \n     international law; or\n       (iii) bring the issue to the attention of the United \n     Nations General Assembly and Security Council; and\n       (D) in the event that noncompliance continues, determine \n     whether or not continued adherence to the Convention is in \n     the national security interests of the United States and so \n     inform the Senate.\n       (5) Financing implementation.--The United States \n     understands that in order to ensure the commitment of Russia \n     to destroy its chemical stockpiles, in the event that Russia \n     ratifies the Convention, Russia must maintain a substantial \n     stake in financing the implementation of the Convention. The \n     costs of implementing the Convention should be borne by all \n     parties to the Convention. The deposit of the United States \n     instrument of ratification of the Convention shall not be \n     contingent upon the United States providing financial \n     guarantees to pay for implementation of commitments by Russia \n     or any other party to the Convention.\n       (6) Implementation arrangements.--If the Convention does \n     not enter into force or if the Convention comes into force \n     with the United States having ratified the Convention but \n     with Russia having taken no action to ratify or accede to the \n     Convention, then the President shall, if he plans to \n     implement reductions of United States chemical forces as a \n     matter of national policy or in a manner consistent with the \n     Convention--\n       (A) consult with the Senate regarding the effect of such \n     reductions on the national security of the United States; and\n       (B) take no action to reduce the United States chemical \n     stockpile at a pace faster than that currently planned and \n     consistent with the Convention until the President submits to \n     the Senate his determination that such reductions are in the \n     national security interests of the United States.\n       (7) Presidential certification and report on national \n     technical means.--Not later than 90 days after the deposit of \n     the United States instrument of ratification of the \n     Convention, the President shall certify that the United \n     States National Technical Means and the provisions of the \n     Convention on verification of compliance, when viewed \n     together, are sufficient to ensure effective verification of \n     compliance with the provisions of the Convention. This \n     certification shall be accompanied by a report, which may\n\n[[Page S4425]]\n\n     be supplemented by a classified annex, indicating how the \n     United States National Technical Means, including collection, \n     processing and analytic resources, will be marshalled, \n     together with the Convention's verification provisions, to \n     ensure effective verification of compliance. Such \n     certification and report shall be submitted to the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations, the Committee on Appropriations, the \n     Committee on Armed Services, and the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate.\n       (c) Declarations.--The advice and consent of the Senate to \n     ratification of the Convention is subject to the following \n     declarations, which express the intent of the Senate:\n       (1) Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the constitutionally based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in Condition \n     (1) of the Resolution of Ratification with respect to the INF \n     Treaty, approved by the Senate on May 27, 1988. For purposes \n     of this declaration, the term ``INF Treaty'' refers to the \n     Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of \n     Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their \n     Intermediate-Range and Shorter Range Missiles, together with \n     the related memorandum of understanding and protocols, \n     approved by the Senate on May 27, 1988.\n       (2) Further arms reduction obligations.--The Senate \n     declares its intention to consider for approval international \n     agreements that would obligate the United States to reduce or \n     limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States in a \n     militarily significant manner only pursuant to the treaty \n     power set forth in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the \n     Constitution.\n       (3) Retaliatory policy.--The Senate declares that the \n     United States should strongly reiterate its retaliatory \n     policy that the use of chemical weapons against United States \n     military forces or civilians would result in an overwhelming \n     and devastating response, which may include the whole range \n     of available weaponry.\n       (4) Chemical defense program.--The Senate declares that \n     ratification of the Convention will not obviate the need for \n     a robust, adequately funded chemical defense program, \n     together with improved national intelligence capabilities in \n     the nonproliferation area, maintenance of an effective \n     deterrent through capable conventional forces, trade-enabling \n     export controls, and other capabilities. In giving its advice \n     and consent to ratification of the Convention, the Senate \n     does so with full appreciation that the entry into force of \n     the Convention enhances the responsibility of the Senate to \n     ensure that the United States continues an effective and \n     adequately funded chemical defense program. The Senate \n     further declares that the United States should continue to \n     develop theater missile defense to intercept ballistic \n     missiles that might carry chemical weapons and should enhance \n     defenses of the United States Armed Forces against the use of \n     chemical weapons in the field.\n       (5) Enforcement policy.--The Senate urges the President to \n     pursue compliance questions under the Convention vigorously \n     and to seek international sanctions if a party to the \n     Convention does not comply with the Convention, including the \n     ``obligation to make every reasonable effort to demonstrate \n     its compliance with this Convention'', pursuant to paragraph \n     11 of Article IX. It should not be necessary to prove the \n     noncompliance of a party to the Convention before the United \n     States raises issues bilaterally or in appropriate \n     international fora and takes appropriate actions.\n       (6) Approval of inspectors.--The Senate expects that the \n     United States will exercise its right to reject a proposed \n     inspector or inspection assistant when the facts indicate \n     that this person is likely to seek information to which the \n     inspection team is not entitled or to mishandle information \n     that the team obtains.\n       (7) Assistance to russia.--The Senate declares that, if the \n     United States provides limited financial assistance for the \n     destruction of Russian chemical weapons, the United States \n     should, in exchange for such assistance, require Russia to \n     destroy its chemical weapons stocks at a proportional rate to \n     the destruction of United States chemical weapons stocks, and \n     to take the action before the Convention deadline. In \n     addition, the Senate urges the President to request Russia to \n     allow inspections of former military facilities that have \n     been converted to commercial production, given the \n     possibility that these plants could one day be reconverted to \n     military use, and that any United States assistance for the \n     destruction of the Russian chemical stockpile be apportioned \n     according to Russia's openness to these broad based \n     inspections.\n       (8) Expanding chemical arsenals in countries not party to \n     the chemical weapons convention.--It is the sense of the \n     Senate that, if during the time the Convention remains in \n     force the President determines that there has been an \n     expansion of the chemical weapons arsenals of any country not \n     a party to the Convention so as to jeopardize the supreme \n     national interests of the United States, then the President \n     should consult on an urgent basis with the Senate to \n     determine whether adherence to the Convention remains in the \n     national interest of the United States.\n       (9) Compliance.--Concerned by the clear pattern of Soviet \n     noncompliance with arms control agreements and continued \n     cases of noncompliance by Russia, the Senate declares the \n     following:\n       (A) The Convention is in the interest of the United States \n     only if the both the United States and Russia, among others, \n     are in strict compliance with the terms of the Convention as \n     submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to \n     ratification, such compliance being measured by performance \n     and not by efforts, intentions, or commitments to comply.\n       (B)(i) Given its concern about compliance issues, the \n     Senate expects the President to offer regular briefings, but \n     not less than several times a year, to the Committees on \n     Foreign Relations and Armed Services and the Select Committee \n     on Intelligence of the Senate on compliance issues related to \n     the Convention. Such briefings shall include a description of \n     all United States efforts in diplomatic channels and \n     bilateral as well as the multilateral Organization fora to \n     resolve the compliance issues and shall include, but would \n     not necessarily be limited to a description of--\n       (I) any compliance issues, other than those requiring \n     challenge inspections, that the United States plans to raise \n     with the Organization; and\n       (II) any compliance issues raised at the Organization, \n     within 30 days.\n       (ii) Any Presidential determination that Russia is in \n     noncompliance with the Convention shall be transmitted to the \n     committees specified in clause (i) within 30 days of such a \n     determination, together with a written report, including an \n     unclassified summary, explaining why it is in the national \n     security interests of the United States to continue as a \n     party to the Convention.\n       (10) Submission of future agreements as treaties.--The \n     Senate declares that after the Senate gives its advice and \n     consent to ratification of the Convention, any agreement or \n     understanding which in any material way modifies, amends, or \n     reinterprets United States and Russian obligations, or those \n     of any other country, under the Convention, including the \n     time frame for implementation of the Convention, should be \n     submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to \n     ratification.\n       (11) Riot control agents.--(A) The Senate, recognizing that \n     the Convention's prohibition on the use of riot control \n     agents as a ``method of warfare'' precludes the use of such \n     agents against combatants, including use for humanitarian \n     purposes where combatants and noncombatants intermingled, \n     urges the President--\n       (i) to give high priority to continuing efforts to develop \n     effective nonchemical, nonlethal alternatives to riot control \n     agents for use in situations where combatants and \n     noncombatants are intermingled; and\n       (ii) to ensure that the United States actively participates \n     with other parties to the Convention in any reassessment of \n     the appropriateness of the prohibition as it might apply to \n     such situations as the rescue of downed air crews and \n     passengers and escaping prisoners or in situations in which \n     civilians are being used to mask or screen attacks.\n       (B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``riot control \n     agents'' is used within the meaning of Article II(4) of the \n     Convention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/30/senate-section/article/S4424-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. AKAKA:\n       S. 1717.

KLINGHOFFER\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Dole, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Nickles, Mr. \nMurkowski, and Mr. Hatch) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 253\n\n       Whereas, Mohammed Abbas, alias Abu Abbas, was convicted by \n     a Genoan Court in June 1986 and sentenced to life in prison, \n     in absentia, for ``kidnapping for terrorist ends that caused \n     the killing of a person' for his role in the death of an \n     American citizen, Leon Klinghoffer;\n       Whereas, a report from the Italian magistrate who tried the \n     case against Abbas stated that the evidence was ``multiple, \n     unequivocal, and overwhelming'' and that his actions in \n     training and financing for this operation, and in choosing \n     the target, as well as in planning the escape, made Abbas \n     guilty of the murder;\n       Whereas, a warrant for Abbas' arrest was unsealed in \n     October 1985 charging him with hijacking, and a bounty of \n     $250,000 was offered for his arrest;\n       Whereas, the Justice Department felt that it did not have \n     the evidence to convict him, and citing the conviction, \n     albeit in absentia by the Italian authorities, canceled the \n     warrant for his arrest in January 1988;\n       Whereas, at an April 1996 meeting of the Palestine National \n     Council in Gaza, Abbas described the killing as ``a mistake'' \n     and that Mr. Klinghoffer was killed because he ``had started \n     to incite the passengers against [the kidnappers]'';\n       Now, Therefore, be it Resolved, That it is the sense of the \n     Senate that the Attorney General should seek, from the \n     appropriate foreign government, the detention and extradition \n     to the United States of Mohammed Abbas (also known as Abu \n     Abbas) for the murder of Leon Klinghoffer in October 1985 \n     during the hijacking of the vessel Achille Lauro.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/30/senate-section/article/S4426-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4426-S4443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n    THE IMMIGRATION CONTROL AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      FEINSTEIN AMENDMENT NO. 3867\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by her \nto the bill (S. 1664) to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nincrease control over immigration to the United States by increasing \nBorder Patrol and investigative personnel and detention facilities, \nimproving the system used by employers to verify citizenship or work-\nauthorized alien status, increasing penalties for alien smuggling and \ndocument fraud, and reforming, asylum, exclusion, and deportation law \nand procedures; to reduce the use of welfare by aliens; and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 3867\n\n       Beginning on page 99, strike line 10 and all that follows \n     through line 13.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                FEINSTEIN (AND BOXER) AMENDMENT NO. 3868\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill S. 1664, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 3868\n\n       Beginning on page 10, strike line 18 and all that follows \n     through line 13 on page 11 and insert the following:\n\n[[Page S4427]]\n\n     SEC. 108 CONSTRUCTION OF PHYSICAL BARRIERS, DEPLOYMENT OF \n                   TECHNOLOGY, AND IMPROVEMENTS TO ROADS IN THE \n                   BORDER AREA NEAR SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated funds not to exceed \n     $12,000,000 for the construction, expansion, improvement, or \n     deployment of physical barriers (including multiple fencing \n     and bollard style concrete columns as appropriate), all-\n     weather roads, low light television systems, lighting, \n     sensors, and other technologies along the international land \n     border between the United States and Mexico south of San \n     Diego, California for the purpose of detecting and deterring \n     unlawful entry across the border.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE DISCRIMINATORY APPLICATION \n                   OF THE NEW BRUNSWICK PROVINCIAL SALES TAX.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) in July 1993, Canadian Customs officers began \n     collecting an 11% New Brunswick Provincial Sales Tax (PST) \n     tax on goods purchased in the United States by New Brunswick \n     residents, an action that has caused severe economic harm to \n     U.S. businesses located in proximity to the border with New \n     Brunswick;\n       (2) this impediment to cross-border trade compounds the \n     damage already done from the Canadian government's imposition \n     of a 7% tax on all goods bought by Canadians in the United \n     States;\n       (3) collection of the New Brunswick Provincial Sales Tax on \n     goods purchased outside of New Brunswick is collected only \n     along the U.S.-Canadian border--not along New Brunswick's \n     borders with other Canadian provinces--thus being \n     administered by Canadian authorities in a manner uniquely \n     discriminatory to Canadians shopping in the United States;\n       (4) in February 1994, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) \n     publicly stated an attention to seek redress from the \n     discriminatory application of the PST under the dispute \n     resolution process in Chapter 20 of the North American Free \n     Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but the United States Government has \n     still not made such a claim under NAFTA procedures; and\n       (5) initially, the USTR argued that filing a PST claim was \n     delayed only because the dispute mechanism under NAFTA had \n     not yet been finalized, but more than a year after such \n     mechanism has been put in place, the PST claim has still not \n     been put forward by the USTR.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Provincial Sales Tax levied by the Canadian \n     Province of New Brunswick on Canadian citizens of that \n     province who purchase goods in the United States violates the \n     North American Free Trade Agreement in its discriminatory \n     application to cross-border trade with the United States and \n     damages good relations between the United States and Canada; \n     and\n       (2) the United States Trade Representative should move \n     forward without further delay in seeking redress under the \n     dispute resolution process in Chapter 20 of the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement for the discriminatory \n     application of the New Brunswick Provincial Sales Tax on \n     U.S.-Canada cross-border trade.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                    GRAHAM AMENDMENTS NOS. 3875-3880\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM submitted six amendments intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill S. 1664, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 3875\n\n       Beginning on page 198, strike line 5 and all that follows \n     through line 5 on page 202.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3876\n\n       On page 177 in the matter proposed to be inserted, \n     beginning on line 9 strike all that follows through line 4 on \n     page 178.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3877\n\n       Beginning on page 188, strike line 11 and all that follows \n     through line 2 on page 192.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3878\n\n       Beginning on page 192, strike line 3 and all that follows \n     through line 4 on page 198.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3879\n\n       Beginning on page 177, line 9 strike all through page 211 \n     line 9 and insert the following.\n\n                      Subtitle C--Effective Dates\n\n     SEC. 197.

FINDINGS RELATED TO THE ROLE OF INTERIOR BORDER \n                   PATROL STATIONS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Immigration and Naturalization Service has drafted \n     a preliminary plan for the removal of 200 Border Patrol \n     agents from interior stations and the transfer of these \n     agents to the Southwest border.\n       (2) The INS has stated that it intends to carry out this \n     transfer without disrupting service and support to the \n     communities in which interior stations are located.\n       (3) Briefings conducted by INS personnel in communities \n     with interior Border Patrol stations have revealed that \n     Border Patrol agents at interior stations, particularly those \n     located in Southwest border States, perform valuable law \n     enforcement functions that cannot be performed by other INS \n     personnel.\n       (4) The transfer of 200 Border Patrol agents from interior \n     stations to the Southwest border, which would not increase \n     the total number of law enforcement personnel at INS, would \n     cost the federal government approximately $12,000,000.\n       (5) The cost to the federal government of hiring new \n     criminal investigators and other personnel for interior \n     stations is likely to be greater than the cost of retaining \n     Border Patrol agents at interior stations.\n       (6) The first recommendation of the report by the National \n     Task Force on Immigration was to increase the number of \n     Border Patrol agents at the interior stations.\n       (7) Therefore, it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (A) the U.S. Border Patrol plays a key role in apprehending \n     and deporting undocumented aliens throughout the United \n     States;\n       (B) interior Border Patrol stations play a unique and \n     critical role in the agency's enforcement mission and serve \n     as an invaluable second line of defense in controlling \n     illegal immigration and its penetration to the interior of \n     our country;\n       (C) a redeployment of Border Patrol agents at interior \n     stations would not be cost-effective and is unnecessary in \n     view of plans to nearly double the number of Border Patrol \n     agents over the next five years; and\n       (D) the INS should hire, train and assign new staff based \n     on a strong Border Patrol presence both on the Southwest \n     border and in interior stations that support border \n     enforcement.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 LEAHY (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3905\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Hatfield) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the bill S. 1664, supra; \nas follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                   TITLE III--MISCELLANOUS PROVISIONS\n\n       Sec. 301.

Mr. President, in recent weeks we have mourned the \npassage of two great Americans, former Senator and Secretary of State \nEdmund Muskie, and Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown.\n  However, little note was given to the passage of another man whose \ncontribution to America's history and future may rival those of the \nbetter known men mentioned above.\n  I refer to Judge Ronald Davies, who died in Fargo, ND, April 18.\n  Appointed to the Federal bench in 1955 by President Eisenhower, Judge \nDavies served the Federal judicial district of North Dakota for 35 \nyears. But his career will be remembered most by a decision he handed \ndown nearly four decades ago.\n  In September 1957, Judge Davies was called to Arkansas to make a \ndifficult ruling--one that has changed America forever. Mr. President, \non September 7, 1957, Judge Ronald Davies of North Dakota ordered the \nimmediate integration of the Little Rock, AR school system.\n  What followed that ruling was, and is, history. Many angry white \nresidents of Little Rock, incited by anti-integrationists such as Gov. \nOrville Faubus, opposed the order and kept their children home from \nschool. They vowed to keep African-American children out of the all-\nwhite high school--by violent force, if necessary. President Eisenhower \nresponded by ordering Federal troops to Arkansas to keep order and \nescort the nine young African-American students to Little Rock's \nCentral High School.\n  That decision, Mr. President, by a North Dakota judge in an Arkansas \ncourtroom, began a new era of race relations in America. No longer were \nseparate but equal schools--which were always separate but seldom \nequal--good enough in America. All citizens were entitled to equal \ntreatment under the law, and that included an equal opportunity in \npublic education.\n  Today, Mr. President, race relations in this country are far from \nideal. However, few of us can imagine a return to the legalized \nsegregation that existed before Judge Davies made his ruling in 1957.\n  Judge Davies was buried Monday, April 22, in Fargo. North Dakota lost \na man of courage and conviction. America lost a piece of its history.\n  To the 5 children and 20 grandchildren he leaves behind, I send my \ndeepest condolences, and our country sends her thanks. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/30/senate-section/article/S4444-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4444-S4445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, last week we voted on an omnibus \nbill that completed our long-delayed work on fiscal year 1996 \nappropriations. This legislation's arduous and agonizing history defies \nbelief--particularly since all sides claim to be committed to reducing \nthe Federal deficit and balancing the Federal budget.\n  However, I want to point out two egregious provisions in this \nlegislation. They particularly disturb me because I share my \ncolleagues' interest in balancing the budget. These provisions also \ntrouble me because they will increase Medicaid spending--and therefore \ncrowd out discretionary programs within this year's spending bill and \nin the future. Under the mantle of fiscal conservatism--the premise of \nthis appropriations bill--we are providing additional Federal dollars \nto States that have won political favor. We are spending hard-earned \ntax dollars in these States, but will not see an improvement in their \nhealth systems nor any other public good that will benefit American \ntaxpayers. Although Republicans claim that they want to control Federal \nspending, the reality does not live up to their rhetoric.\n  The omnibus appropriations bill includes State-specific provisions \nthat permit two States--States that blatantly abused Federal matching \nrules in the past--to draw excessive Federal Medicaid payments. \nAccording to a host of independent analyses, the disproportionate share \nhospital [DSH]\n\n[[Page S4445]]\n\nschemes used by these States and others nearly single handedly created \ndouble-digit increases in Federal Medicaid spending in the early \n1990's. Congress shut down these schemes in 1991 and 1993 by creating \nState-specific and hospital-specific limits on DSH payments. However, \nthrough Republican maneuvering under this omnibus bill, two States that \nrelied on these schemes will once again disproportionately benefit from \nthe Federal Treasury.\n  First, New Hampshire will receive Federal matching payments for the \ndisproportionate share hospital payments it made last year to a State-\nowned psychiatric hospital, even though these payments violate the \nhospital-specific limits enacted in 1993. The Department of Health and \nHuman Services has deferred making Federal matching payments \nbecause these DSH payments normally would not be allowable under \nMedicaid matching rules. The omnibus appropriations bill would allow \nNew Hampshire to receive matching payments up to $54 million, whether \nthese payments are allowable or not.\n\n  In addition, although the majority intended to provide a fix only for \nNew Hampshire, other States may also qualify under this provision.\n  Second, Louisiana will receive a guaranteed Federal payment of $2.6 \nbillion--even though it will not be putting up the State dollars \nnecessary to claim these matching payments. This provision, in essence, \nprovides Louisiana with a higher Federal matching rate than allowed \nunder current law, simply because Louisiana is unwilling or unable to \ncommit sufficient State funds to support its existing Medicaid Program. \nLouisiana also used DSH scams to draw enormous Federal Medicaid \npayments and is now facing a budget shortfall under current, tighter \nrules. CBO initially estimated that this fix will cost the Federal \nGovernment an additional $900 million through 1999. Late-breaking \nnegotiations have shortened the time-frame and lessened the Federal \ncost in the out-years. However, increased spending still will not be \noffset because the increase occurs later than fiscal year 1996.\n  In 1991 and 1993 Congress chose to close down some States' creative \nbookkeeping schemes and construct reasonable limits to the \ndisproportionate share hospital program. These appropriations \nprovisions will undermine those important protections for the Federal \nTreasury. If congressional Republicans were serious about limiting \nFederal spending, they would have refused to include these give-aways \nin this appropriations agreement. Instead, Congress will provide \nadditional funding with no additional gain to American taxpayers.\n  The Republican Governors say that they can control Medicaid spending \nthemselves--and they have clamored for Federal block grants to do so. \nYet the Republican Governors in these two States sought these \nexceptions to Medicaid law. These legislative fixes signal that the \nRepublican Governors in these States cannot even live within existing \nlimits that control only one aspect of the Medicaid Program. If \nMedicaid block grants were to be enacted, we should expect a deluge of \nformula fixes in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/30/senate-section/article/S4444-4", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RELIEF OF NATHAN C.

Mr. President, yesterday I did not have an opportunity \nto participate in a very important series of speeches on the subject of \nthe national drug strategy that were spoken by several of my \ncolleagues, particularly on this side of the aisle. I am sorry I was \nnot able to do that. That was under the leadership of Senator \nCoverdell, and I compliment Senator Coverdell for his leadership in \nthat area. So, it is at this point, albeit 1 day later, that I would \nlike to comment on our Nation's drug strategy.\n  Mr. President, when I returned to Washington after the Easter recess, \nI returned with a lot on my mind. During the last week of Easter recess \nI held a series of meetings across Iowa to brainstorm with parents, \neducators, law enforcement officers, country attorneys, probation \nofficers, juvenile court officials, social service and youth \nspecialists, and high school students. I wanted to hear their views on \njuvenile delinquency, violence, and drug use. I held these meetings to \nfollow up on a town meeting I held in February. I did this, in part, as \npreparation for the reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Act. We need to take a hard look at what works and where \nthe act needs to be updated in order to meet today's requirements.\n  The meetings highlighted the deep concern of the public over the \ngrowing problem of violence and drug use among the Nation's young \npeople. One of the causes of difficulties is the ease of availability \nof illegal drugs to today's young people. Not only do illegal drugs \ndestroy families and ruin the lives of individuals; they exact a heavy \ncost on society as a whole. Whether it is in rising health care costs, \nlosses at work, or greater risks on our highways and streets, drugs \nexact a heavy toll. Conservative estimates put the costs at over $67 \nbillion a year. That does not include the costs of the drugs \nthemselves. Nor is it a measure of human misery, which cannot be \nreduced to dollars and cents. When linked to rising crime and violence \namong our young people, the problems become even more disturbing.\n  Juvenile crime is not new but it is rising nationwide. What is worse, \nexperts say kids commit more violent crimes today and show less \nremorse. In the last decade, murders committed by teens increased by \n150 percent. Just recently, three children, one 6-year-old and two \ntwins, aged 8, invaded the house of a neighbor to steal a tricycle. The \n6-year-old, the ring leader, used the occasion to savagely attack an \ninfant in its crib. The infant, beat and kicked by the 6-year-old, is \nnot expected to live, and if he does live, he is likely to have brain \ndamage. The crime was premeditated and vicious. Unfortunately, this \ntale of children killing children is becoming increasingly common. As \nis drug use among teenagers and even elementary school kids.\n  What is unfortunate about this rise in drug use is that it comes \nafter years of declines. It comes after we had made considerable \nprogress. After years in which ``Just Say No'' helped lift a generation \nof kids past the most vulnerable years--ages 12 to 20. Not only is use \nreturning, but kids see less danger in using drugs than just a few \nyears ago. Somewhere we put a foot wrong, and now we face the prospect \nof a new generation of addicts.\n  We cannot let this happen. Recently, I cochaired a congressional task \nforce to lay the groundwork for fighting back. Last week I held a \nhearing on the domestic consequences of drug trafficking and use. Last \nmonth the Task Force on National Drug Policy, convened by Senator Dole \nand Speaker Gingrich, released ``Setting the Course: A National Drug \nStrategy''. In that report, we set out many of the prevention, \ntreatment, law enforcement, and interdiction initiatives that we need \nto undertake to respond to the growing challenge of returning drug use. \nSenator Hatch, Congressman Zeliff and I, along with others, have been \nworking to put the drug issue back on the national agenda after years \nof neglect and virtual silence from the administration.\n\n  Yesterday, the administration, belatedly, issued its own strategy on \nhow to fight back. While I welcome General McCaffrey, the new drug \nczar, to the fray, I am concerned that the strategy released by the \nadministration is long on platitudes and shy on substance. While I do \nnot doubt the General's sincerity, I am not all that confident in the \nadministration's commitment to supporting him. Indeed, the General's \nfirst task is imply to recover much of the ground lost in the last 3 \nyears. His effort is aimed at damage control. The strategy, \nunfortunately, is a prisoner to that effort. And it shows. It outlines \nfine sentiments, but it is skimpy on any measurable standards. It is \nhard to fault such language as the strategy contains. But it says \nlittle other than it is against drugs. It offers little in concrete \nmeasures to determine whether intent will be backed up by deeds. And it \nfights shy of providing any criteria to measure success.\n  I know that General McCaffrey intends to do all in his power to fight \nthis problem, but when it comes to serious effort, my response is, \n``Show me, don't tell me.'' It is important that we get action not more \nwords.\n  This administration has been more than invisible on the drug issue in \nthe past 3 years. It has tried to bury the drug issue. The first \nofficial act on drugs of this administration was to gut the drug czar's \noffice. To cut its staff by 80 percent. It was this administration's \nfirst Surgeon General that called for the legalization of drugs. It was \nthis administration that replaced ``Just Say No'' with ``Just Say \nNothing.'' It was this administration that replaced a strategy that was \nworking with one that has presided over one of the largest increases in \nuse in the last 30 years. Furthermore, in the past 3 years under this \nadministration's approach, the movement to legalize drugs has gained \nmomentum.\n  It is deja vu all over again. Music, movies, and the media have begun \nto glamorize drug use. To normalize it in print and song. Meanwhile the \nresponse from the administration to rising teenage drug use or the \neffort to legalize dangerous drugs has been like pulling teeth to \nmonitor, difficult to explain, and hard to spot with the naked eye.\n  It is only after growing criticism from Congress and from the public \nthat the administration has begun, at long last, to at least talk about \nthe drug issue. The President has had more to say about the drug issue \nin the past 2 months than in the past 3 years. It is about time. It is \nonly after efforts by Congress to force a more serious strategy on the \nadministration, and to insist upon accountability in programs, that the \nadministration has begun to speak about meaningful efforts.\n  The administration is now talking about the need for a \nbipartisan effort. I, for one, welcome such an effort. But let us not \nmistake criticism of failed policies as partisanship. It is, after all, \ncriticisms of the past few years of effort that have led to the \npresent, election-year reversals. It is breaking the silence on poor \nperformance and neglect that have led to renewed attention to drug \npolicy. To the appointment of a new drug czar. To a rediscovered \ninterest by the President in drug policy.\n\n[[Page S4447]]\n\n  Better late than never. But, while I welcome the present born-again \npolicy, I remain concerned about the intent behind it. There is more \nshowmanship and political maneuvering in the present effort than depth \nof commitment. I know that General McCaffrey is not running for \nreelection. I believe that General McCaffrey is serious when he says he \nwants a bipartisan approach. I am less certain about the motives of \nothers in the administration. I remain concerned that many of the Key \nadvisers on policy are hostile to serious enforcement and interdiction \nefforts. I am concerned about the commitment of some of the advisers to \nthe White House to keeping drugs illegal.\n  Nevertheless, I welcome the strategy and I hope that the \nadministration will support the drug czar, unlike his predecessor. I \nhope that we will see more action. I hope that the action that we see \nfocuses less on backdrops and photo ops, and more on results.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/30/senate-section/article/S4446-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
