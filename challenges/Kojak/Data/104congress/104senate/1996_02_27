Mr. President, next month, March 1996, is National Eye \nDonor Month. The purpose of National Eye Donor Month is to alert \nindividual Americans to a terrific opportunity each one of us has to \nmake a real difference in someone else's life.\n  Many Americans do not realize that they have it in their power to \ngive someone else the ability to see, but it is true; each one of us \ndoes. If we declare now that after our passing, we want our eyes to be \ndonated to an eye bank, then these eyes can become someone else's gift \nof sight. What a great opportunity. Indeed, what a great \nresponsibility, one that all of us and our families should take very \nseriously.\n  According to the most recent statistics, over 6,000 Americans are \nwaiting for corneal transplants--6,000 today awaiting an operation that \ncan restore the gift of sight. These Americans \n\n[[Page S1318]]\ncould have this operation today if only there were enough donated eyes \navailable.\n  The purpose of National Eye Donor Month is simply to remind all \nAmericans that we can make those corneas available. Every year \nthousands of Americans donate their eyes to eye banks. In 1994, over \n95,000 eyes were donated and over 43,000 transplants were actually \nperformed.\n  Mr. President, these numbers need some explaining. Those figures seem \nto reflect a pretty substantial disparity, but there is a good reason \nfor it--a very strict screening process that keeps out those who test \npositive for HIV, those who have hepatitis, and those with unhealthy \ncells on their corneas. Those are just a few of the reasons why many \ncorneas are unsuitable for transplantation. But the corneas from these \ndonors are, in fact, actually used for a good purpose. They are used in \nother very important ways. They are used for research in surgical \ntraining and other medical education. It is because of this screening \nprocess I have just described that eye transplant operations have such \nan incredible success rate--better than a 90-percent success.\n\n  This screening process and this rate of success, however, require a \ngreater number of donations. If we could increase the number of eyes \ndonated to eye banks, we could take care of the 6,668 patients who are \nstill waiting for corneal transplants today as well as the 40,000-odd \npeople who join their ranks every single year.\n  As I said, this kind of surgery really does work. In the 35 years \nsince the founding of the Eye Bank Association of America, EBAA member \neye banks have made possible over half a million corneal transplants.\n  There simply are not enough eye donors. The only solution is public \neducation--making the American people aware of what we can do to help. \nThat is what National Eye Donor Month is all about. In March 1996, let \nus recommit ourselves as a nation to giving the gift of sight to some \nof our fellow citizens who stand in need.\n  Let me conclude on a personal note. In August 1993, our 22-year-old \ndaughter Becky was killed. My wife and I and our children had never \ndiscussed the issue of organ donation, and when Fran and I were at the \nhospital and were asked to donate Becky's eyes, we said ``yes.'' We \nsaid ``yes'' because we knew that is what our daughter would have \nwanted us to do. Becky was a loving and caring person. She cared very \ndeeply about other people.\n  I encourage all families to discuss with their family members this \nvery important issue because by donating the eyes of a loved one or \nmaking arrangements that your own eyes can be donated, some good can \ncome out of what to us was life's most horrible tragedy.\n  Again I call the Members' attention to National Eye Donor Month, \nwhich is March of this year, and ask that we all renew our dedication \nto increasing the number of donations, the number of eyes that are \navailable so that more people could see. Thank you very much, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I commend my distinguished colleague from \nOhio on his very moving, very touching appeal, certainly one that I \nthink is extremely important for all of us. While our hearts and our \nsympathies go out to him and his lovely wife in their loss, we do \ncommend them for using this opportunity to assist others.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bond pertaining to the introduction of S. 1574 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1317-8", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1318-S1319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO GARY MUNSEN--A BASKETBALL COACHING MILESTONE\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, during the cold and snowy winter months \nin South Dakota, many of my constituents enjoy the excitement of the \nbasketball courts as a reprieve from the cold. This year, a very heated \nbasketball season is melting the snow off the city of Mitchell, SD. \nMitchell's basketball coach, Gary Munsen, has reached a milestone in \nSouth Dakota high school basketball--he has recorded 500 career wins.\n  Gary Munsen's achievement represents his long, dedicated service to \nthe game of basketball in South Dakota, and more important, his players \nand his community. Gary is living proof that hard work and a strong \ncommitment are the foundation of South Dakotans' success. Gary's \nsuccess also comes from his understanding that coaching is more than \nteaching kids how to put an orange ball through an iron hoop. Coaching \nis about teaching young people the importance of teamwork, discipline, \nhard work, and individual effort. Gary Munsen has made many sacrifices \nduring his career as a basketball coach. But Gary's incredible effort, \ndetermination and commitment have made him a brilliant coach. I extend \nmy congratulations to him for his outstanding record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of an \narticle highlighting Gary Munsen's career be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the article was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Argus Header, Sioux Falls (SD), Feb. 4, 1996]\n\n Munsen Hanging Tough--Mitchell Coach's Road to 500 Wins Hasn't Always \n                              Been Smooth\n\n                            (By Stu Whitney)\n\n       Gary Munsen doesn't need numbers to prove his perseverance. \n     His stubborn survival as South Dakota's master of March could \n     never be that simple or pure.\n       But some numbers are too significant to ignore, and they \n     are used to measure Mitchell's basketball mentor against \n     other mortals.\n       Victory is a comfortable criteria for Munsen. He shines \n     every time.\n       After Saturday's triumph over Washington, he needs one more \n     win to become the second coach in state history to claim 500 \n     boys basketball victories. Gayle Hoover compiled 577 in 34 \n     seasons at Parker.\n       The milestone might be reached Tuesday in Brookings, but \n     Munsen is more concerned about keeping this year's Kernels on \n     course. They are 11-1 and ranked No. 1 in Class AA.\n       ``I'm not one of those guys who set out to coach 30 years \n     and get my plaque,'' says Munsen, whose 499-161 record \n     includes six state championships. ``I'm also not on some kind \n     of mission to break Hoover's record.''\n       To assert this, Munsen talks about walking away. He turns \n     53 on March 12, so early retirement from Mitchell's school \n     system could come in 1998.\n       ``I've spent all my life doing this, and maybe it hurt my \n     family sometimes,'' says Munsen, who grew up 35 miles west of \n     Mitchell in White Lake.\n       ``I might get out of education altogether, if I can afford \n     it. We've got a great athlete in (sophomore guard) Mike \n     Miller, and I told him when he goes, I'll go with him.''\n       Munsen has coached Mitchell's girls to a 141-21 record and \n     three state titles since 1989, but he plans to drop that \n     extra responsibility after next season. He almost did it at \n     last season's state tournament in Rapid City.\n       ``Before the finals against O'Gorman, I decided I was going \n     to get out of girls basketball if we won,'' recalls Munsen. \n     ``It just seemed like a good time to get out.''\n       When Mitchell was upset by the Knights, however, Munsen was \n     stuck for another year. Such is the burden he has built for \n     himself.\n       Critics can mention Munsen's alcohol abuse, his family \n     struggles, but never can they deny that he wins the big \n     games. Even on the high school level, it is that portion of \n     one's reputation that often prevails.\n       ``There are probably some people who don't like him, but I \n     think a lot of people respect him,'' says son Scott, 30, who \n     coaches track and cross country at the University of South \n     Dakota.\n       ``Coming through at the state tournament has always been \n     his style and his strength. I think he figured, `Well, I \n     might not be the smartest guy in the world, but I can outwork \n     them. I can be better prepared.' ''\n       But how does Munsen prepare for the end? If retirement \n     means losing the one thing that defined him as a winner, what \n     part of his reputation will ultimately rise?\n       ``I was talking to (former Dakota Wesleyan coach) Gordie \n     Fosness about that,'' says Munsen. ``And he said, `When it's \n     time to get out, you get out. You'll know when it's time.'\n       ``I still have a love for the game. I'm not as young as I \n     was, but the fire is still there. When the fire's gone, I'm \n     gone.\n\n\n                              starting out\n\n       When Munsen started his coaching career at Marion High \n     School in 1966, it might have seemed laughable that history \n     would match him with Hoover.\n       Just eight miles down the road, Hoover's hard-working \n     Parker squads had established a sure-shooting reputation. \n     They beat Munsen every time the schools met.\n       ``He drilled me a few times,'' concedes Munsen, whose \n     collegiate playing career started at Dakota Wesleyan and \n     ended unceremoniously at Dakota State.\n       ``But he also showed me how to coach the game. I admire him \n     for the years he stayed all in one place.'' \n     \n[[Page S1319]]\n\n       But Hoover remembers thinking that Munsen would not stay in \n     Marion. When the young coach ranted and raved, there was \n     something extra in those eyes.\n       ``He was truly enthusiastic about basketball,'' recalls \n     Hoover, who remains Parker's athletic director. ``And I \n     figured he didn't want to stay at a small school. But I don't \n     think Gary knew exactly what he wanted at that time.''\n       After three seasons, the decision was made for him. A \n     school board member, unhappy with his son's playing time, \n     pushed through an unpleasant ultimatum.\n       ``They basically said, `Do it this way or you'll be the \n     assistant coach,' '' says Munsen. ``A lot of people in the \n     community wanted me to stay, but that really wasn't much of a \n     choice.''\n\n\n                           moving to mitchell\n\n       Whether classified as a resignation or a firing, Munsen's \n     departure was basically a beginning.\n       In 1969, he was hired to teach business at Mitchell's \n     middle school--which included ninth-grade coaching duties in \n     basketball, football and track.\n       He also served as an assistant to varsity basketball coach \n     Tim Fisk, whom he met during a brief stay at Wesleyan in \n     1961.\n       ``The tough part was getting the people in Mitchell to hire \n     him after what had happened in Marion,'' says fellow White \n     Lake native Jerry Miller, who was Mitchell's wrestling coach \n     at the time.\n       ``But once he started coaching, Gary was destined to be a \n     good one. He's got a real knack.''\n       When Fish left coaching in 1972, Munsen inherited the \n     program. That first season, the Kernels introduced their new \n     coach to what would become familiar territory.\n       ``I had never been to the state tournament--and we got \n     there,'' says Munsen, whose 18-7 team took third and watched \n     Huron beat Yankton in the finals.\n       ``The kids we had that year really played above their level \n     of capability. Our biggest kid was 6-foot-4 and we had a 5-5 \n     guard, but somehow we found a way.''\n       Still, Munsen did not enjoy sudden success at the state \n     level. Yankton had some powerful teams, and getting past the \n     semi-final round became a constant struggle.\n       ``It wasn't all roses during the first seven or eight \n     years,'' says Munsen, who saw championship-caliber teams \n     stumble at the 1976 and '78 tournaments.\n       ``We had some tough times where it seemed like we couldn't \n     get over the hump. I don't know if my job was ever in \n     jeopardy, but maybe people were saying we couldn't win the \n     big one. I was given a good chance to succeed, though, and I \n     hung in there.''\n\n\n                            time for success\n\n       Munsen finally broke through in 1984, when all-state guard \n     Kyle Adams led the Kernels past Washington 54-48 for the \n     school's first title in 20 years.\n       ``We were so thankful to finally get there that we made the \n     most of the opportunity,'' says Scott Munsen, who was a \n     backup point guard on that team. ``I think (Munsen) felt like \n     if he stuck it out long enough, something good was going to \n     happen.''\n       Once Munsen had conquered the state tournament, his \n     appetite for victory became voracious.\n       The Kernels, sparked by Bart Friedrick and Chad Andersen, \n     went 27-0 the next season to forge their reputation as a \n     perennial postseason power.\n       When Mitchell rose again in 1986--the first year of the \n     three-class system--it became the first South Dakota school \n     to win three straight boys basketball titles since 1924.\n       ``Maybe it's easier to get to the state tournament now, but \n     it's not always easy to win it,'' says Munsen, who rose again \n     with a dramatic double-overtime win over Lincoln in 1990 and \n     added titles in '91 and '94.\n       ``We always talk about getting back to the tournament and \n     trying to finish higher than the year before. If we won it \n     the previous year, we talk about doing it again.''\n       Munsen calls tournament time ``the most exciting part of \n     the game,'' and he speaks from experience. His Mitchell \n     teams--boys and girls--have reached the postseason party 25 \n     times.\n       His boys teams have compiled a 37-17 record in 18 state \n     tournaments and have finished lower than fifth only twice.\n       ``There's something unique about what happens to Gary's \n     teams at tournament time,'' says Miller, now the athletic \n     director at Roosevelt.\n       ``And it doesn't happen by accident. It's got to be a \n     mental edge at that point, and what he does to get those kids \n     ready is really something.\n\n\n                             hanging tough\n\n       As magnificent as Munsen the coach has been, his mystique \n     has been marred by the real-life struggles of Munsen the man.\n       His father, Charles, died of cancer in 1987. And his first \n     wife, Cheri, was diagnosed with the same illness in 1989.\n       All the hard work in the world couldn't erase that reality, \n     so Munsen looked to escape.\n       ``That's when the drinking became heavy,'' he told the \n     Argus Leader in December 1991. ``I had some struggling \n     moments, some tough times. I knew it was a problem, but I \n     just wasn't able to cope.''\n       In the fall of 1990, Munsen underwent a month-long alcohol \n     rehabilitation in Aberdeen. He was separated from Cheri when \n     she passed away in 1991.\n       ``I didn't handle that very well,'' says Munsen, whose \n     youngest son, Sam, is a Mitchell freshman. ``But it's over \n     and done with. I never, ever lost focus of the program during \n     that time.''\n       But problems with his second wife, Pam, also arose. Munsen \n     was arrested for misdemeanor assault Oct. 3, 1994, after she \n     accused him of striking her and knocking her to the floor.\n       Davison County State's Attorney Doug Papandick dropped the \n     charge on the condition that Munsen seek counseling, and the \n     couple has reconciled.\n       Though this side of Munsen's reputation has been wasted by \n     weakness, a person without strength could never have \n     survived. Even those with frailties can fight, and sometimes \n     they even win.\n       In the very near future, Munsen will win for the 500th time \n     and solidify his status as one of the finest coaches in the \n     history of South Dakota basketball.\n       It is a status that has grown sturdy through the years, so \n     sturdy that restless rumors and rival reputations cannot \n     possibly steal it away. Munsen knows how sturdy the vision of \n     victory can be. He couldn't even destroy it himself.\n       ``He is a strong person,'' says Scott Munsen. ``Whenever he \n     has struggles, he becomes convinced that you have to believe \n     in yourself and become more committed to what you're doing.''\n       Until retirement comes, Munsen will commit to the cause \n     that has defined his existence over the past 30 years. After \n     a while, you become accustomed to carrying on.\n       ``When someone has a bumpy road but still hangs in there, \n     that's a pretty good quality,'' says Jerry Miller.\n       ``Maybe only a guy from White Lake, South Dakota, could do \n     that.

Mr. President, When I was growing up on a farm in \nHumboldt, SD, I knew and participated in one of my home State's best \nkept secrets: hunting. Almost every year I have returned to my State to \nhunt pheasants in the fall. I did so again, with great success, just \nlast fall. South Dakota is a sportsman's sanctuary, a heaven on earth. \nIt's becoming less and less a secret. Hunting-related tourism has \nboomed in my State. People from around the world travel hundreds--even \nthousands--of miles to experience a special piece of South Dakota. The \ntourism industry has become an integral part of South Dakota's \ncontinued prosperity and economic growth.\n  I have many fond memories of growing up in South Dakota. A recent \narticle in the Wall Street Journal articulated many of the sentiments I \nfeel about South Dakota hunting. Sun-filled, crisp blue skies; fields \nthick with pheasants--indeed, South Dakota is filled with many such \ndays of splendor. I encourage my colleagues and all Americans to share \nin this unique South Dakota experience. I extend a warm invitation to \nvisit my State.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the Wall \nStreet Journal article, ``Where Pheasants Swarm as Thick as Locusts,'' \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the article was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n               Where Pheasants Swarm as Thick as Locusts\n\n                          (By Michael Pearce)\n\n       Gettysburg, SD.--A half-dozen gunners and a pair of dogs, \n     we quietly eased into a grassy field that was the picture of \n     prairie tranquillity. During the first few minutes signs of \n     life were rare, save the occasional flushing meadowlark and \n     the lone redtail hawk that rode the same gentle wind that \n     pushed rippling waives across the grass and rattled the \n     skeletal remains of wild sunflowers.\n       But the serenity vanished one-third of the way through the \n     field when a gaudy rooster pheasant flushed inches in front \n     of a pouncing golden retriever. And within seconds pheasants \n     were rising like popping corn; first one, then another, \n     followed by a pair, another single and then a trio. \n     Throughout the rest of the hike pheasants rose in numbers \n     that rivaled swarms of locusts of biblical proportions.\n       The result was a pleasant pandemonium. Hunters fumbled to \n     reload as rooster after rooster lifted skyward, towing tails \n     as long as their brilliantly plumed bodies. There were \n     countless shotgun fusillades, shouts of ``good shot,'' \n     ``rooster coming your way'' and ``hen, don't shoot'' amid the \n     roar of beating wings.\n       Though no exact count was taken, estimates of pheasants \n     flushed from the field ranged from 200 to 400. Days, weeks \n     and months after the final flush of the one-hour hunt the \n     gunners would use every superlative imaginable as they vainly \n     tried to describe the experience to family and friends. But \n     to a true wingshooting aficionado they only needed to say ``a \n     good day in South Dakota.''\n       First introduced in the waning years of the last century, \n     the varicolored Asian imports \n\n[[Page S1320]]\n     have thrived in this state, creating an autumn tradition as popular as \n     gridiron rivalries and the World Series for many. Longtime \n     locals still talk of Depression-era days when they flushed \n     rising clouds of ringnecks from weed patches to feed their \n     families through the long winter ahead. It was about the same \n     time affluent sportsmen from around the world began coming to \n     the prairies to experience the incredible sport.\n       But as with much of America's wildlife, South Dakota's \n     pheasant population has risen and fallen at the whims of \n     Mother Nature. Worse yet, it suffered at the hands of modern \n     agriculture, which steadily replaced needed nesting and \n     winter cover with sprawling inland seas of corn and wheat. \n     But the tide has turned. South Dakota's pheasant hunting has \n     been nothing short of phenomenal lately.\n       ``Thanks to several things--mild winters, the cover of the \n     Conservation Reserve Program, and private habitat programs--\n     our pheasant population has been incredible the last few \n     years,'' said Paul Nelson, president of Paul Nelson Farm, the \n     Gettysburg outfitter who hosted the hunters mentioned above. \n     ``Most of our guests have simply never seen anything like it, \n     or compare it to the glory days of the 1950s. It's not \n     uncommon for our guests to flush 200 pheasants from just one \n     field.''\n       Not surprisingly, the mind-boggling bird numbers have again \n     brought sportsmen from around the world to the place where \n     pheasants outnumber people many, many times over. ``Pheasant \n     hunting is really, really big in South Dakota. People come \n     from all over the world,'' said Mark Kayser, outdoor \n     promotions manager, South Dakota Department of Tourism. ``We \n     estimate we had 100,000 hunters afield on opening day. A lot \n     of them have been coming for years. It's like a homecoming \n     for them.''\n       According to Mr. Kayser, the visiting hunters come from all \n     walks of life. Air strips are lined with private jets, and \n     parking lots hold everything from new Suburbans to rusted old \n     pickup campers that seem to spew low-income sportsmen like \n     clowns from a tiny circus car.\n       But no matter how they arrive, the visiting sportsmen are \n     spending much-needed money in pursuit of South Dakota's state \n     bird. ``Our Game, Fish and Parks Department estimated that \n     pheasant hunting adds about $55 million to the South Dakota \n     economy,'' said Mr. Kayser, a lifelong resident and avid \n     sportsman. ``Some think that's on the conservative side. \n     But there's no question that it's very big for a lot of \n     small-town economies that are otherwise just dependent on \n     agriculture.''\n       So it appeared during a recent trek through the central \n     part of the state. Every convenience store held a full \n     selection of ammo, orange hats, gloves and licenses. Signs \n     advertising church-sponsored dinners and bird-cleaning \n     services were as common as mile markers on some highways.\n       Accommodations ranged from tents, back bedrooms in the \n     homes of landowners who allow hunters to roam their land and \n     bunk for a nominal fee. In recent years a number of \n     businesses have blossomed that cater to sportsmen who want \n     the creme de la creme of wingshooting action and worldly \n     accommodations, such as Mr. Nelson's legendary establishment.\n       Picked up in a nearby Pierre, guests are taken along a \n     back-road maze that soon places them at the huge lodge that \n     features a country opulence and is rated among the best in \n     the nation. Served by a hand-picked staff from across the \n     state, Mr. Nelson's guests feast on five-star cuisine as they \n     talk business or simply relax.\n       But there is no time for total relaxation when taken afield \n     by Mr. Nelson's guides and dogs. Proof that agriculture and \n     wildlife can coexist, Paul Nelson Farm's thousands of acres \n     spew birds like bees from a shaken hive. The wingshooting is \n     indeed so good that Mr. Nelson had to seek special regulation \n     that allows gunners to take more than the state-regulated \n     three-bird-per-day limit.\n       Still, the action is hot enough that most guests are back \n     at the lodge by late afternoon, where they can bang a round \n     of sporting clays or simply sit quietly on a balcony, favored \n     drink in hand as they watch scores of gaudy cockbirds sail \n     into a small sanctuary just yards from the lodge. Mr. Nelson \n     reports that few who depart fail to leave a deposit for \n     another all-inclusive hunt, which will cost around $2,000 for \n     three days.\n       After a morning at Mr. Nelson's, I joined Bob Tinker, of \n     Tinker Kennels, near his home in Pierre. Walking upland \n     prairie pastures toward endless horizons, we followed his \n     stylish English setters as they found, pointed and retrieved \n     prairie chickens and sharptail grouse.\n       The next morning I traded walking boots for waders and made \n     a predawn trudge into a marsh that actually smelled of ducks \n     with Mike Moody, a guide from Herrick. The first flock of \n     mallards that passed over our decoys was easily 100 yards \n     from first duck to last. Never were there not ducks in the \n     air. Totally addicted, I was with Mr. Moody the following \n     morning for another incredible day. At one point some 200 \n     beautiful mallards landed amid our decoys, like leaves \n     cascading from an autumn maple.\n       As we walked from the marsh at midmorning, bags of decoys \n     on our backs and limits of tasty ducks in our hands, I \n     learned the best duck hunt of my life could be just the \n     beginning. ``A lot of times we'll take our ducks, then walk \n     the C.R.P. [Conservation Reserve Program grasses] for \n     pheasants in the afternoon,'' said Mr. Moody. ``And if the \n     geese are in and you fill out on pheasants in time, you could \n     even . . . .''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1319-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING THE JACKSON'S FOR CELEBRATING THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, on January 8, 1835, in the 58th year of our \nRepublic, a distinguished native of North Carolina, Andrew Jackson, \nhosted a banquet to celebrate the Nation's deliverance from economic \nbondage. The national debt had been paid. There was cause for great \ncelebration, because the payment of the national debt was considered to \nbe a triumph of republican government.\n  President Jackson delivered the following toast: ``The Payment of the \nPublic Debt--Let us commemorate it as an event which gives us increased \npower as a nation, and reflects luster on our Federal Union, of whose \njustice, fidelity and wisdom it is a glorious illustration.''\n  Fast-forward 161 years, Mr. President: Today it is my sad duty to \nreport that on this past Friday, February 23, 1996, the Federal debt \npassed the $5 trillion mark--a new world record. Never before in \nhistory had a nation encumbered itself with a debt so enormous.\n  The sheer arithmetic of the Federal debt is so immense that it \nboggles the mind. Consider these figures: As of the close of business \nthis past Friday, February 23, 1996, the Federal debt stood at \n$5,017,056,630,040.53.\n  Let me run that by once more a bit more slowly--5 trillion, 17 \nbillion, 56 million, 630 thousand, 40 dollars and 53 cents. The \nenormity becomes more clearly in focus when one bears in mind \n\n[[Page S1321]]\nthat there are a million million dollars in a trillion--so the Federal \ndebt of the United States has now passed five million million dollars.\n  Let's look back 23 years. The day I was first sworn in as a U.S. \nSenator, on January 3, 1973, the Federal debt stood at less than one-\ntenth of today's total Federal debt. On April 18, 1973, for example, \nthe April 15 tax deadline had just passed; the taxpayers' money was \nflowing into the Internal Revenue Service; and the Federal debt stood \nat 455 billion, 570 million, 163 thousand, 323 dollars and 85 cents. I \nshould add that the Federal budget deficit that year was about $15 \nbillion--one-tenth of the present Federal deficit.\n  Mr. President, one of the first pieces of legislation I offered in \nearly 1973 was a resolution to require the Senate to balance the \nFederal budget. I did that several times in the weeks and months to \nfollow. I lost every time. Then I offered a resolution stipulating that \nthe salaries of Senators and Congressmen be reduced by the same \npercentage that Congress failed to balance the budget. As I recall, I \ngot seven votes for that proposition and a lot of angry expressions.\n  Since then, the Federal debt has exploded tenfold.\n  I recently reviewed a publication entitled ``Historical Tables of the \nFiscal Year l995 Budget.'' Guess what this document revealed about one \nsignificant aspect of the Federal debt. It showed that the interest on \nthe money borrowed and spent by the Congress of the United States, over \nand above income, during the fiscal years l973 through l993, cost the \nAmerican taxpayers $3,006,417,000,000.00.\n  Three trillion dollars just to pay the interest on excessive spending \nauthorized and appropriated by the Congress of the United States over a \nperiod of a couple of decades.\n  Just suppose Congress had agreed back in 1973 to discipline itself \nand hold fast to a balanced Federal budget. We would be on Easy Street \ntoday.\n  But, Mr. President, it is so easy to spend somebody else's money. As \na result of all this Federal deficit spending, the share of every man, \nwoman and child in America averages out to be roughly $19,043. Every \nchild born today will be taxed $187,000 during his or her lifetime to \npay just the interest on the Federal debt.\n  Think of what has been done to our children and grandchildren. The \nburden of a $5 trillion debt is a weight on the shoulders of future \ngenerations, as well as on our economy today. The Federal Government \nannually spends approximately 15 percent of its budget paying the \ninterest on the Federal Government's debt.\n  Last year the Federal Government spent approximately $1.5 trillion, \nmuch of it entirely unnecessary, duplicative, or just plain wasteful. \nWe must return fiscal sanity to the Federal Government and discard the \nfoolish notion that all problems can be solved by more intrusive \nGovernment programs and yet more spending. It's time, Mr. President, to \nmake some hard choices. We can make the tough decisions now, or leave \nthem for someone else to make later, when they'll be even tougher. The \nhonorable, sensible policy is to cut spending and cut it now. Only when \nwe reign in the out-of-control spending of the taxpayers' money can we, \nlike President Andrew Jackson, who was born in Union County, NC, get \nabout the business of returning the luster to our Federal Union which \nhas become so dim.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Steve \nGreene, a fellow serving on the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, \nbe extended the privilege of the floor during the consideration of the \nconference report on H.R. 2546.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to present this conference report \nto the Senate today, at long last. It has been some 90 days that we \nhave been trying to reach agreement. I hope my colleagues will listen \nvery closely to what I have to say, and I hope very strongly that we \nwill be able to pass this conference report. I do so with the \nconfidence that this is the best compromise we can achieve at this \ntime. It is important that we enact this bill and provide the D.C. city \ngovernment with a remainder of the Federal payment and bring to an end \nthe uncertainty about fiscal year 1996 appropriations. We are already \npartially through the year, and we still have not met our commitment to \nthe city.\n\n  This bill contains some very important and long overdue educational \nreforms. However, it contains a couple of provisions that were very \ncontentious. I will explain those briefly. I think we have reached an \naccommodation on one. There is an abortion provision in there that \nsays, ``No funds, Federal or local, covered in this appropriations bill \ncan be used for abortion, except to save the life of the mother or in \ncases of rape or incest.''\n  Also, there is a provision which was not intended to be \ncontroversial--I want to clear that up--with respect to Davis-Bacon. \nThere is no intention in this bill to waive the Davis-Bacon Act, except \nwith respect to donated services to repair school facilities. I wanted \nto make it clear that they were not covered by the Davis-Bacon Act. It \nappears that in so doing, we perhaps created an interpretation that \nwould say it also applied beyond what we intended. There is no \nintention to do that. So we will fix that at the appropriate time.\n  The controversial provision I am referring to is the portion that \npermits the use of taxpayer dollars to pay tuition vouchers at private \nand religious-affiliated schools. I urge you to pay close attention to \nwhat we have done here. The conference agreement allows for two \ndifferent types of vouchers--one to be used for tuition, which is the \ncontroversial part. The other is to be used for after-school enrichment \nprograms. Keep this latter one in mind. There is no controversy over \nthis at all. There are some 20,000 D.C. students right now who are in \nneed of remedial help. We have a 28-percent dropout rate in the city \nright now. We need to do something about that.\n  Also, as is true nationwide, about 50 percent of the kids who \ngraduate from high school are functionally illiterate. I do not intend \nto allow that to continue. I do not think anybody in this body wants to \ndo that. So we allow for the vouchers to be used--or scholarships, as \nsome prefer to call them--to help the kids after school who are having \nremedial problems. However--and this is critical--in no case can any \nFederal funds be allocated for any voucher program until the D.C. \nCouncil approves of such expenditure. Schools participating in the \nvoucher plan are required to comply with Federal civil rights laws. \nThere is total local control here and no Federal mandate that they must \nbe used.\n  This agreement reinforces the fundamental principle of local control \nand allows the D.C. Council to determine if vouchers are appropriate \nfor the District of Columbia public schools and to determine the \nappropriate split between tuition vouchers and the noncontroversial \nafter-school vouchers.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to let the voucher piece overshadow the \nother educational provisions that are contained in the bill. The \nconference agreement includes a number of education initiatives \ndesigned to improve the public education and help all the children in \nthe public schools in the District of Columbia by making it possible \nfor them to compete in the future \n\n[[Page S1322]]\nwork force. This is a critical problem in the District of Columbia and \na critical problem in this Nation.\n\n  The District of Columbia public schools have a proud academic \ntradition. They have produced prominent Americans and local leaders. \nOur former colleague, Senator Edward Brooke, graduated from Dunbar High \nSchool, as did Dr. Charles Drew, the founder of the blood bank; and \ncurrent D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton is also a graduate of the \nD.C. public schools. Space shuttle astronaut Col. Fred Gregory; former \npolice chief Maurice Turner; former president of Howard University, \nFranklyn Jenifer; Gloria Steinem; and Austin Kiplinger, publisher of \nthe Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine, are all graduates of the \nD.C. public schools.\n  I do not intend for our heritage to be the destruction of the public \nschools in the Nation's Capital, but rather to provide the framework \nfor its return to a tradition of excellence.\n  When this bill left the Senate, we had provided the most important \ncomponents for that framework. We included a provision that would \nestablish a Commission on Consensus Reform to review, comment, and \nadvise District officials on the long-term education reform plan, \npublic school budgets, and other activities of the board of education \nand the superintendent.\n  The Consensus Commission is made up of local citizens and D.C. school \nofficials. Its mandate is to ensure that the reform plan that is agreed \nupon and developed by the public schools and officials is implemented. \nThe decline of the quality of the District of Columbia's public schools \nhas been punctuated by study after study, reform plans, and good \nintentions, but none of these studies has been notable in any \nfollowthrough or have resulted in any significant improvement of the \nschools.\n  The long-term reform plan provided for in this agreement will be \nimplemented. The Consensus Commission will fulfill the necessary step \nof monitoring and oversight of school officials' actions. If city \nofficials do not listen to its directives, the Commission will turn to \nthe District control authority to implement the required action, and it \nwill be implemented.\n  There is an important relationship between the Consensus Commission \nand the city's financial recovery which must be understood. When we \nfirst started discussing control board legislation a year ago, we asked \nthe General Accounting Office and Congressional Research Service to \ntalk to those in other cities and States that have gone through \nfinancial crises. As part of the results of those findings, GAO and CRS \nreported that in each city those involved volunteered that one of the \ngreat impediments to economic recovery and community development \nefforts which would lead to financial health was the poor state of \npublic education in the city school system of those cities. That is \ntrue of this city, and it is true of our Nation generally.\n  The District must be no exception. If we do not improve the quality \nof education in this city, we cannot hope to attract people and \nbusinesses into the city. That means that the District will become a \nward of the Federal Government. During the process of retrenchment at \nthe Federal level, we cannot afford to allow the city to become more \ndependent upon us.\n  Mr. President, the bill provides for the improvement of the overall \nD.C. educational system by requiring the superintendent of schools to \ncreate a District-wide reform plan. But broad plans are of little value \nif we fail individual children. The bill encourages a system to ensure \nthat each child has a chance to succeed and no child is overlooked. To \ndo this, we need to both help out teachers and hold them accountable \nfor the achievement or deficiency of each student, and we need to hold \nthe parents and students accountable so we can move forward to provide \nan education that is good for every child. We cannot do this unless we \nfind a way to assess each student in his or her development.\n\n  There are provisions in the bill to establish up-to-date performance-\nbased District-wide assessments that will identify every student in the \nDistrict of Columbia public schools who does not meet minimum standards \nin reading, writing, and mathematics and will provide the kind of \nremedial help necessary in order to bring that student back into the \nposition they ought to be in.\n  Once we have that assessment, we can apply the resources in this bill \nto those in need to get help after school, on weekends, or during the \nsummer. We can no longer be content with knowing that the average \nnumber of students are performing satisfactorily. We must know that \neach child is succeeding and that none is left to fall through the \ncracks.\n  Also important is the creation of the public charter schools in the \nDistrict that provides an alternative for parents as competition for \nthe public school system. The expected result is a choice in public \neducation and an improvement in the public schools by creating an \nincentive to change.\n  In contrast to the tuition vouchers, these public charter schools \nwill be available to every student in the District regardless of \nincome, academic achievement, or behavior problems.\n  The operators of charter schools must be nonsectarian, nonprofit and \nwill receive the same per-pupil funding from the D.C. government as \neach D.C. public school receives.\n  The conference agreement also includes a $2 million additional \nappropriation for Even Start programs in the District. Even Start is \nthat program which allows us to work both with the parents and with the \nchild, that are all illiterate, to bring them into literacy and into a \nbetter future.\n  Also included are funds to begin planning for a residential school \nfor the District. Other school districts are experimenting with the \nconcept of a residential school, and the superintendent believes if you \ncan remove the influences of the mean streets it would make it easier \nto reach some of these kids. These funds will allow the superintendent \nto begin the planning process towards the establishment of a \nresidential school.\n  The creation of a business partnership is designed to leverage \nprivate-sector funds to purchase state-of-the-art technology for the \nD.C. public schools. Face it, when our local grocery stores have more \ncomputer technology than our schools, we must make improvements. Our \nworld is already dominated by technology, and that trend will only \nincrease. If our children do not have access to technology, they will \nbe hamstrung in functioning and competing successfully in the business \nand academic world after high school. Not only is technology essential \nto remain competitive now and in the next century, it also is the \ngateway to new experience and knowledge for school children.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the hard work and \ndedication of the chairmen of the other side, Representative Jim Walsh \nof the D.C. subcommittee and Representative Bob Livingston of the full \ncommittee, for helping to bring this bill to this point. We have had \nmany conversations and it has been a tough fight, but I believe we have \na good bill. I also want to express special appreciation to \nRepresentative Steve Gunderson, whose hard work and dedication was \ninstrumental in forming the House education reform package.\n  On our side, our distinguished ranking member, the Senator from \nWisconsin, has been supportive and helpful in each stage. At the full \ncommittee, I could ask for no more cooperation and support than I have \nreceived from the Appropriations Committee chairman. Senator Hatfield \nhas convened and attended meetings with me in an attempt to reach an \nagreement. His help was indispensable. His counterpart on the minority \nside, the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, offered an \namendment contained in this conference agreement and improves the bill \nin the important area of discipline.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that some Senators can find things in this \nbill to oppose. However, we have spent 90 days in conference on this \nbill. I can assure my colleagues that unlike Vermont cheddar cheese, \nthis agreement will not get better with age. It is time to move on, to \ngive the District the remainder of the payment for the cash that they \nneed in its strapped condition now and allow it to focus on \nimplementing the meaningful education reform that the majority of the \nbill provides. I urge my colleagues to support this conference report.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  \n[[Page S1323]]\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, let me begin by commending Senator Jeffords \nfor his leadership on this important piece of legislation. I greatly \nadmire his enthusiasm and his skill in putting together this difficult \nbill--especially as it regards education. Senator Jeffords is a long-\ntime advocate of quality education for all our Nation's children, and \nin the Senate-passed D.C. appropriations bill, he brought some of his \nbest ideas to the children of the Nation's Capital.\n  For example, the chairman has created a consensus commission that \nwill remove obstacles to much needed reform of the District's public \nschool system. The agreement also includes funds for the expansion of \nEven Start programs for District schools, authorizes establishment of \ncharter schools, and encourages partnerships with business, to \nfacilitate technology assessment and job training initiatives.\n  Unfortunately, the House conferees were adamant in their opposition \nto the inclusion of any education provisions in the conference \nagreement--and, for that matter, adamantly opposed to any conference \nagreement at all--unless a House-sponsored provision related to \neducation vouchers was included in the bill. I did not support this \naction in conference, and I cannot now support an agreement that \nincludes vouchers.\n  As former chairman of the D.C. Appropriations Subcommittee, I take \nthis step with great regret. Senator Jeffords is an able, effective and \ndedicated chairman. Under difficult circumstances, he has labored long \nand hard to craft a measure that will put the District on the road to \nrecovery. I believe that by removing the voucher provision--and by \namending the provisions regarding reproductive health and Davis-Bacon--\nthis report could be adopted by unanimous consent.\n  In my opinion the concept of public funding for private schools is \nfundamentally flawed. Private schools have selective admissions \npolicies, in some cases enrolling only those students of a particular \nreligion or gender. Public schools do not discriminate: they are \ncharged with educating all children. Our first priority must be to help \npublic schools meet their goal. Unfortunately, this bill does not \nreflect that priority, and therefore, I will vote against cloture and I \nencourage my colleagues to do the same. I have a longer statement \ndetailing my objections to the voucher provision that I will include in \nthe Record. Mr. President, I hope that we can act quickly to resolve \nthis matter and produce a report which will be acceptable to all \nMembers of the Senate. The District is in dire financial straits and \nthe situation is deteriorating rapidly. It is my understanding that the \nDistrict will run out of cash within the next several weeks, if this \nmatter is not resolved. Unless Congress releases the balance of the \nFederal payment, the city will be unable to meet payrolls, pay bills or \nprovide basic services. I therefore urge my colleagues on the other \nside to stop holding the Nation's Capital hostage in order to debate a \nsubject that would be better resolved on an education bill.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that pursuant to the unanimous-\nconsent agreement governing this matter, time for debate has been \nequally divided between the majority and the minority. For purposes of \naddressing the issue of vouchers, I have agreed to yield to Senator \nKennedy such time as he may consume. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Danica \nPetroshius and Sam Wang, legislative fellows in my office, be granted \nprivileges of the floor for the duration of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time as I might use.\n  Mr. President, just some obvious facts that should be evident to all \nthe Members as we come back to the legislative process and consider the \nD.C. appropriations conference report. First of all, I want to commend \nmy friend and colleague, Senator Kohl, for his statement. He has, since \nthe time of the conference report, visited with a number of us on this \nissue. He has taken great interest and great diligence during the \nperiod of the conference. He has a real grasp and understanding about \nthe public issues and policy issues raised by this conference report.\n  As a Member of the body and the Education Committee, I want to \ncommend him for all of his good work and for raising these very, very \nimportant issues in a way which I think will gain broad support. I \nthank him for his attention and involvement in the issues.\n  Second, Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the very strong \ndedication and commitment to education and adequate funding of \neducation from the Senator from Vermont, my friend, Senator Jeffords. \nHis words carry great weight in this body, as they should, on any \nissue, but particularly on education issues and on the issues involving \neducation in the District of Columbia. He has not only been tireless in \nhis commitment to enhancing educational opportunities in the District \nthrough public policy, but also he has committed himself personally in \nthe Everybody Wins Program, a special program to provide literacy \ntraining to the students in the District of Columbia. Through his \nintervention, the Members of this body are much more familiar with that \nprogram. Because of Senator Jeffords' leadership, Members in this \ninstitution and the House of Representatives, in the various Cabinet \noffices, and many of the others in the community reach out and work \nwith young people, in training and enhancing their literacy capability. \nSo he brings a very considerable credibility to the positions that he \ntakes.\n\n  Even though he and I generally agree on most educational issues, on \nthis conference report I reach a different conclusion, not only because \nof the position on vouchers, but for other reasons as well. I think the \nSenator from Wisconsin pointed out very clearly that if the amendments \nhad not been included, those dealing with the issues of a woman's right \nto choose, those issues involving Davis-Bacon, as well as the issues on \nvouchers, this legislation would go through unanimously.\n  What we are faced with here, with this conference report, is what we \nhave been faced with in other types of appropriations, is riders that \nare not directly relevant to the appropriations matters at hand. Davis-\nBacon rider waives labor protections and denies workers on federally \nfunded construction project the right to be paid locally prevailing \nwages. Consideration of these issues falls under the jurisdiction of \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee. We have had hearings on them. \nWe have reviewed various proposals. To undermine the committee's \nability to deal with this and to tag it onto the D.C. appropriations is \nquite unacceptable.\n  I do not know what the majority has against workers with an average \nincome of $26,000 a year--that is what the average worker receives \nunder the provisions of Davis-Bacon. I just left a hearing of the \nJudiciary Committee. Because of an oversight in drafting, $4.6 billion \nare going to go to a handful of pharmaceutical companies--$4.6 billion. \nIn this bill, we face a rider that will undermine the ability of \nconstruction workers to be paid the prevailing wage in the District. \nThis undermines their ability to receive a fair compensation. It just \nonce again reminds us, or should remind us and remind the American \npeople, about who is on whose side.\n  I must say, Senator Chafee is working with Senator Pryor to try to \nalter that oversight. Hopefully they will be successful.\n  Nonetheless, we have the inappropriate rider on Davis-Bacon in this \nbill. We have the inappropriate rider on a woman's right to choose. \nHarris versus McRea asserts that the use of State funds to provide \nabortions for poor women is a State, not a Federal, decision. But not \nin this D.C. legislation. It decides how local funds will be used. We \nare not letting the people in the District of Columbia, as we permit in \nevery other State, to make a judgment. The restrictive language in this \nbill will cause a very serious hardship, particularly among the poorest \nand most needy people in our society.\n  The majority imposed a measure affecting protections for income \nlevels for workers. The majority decided to superimpose their judgment \non a woman's right to choose. And the majority has imposed a private \nschool voucher program that was rejected a number of years ago by an 8-\nto-1 majority in the District of Columbia.\n  The Congress refuses to say on this issue that the local people know \nbest. \n\n[[Page S1324]]\n How many times have we heard that rhetoric here on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate? Oh, no, not with regard to the District of Columbia, they \ndo not know best. They do not know how they want to allocate their \nresources. But, we in the Congress, we know best what is in their local \ninterests even though they have clearly rejected that proposal a number \nof years ago. Vouchers also have been rejected in a number of States on \nstatewide ballots. 16 States have rejected it.\n  While I support various kinds of public school choice, that is not \nwhat is at stake today. Today, the most important question is whether \nwe are going to take scarce education funds away from children who \nattend the public schools to provide those resources to private \nschools. That is the core issue.\n  So, I strongly subscribe to the position that was taken by the \nSenator from Wisconsin who said that without these riders that are not \ngermane to the underlying core issue this would go through on a voice \nvote.\n  Mr. President, having expressed my strong view about the commitment \nof the Senator from Vermont on this issue, I question the seriousness \nof this Congress on its commitment to supporting public schools. We saw \na year ago the cutting back of some $28 million from D.C. public \nschools. This year, it is about $11 million. We know under the \nRepublican proposals in the House of Representatives there will be a \n22-percent reduction in all support for elementary/secondary \nlegislation on appropriations. Let us understand what we are looking at \nin a broader context. This Congress is pushing significant reductions \nin funding for public schools generally, and significant reductions in \nfunding for D.C. public schools.\n  During this debate and discussion, we find individuals who say, ``We \nhave the answer. We do not have to provide the funding for public \nschools. We do not have to listen to what the Governors of this \ncountry, Republican and Democrat alike, recommended to the Nation when \nthey met down in Charlottesville, VA.'' And that is that children, in \norder to be able to learn, have to go to school ready to learn. That \nmeans they need an adequate breakfast and to be able to come from a \nhome atmosphere free from substance abuse, family violence. They must \nbe free from being preyed upon by gangs in the schoolyard and a whole \nhost of different kinds of challenges.\n  We hear that the answer to all the problems in the school districts \nis vouchers. Proponents of the voucher program say that D.C. has the \nchoice of whether or not to implement a private school voucher program. \nThat decision really lies with a newly created Scholarship Corporation. \nThe D.C. Council only has veto power over proposals submitted by the \nCorporation.\n  Of course, if the council does not agree, do you think the local \nschool district will be able to spend that $5 million for the benefit \nof all the children? Absolutely not. If they do not spend it on \nvouchers, they cannot spend it at all. You talk about intimidating or \nattempting to intimidate the local school. If they do not go along with \nthis oversight body, they lose the $5 million. It is that kind of \nintimidation, it is that kind of wrongheaded policy, it is that kind of \npaternalistic attitude that ought to be rejected today. Again, we could \npass D.C. appropriations in a matter of seconds if we freed ourselves \nfrom these riders.\n  It is important to understand the number of children we are talking \nabout. Even if we were able to provide the full range of funding, $5 \nmillion, to children, we would fund only 2 percent of the D.C. school \npopulation. Vouchers take money away from what is available to children \ngenerally in the school system to try to provide some help and \nassistance, whether it is to enhance their math and science skills, \nwhether it is to support reading and literacy, whether it is to make \nsome minor repairs in school buildings that are 100 years old.\n  And what will the fate be of that 2 percent? Many people think that \nthese low-income students will be able to go to the private school of \ntheir choice because of the voucher provision in this bill. But the \nprivate schools can decide whether to accept a child or not. The real \nchoice is given to private schools, not parents or students.\n  Private schools choose a hand-picked group of students who are much \nmore likely to have college educated parents and to come from high-\nincome families than their public school counterparts. Public schools \ncan't be selective. They must take the children of the homeless and \nchildren of limited English proficiency. The public schools take \nchildren with disabilities. They must take all students and try to \nteach all students no matter how disadvantaged their background. They \ndon't have the luxury of closing their doors to students who pose a \nchallenge.\n  Little Johnny wants to be able to go to private school. He is able to \nqualify for that voucher, but the school says no. That is the \ndifference. This is not competition. This is not letting the parents or \nthe children make the choice. This permits the school to make the \nchoice. The school can turn him down. They have a limited number of \npositions and they take the children that will fit into those \nparticular slots.\n  Now, are we going to insist that they take all students? Are the \nproponents of the voucher system going to say, ``OK, if they do not \ntake them, they should take them,'' so that we have an equal playing \nground in public and private schools and have a real choice? Are they \nproposing that? Of course not. Nothing of the sort.\n  Those who support the voucher system are not creating a level playing \nfield. What they are doing is taking the money, scarce resources out of \nthe public school system and giving it to children that may or may not \ngain entrance into the private school system. We should not take the \nmoney out of the public schools and put it into the private.\n  There is no evidence that voucher programs work. In Milwaukee, which \nhas had a voucher program for 5 years, test scores of voucher students \ndid not rise. One third of parents and students who began participating \nin the voucher program there have opted out of it. In the last month, 2 \nof the 17 schools that participate in the choice program have closed \nand 2 more are being audited because of serious financial difficulties.\n  Mr. President, I see colleagues here on this issue, and I will yield \nat this time to permit them to speak and come back to this issue.\n  In summary, this is the wrong answer for a central challenge. We must \ninvest in children at the earliest possible age. That is why 2 years \nago we changed the Head Start Program to include younger children and \nprovide programs for parents to learn parenting skills for children to \nget them involved in school. The recent Carnegie Commission report \nsuggests that we must be serious about investing in young children. We \ndo not want to abandon public schools by taking scarce resources out of \nthem and putting them into private schools. We are effectively turning \nthumbs down on the public school system. We are abandoning them. We are \nnot giving them close enough attention.\n  This voucher proposal will fund the few at the expense of the many. \nIt gives scarce Federal dollars to the schools that can exclude \nchildren. It also ignores the fact that in 16 States and the District \nof Columbia this concept was rejected. And it raises the important \nconstitutional issues which were raised in a Milwaukee case that now \nstands before the Supreme Court. It is unwise policy. It is \nunjustified. And if we really care about children we ought to be \nlooking at what is necessary and essential as a nation to adequately \ninvest in those children, in those teachers, in their classrooms, and \nin the latest technologies for them to have a more complete education \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, I think Senator Simon was here first, and I yield to \nhim such time as he may want.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, first I ask unanimous consent that Janette \nBenson, who is an American Psychological Association Congressional \nScience Fellow in my office, be permitted floor privileges for the \nduration of the debate on the D.C. appropriations conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, we have a very fundamental policy decision \nhere. Vouchers are being tried right now in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio, \nand perhaps elsewhere. That is the advantage \n\n[[Page S1325]]\nof the Federal system. I happen to think we have to be very careful as \nwe approach this. Among other things, we have very limited resources \nthe Federal Government is putting out, and we are talking now in this \nbudget about cutting back. In fiscal year 1949, the Federal Government \nspent 9 percent of its budget on education. This year, as I have said \nin the Chamber, it is 2 percent, but my colleague from Vermont has \ncorrected me and said we are down to 1.4 percent. And now we are \ntalking about dissipating these resources. I do not think that is wise.\n  Second, while technically we do not mandate the D.C. schools to do \nthis, what we say is here is some money and if you spend it for this, \nyou can have it. And if you do not spend it for this, you cannot have \nthe money, for a strapped D.C. school system.\n  Third, as Senator Kennedy pointed out, the participating schools do \nnot have to take all students. So there is a creaming process that \nhurts the public schools. There is just no question about it. That is \nthe difference between this and the student aid program that we have.\n  Then what we do is we fail to address the real problems of the D.C. \npublic schools. Real candidly, I have only visited one school, the \nschool both Senator Jeffords and I get over to as frequently as we can \nto read to a student, and that school I visit is, it is my guess, above \naverage for the schools in D.C.\n  Last year, I visited schools in Chicago, on the west side, and the \nsouth side. I visited 18 schools. I did not take any reporters with me. \nI just tried to see what was going on. I saw some encouraging things; I \nsaw some awfully discouraging things. We ought to be addressing the \nreal problems of urban schools in America.\n  This does not move in that direction. I hope we will restrain our \ndesire to move in and, with the minutest detail, tell the D.C. schools \nwhat they ought to do. We ought to be helping urban schools. We ought \nto be helping schools in our country in general much more than we are. \nThis is not the right way to do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the District of \nColumbia appropriations bill. I oppose this bill for the same reasons \nthat Senator Simon and Senator Kennedy have already discussed, because \nit includes a provision that permits publicly funded ``scholarships,'' \nto low-income students to attend private and religious schools in the \nDistrict. I believe this is just another attempt to fund private \nschools with already scarce Federal dollars, too scarce.\n  I have consistently opposed attempts by Congress to encourage the use \nof Federal funds to support private schools whether in the form of \ntuition tax credits or vouchers. Including this provision would be the \nfirst step toward establishing a permanent voucher program for \neducation in this country. Mr. President, if the public schools are not \nproducing the product we want, we need to fix the system, not start \nsiphoning additional money from its purposes and from what it is being \nused for now.\n  The system of public education in this country is available to all \nchildren. Every young person has a right to expect to get a good \neducation out of the school system in this country.\n  If it is not producing the high level of achievement needed, we \ncannot abandon it, but rather we must find ways to make necessary \nimprovements. Not only that, but this is a time when education programs \nare suffering from a disproportionate share of Federal budget cuts. \nDiverting Federal resources over to private schools rather than trying \nto strengthen the public school system of this country is just wrong.\n  Mr. President, I think most people are surprised when they find out \nwhat a small percentage of support comes from the Federal Government \nfor elementary and secondary education. The Federal Government plays a \nvery major role in higher education--Pell grants, loans, things like \nthat. That help is really an aftermath of the success of the GI bill \nfor education after World War II.\n  So the Federal Government has a very major role in higher education \nbut plays a very minor role in elementary and secondary education; the \nhighest we ever got up to was about 9 percent of the expenses for \nelementary and secondary. It gradually drifted down to 6 percent. If I \nheard Senator Simon correctly a moment ago, I believe the current \nfigure is only 1.6 percent, something like that. I do not know whether \nit is that low or not. I thought it was still around 5 or 6 percent, \nwhich is too low to begin with.\n  Elementary and secondary education is basically funded through State \nand local funding. It comes from an antiquated property tax we should \nhave corrected many years ago. Go back to the early days of this \ncountry, and most of the wealth of this country was in property. We did \nnot have NASDAQ and the big New York Stock Exchange and the \ninternational flow of funds and investments. We had property, and that \nwas a fair measure of people's ability to support an educational \nsystem. So a property tax became the norm for supporting education in \nthis country.\n  Now we are over two-thirds a service economy, and yet we stick with \nthe property tax. As Lester Thurow pointed out in his book a couple \nyears ago, we run our educational system not on a national basis like \nevery other major industrialized country in the world; in this country \nwe elect 15,000 independent school boards who are getting elected on \nthe basis of, ``We will not raise your taxes.'' That is how we take \ncare of one of the most important functions of our whole society--how \nwe educate our kids for the future, how we educate our young people to \nbe competitive in an increasingly competitive world.\n\n  I personally think we should be doing more on this at the Federal \nlevel. International competition is going to eat us up if we are not \ncareful and do not get our kids the first-rate education that they \ndeserve. I do not want to see money siphoned off from our system, \nsupporting efforts to leave the public school system. So I will support \nthe finest public school system in the world, in this country and vote \nto supply the money for that.\n  There is another concern about this that was mentioned on the floor a \nfew moments ago. That is, this proposal does not require private \nschools receiving vouchers to accept students with learning \ndisabilities, behavioral problems, homeless students, or those with \nlimited English proficiency. You can siphon off the kids you want and \nnot take the kids in wheelchairs, the kids with learning disabilities, \nthe kids with dyslexia that are treatable and should be treated and \nshould be part of our system that helps young people get a start in \nthis world. There is no requirement for private schools receiving \nvouchers to accept students with these problems.\n  Public schools have the responsibility to educate all students. I \ncertainly worry, with this legislation, that vouchers will skim the \nbest students and leave public education with little Federal help and \nyet expect them to solve all the educational problems. That is just \nwrong.\n  I believe that providing vouchers to religious schools also is \nunconstitutional. There is no Federal or State court, as I understand \nit, that has ever upheld using vouchers for private or religious \nschools. In fact, in August, the Wisconsin Supreme Court issued an \ninjunction against the expansion of Milwaukee's School Choice Program \nto include religious schools--an injunction against them.\n  Vouchers undermine any serious attempts being made to reform our \npublic education in this country. With this voucher provision included, \nI will vote against the District of Columbia appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, very briefly--I know other Senators are waiting--but \nwhile I have the opportunity, I want to mention my opposition to \nanother provision in this conference agreement which was recently \nbrought to my attention. That is section 2551(b)(6), which would waive \nFederal procurement laws for the GSA Administrator when he provides \ntechnical assistance and advisory services for the repair and \nimprovement of D.C. schools.\n  I am told the sole reason this provision exists is to speed up the \nprocess of getting D.C. schools in shape in conjunction with a 2-year \nflash program. \n\n[[Page S1326]]\n While that may be an admirable goal to get these things taken care of \nspeedily, both GSA and the D.C. government have been plagued with their \nshare of problems over the last few decades. The District in particular \nis ripe with examples where contracting was not carried out properly, \nand to just waive all the rules and regulations and let them go because \nwe need speed in this particular area, I think takes too big a chance.\n  We all know too well there is enormous potential for fraud and abuse \nin procurement. I am not willing to approve such broad authority \nwithout any assurances attached to it. There are reasons for these \nprocurement laws, reasons throughout Government why GSA has a \nprocedure. We just revised them. I was chairman of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee when we went through some of these procedures and \nchanged the procurement laws for our whole Government to protect \nagainst fraud and abuse in these programs. To waive those things, \nparticularly with the District of Columbia, that does not have a good \ntrack record in the area of contracting and fiduciary or financial \nresponsibility, I think is just wrong.\n  This legislation does not even include a reporting requirement on \ncontracts awarded under this provision. There is no evidence that they \nconsidered using one of the exceptions to full and open competition \nunder the Competition in Contracting Act [CICA], such as unusual and \ncompelling urgency or in the public interest. While these procurements \nwould still be protestable, it would have been a much more palatable \nsolution than broad waivers.\n  I have opposed blanket waivers of procurement laws in the past. Most \nrecently I came to the floor to speak against the waiver of procurement \nlaws with respect to the FAA. Although I continue to believe that the \nFAA waivers were a bad precedent to set, at least that legislation \ncontained a very specific list of the laws to be waived. No such list \nexists in connection with this provision. A few laws, such as CICA and \nthe Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act have been named, but the \nphrase, ``* * * or any other law governing procurements or public \ncontracts * * *,'' leaves the rest of the field wide open to include \nlabor, civil rights, and financial management laws.\n  The list in this bill, at the very least, should be as explicit in \nthe D.C. appropriations bill as it is in the DOT appropriations law. \nThis is a very dangerous precedent to set even for a limited period of \ntime and for a limited purpose.\n  If the conference report is defeated, I hope the committee will \nconsider this view and redraft, if not delete, this provision from the \nbill.\n  My basic objection, going back to where I started, is, to siphon off \nmoney from the public school system for private purposes is just flat \nwrong. If we have problems with our public school system, let us fix \nit. Let us vote the money for it, not siphon off what little money we \nhave in it now.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator from Connecticut such time as he \nmay want to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nVermont.\n  I rise to indicate my support for cloture on this D.C. appropriations \nbill. I do so because, as most Members in the Chamber, I would like to \nbegin to see some money flow to the District generally for its \noperations, but I specifically want to speak to the reason why many of \nmy colleagues will oppose the cloture motion, and that is their \nopposition to some of the education reform measures that have been \nattached to this appropriations bill. I strongly support those \neducation reform provisions, including the scholarship program that has \nbeen referred to in this debate, which is a relatively small part of \nthe overall District school reform proposals in this bill.\n  I must say that I approach this debate in a very different spirit. We \nhave been through a lot of gridlock, again, in this Congress. Ideas \nthat are new have been talked about. Not too many have made it forward. \nBut I feel a sense of joy, frankly, to have this package of progressive \nand genuinely important reforms for the District of Columbia school \nsystem on this floor for consideration today. It would be a shame if \npassage of these provisions, which could do so much to help children \nand families in this Capital city of ours achieve their full potential \nand escape the cycle of poverty, is stopped because of opposition to \nthis modest program of scholarships for poor children. That is what we \nare talking about. The education reform provisions in this bill were \nnot imposed by our friends in the House from up on high. In fact, they \nhad their origin with a locally based education reform commission that \nwas established in the District.\n  While all of the attention and controversy in this debate and outside \nhas been focused on these scholarship funds which will allow some \nchildren to leave the public school system and go to nonpublic schools, \nthere are a wide variety of other provisions in this measure that \ndeserve to be noted.\n  The so-called D.C. School Reform Act, which is now part of the bill \nbefore us, would, in fact, direct approximately $302 million out of the \n$324 million in new funds over 5 years provided for in this bill to \nbenefit public school students, public schools in the District of \nColumbia.\n  Let me focus on two words. We are talking here about new money. We \nare not skimming money off that otherwise would go to the public \nschools. We are talking about new money and, in fact, all but $22 \nmillion of that will go to the public schools. It is just $22 million \nof the $324 million that are part of this innovative scholarship \nprogram.\n  What else does the reform act do? It permits charter schools, public \ncharter schools, and encourages choice among public schools. It assists \nthe D.C. public schools in establishing a strong core curriculum in \nbasic academics, promotion standards based on a new curriculum and \ntraining for the over 5,000 teachers in the school system.\n  It protects public school teachers from losing their jobs due to any \nrestriction in the number of full-time employees contained in this \nappropriations legislation.\n  It provides for a new per-pupil funding formula to be developed by \nthe District that we think will establish the stability and \npredictability in the education budget as the District cuts its overall \nbudget.\n  This measure provides so-called Even Start family literacy education \nprograms in public schools for over 7,000 families, including 28,000 \nstudents and parents.\n  It provides state-of-the-art security measures for over 3,700 \nstudents and teachers at high-risk schools in the District.\n  It provides work force transition assistance to 27,000 seniors and \njuniors through the nationally proven Jobs for America's Graduates \nProgram.\n  It establishes a high technology training and referral center in the \nDistrict that will serve up to 4,000 18- to 25-year-olds.\n  And it establishes a national partnership with business to put in \nplace computers and high-technology infrastructure in the schools, \nleveraging at least $40 million in public and private resources.\n  That is all that this measure does for public schools and students in \npublic schools.\n  So what is all the fuss about? The fuss is literally the tail on the \ndog here. I gather that my colleagues are opposed to providing tuition \nscholarships to between 1,000 and 1,500 low-income District students in \nthe first year to attend private schools of their choice, religious or \nnonreligious, and those schools, incidentally, have to be located in \nthe District. Over 5 years, as many as 11,000 annual tuition \nscholarships could be provided.\n  Do my colleagues in the Senate really want to oppose legislation that \nwill enable kids from families below the poverty line to receive full \ntuition scholarships of up to $3,000 a year to give them a better \nchance to develop their potential in safer schools? Do we really want \nto stop families that are between the poverty line and 185 percent of \npoverty who can qualify for half-tuition scholarships, up to $1,500 per \nyear under this provision?\n  Do we really want to oppose parts of this bill that would provide \n2,000 to 3,000 after-school scholarships in the \n\n[[Page S1327]]\nfirst year, 22,000 over 5 years to low-income students after school \nprograms, including academic tutoring, nonacademic enrichment programs, \nor vocational and technical training?\n  Mr. President, I cannot believe that is really what the Senate wants \nto do and why we would block consideration of the overall D.C. \nappropriations bill.\n  My colleagues in the Senate are probably not surprised that I am \nspeaking in favor of cloture on this bill and support of the \nscholarship provisions, because I have fought for several years now, \nusually alongside, my friend and colleague from Indiana, Senator Coats, \nwho I notice is on the floor, to create a similar national \ndemonstration program to be available to kids in poverty areas around \nthe country to, once and for all, test this idea.\n  There is a lot of controversy about private school choice. There is \nno controversy about the fact that our public schools are just not \nworking for millions of children in this country. There is no \ncontroversy about the fact that if you are not educated today, you are \nnot going to be able to make it in the work force of today.\n  We are all preoccupied with the Presidential campaign and brother \nBuchanan's statements about economic insecurity. What is the root of \neconomic insecurity, and what is the road to economic security? A \nbetter education. The kids in our poorest school districts are simply \nnot getting that education. Senator Coats and I have offered the Low \nIncome School Choice Demonstration Act in an effort, once and for all, \nto make scholarships, such as those provided in this bill for District \nof Columbia students, or vouchers as we call them, available at between \n20 and 30 demonstration sites around the country.\n  Can anyone honestly say that we are so confident about what our \npublic school system is doing that we do not want to test another way \nto see what effect it will have on the kids who have this choice, who \nget these scholarships, to see what effect it will have on the public \nschools?\n  Senator Coats and I are open to the results. In our bill, we have the \nDepartment of Education doing an evaluation which will help us \nunderstand the effect of this program. Are we so intent on protecting \nthe educational status quo, the existing system, which we know is \nfailing millions of our kids, that we are not even willing to test, as \nSenator Coats and I would do in 20 to 30 systems around the country, as \nthis bill would do in the District, another way to see whether it will \nwork, to see whether it teaches us anything about how we can improve \nour public schools?\n  Mr. President, just take a look at the front page of the Washington \nPost today. Coincidental, I guess. It is a story of a principal, Learie \nPhillip, obviously a fine man, working hard to provide an education at \nRoosevelt High School here in this city. The description is given of \njust the time he spends trying to maintain basic order, getting kids to \ngo to the classroom, keeping children from marauding the halls, \nterrorizing other kids and teachers. There are descriptions of one \nteacher who attempted to get some kids to leave the halls and go to \ntheir classes, getting beaten up brutally--a teacher beaten up. \nChildren are trapped; good children, wanting to learn, are terrorized \nin this school system.\n  Let me read a quote from the Washington Post from another story last \nfall about an emergency education summit Mayor Barry held at Dunbar \nSenior High School on October 8, 1995.\n\n       It was a group of student leaders who came to dominate the \n     summit's main session--students describing life in the public \n     schools in the District as a world in which they constantly \n     go without--without books, without caring teachers and \n     principals, without the training they need to succeed in \n     life. ``Today the mayor has asked us here because there is a \n     crisis in our public schools,'' said Devon Williams, 15, a \n     sophomore at Banneker Senior High School. He adds, ``When \n     school first started in September, it dawned on me that many \n     public schools did not have teachers. I did not have a global \n     history teacher for 2 weeks. If I don't have a book, if I \n     don't have a teacher, what can I learn?''\n\n  Here is a quote from another Washington Post editorial back on June \n28 of last year:\n\n       According to the Washington Teacher Union's nonscientific \n     sampling of D.C. teachers, 45.2 percent of the teachers who \n     responded said they had been victims of acts of violence. \n     Almost 30 percent said threats of violence had kept them or \n     their coworkers home from work. ``Serious disciplinary \n     problems are causing teachers to lose 18.5 hours of teaching \n     time per year for each class taught,'' according to the union \n     president's written testimony. ``Disruptive students steal \n     time away from students who come to school to learn,'' Ms. \n     Bullock of the Washington Teacher's Union testified.\n\n  Mr. President, if this level of fear and violence applies to \nteachers, we really have to wonder and ask what life is like for the \nstudents in the schools who are there to learn. In some schools it must \ntake a great deal of courage just to show up to class every day, much \nless to stand out by excelling academically. It has been an American \ntradition that one of the great strengths of our country has been that, \nwith an education, you can work your way up out of poverty. But now, \nmore than ever, there seems to be a vicious cycle in operation that has \nresulted in a concentration of poor kids trapped in inadequate, unsafe \ninner-city schools, without hope and without opportunity.\n  Families who have money around our country, who are faced with \nsending their kids to schools, such as the one I have described, would \ndo just one thing: They would walk. They would use that money to \nexercise a choice and remove those kids to better schools. The sad \nreality is that families without money cannot do any of those things. \nFamilies that have the money have the ability to exercise a choice. \nPoor families are at the mercy of failing schools. I, for one, cannot, \nin good conscience, accept the continuation of that reality. I cannot \naccept what it means in terms of deepening the cycle of poverty and \nhopelessness for the children of our poorest areas of America.\n  I know that some of the opponents of this kind of scholarship or \nvoucher program are concerned that it will harm public education by \nallowing the best students--the so-called advantaged students--to \nescape from public schools. Mr. President, in the case of this \nproposal, that is just dead wrong. These scholarships will be \ndistributed according to a system worked out along with the D.C. City \nCouncil. In a broader sense, it misses the whole point of what the \nprogram is intended to do. We are trying to recognize that schools in \nsome parts of the country--in this case, the District of Columbia--are \nnot working for our kids. They are not performing their basic mission \nof educating our children. And so we have to give some of the kids an \nopportunity to seek a better way, until we have the ability to reform \nand improve the public schools. And maybe from the lessons we learn at \nthese nonpublic schools, our public schools will learn how to make \nthemselves better.\n  Opponents say we should work to improve the public schools. Of course \nwe should. Senator Coats and I and Congressman Gunderson agree with \nthat. We should devote more time and energy and resources to improving \npublic schools everywhere. And that has been where most of our money \nand effort has gone. That is where most of it goes in this bill. In the \nmeantime, the fact is that poor children, who are average, above \naverage, and below average--it does not matter--will all have a shot at \nthese scholarships in the District. They all deserve an equal \nopportunity at the American dream. Right now, trapped in these unsafe \nschools with inadequate resources, with teachers afraid to teach, they \nare not getting that opportunity.\n  Others oppose the program because it would allow the use of tuition \nscholarships at religious schools. This is an old argument. I happen to \nbelieve--according to what I take to be the prevailing Supreme Court \ndecision of Meuller versus Allen in 1983--that this program is \nabsolutely constitutional.\n  But what is the great fear? Does somebody fear that by giving a poor \nchild a scholarship to go to a religious school, we are establishing a \nreligion in this country? That is ridiculous. We are giving that child \nan opportunity to go to a school that his or her family wants him to go \nto, and that one of the reasons they want them to go there is that, in \naddition to a safe surrounding and a good education, they are also \ngoing to get some values. Maybe that is something we have to learn, as \nwell, from this experiment.\n  The Rand Corp. did an important and revealing study in 1990. It \nshowed that the performance of African-American \n\n[[Page S1328]]\nand Hispanic-American children at Catholic parochial schools was much \nbetter than that of a comparable group in public schools--not skimming, \nsimilar kids, similar backgrounds. It also showed that the gap in \nperformance that exists between the minorities and other children \ndropped significantly in the parochial school system.\n  The study identified several factors in the success of the parochial \nschools they examined. Teachers in the schools are able to provide \nstudents with more personal attention. Those schools had a more \nrigorous academic curriculum. They do not teach down to the students. \nThey tell them that they can reach up. They set higher standards for \nall the kids and, in fact, one of the results is that the kids get \neither to those standards, over them, or close to them. It was less of \na stifling bureaucratic presence.\n  I must say that I have always felt that every time I visited a \nreligious-based school, another key to the success of these schools is \ntheir sense of mission, sense of purpose and dedication to values that \nthe teachers and the schools bring to the classroom and to their \nchildren. Maybe it is hard to measure that, but we see it.\n  Let me report briefly to my colleagues on a visit that Senator Coats \nand I were able to take to a school in the Anacostia area, Dupont Park \nSchool, affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It is a very \nimpressive place. The principal is a devoted woman. We asked her about \nthe educational administrative bureaucracy there--she is it. There is \nno top-heavy bureaucracy. She directs the school and takes care of all \nof it.\n\n  The kids, the demeanor, the commitment, the attitude of the children \nwas very impressive to Senator Coats and me. Their test scores are \nexceptionally high. Mr. President, 97 percent of the kids at that \nschool--and they come from a wide range of groups within the \nneighborhood; some of them from poverty families--97 percent of the \nkids test above national average.\n  We went into the classrooms. The first graders were talking Korean to \none another. The school choir sang a song from Africa in the African \ndialect. Computers--second, third, fourth grade kids working on \ncomputers, studying global history, working with advanced math.\n  The school's annual tuition, well below the $3,000 threshold of the \nprogram of the scholarship program in this bill. We were in one of the \nclassrooms and we asked, ``Do you like going to this school?'' \nEverybody said yes. We said, ``Why do you like going to this school?'' \nA whole bunch raised their hands, and we called on one young man and he \nsaid, ``I like going to this school because our teachers love us.'' \nThis was a third or fourth grader. I thought maybe he would say it is \nan old building but it is very nicely kept. I thought maybe he would \ntalk about the computers or the excitement of learning about world \ncultures. I am not saying there are not a lot of teachers in the public \nschools who love their students, but he has a sense of worth because he \nhas received that message from the school. In another class we said, \n``Why do you think your parents sent you here?'' One girl raised her \nhand and she said, ``My parents sent me here because my mom told me \nthat here none of the students would be carrying guns or knives.'' That \nis the truth.\n  As I indicated earlier, it seems to me there is something special to \nbe learned from the schools. We ought not to cower from them in fear. \nWe have nothing to fear from them. We have a lot to learn from them and \ntheir sense of purpose and dedication, and perhaps in the public \nschools we can build on some of that as well.\n  The bottom line is this: Poor kids deserve the same access, the safe, \nsecure, loving, encouraging environment as kids who have more money. \nThat is what this scholarship program will test and offer to a small \ngroup of children in the District of Columbia school system.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont for his generous gift of time to me.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to \ntake a moment to straighten out the Davis-Bacon problem so that Members \nwill not, I think, be concerned about something that was inadvertently \ndone in the bill, and I am not sure is even there at all. The basic law \nupon which all contracts are considered with respect to the Davis-Bacon \nand the District of Columbia, and that is the Davis-Bacon law says \nevery contract in excess of $2,000 to which the United States or the \nDistrict of Columbia is a party for construction, alteration, and or \nrepair, et cetera, is included under Davis-Bacon.\n  Now, some of you may remember that Congressman Cass Ballenger on the \nHouse side has this dream, and I hope it comes true, that thousands if \nnot millions of dollars will come in from private business and \ncorporations to assist in altering and helping schools.\n  There is a provision with respect to the head of the GSA that says \nthat in the event that he provides technical assistance to these \nprivate firms, that if that technical assistance exceeds $2,000 that \nshould not trigger Davis-Bacon for those kinds of donated services.\n  That is the intention. Some say it can be generalized. I do not see \nhow. Because of that concern, we will take care of that when it comes \nto the final bill. I just want to let everybody know that really there \nis no Davis-Bacon argument in here.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I want to tag on, I do not know if I can \nadd to what was so articulately presented by my colleague, Senator \nLieberman, from Connecticut, about the many reasons why we ought to go \nforward and support this demonstration effort to determine whether or \nnot it is a valid idea to allow students and their parents to make a \nchoice, or at least to have a choice, to attend a private school in \nlieu of the public school education they are receiving.\n  Senator Lieberman and I obviously feel that it is. We have been \ntrying to promote the idea of school choice for several years here in \nthe U.S. Senate, albeit, unsuccessfully. The evidence is rolling in at \na very rapid rate that at least in certain sectors of our country the \npublic school system is badly failing our children. Now, many Americans \ncan opt out of that. They can opt out of that because they have the \nfinancial wherewithal to select a different school for their child if \nthey feel that child is not receiving a legitimate education or an \neducation that will allow them, in many cases, to escape the poverty \nthat they find themselves in. Probably most, if not all, of the \nSenators in this body had that choice.\n  I think that it is important to stress what we are attempting to do \nhere. We want to allow a test of the concept of making assistance \navailable to families and to students who do not have the financial \nmeans to make a choice as to where their children will be educated. \nMany low-income families find themselves trapped in a failed education \nsystem or in a school that is not providing education to them in a \nsufficient way to allow them to escape some of the desperate situations \nthat they live in. We find parents that are pleading for the \nopportunity to have the choice that most of the rest of us in this \nChamber enjoy.\n  This is an extraordinarily modest attempt, far less than what I would \npropose. Maybe it is the only thing that is achievable, but an \nextraordinarily modest attempt to give a few students and their \nfamilies, in some of the poorest areas of this city, an opportunity to \nopt out of a failed system and into a school that they think can \nprovide a better education and a better atmosphere for their children.\n  I ask my colleagues, if you have any doubts about the value of such \nan opportunity, go and visit the school that Senator Lieberman and I \nvisited a couple of weeks ago. This school is located in one of the \npoorest sections of this city, and the vast majority of its students, \nover 90 percent, are African-Americans, many of whom are from low-\nincome families. Their parents have made extraordinary sacrifices to \npay the tuition, which is modest for the education they are receiving, \nso the children can go there. It is one of the most remarkable examples \nof the differences that exist today between private schools and public \nschools in many areas.\n  I do not want to say all public schools are bad because they are not. \nI happen to send my children to public schools. That is a choice we \nhave. If I were living in an area where the public \n\n[[Page S1329]]\nschools were not, in my opinion, providing the learning experiences, \nproviding the education, providing the atmosphere, the safety, that I \nfelt was appropriate, I had the choice, the financial wherewithal to \nsend them somewhere else. However, many low-income parents do not have \nthat choice. They are condemned to the school in their neighborhood, \nthe school to which they are assigned.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. I will be happy to yield at the end. If I had unlimited \ntime I would be happy to yield to the Senator because I know of his \nexperience in this issue and I respect that.\n  There is a school in Indianapolis that exists in the near east side, \none of the poorest neighborhoods of Indianapolis. It is a private \nparochial school. A wealthy individual in Indianapolis who was \nfrustrated over the inability of low-income students to have the same \nchoices as other students put $3 million of his own money into a fund \nthat would pay for half of the scholarships at this school. The school, \nincidentally, charges a per pupil tuition which is one-third the per \npupil expenditure in the public schools. This gentleman decided to pay \nhalf the tuition for low-income families living in the inner-city \nneighborhood of the school to ensure that those families would have a \nchoice as to where their children would be educated. The demand for \nthese scholarships was so overwhelming that the school could not begin \nto accommodate the numbers of students interested.\n  This parochial school had the kind of streamlined bureaucracy that \nSenator Lieberman referred to earlier in discussing private schools. \nThis school has one principal and I think one administrator who handled \nthe book work and so forth. But the remarkable difference between this \nschool and public schools concerned the experience of the students--the \nextent of their education, their achievements, their respect for the \ninstitution, and the involvement of many of the teachers, many of whom \nwere making a great financial sacrifice to teach as part of a \ncommitment and a mission that they felt--it was dramatic difference.\n\n  So, really what is at issue here today is whether or not the U.S. \nSenate is going to continue to insist that the educational choice \navailable to middle and upper income families not be allowed for \nessentially minority, low-income students. And whether or not we have \nan obligation to at least test the concept to see whether or not the \nbenefits that we propose are in fact benefits that do inure to these \nstudents.\n  If opponents of this proposal are correct, that this program will \nundermine the public schools and not be successful at better educating \nsome low-income students, then we will know, will we not? If we allow \nthe District to experiment with school choice, as other communities are \nbeginning to do, we will be able to evaluate objective results. The \nmeasures that Senator Lieberman and I have offered over the years have \nprovided a very stringent accountability and testing of the \ndemonstration program so that this Congress is given a set of data with \nwhich to make an objective determination of whether it works or does \nnot work.\n  I am not sure that it takes some fancy studies to figure out that \nthere are problems in our public school system today, particularly in \nmany inner-city areas, and that there are parents who are desperate for \neducational options for their children because they believe that the \ncurrent system condemns them to a lifetime of inadequate educational \npreparation. Many families are worried that they are condemned to a \nlifetime of living in the conditions they are living in because \neducationally they will not have the tools to allow them to achieve a \nbetter standard of living for themselves and for their children. So \nthis bill represents an extraordinarily modest attempt to experiment \nwith the concept of school choice. I hope that this is something that \nmy colleagues would take the time to examine to determine whether or \nnot we should pursue this type of education reform.\n  I come from an area of Indiana--Fort Wayne, IN--that has \nsuccessfully, for generations, operated parallel school systems. We \nhave a vigorous public school system which we are proud of, we have a \nvigorous private Protestant system--it is a Lutheran school system--and \nwe have a vigorous parochial, Catholic school system, all operating \nside by side. I contend, and I think the statistics prove, that all \nthree of those systems are healthy and are vibrant and are successful \nbecause the competition among the three has caused all of them to try \nto do a better job. I do not know of anything in America, that provides \nbetter quality at a better price as a result of a monopoly, but I have \nthousands of examples of better quality products at a lower price \nbecause of competition. So many of our success stories have come about \nby people trying to do a little bit better than the person next door, \nor trying to do a little better than their competitor.\n  This bill acknowledges this truth about success and says that it is \npossible, as a result of competition, to provide better quality \neducation. If any Senators can stand and argue that the public school \nsystem does not need some shakeup, some change, I think they have not \nbeen examining what is going on in our public schools. All you need to \ndo is ask the parents or ask the students or make a visit.\n  I know the hold of the organized public school lobby is \nextraordinarily strong, but I think their arguments are becoming much \nharder to defend, and I hope we can at least provide this demonstration \nprogram. For that reason, I will be supporting the vote on cloture.\n  I thank my colleague from Connecticut for his articulating the many, \nmany reasons why we should go forward with this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the reason the Catholic and the private \nschool in Indiana next to that public school is vibrant and successful \nis that we are leaving it alone. The duty of the Government toward \npublic education is to support and finance it. The duty of the \nGovernment with respect to private education is to leave it alone. That \nis the fundamental.\n  When you say the question is, ``Is the United States going to insist \nthat the minority student not be given a choice?'' That is not the \nquestion. The question is whether you and I, as Senators, are going to \nbe able to choose public money for private endeavor. I never heard of \nsuch a thing. Is it a valid idea to allow children to attend private \nschools? That is a valid idea. They do it. I happen to come from public \nschools. I had a child in Woodrow Wilson public school and one at \nCathedral private school. The validity is not a question. This crowd is \nwound up in pollster politics and new ideas. What nettles this \nparticular Senator is why in the Lord's world we are not financing \npublic education.\n  Public education is working, generally. There are many examples of \nwhere it needs repair, but I can give you many examples of the private \nschools that are more in need of repair. I wish we had time to debate \nit. But the point is, having dealt with that debate we had around here \nfor 10 years about tuition tax credits, they are now trying to sneak in \na voucher program of financing private education. That is the same \ncrowd that wants to do away with the Department of Education. And when \nmy distinguished colleague from Connecticut says we are not taking any \nmoney from the schools--that is true about the effect of this \nparticular provision on District schools. But, overall, you are taking \n$3 billion from public education and are about to try to give $42 \nmillion to the private schools.\n  I hope we do kill this measure until we take this voucher cancer out. \nIf it worked--I do not think it has any idea of working, but if it \nworked, you have started a multi-multibillion dollar program. If it \nworked in the District, come down to Charleston. I have a lot of good \nprivate schools down there, too. They will want financing and \neverything else. If vouchers work for the private schools, why not \nvouchers for the public schools? That is the one for new ideas--\neducation reform. This is not education reform. Scholarship, \nprogressive--saying it is so does not make it so. \n\n[[Page S1330]]\n\n  I listen closely to the matter of the language and the persuasion \nused here. It was James Madison who said:\n\n       But what is government itself the greatest of all \n     reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no \n     government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, \n     neither external nor internal controls on government would be \n     necessary.\n       In framing a government which is to be administered by men \n     over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You must first \n     enable the government to control the governed; and in the \n     next place, oblige it to control itself.\n\n  And we are totally out of control.\n  We are talking about new ideas--anything--but throw money, start \nprograms. We spent, for the last 15 years, $200 billion more than we \nhave taken in. It is not a question of balancing the budget; it is a \nquestion of paying for what you get. Social Security is paid for. \nMedicare is paid for. Education is not paid for. Defense is not paid \nfor.\n  You do not want to pay the bills around here. You want to, willy-\nnilly, start off on a multibillion dollar program on an idea that we \nare against new ideas--come on.\n  Mr. President, today we vote on whether or not to create a new \nFederal program to pay for private school tuitions. I hope my \ncolleagues will keep in mind our duty in the area of education. Our \nduty to the public is to support public schools and our duty to private \nschools is to leave them alone.\n  So far, this Congress has abandoned public education. I refer to the \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill, in \nwhich the House cuts education by more than $3 billion. The cuts to \nfederally assisted public schools in that bill average over $1,700 per \nclassroom across this country.\n  For example--and this is not the most extreme case--I have heard \nrecently from a principal in Greenville, SC, at Sans Souci Elementary \nSchool. He has been principal at three other public schools that did \nnot receive Federal chapter I money, and now he has taken on Sans \nSouci.\n  ``Sans Souci'' means ``without care'' in French, but that is not the \ncase with this school. Over 80 percent of his children qualify for free \nlunch and 60 percent of the parents did not graduate from high school.\n  Mr. President, one-fifth of the budget at Sans Souci comes from the \nFederal chapter I program. We hear all the time that the Federal role \nis small--and it is on the average--but at the needier schools, \nparticularly at the elementary level, the role is often much greater.\n  Of course, the principal tells me that these funds are absolutely \nnecessary and effective. Last semester he used these funds to hire \nreading specialists for children who began first grade with no literacy \nwhatsoever. In 4 months, these children were reading 60 words and \nwriting grammatical sentences in three-sentence groups. Furthermore, \nthese funds have lowered average class size in his school and allowed \nhim to boost the advanced training for his teachers. I would add that \nthese are exactly the services this Congress would cut in Washington, \nD.C. We will lose basic reading and math services for an estimated \n3,000 children.\n  But, while this Congress proposes cutting services for the majority \nof the children at public schools, the stance toward private education \nhas been the opposite. The Speaker himself held up funding for our \nNation's capitol for 4 months to get a new, fully funded Federal \nprogram for private schools in the Washington area. Not one Senate \nconferee of either party supported this House provision. Chairman \nHatfield, Chairman Jeffords, Senator Campbell, Senator Kohl, and \nSenator Inouye were in opposition. But, through the direct intervention \nof the Speaker, the House would not budge until the Senate took the \nwhole $42 million 5-year authorization, plus full funding of $5 million \nfor the first year on the D.C. appropriations bill. Thus, while we are \nsupported to cut schools like Sans Souci, in Greenville, SC, we are \nsupposed to initiate funding for St. Albans and Sidwell Friends.\n  I have admissions information for St. Albans, for those who are \ninterested. The tuition is $13,322 for day students and $18,856 for \nboarding students, but the deadline has already passed to apply for \nnext fall. The brochure notes that students are admitted ``on the basis \nof entrance tests, academic promise, previous record, and \nrecommendations.''\n  So if your child cannot yet show academic promise--maybe he or she \nwill prove it at public school--keep your $13,000. If your child does \nnot compete well with other children on standardized tests, find \nanother school. If your child has a previous record with spots--maybe \ndue to emotional stress from a divorce or to a learning disability--pay \nyour tuition taxes, but take your child somewhere else. But if your \nchild is uniformly bright, spotless, and promising the school may send \na letter of invitation in mid-March.\n  Mr. President, the duties and privileges of citizenship in this \ncountry do not require a letter of invitation. That is why, from Thomas \nJefferson, to Horace Mann, to Martin Luther King and Lyndon Johnson, we \nhave developed a system that admits all children. So Sans Souci must \nlet in all children, and St. Albans can pick and choose.\n  Of course, not all private schools are as expensive as St. Albans. In \nfact, only 7 of the 51 private schools in Washington, DC have tuitions \nin the range of vouchers provided by this bill. And six of these seven \nschools are sectarian, religious schools. Mr. President, we can argue \nabout what the current Supreme Court says about Federal entanglement \nwith religion, but if six of the seven available schools are religious, \nthere is going to be entanglement. Furthermore, there will be \nGovernment intervention in the independent schools.\n  This is not a theoretical prediction--there is a track record. In \n1989, the Bush administration published a report on educational choice \nin Europe--it was a prochoice document, with an enthusiastic \nintroduction by Secretary Lauro Cavasos. But when you get to page 210, \nin the conclusion, you will find the following:\n\n       Finally, this survey brings confirming evidence to several \n     conflicting positions in the controversies over public \n     funding for nonpublic schools. For those who believe strongly \n     in religious schooling and fear that Government influence \n     will come with public funding, reason exists for their \n     concern. Catholic or Protestant schools in each of the \n     nations studied have increasingly been assimilated to the \n     assumptions and guiding values of public schooling.\n\n  Mr. President, that is from the Bush administration. If you value the \nindependence of the religious schools, if you do not want entanglement, \nthe real-world experience with public funding says ``watch out.''\n  Similarly, with respect to social division:\n\n       For those who fear that public support for parent choice \n     will result in race and class segregation and unequal \n     opportunities, the survey provides confirming evidence.\n\n  That is the studied review from a little more than 6 years ago.\n  Since that time, we also have a program in Milwaukee, WI. We have two \nprivate schools that have just shut down there in the last month--one \nwith the director apparently involved in drugs. He reported that he was \nteaching voucher children and nonvoucher children, but it turned out \nthat all the children were on taxpayer vouchers. Representative Polly \nWilliams, who wrote the Milwaukee voucher program, is calling for \nregulation of the private schools. But the program is moving in the \nother direction. It is expanding, and with less and less oversight or \nrestriction. After 5 years of yearly evaluations showed no educational \nprogress, the legislature has eliminated funding for further \nevaluation, reportedly due to political pressure. The legislature has \neliminated the requirement that schools rely partly on privately paying \nstudents instead of only on Government vouchers. And, the courts are \nholding up the expansion due to the threat of religious entanglement.\n  Mr. President, this is not the fate we want for public schools. We \nhear this cry for accountability, accountability, but in Milwaukee we \nhave gone from worrying over student achievement to worrying over \nwhether they will have a school.\n  And, while these school closings get the most attention, the real \nstory is that attention and support is drawn away from improving the \npublic schools that educate the vast majority of America's children. \nThis Senate should reconsider its proposals to cut public education and \nto start taxpayer funding of private schools. I urge my colleagues to \nstart getting back on the right track by voting against cloture on this \nD.C. voucher program.\n\n[[Page S1331]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article by Al Shanker, that recently appeared in the New York Times, \n``Risky Business.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Risky Business\n\n    (By Albert Shanker, President, American Federation of Teachers)\n\n       How can we improve U.S. education? One answer that gets a \n     lot of applause is to introduce some form of private \n     enterprise. Some people call for vouchers--using public money \n     to pay for children to attend private, and largely \n     unregulated, schools. Others tout charter schools, which are \n     set up under state law to be independent of state and local \n     control though they are funded by public money. Either way, \n     supporters say, we would bypass the regulation that is \n     strangling education. And we'd create competition among \n     schools, causing excellent schools to flourish, good, new \n     schools to spring up, and bad schools to close--just the way \n     it happens in the business world.\n       All this sounds good, but voucher programs are rare and \n     charter school legislation is relatively new. So we haven't \n     had a chance to test these confident assertions against real-\n     life examples of how the market works. Now, though, we are \n     beginning to get some striking evidence about the down side \n     of market schools.\n       In Los Angeles, a charter school for troubled teenagers was \n     closed last year by the district. According to stores in the \n     Los Angeles Times, district funds were used to lease a \n     $39,000 sports car for the principal and pay for his private \n     bodyguard. Expensive furniture was purchased for the \n     administrative floors, and a ``secret retreat'' was held to \n     the tune of $7,000. The district started investigating the \n     school's finances when an auditor found a discrepancy between \n     the number of students the school was claiming--and receiving \n     payment for--and the number that appeared on the rolls. By \n     the time the school closed, four teachers were left to reach \n     more than 200 students, and there was $1 million worth of \n     unpaid bills. The school had a board of directors, but its \n     members apparently did not pay much attention to how things \n     were going with the students--or how the school district's \n     money was being spent.\n       In Milwaukee, two schools in its voucher program for low-\n     income students recently shut their doors, and, as I write, \n     two more are in danger of closing. Competition? No, poor \n     financial management, according to stories in the Milwaukee \n     Journal-Sentinel. The principal at one of the failed schools \n     was charged with passing $47,000 worth of bad checks. The \n     other school ran out of funds and was reportedly unable to \n     pay its teachers for several weeks. The financial problems in \n     all four schools, three of which were new this year, arose \n     when they enrolled fewer students than they had counted on. \n     An official in the state education department said that \n     administrators of the new voucher schools could have used \n     training in financial procedures and school administration \n     but that legislation governing these schools did not permit \n     his department to offer it.\n       No one should be surprised. These charter and voucher \n     schools are the educational equivalent of small businesses. \n     Many of them are new, and everybody knows that the failure \n     rate for small businesses over the first several years is \n     very high. (According to the Small Business Administration, \n     53 percent of small businesses fail within 5 years of \n     starting up, 79 percent by the end of 10 years.) Failure is \n     usually related to what has troubled these schools--financial \n     problems and, often, lack of experience in running a \n     business.\n       The difference is that when a small business fails, it's \n     the owners who pick up the tab. When a voucher or charter \n     school goes out of business, it is the taxpayers' money that \n     is thrown away. But the chief victims are the students; they \n     are the ones who lose school time that cannot be replaced. \n     John Witte, the evaluator for the Milwaukee voucher project, \n     put it this way when a school closed during the first year of \n     the experiment:\n       There are those who would argue that the failure of that \n     school is to be expected in a market system of education. \n     Whether one believes that that expectation outweighs the fact \n     that approximately 150 children essentially lost a year's \n     education is a value issue that we cannot resolve. Whatever \n     one's values are, the price was high for those families \n     involved.\n       The costs and implications of charter and voucher school \n     failure do not stop here. Where do students go when their \n     school has shut its doors? Must taxpayers also spend money to \n     keep public school spaces for youngsters in voucher and \n     charter schools in case there are school closings? If not, \n     would we put them in classes that might already be filled to \n     overflowing? Or send them to a school with available space, \n     no matter where the school was located? Or should we make \n     them wait in line unit the following year--the way voucher \n     and charter schools would do?\n       The people who want us to embrace vouchers and charter \n     schools pretend that doing so is as easy as saying ``free \n     enterprise.'' The failures in Los Angeles and Milwaukee \n     remind us that these ventures are risky--and that all the \n     risk falls on people who have no influence over the outcome.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWashington for yielding me the time, and I reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the conference report on the District of \nColumbia appropriations Bill. I do so, however, with profound respect \nfor Senator Jeffords, the chairman of the D.C. Appropriations \nSubcommittee, and the hard work he has devoted to this legislation. Far \nmore often than not, Senator Jeffords and I are on the same side of the \nissue when it comes to education. Therefore, it is with deep regret \nthat I find myself on the opposite side in this case.\n  Philosophically, I am drawn to the concept of choice. It is one of \nthe precepts upon which the Pel Grant Program is based. As I see it, \nhowever, the problem is not only when but also how we move toward \ngreater choice in education. My difficulty with this provision is that \nit comes at the wrong time and does it in the wrong way.\n  With current Federal education funding so much at risk and with \nFederal education programs suffering such a disproportionate share of \ncutbacks, I do not believe it is prudent that we move in this direction \nat this particular time. Given our scarce Federal resources, I am of \nthe mind that they should continue to be directed primarily to the \npublic schools that educate almost 90 percent of our Nation's \nelementary and secondary school children.\n  Further, private schools today choose which students they want to \neducate. They are not required to accept students who are difficult to \nteach in terms of behavior or educational deficiencies. They operate in \na manner that is wholly different from the rules under which the public \nschools are required to function. In the absence of Federal funding, \nthis may be acceptable. However, if they are to become the \nbeneficiaries of a federally supported scholarship or voucher program \nas proposed in this legislation, I believe we should expect more of our \nprivate schools.\n  It is unforunate, indeed, that there is no guarantee in this bill \nthat students with disabilities, students with discipline problems \nstudents with language deficiencies, or homeless students will have \naccess to private school education. Private schools could continue to \nchoose not to accept them. Thus, these students could well be left in \nthe public schools, and the public schools, in turn, left with even \nless resources to devote to their education. It is a choice program \nthat leaves public education in the lurch, and I fear it would set a \nvery unfortunate precedent.\n  At this particularly critical time, I believe it very important that \nwe continue to devote our resources primarily to the public schools \ncharged with the responsibility of eduating all children, regardless of \ntheir disadvantage, their deficiencies, or their disability. In that \nvein, I would urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this conference \nreport.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 15 minutes and 55 seconds on the \nSenator's side and the opposition has 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise as a Senator who, as a teacher for 20 years, \nspends time about every 2\\1/2\\ or 3 weeks in a school in Minnesota. \nFirst my premise. I think education is the foundation of it all. I \nthink it is the key to welfare reform. I think it is the key to \nreducing poverty. I think it is the key to a stable middle class. I \nthink it is the key to helping us decrease violence in our communities. \nI think it is the key to successful economic performance of \n\n[[Page S1332]]\nour country, and I think it is the key to a functioning democracy.\n  The second point I wish to make. I heard my good friend from \nIndiana--and he is a good friend--talk about the need for shakeup. I \nthink education needs to be shaken up as well, although I wish to start \nout with one point, and I am not talking about any of my colleagues \nhere. I do not mean this personally. But I am absolutely convinced, \nhaving spent a lot of time in our schools, that some of the harshest \ncritics of public education could not last 1 hour in the very \nclassrooms they condemn.\n  So now my point. You are right; education needs to be shaken up. We \nneed to make sure that, first of all, children at birth have a chance, \nwhich means that every woman expecting a child has to have a diet rich \nin vitamins, minerals, and protein, and we cut nutrition programs, but \nsomehow a voucher plan is going to help. Education needs to be shaken \nup. That is right. Children need to be ready to learn when they come to \nelementary school, but you know what. Some of the very folks who are \ntalking about the voucher plan--not all--want to cut the Head Start \nProgram. They do not want to fund adequate child care. We have children \n2 and 3 years of age, as I see with my own grandchildren, that every 15 \nseconds are interested in something new; they are exploring all the \nunnamed magic of the world, but what we are doing, rather than igniting \nthat spark of learning, we are pouring cold water on that spark of \nlearning. We ought to make a commitment to these children when they are \nyoung, but we do not.\n  That would be shaking up public education. It is hard to teach 38 \nkids in elementary school. We need to have class sizes much less. But \nwe have not dug into our pockets to make that commitment of resources. \nWhen kids go to school and the buildings are dilapidated, the toilets \ndo not work, and the heating does not work, it is hard to believe that \nas a matter of fact the adults care very much about you, but we have \nnot committed the resources to dealing with this dreary, dilapidated \nphysical infrastructure.\n  Education needs to be shaken up. There is no question about it. But \nthe problem is the context of this plan. We had a continuing resolution \nin the Chamber a couple of months ago--we are going to come back to it \nagain--outrageous, a 20-percent cut in title I money for kids with \nspecial problems and vocational education and Head Start, and at the \nsame time we are talking about starting on a voucher plan.\n  I said to my colleagues before, I say it again, if you can marshal \nthe evidence that shows me that we have made a commitment to children \nin this country, we have made a commitment to doing something positive \nabout the concerns and circumstances of their lives, we have made a \ncommitment to public education, we have made the investment and then \nthat does not work, I would be the first to come to the floor and say \nlet us try something different.\n  We have not made that commitment at all, in which case this makes \nabsolutely no sense. There is going to be a further reduction of funds, \nand that means what this gets to be is a zero-sum game. I say this with \nsadness to my colleague. It is less money for education for \nmathematics, for history, for English, for language. It is less money \nfor public education for support services for students. It is less \nmoney for public education to recruit and train teachers. It is less \nmoney for public education to reduce the violence in our schools so \nthat we can move forward to safer schools, in which case this plan is \nnot a step forward. It is a great leap sideways. As a matter of fact, \nit is a great leap backward.\n  That is what this is all about. We say to D.C. we will put a rider on \nyour appropriations bill, telling them this is the money and you have \nto spend it for private vouchers. That is unacceptable. It is \nunacceptable because--I do not care how many speeches are given in the \nSenate Chamber--we have not backed up the photo opportunities we all \nlike to have with children. We have not backed up all of our discussion \nabout how the children are the future with an investment in resources \nfor public education so every child will have the same chance to reach \nhis or her potential. We have not done that. So do not talk to me about \nhow a voucher plan is the answer when we have not even made a \ncommitment to the answer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia wanted 1 minute, \nand I would be glad to yield to him.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Virginia 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I first thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom Rhode Island and the manager.\n  I wish to assure the manager that I am going to support him on the \ncloture motion, although I feel very strongly about an issue which I \nwill address momentarily. I think it is imperative that the District of \nColumbia be given its budget. I support the various provisions of this \nmeasure.\n  But, Mr. President, regrettably, certain elements of the government \nin the city, namely, the D.C. Taxicab Commission, voted on February 6 \nof this year to terminate a longstanding taxicab reciprocity agreement \nbetween the District of Columbia and areas in northern Virginia and in \nMaryland.\n  Mr. President, this affects the way we do business here because we, \nthe Congress of the United States, are very dependent on the best \nmeans, safest means, most cost-efficient means of transportation for \nthe many people who visit not only Capitol Hill, but come here as \ntourists and the like. This is an effort by the District of Columbia to \ndisrupt an agreement that essentially has been operating and operating \nfor the benefit of all for 50 years.\n  Mr. President, I am going to fight unrelentlessly. I would seize this \nvehicle, if it were possible, this legislative vehicle to make sure we \ncontinue the practice that has served this greater metropolitan area \nfor years.\n  As I said, on February 6, 1996, the D.C. Taxicab Commission voted \nunanimously to terminate the longstanding taxicab reciprocity agreement \nbetween the District of Columbia and Arlington County, Fairfax County, \nthe city of Alexandria, and Montgomery County, MD.\n  The reciprocity agreement permits taxicabs properly registered in \ntheir home county to: Transport persons from their county of origin \ninto the District and discharge passengers; to pick up passengers in \nthe District and take them to their home county in response to a call \nto a dispatcher at the home county; to transport passengers in response \nto a prearranged trip, and immediately following the termination of a \ntrip.\n  The D.C. Taxicab Commission's action will prohibit all taxicabs not \nlicensed in the District from providing taxicab and ground \ntransportation service of any type which physically originates in the \nDistrict.\n  Mr. President, ending taxicab reciprocity is highly contradictory of \nthe metropolitan area's long record of cooperation on transportation \nmatters. The unilateral cancelation of reciprocity could well begin a \nchain of events that could lead to increased fares in every \njurisdiction, and it could easily result in District taxicabs being \nunable to pick up fares throughout the rest of the metropolitan area.\n  Passengers could find themselves unable to rely upon consistent, \ndependable service from carriers with whom they have grown accustomed. \nInstead, they could be passed like batons from carrier to carrier \nbecause of artificial and unnecessary barriers. This could have a \nparticularly harsh effect on disabled and elderly citizens who rely on \nlocal taxi service to commute to work in the District, as well as \ncontractual agreements by D.C. firms on behalf of their Virginia \nresident employees.\n  I understand that the conference report on H.R. 2546 cannot be \namended. Indeed, at this point, we do not know if cloture will succeed.\n  My thoughts are that this is meant to be a strong advisory to the \nDistrict \n\n[[Page S1333]]\ngovernment and the Taxicab Commission to closely reconsider their \ndecision on revoking reciprocity.\n  As I understand it, the commission decision must first be transmitted \nto the District corporation counsel for proposed rulemaking, and that \naction has not yet happened. There is still time to reconsider a \ndecision which perhaps was made without fully considering what could be \na strong negative impact on their own services.\n  I fear the D.C. Taxicab Commission may have fired a shot, as they say \nin the Navy, without fully considering potential retaliation. If indeed \nVirginia taxicabs are prohibited from dropping off and picking up fares \nwithin the District, what is to prevent Virginia from prohibiting D.C. \ntaxi service at such major hubs as the Pentagon and National and Dulles \nAirports.\n  So, Mr. President, let this be a warning shot across the bow. While \nthis conference report cannot be amended, we will have a continuing \nresolution in the near future which would be an appropriate vehicle for \na funding prohibition on the enforcement of the reciprocity repeal.\n  I would prefer not to take such action. I do not like to interfere \nwith D.C. home rule. However, we are dealing with an ill-conceived \npolicy which would have a detrimental effect on my constituents and \nmetropolitan transportation services as a whole.\n  I look forward to meeting with District officials in the near future \nas well as other Members of the local congressional delegation. Our \ngoal should be the provision of the best transportation services \navailable for each of our municipalities, but working together with a \nstrong sense of cooperation for the common good.\n  Mr. President, I thank the managers.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, last fall the Senate approved a version of \nthe D.C. appropriations bill with no trouble. We passed it here in the \nSenate with no difficulty. Later, the House passed its version, but in \nits version there was the creation of a new Federal spending program to \nprovide private school vouchers to a select group of students. This \nconference report which we are dealing with today creates the first \nfederally funded private school voucher program in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The Senate conferees, Republicans and the Democrats from the Senate, \nwere united in their opposition to the House private school voucher \nprovision. The House would not yield, and for months an agreement could \nnot be reached. The Senate bill did not include, as I say, anything to \ndo with vouchers. We never had an opportunity to address it. There had \nbeen no hearings on this measure in the Senate. But the House has said, \ntake this new Federal spending program with all its flaws or the \nDistrict of Columbia will not receive its Federal payments.\n  This appropriations bill, I submit, should not be used to force the \nSenate to endorse the creation of a new Federal spending program with \ndubious merit. It is no accident, it seems to me, Mr. President, that \nthis new voucher program has been attached to the D.C. appropriations \nbill. None of us have a constituency. None of us are responsible to the \nDistrict of Columbia voters. They cannot punish us or reward us in any \nfashion. We are unaccountable for our actions.\n  Under this proposal, the parents do not choose the school that their \nchildren will attend. The private schools select the children who are \ngoing to attend those schools. This is not a luxury that our public \nschools have. Our public schools cannot pick and choose among the \nstudents. Public schools are committed to providing an education to all \nour children. They have to accept the child who comes to the school in \nthe middle of the school year, the child who comes with disabilities, \nthe child whose primary language is not English. They have to accept \nthe child with disciplinary problems or the child with the low IQ.\n  Private schools do not have to accept any of those children and can \nreject any child who falls into the above categories--does not speak \ngood English, does not have the adequate IQ, and so forth. In short, \nprivate schools have the ability to select the smartest, the least \ndifficult students with the fewest challenges to overcome, those \nstudents with the greatest family support.\n  Jonathan Kozol, the Harvard-educated Rhodes scholar who is best known \nas a teacher, a civil rights worker, and the best-selling author of \n``Savage Inequalities,'' and more recently the good ``Amazing Grace: \nThe Lives of Children and the Conscience of a Nation,'' has been an \noutspoken critic of American education, particularly in our inner \ncities. Yet when asked about private school choice, this is what he had \nto say:\n\n       Choice doesn't do anything for poor children. It simply \n     creates a system of triage that will enable the most \n     fortunate to opt out and leave the larger numbers of the \n     poorest and least sophisticated people in schools nobody \n     willingly would choose.\n\n  There is a myth that poor schools somehow magically improve to meet \nthe competition. Kozol says:\n\n       Contrary to myths, the poor schools do not magically \n     improve to meet the competition, nor do they self-destruct. \n     They linger on as the depositories for children everybody has \n     fled.\n\n  The role of our schools has changed dramatically in the past three \ndecades. Schools have taken on extraordinary new burdens. Today we are \nseeing youngsters with learning disabilities, youngsters who do not get \nenough to eat, youngsters born with drug or fetal alcohol problems, \nyoungsters from totally shattered families. As a society, we expect \nthat our schools will take in these children and help make their lives \nbetter through education.\n  I believe it is wrong to provide Federal dollars to private schools \nto enable them to skim the best students from the public schools and \nleave the public schools with the greatest challenges to deal with.\n  It is curious, it seems to me, Mr. President, that under the House \nappropriations bill, the District of Columbia will lose its $13 million \nthis year, $13 million in title I and so forth programs, yet at the \nsame time this report authorizes $42 million over the next 5 years--$5 \nmillion this year alone. So this is $42 million over the next 5 years \nthat, it seems to me, could far better be spent on improving our public \nschools in the District of Columbia, renovating the shabby buildings, \nupgrading the facilities, purchasing new books, installing computers \nand Internet connections, rewarding excellent teachers. All of these \nthings that money could go for.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude by saying that in Milwaukee \nthey have such an experiment. They have had it for 4 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The results of that have not shown an improvement in \nthose students who come from the low-income schools as opposed to those \nstudents who remained in the low-income schools.\n  This proposal permits taxpayer dollars to be used to pay for \nreligious education. Even if this plan was approved by the House and \nSenate and signed by the President, it would be a long time before poor \nchildren in the District received these vouchers because this proposal \nwould go straight to the courts.\n  On December 14, 1995, I received a letter opposing the voucher \nproposal from a group of local D.C. religious leaders who believe that \nproviding taxpayer dollars to religious schools would damage their \nreligious autonomy, and they agree that it would violate the first \namendment. They argue:\n\n       Public funding will inevitably lead to regulation of \n     religious schools, harmfully entangling the government in \n     religious matters. Currently religious schools are free from \n     government intrusion and may enroll and hire those of their \n     own religion. This independence is important given that the \n     mission of a religious school is to promote its faith in its \n     pupils. The ``scholarships'' will threaten the schools' \n     ability to operate in a fully sectarian manner.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nletter be printed in the Record. I also ask unanimous consent that \nanother letter in opposition to the voucher proposal from the Baptist \nJoint Committee be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Finally, Mr. President, on the issue of federally funded \nvouchers for religiously affiliated schools, I would like to quote Mr. \nGunderson, the author of this proposal. On August 12, 1992, during a \nspeech in the House \n\n[[Page S1334]]\nChamber in opposition to a voucher amendment by Mr. Armey, \nRepresentative Gunderson said, ``Choice which goes beyond public and \nprivate schools to include religious schools, I have to tell my \ncolleagues, raises serious constitutional questions.''\n  The underlying assumption of private school voucher plans is that \npublic schools are doing a bad job and private schools are better. The \nadvantage that private schools appear to have over public schools \ndisappears when students of similar backgrounds are compared. Private \nschool achievement measures at a much higher rate than public school \nachievement because private school students come from much more \nadvantaged backgrounds with higher incomes and parents with higher \nlevels of education.\n  In a report entitled ``Fourth Year Milwaukee Parental Choice \nProgram,'' researchers found that voucher students in private schools \nare not doing better in math and reading than low-income students who \nremained in the public schools. Another study by Bruce Fuller of the \nHarvard University graduate school of education called ``Who Gains, Who \nLoses From School Choice: A Research Summary'' reported that after the \nthird year of the Milwaukee voucher experiment reading scores were \nessentially no different between choice students and similar low-income \nMilwaukee public school students.\n  In 1993, many of those who support forcing this voucher program on \nthe District of Columbia opposed Goals 2000: the Educate America Act \nbecause, they argued, it lessened local control over education. Well, \nMr. President, if anything lessens local control over education in the \nDistrict of Columbia, it is this conference report. It has not been \nasked for by the D.C. school board, but Congress set up a special board \nand a new program for the District of Columbia.\n  Supporters of the voucher plan say the District of Columbia should \nprovide choices to parents. They say the District of Columbia should \nhave charter schools. They call for partnerships between city schools \nand the Smithsonian Institution. The truth is that the District of \nColumbia has all of these things. The District has public school \nchoice. There is a charter school program at a school not six blocks \nfrom the Capitol. Down the street there is a middle school which has \nentered into a partnership with the Smithsonian. D.C. public schools \nare the only public schools in the area that provide an all-day \nkindergarten program, and every high school in the District is a magnet \nschool.\n  Is there room for improvement? Of course there is, and I suggest that \nif those who put forth this plan were truly interested in improving the \neducation of D.C. students, they would provide sorely needed additional \nresources to the public schools here. They would encourage the District \nof Columbia to look at schools and programs that are succeeding here \nand try to emulate that success.\n  I find it extraordinary that the 104th Congress, which is dedicated \nto local control and cutting spending, is seeking to enter into a \nbrandnew spending program to micromanage a local school system.\n  I will vote against cloture, and I urge my colleagues to do so.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n               gunderson's ``scholarships'' hurt religion\n\n       As clergy of the District of Columbia and those committed \n     to the principle of separation of church and state, we \n     strongly oppose the ``scholarships'' provision, advanced by \n     Congressman Steve Gunderson, in the D.C. Education Reform \n     Proposal. These ``scholarships'' will funnel public dollars \n     to parochial and other religious schools, thereby damaging \n     their religious autonomy and violating the First Amendment of \n     the U.S. Constitution.\n       Public funding will inevitably lead to regulation of \n     religious schools, harmfully entangling the government in \n     religious matters. Currently, religious schools are free from \n     government intrusion and may enroll and hire only those of \n     their own religion. This independence is important given that \n     the mission of a religious school is to promote its faith in \n     its pupils. The ``scholarships'' will threaten the schools' \n     ability to operate in a fully sectarian manner.\n       Furthermore, under the U.S. Constitution's church-state \n     separation provisions, government may not subsidize sectarian \n     education. If tax dollars are funneled to religious \n     denominations in the form of ``scholarships,'' all citizens \n     will be paying taxes to support religion. This intrinsically \n     breaches our nation's heritage of religious freedom. \n     Therefore, in the debate over the ``scholarships,'' do not \n     omit the principle of religious liberty from consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rev. Charles Worthy,\n       Pennsylvania Avenue Baptist Church.\n     Rabbi Fred Reiner,\n       Temple Sinai.\n     Rev. Kenneth Burke,\n       E. Washington Heights Baptist.\n     Rev. Eliezer Valentin-Castanon,\n       General Board of Church and Society, United Methodist \n     Church.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                      Baptist Joint Committee,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 13, 1995.\n       Dear Representative/Senator: The Baptist Joint Committee \n     serves the below-listed Baptist groups on matters related to \n     religious liberty and the separation of church and state. The \n     Committee has consistently opposed efforts on the part of \n     government to funnel tax dollars to teach religion, whether \n     couched in terms of direct grants, voucher tax credits or \n     ``scholarships.'' Accordingly, we urge you to vote against \n     any attempt to fund parochial schools in the District of \n     Columbia Appropriations Bill.\n       Such funding mechanisms are unconstitutional. The Supreme \n     Court has struck down virtually every form or direct \n     financial aid to parochial schools at the elementary and \n     secondary levels. Government should not be permitted to do \n     indirectly what it is prohibited from doing directly.\n       It is also bad public policy. This kind of scheme is \n     unfair, engenders unhealthful governmental regulation of \n     religion, endangers public education, and may exacerbate \n     class divisions--creating welfare for the wealthy, while the \n     needy continue to go wanting.\n       Finally, it violates core Baptist convictions that \n     authentic religion must be wholly voluntary. Religion should \n     be dependent for its support on the persuasive power of truth \n     that it proclaims and not on the coercive power of the state. \n     Utilizing the things of Caesar to finance the things of God \n     is contrary to true religion. These principles apply full \n     force to religious education.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this very important \n     legislative initiative.\n           Yours very truly,\n                                                  J. Brent Walker.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank the manager of the bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 5 minutes. The \nSenator from Vermont has 8 minutes 21 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join us in \nassuring that we can go back to the table and pass an appropriate D.C. \nappropriations bill. There is inappropriate language in this bill on \nDavis-Bacon, there is inappropriate language in here that puts \nconditions on a woman's right to choose, and we have heard much over \nthe last hour and a half about the inappropriate language on vouchers \nthat is included in this bill.\n  There have been many eloquent statements by my colleagues in \nopposition to the vouchers, but let us stop for a minute and ask, who \nwins under a voucher system? Do the parents? Do they really get a \nchoice? Not really, Mr. President. The private school administrators \nwill have more of a choice in students that they will be able to select \nfor their private schools, but parents, unless they have the money that \nthey will need, will truly not have a choice. And they will not have a \nchoice if school administrators say ``no'' to their child.\n  Will the students win under a voucher system? There is no evidence \nthat students will win. In fact, in Milwaukee, which has had a voucher \nprogram for 5 years, test scores of voucher students did not rise. \nThere is no evidence that students do better.\n  Will the public schools win? Hardly. We have heard many arguments \nabout the money that is currently out there that will be taken from our \npublic school system that will not be used for every child in America \nto assure that we continue to make sure that every child has the \nopportunity to get a good education in this country. Public schools \nwill clearly not be a winner.\n  Will private schools be a winner under a voucher system? Hardly. \nPrivate schools will have taxpayer dollars coming into their schools. \nThey will then have to respond to taxpayers as to how they spend their \nmoney. They will have oversight and they will have to respond to all of \nus who pay our taxes \n\n[[Page S1335]]\nfor vouchers if they decide to buy equipment or supplies. They will \nhave to be responsive to taxpayers because it will be taxpayers' money \nthat they are using. I hardly think that the private schools will win \nunder this voucher system.\n  Will the taxpayers win? No, they will not. It is merely moving money \naround.\n  If we were to pass a voucher system today, we would have to write a \ncheck for every student who is currently in a private school, in terms \nof a voucher. That will amount to billions of dollars. If we do it in a \nsmall district like the District of Columbia, just take a look at the \nnumber of students who are currently in private schools. If a voucher \nsystem passes, do the students who are currently enrolled in private \nschool get a check or do new students coming in get those checks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 additional seconds.\n  Under the voucher system, no one wins. I think that we need to step \nback and pass an appropriate D.C. bill and remove these riders.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield myself 6 minutes and 21 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. President. What has happened today is \nwhat I had hoped would not happen. It has taken us some 90 days to get \nhere to bring forward a proposition to this body which would keep us \nout of the national debate over the use of the voucher system. This is \nnot the time or place for that. We have a city which needs help, and we \nhave to give it help.\n  So what, in my mind, might have started out as a torpedo aimed at the \nmidsection of public education in the District of Columbia or the \ncountry, now has turned into a small shot across the bow, and there is \neven an opportunity to divert all the powder resulting from firing that \nshot.\n  That is where we are right now. So let us not make this into a big \nnational issue. Let us wait for that some other day, but let us take \ncare of the District of Columbia school system.\n  Let me clarify some statements here that are confusing. First of all, \nthere are no D.C. public school funds being used at all. This is a \nseparately appropriated fund.\n  Also, the District of Columbia sits in an unusual situation, so it is \nhard for us to do anything as a demonstration project in the District \nof Columbia without giving it some Federal implications. We have to \nkeep that in mind.\n  What I wanted to see done, and what we have done in this bill, is to \nmake sure that this is a locally controlled option.\n  There is a nonprofit corporation set up to receive the funds. There \nwill be two different types of vouchers that will be allowed, or \nscholarships, if you want to call them that. One is for remedial help \nand one is for tuition scholarships. So we do not know how much is \ngoing to be spent on each. There is only $5 million, and there could be \nprivate funds to help even more.\n  Also, the private board that is set up will be awarding each \nscholarship, and under the mandate of this bill, they must ensure, to \nthe best they can, that there is a diversity of academic achievement \nlevels represented among the students that receive the scholarships. So \nthe scholarship board will have control over that.\n  The other issue that was brought up is about the ability to \ndiscriminate. The schools cannot discriminate and, again, the board is \nrequired to make sure that does not happen. The bill specifically \nrequires that the civil rights laws be carried out and that they will \nmake sure, with respect to the handicapped, that section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act is not violated.\n  Finally, I believe, and believe strongly, that when the final \nanalysis is made, there will be vouchers, but the pressures will not be \nfor the tuition vouchers--hopefully, there will be private funds to \nsatisfy that demand--but there will be so much need for vouchers for \nremedial help for these kids. We have some 20,000 young people in this \ncity who are in need of remedial help.\n  My belief is there will be such a strong demand on the District \nCouncil to see that after-school vouchers are distributed to those in \nneed, and, hopefully, there will be private funds for tuition \nscholarships so that almost all of the Federal funds will be used for \nremedial help.\n  Let us not make this into something it is not. It is not an attempt \nto try and establish a mandated Federal program. This is a local option \nfor the city. I have no problem with sending a message to the public \nschool system that they better get going or else they may see a larger \nprogram.\n  It has been 90 days. We have gone through option after option. We \nhave had two agreements that fell apart, and we finally reached this \none, which no one who is familiar with it is happy with, which is \nprobably a pretty good solution. The scholarship program is not as far \nas some would like to go toward trying to establish a voucher system, \nand it is too far, obviously, some say, because it is a nose under the \ntent.\n  So I urge my colleagues to take a look at this. Do not get swallowed \nup in trying to make this into an argument about a national mandate. \nLet us take care of the kids in Washington, DC. Let us worry about the \nschool system here and the wonderful things that this bill will help us \ndo to make sure we can change this city's educational system from one \nwhich is an embarrassment to one which we can be proud of again, proud \nas we were in the past. That is my goal, and I am sure the goal of all \nhere.\n  Let us not scuttle this bill, because if we do not pass it, then we \nhave to start all over again in the process of trying to see what we \ncan come up with as a compromise.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture, and let us go on and take \ncare of the city, which is in desperate need of funds right now. They \nare about ready to go bankrupt. I cannot see us taking another 30, 60, \nor 90 days trying to find an answer. Let us accept this one for what it \nis, not for what you fear it may be or for what you may want it to be.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from Washington \nthat 1 minute, 43 seconds remains on her side, and the Senator from \nVermont controls 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \nprivate school voucher plan included in the conference report on the \nD.C. appropriations bill.\n  At a time when our public education system is suffering under the \nweight of draconian cuts in Federal education programs, diverting \nprecious resources to private and parochial schools is the wrong \nmessage to send to our Nation's children.\n  This year alone, the Congress has already cut $3.1 billion from \neducation programs--the largest cut in education funding in American \nhistory. This is money that would help children learn new skills, raise \ntest scores, provide money for college education, and prevent violence \nand drug use in our schools.\n  We should not be taking scarce Federal funds away from public school \nstudents. Instead we should take this opportunity to reaffirm our \ncommitment to reforming our public education system, which educates 88 \npercent of American students. But, this bill would tell our public \nschools and the vast majority of our Nation's children: ``We can't \nimprove our public schools, so let's not even try.'' Well, I reject \nthat argument.\n  Our universal public education system is one of the very cornerstones \nof our Nation, our democracy, and our culture. And this voucher \nproposal would fundamentally undermine this ideal by spending Federal \ntaxpayer dollars for students to attend private and religious schools \nthat are unaccountable to the public.\n  Instituting a voucher system in Washington, DC, would also seriously \nharm most of Washington's low- to moderate-income families, who depend \non public schools for their children's education.\n  Supporters claim that these vouchers will allow D.C. schoolchildren \nto attend better schools. But the fact of the matter is, the vast \nmajority of children in Washington, particularly those who are the \npoorest and who need the most help, will remain in public schools.\n  For thousands of students and their parents, Federal resources that \nare desperately needed to repair D.C.'s ailing schools, provide \ncounselors to deal \n\n[[Page S1336]]\nwith the many social problems that face Washington's young people, and \nequip teachers with the tools they need to educate their students will \nbe diverted to the few who are lucky to attend private and parochial \nschools.\n  Supporters claim that this voucher proposal will give parents a \nchoice on where their children go to school. But, in fact, these \nvouchers will not fully open the doors to private education, because \nprivate and parochial schools will be under no obligation to accept all \napplicants.\n\n  Private schools will pick and choose the best students; and the ones \nwith the lowest test scores, the ones with learning disabilities and \ndiscipline problems, and the ones for whom a $1,500 to $3,000 voucher \nwill not begin to pay the, on average, $10,000 tuition for private \nschools in the District will be the ones left behind.\n  In addition, these proposals raise serious constitutional questions \nabout using Federal money to pay tuition at religious schools. No \nFederal or State court has ever upheld the use of vouchers for \nparochial schools, and I seriously doubt that this bill will be any \ndifferent.\n  Supporters claim that if this proposal passes, Washington DC, would \nserve as an important testing ground for the voucher program. But why \ntest a program that doesn't work and that the American people don't \nwant? Considering the fact that Federal resources are already strained, \nwe shouldn't be using the District of Columbia appropriations bill to \nwaste taxpayer money on bad ideas.\n  Washington, DC, residents, like those in California, Colorado, and \nOregon have voted down vouchers in various ballot initiatives. \nElectoral rejection of these programs may be due in large part to the \nfact that private school vouchers don't live up to their advanced \nbilling. In Milwaukee, where the voucher program has been in place for \n5 years, test scores of students, who utilized vouchers, failed to \nimprove.\n  I understand the importance and relevance of private and parochial \neducation. I am a product of St. Thomas the Apostle, a Jesuit boys \nschool. And, I am very proud that my parents made the decision to send \nme there. But, I am also aware that when making that decision they \nweren't expecting to be subsidized by the Federal Government. They \nunderstood the importance of our public education system and that the \nFederal Government should do all it can to support our public schools.\n  I have long believed that education should be made our No. 1 priority \nin Congress. A strong education is critical to forming productive, \nthoughtful, and tolerant citizens.\n  I have fought to reform our public schools in the past, and I will \ncontinue to do so in the future. However, I strongly believe that \nsending taxpayer dollars to private and parochial institutions will \ndrain already meager Federal resources and undermine serious \neducational reform efforts.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing private school vouchers \nand work to support a bill that provides real school improvement for \nthe District of Columbia's schools.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nHawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nyielding to me.\n   Mr. President, I rise to register my opposition to the school \nvoucher provision included in the pending measure. The conference \nreport to the fiscal year 1996 D.C. appropriations bill contains \nlanguage that would establish a scholarship program for low-income \nstudents to attend private and religious schools or attend after-school \nprograms in religious, private, or public institutions.\n  As a former teacher and public school principal, my chief concern is \nthat this measure would, for the first time, permit Federal tax dollars \nto be used to subsidize private or religious education. This provision \nrepresents the proverbial camel's nose under the tent of public \nfunding, which could lead to the diversion of additional Federal moneys \ntoward private instruction. Worse, it would encourage States and \nlocalities to follow the Federal example, with disastrous consequences \nfor public education.\n  There are no quick fixes for what ails our system of learning. It \ntakes time, energy, and resources to construct and maintain school \nbuildings, to develop appropriate curricula, to hire and train \neffective teachers, to encourage parental involvement, to make our \nschools safe from crime. And it takes time, energy, and resources to \nensure that our schools provide our children with the skills and \nknowledge necessary to respond to the economic, scientific, and \ntechnological challenges that will confront them upon graduation. \nNevertheless, speaking from my background as an educator, I know that \ngiven adequate attention and resources, public schools can and do work.\n  I have no quarrel with private or religious schools. In many cases, \nthey provide a quality education for thousands of young people; in \nfact, we have many fine private institutions of our own in Hawaii. But \nprivate schools are by nature highly selective. They may choose their \nstudents on virtually any basis one could care to name, including \nincome, race, ethnicity, gender, religion, aptitude, behavior, even \nphysical or emotional disability. This exclusiveness guarantees that \nonly a small fraction of school-age children will be able to \nmatriculate in private schools; as a consequence, the vast majority of \nchildren will continue to be served by public schools.\n  Knowing this, is it our place to take away precious funds from the \nmany who attend public schools in order to assist the few who attend \nprivate schools? Is this an appropriate, fair, or wise use of tax \ndollars? How many public schoolteachers could we hire for $42 million, \nthe amount that this program will cost over the next 5 years? How many \ntextbooks could we give to inner-city children? How many school lunches \ncould we offer undernourished kids? How many personal computers could \nwe purchase for classrooms? Most importantly, what would be the long-\nterm cost of this provision to public instruction, if this provision \nopens the door to additional raids on the Federal Treasury in the name \nof school choice?\n  Mr. President, vouchers are the snake oil in the pharmacology of \nAmerican education, a quick fix for an imagined ailment. They expose a \nlack of will and imagination in addressing the real education \nchallenges facing our Nation, challenges which millions of teachers, \nstudents, and parents could overcome in public schools around the \ncountry, if only they had the support we and other policymakers could \ngive them. I urge my colleagues to reject this approach, and instead \nwork hard to improve what we already have, a democratic system of \npublic education that is funded by all citizens for the benefit of all \nAmericans.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to invoke cloture on \nthis measure.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from Vermont \nabout a provision in the conference report that concerns me. That is \nsection 2353(c), which requires that $1.5 million of funds available to \nthe board of education be used to develop new management and data \nsystems. I am informed that the amount required to be used for such \npurpose exceeds the amount of the board's budget, which, as I \nunderstand it, would effectively shut down the District's board of \neducation. Although minority conferees were not permitted to \nparticipate in the drafting of much of the conference agreement, I can \nonly speculate that this was not the intent of the majority conferees. \nI would therefore ask the manager to explain this apparent discrepancy?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin has raised a \nproblem that came to my attention only after the conference had \nconcluded, and in fact after the House of Representatives had acted on \nthe conference report.\n  When this provision was agreed to, and it was included in the draft \nof the education title of the bill that was shared with conferees and \nothers on December 14, 1995, the budget for the board of education was \nmore than $1.8 million. However, I am now informed that at the end of \nDecember 1995 the board proposed reductions in its own budget and that \nthe council reduced the budget and staffing of the board of education \nthat will be recommended to the control board and then to the Congress. \nI did not know of these actions until February 1, 1996, the day after \nthe House adopted.\n\n[[Page S1337]]\n\n  It is not this Senator's intention to shut down the board of \neducation. It is my intention, and I believe of the other conferees, \nthat the board ensure that the management and financial information \nsystems of the public school system be modernized and upgraded so that \nthe implementation of the reforms we propose can be monitored, both by \nthe board and by others.\n  If we do not have accurate and timely information we will not be able \nto achieve the results the kids need.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest to the Senator that since this will \nbecome a part of the statute, that I will seek a legislative remedy at \nour earliest opportunity. Alternatively, I would suggest to city \nofficials that, since it is not our intent that the board cease \noperation, a reprogramming from other sources could be effected so that \nthe operations of the board can continue. Such reprogramming should be \nat levels approved by the council and control authority.\n  I hope that this explanation clarifies that our conferees are intent \non this matter.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nagreement accompanying H.R. 2546, the fiscal year 1996 District of \nColumbia appropriations bill.\n  The conference agreement provides Federal payments to the District of \nColumbia totaling $727 million. The bill provides $660 million for the \nFederal payment, $52.1 million as the Federal contribution to certain \nretirement funds, and just under $15 million for a Federal contribution \nto a new education initiative.\n  The bill is at the subcommittee's revised 602(b) allocation for both \nbudget authority and outlays.\n  I commend the distinguished subcommittee chairman and ranking member \nfor their diligent work on this bill over these many months.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the conference agreement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nbudget committee scoring of the final bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          D.C.

Totals adjusted for\n  consistency with current scorekeeping conventions.                    \n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, given the District of Columbia's \nfinancial problems, it is unconscionable that 5 months into the fiscal \nyear, Congress has yet to approve a D.C. appropriations bill. It is \nequally unconscionable that months after an agreement was reached on \nthe amount of money Congress would appropriate for the District, when \nthe Senate is at long last scheduled to vote on the D.C. appropriations \nbill, that the bill contains controversial and seriously flawed public \npolicy riders.\n  The bill contains provisions that tie the hands of the D.C. \ngovernment with regard to abortion services, and that trample the \nrights of workers. This bill also creates a federally funded, private-\nschool voucher program. This bill takes $5 million away from the D.C. \npublic schools this year and gives it to private schools.\n  Mr. President, this bill is an abrogation of our responsibility as \npublic officials to support public education. It is public education \nthat has, throughout history, made it possible for generations of \nAmericans to blur class and wealth divisions. It is public education \nthat has given women and minorities voices in our democracy, and it is \npublic education that has created a strong middle class. It is on the \nfoundation of quality public education that rests the hopes and \nopportunities embodied in the American Dream.\n  The Washington Post has recently published articles describing \ntextbook shortages, unsanitary bathrooms, and other problems with the \nD.C. public schools.\n  The legislation before us today should address these problems. \nCongress should work to improve the quality of public education in this \ncountry and in the District. Instead, this bill calls on the Federal \nGovernment to walk away from public education.\n  The House-passed Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill cuts Federal \nsupport for public education by more than $3 billion--the biggest cut \nin history. Under that bill, the District loses $8.5 million. Under the \nbill before us today, the D.C. public school system loses another $5 \nmillion this year, and $42 million over 5 years.\n  There are 80,000 students enrolled in the D.C. public schools. Fifty-\nseven percent of them are classified as ``low-income.'' This bill buys \ntuition vouchers for 1,666 of these low-income students. This bill buys \nvouchers for 3.6 percent of low-income D.C. students--or 2 percent of \nthe total number of students attending D.C. public schools.\n  What about the other 98 percent?\n  Mr. President, public schools receive Federal funds based on \nattendance. Under this bill, every child that accepts a tuition \nvoucher, leaves the public school system, and attends a private school, \ndrains funds out of the public school system. This bill essentially \npays private schools to take money away from public schools.\n  In addition, for every 100 students, D.C. schools get a resource \nteacher--like a reading or science specialist. Every child that leaves \nthe public school system depletes the base of students that makes these \nspecialists available.\n  Under this bill, schools will have less resources for the 98 percent \nof children who will remain in the public schools; there will be fewer \nteachers; and the public school children will have less of a chance of \nreceiving a quality education.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the day will come when every one of our \npublic schools is among the best in the world, and when we are \ntherefore in a position to debate the merits of whether or not we \nshould give Federal dollars to private schools.\n  But we are not in that position. And Congress cannot take a position \nof siphoning funds out of public schools.\n  If the authors of this bill would like to bring the issue of school \nvouchers before Congress, then I challenge them to do so. It is wrong \nto tack these unacceptable measures onto this spending bill.\n  It is our responsibility to help the D.C. public schools educate our \nchildren, just as it is our responsibility to help the D.C. government \ndeliver basic services to its residents. Regretfully, this bill backs \naway from the children, and as such, I am left with no choice but to \nvote against it.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the District \nof Columbia appropriations conference report for fiscal year 1996. I \nwould like to recognize my colleague, Senator Jeffords, for all of his \nefforts to move this bill along. Under his chairmanship, Senator \nJeffords has been given the task of managing the delicate balancing act \nbetween fiscal restraint and social responsibility, and as a result, he \nhas been subject to pressure from all sides. As a member of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on the District of Columbia, it has been \ndifficult for me personally to keep the process moving and support what \nI believe is right in this legislation, in spite of what I think is \nfundamentally wrong with this legislation. That is why I supported the \nconference report when it was reported out of the appropriations \nsubcommittee. In an effort to keep the process moving forward I will \nsupport the motion to invoke cloture, however my concern with several \nprovisions that remain in this conference report will cause me to vote \nagainst final adoption of the conference report, even though it \ncontains much needed funds for the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. President, the conferees on the D.C. subcommittee worked \ndiligently to craft a conference report that provided adequate funding \nfor the District of Columbia. Notably, the funding issues were never a \npoint of contention, rather there were several legislative provisions \nthat have been the focal point of all of our discussions.\n  First, the bill places clear restrictions on a women's right to \nchoose. \n\n[[Page S1338]]\nThe final language in this bill specifically makes an exception for the \nlife of the mother, and in cases of rape or incest, but I feel that \neven this language is too restrictive and dictates who can receive an \nabortion and when. This is a role I do not believe the Government \nshould be playing.\n  Second, and most importantly, I have had difficulty with the school \nvoucher provision of this bill. While this conference report includes a \ncompromise on the initial voucher proposal, it still provides $5 \nmillion for the implementation of a voucher program. I have always been \nconcerned that there may not be adequate accountability from private \nand parochial schools that they are, in fact, providing the best \neducation for low income students.\n\n  Vouchers are often looked at as a cure-all for the ills of public \neducation. While I think it is unreasonable to claim that public \neducation is failing our children, I do believe that our schools need \nreform. We need to infuse our public educational system with creative \nand innovative new ways to approach the rapidly changing demands of our \nsociety. Our public schools need to be empowered, not ignored, and I \nbelieve that vouchers would do just that: ignore the problems by \nproviding an out--a choice to abandon the public schools.\n  Our Nation must have a strong public education system, that provides \nopportunities for both excellence and equality. To that end, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in an effort to think of new ways the Federal \nGovernment can better serve the States and the school districts to \ncombat the modern challenges of public education. It is only by \ndirectly addressing the problems, through which solutions can be found.\n  In closing Mr. President, it was clear that the two Chambers came to \nthe table with very divergent views on how to develop this conference \nreport. The conference report before us represents many compromises \nthat were made in order to move this bill forward. However, these \ncompromises represent a conference report that I cannot support.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished majority, Mr. \nJeffords, and minority, Mr. Kohl, managers of the conference agreement \non the Fiscal Year 1996 District of Columbia Appropriations Bill. I \nknow, from 7 years of personal experience as Chairman of the District \nof Columbia Appropriations Subcommittee, how much effort is required \nand how much frustration is involved in dealing with the problems \nencountered in formulating this legislation. It is a thankless job.\n  This conference agreement includes a limitation of $4.994 billion, \nwhich is $154,347,000 below the District's August 8, 1995, budget \nrequest. The reductions contemplated are to be allocated by city \nofficials with the approval of the District of Columbia Financial \nResponsibility and Management Assistance Authority, also referred to as \nthe Control Board, which was established last year.\n  The Senate conferees have worked hard to bring a conference agreement \nto the floor which should significantly improve the education programs \nof the District, including a provision, which I authored, designed to \nimprove discipline in the schools. I understand that the House \nconferees were adamant, in insisting on the inclusion of a \ncontroversial education voucher provision, in order to break an \nimpasse. Despite this, the conference agreement includes a number of \nother education initiatives, which is a tribute to the hard work of the \nChairman of the Subcommittee, Mr. Jeffords, who has spent so much time \nover the past year in an effort to draft legislation which would \nreinvigorate the D.C. public school system. I commend him and encourage \nhim in those efforts, and especially those relating to increased \ndiscipline in the schools.\n  I want to commend the staff of the Subcommittee. Tim Leeth on the \nmajority and Terry Sauvain on the minority are two experienced \nCommittee staffers. Mr. Leeth has worked for both the majority and \nminority and represents a proud tradition of non-partisanship on the \nSenate Appropriations Committee staff. Mr. Sauvain's first assignment \non the Senate Appropriations Committee staff was to this bill in the \nearly 1970's. He has held a number of important assignments since then, \nand for the last 7 years has served as my Deputy Staff Director of the \nAppropriations Committee, a position which he currently fills in \naddition to his work for the Subcommittee.\n  Finally, I want to commend someone who has assisted the House and \nSenate District of Columbia Appropriations Subcommittees for the past \n35 years. Mrs. Mary Porter, an employee of the District of Columbia \ngovernment, has been assigned on detail to the Appropriations \nCommittees for at least a part of each of the past 35 years. Mrs. \nPorter is one of those quiet and competent civil servants who works \nbehind the scenes. Her faithful and dedicated service are to be \ncommended.\n  Again, I thank the managers for their hard work in bringing this \nconference agreement to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in the last few seconds remaining on this \nside, let me just say the Senator from Vermont has done an admirable \njob of trying to get the D.C. appropriations bill through, and I \ncommend him. But I do think, despite the fact that this bill needs to \npass, that with the unnecessary riders and messages and political \nmotivations, now is not the correct way to do it.\n  If we defeat cloture today, we can go back and do what the Senate did \nbefore and pass a D.C. appropriations bill that is acceptable to all \nMembers of the Senate.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, again, I thank my friend from Vermont. \nI associate myself with everything the Senator from Vermont has said, \nincluding particularly the sense of despair, even outrage, that we may \ndefeat continued funding for the District of Columbia which desperately \nneeds it because of opposition to a very small part of this proposal \nthat calls for scholarships for kids in the D.C. school system.\n  I want to suggest in closing that those who oppose the scholarship \nprogram are opposing a false choice. This is not an either/or. It is \nnot if you are for the scholarship program, you are against the public \nschools. Obviously, we are all for the public schools. I am a proud \ngraduate of the public school system. I have supported just about every \nfunding proposal for public schools that has come here and opposed \nthose that have proposed cuts for the public schools.\n  The fact is that billions and billions of dollars of taxpayers' money \nare spent every year in our public school systems. There is almost \nnothing to give the kind of choice we are talking about testing in the \nDistrict system.\n  So what is the big deal? The choice to me is this: Is our \nresponsibility to protect a system, which is to say the public schools, \nright or wrong--and we know they are failing millions of our kids \ntoday, doing a great job with millions of others--or is it to better \neducate our children?\n  This is not just a question of money. If it were, the District school \nsystem would be in better shape than it is, than I described in the \nsentences I uttered earlier on. The District of Columbia public school \nsystem spends more per student than any other State, than any of the 40 \nlargest school systems in America, and still it has the problems it \nhas.\n  My friend from Washington asked, ``Who wins in the scholarship \nprogram?'' I will tell you who. It is 11,000 students in the District \nof Columbia--mostly poor kids, by definition--who, by this measure, \nwill have the opportunity to have a choice to do what families with \nmoney do when their kids are in schools where they cannot have an \nopportunity to learn.\n  Think about it from the point of view not of the school system or of \nthe teachers, but of the parents of these kids. Maybe a single mother \nworking hard to bring up a child can give that child values, hope, and \na future, and this scholarship system is that hope.\n  Are we going to frustrate those 11,000 kids and stop funding for the \nDistrict of Columbia? Good God, I hope not. I am going to support \ncloture.\n\n[[Page S1339]]\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, may we have order, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I understand the will of the Senate. The \nSenate has spoken. They did not desire to pass the bill in its present \nform. I want to make all of my colleagues aware of the serious \nsituation that we are facing with respect to our Capital City, a city \nfor which we have taken responsibility.\n  As I mentioned earlier to my colleagues, we have been for some 90 \ndays or more trying to reach a resolution of this problem. We have two \nareas of different concerns. One is the fiscal health of the city. That \nis in a precarious position right now. I want to make sure all of my \ncolleagues are aware of that. If we do not pass an appropriations bill \nfor the city of Washington in the next few days, they will be \nessentially bankrupt. That bankruptcy will be on our heads because we \nhave not passed the appropriations bill, which was scheduled to be \npassed by October 1 of last year. I want to assure my colleagues that I \nam going to take every legislative opportunity to make sure that the \ncity receives the remaining $254 million in Federal funds that were \ncontained in the conference agreement as soon as it is possible.\n  At the same time, I also believe that it is imperative that we \nmaintain as much of the school reform that is contained in this \nconference report as we can. I will be immediately reaching out to the \nHouse Members to see what we can agree to and also be talking, probably \nmore importantly, to the other side of the aisle here who have seen \nthat it was important to them to prevent the passage of this bill at \nthis time in the form that it is in. I want to make sure that we do \nwhat we can to help the kids here in Washington.\n  By encouraging individual assessments in the other matters in this \nbill, which I will go through again briefly, we provide a way of \nhelping both students and teachers make sure that no child falls \nthrough the cracks. We have a responsibility to see that that happens. \nWe have thousands of young people in this city, because of the problems \nwe have with the school system, that are in danger of either dropping \nout or graduating--if they do graduate--in a situation where they will \nnot be ready to enter the work force. We must do all we can to make \nsure that we take care of these kids.\n  We should also insist upon the independent charter schools as a way \nof providing competition, which certainly a majority of this body \nbelieves is necessary, for the public schools and to give them an \nincentive to change. This approach provides the chance to improve the \neducation of all D.C. students.\n  The requirement of a long-term plan and the Consensus Commission to \nensure its implementation would, for the first time, bring rational \ncriteria to the District's educational policy and goals. The criteria \nwill give the community a measure for the success of these and other \ninitiatives.\n  Greater coordination and cooperation between business and educators \nis essential as provided for in our conference agreement. We will bring \nforth more technology with resources to the public school classrooms. \nThis is imperative if we are to prepare our students for competition in \nthe workplace for the next century.\n  Mr. President, I will discuss with the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee our next move, but I want to, again, ensure \nyou I will do everything I can to make sure we pass it in a timely \nmanner and we do provide what is necessary to make sure that the young \npeople of this city have every opportunity--and we have accepted that \nresponsibility--to be able to enter life with an education that they \ndeserve and they need. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. I say to the distinguished Senator from Vermont that we \nmight file cloture again today and have another cloture vote on \nThursday to indicate we are serious and we would like to get the bill \npassed. So we will discuss that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just wanted to respond very briefly to \nthe comments of the Senator from Vermont. I think all of us who \nfollowed the conference closely understood that it was the sense really \nof not only Democrats but also Republicans in that conference that it \nwould be extremely unwise to add these three conditions onto the \nappropriations conference report. It was ultimately, after a number of \nweeks of discussion and meetings, the insistence of the House that they \nmove ahead and add those various provisions which have been effectively \nrejected here this afternoon. \n\n[[Page S1340]]\n\n  I think it has been very clearly stated that if this legislation was \nfree from those three additional kinds of riders that really are not \ndirectly germane to the appropriations bill, that the legislation and \nthe funding would go ahead on a voice vote.\n  So I am hopeful that we will be able to address a clean bill. After \nwhat I think is a very decisive vote in the Senate, it ought to be a \nvery clear message about what the impediments are toward reaching a \nfinal, positive conclusion. If it is the desire of the leadership in \nthe House and the Senate to really respond to the very critical needs \nof the District, which have been outlined in great detail by the \nSenator from Vermont, we would take the opportunity to remove those \nvarious provisions and see this appropriations bill move ahead.\n  Clearly, if that is not the case, we will have a responsibility--and \nI will join with the Senator from Vermont; I know I speak with Senator \nCoats, Senator Murray, and others who spoke and voted against the \ncloture motion--to make sure that we move this appropriation along with \nthe other unfinished business and the other appropriations as well.\n  That is our commitment, and it has always been our commitment, in \nexpressing our reservations about the policy decisions. It remains our \ncommitment.\n  We look forward to working with the chairman of the committee, the \nSenator from Vermont, in ways that can be helpful to him and, most \nimportant, be helpful to the citizens of the District of Columbia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1339-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1340-S1341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CUBA POLICY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the entire world is now aware of Fidel \nCastro's attack on unarmed American civilian aircraft in international \nairspace. The U.S. Coast Guard has now called off its search for \nsurvivors. Four American citizens have been murdered by Fidel Castro's \nfighter jets. Brothers to the Rescue is a Florida-based humanitarian \ngroup which flies the straits of Florida searching for the desperate \nproduct of Fidel Castro's Communist system: refugees in makeshift boats \nseeking to escape repression. For these efforts, four Americans gave \ntheir lives. It is time to honor their memory with real action against \nFidel Castro's tyranny.\n  The apologists for Fidel Castro have already come up with excuses--\nBrothers to the Rescue had penetrated Cuban airspace in the past, Cuban \nflight control personnel gave warnings, and on and on. It now appears \nthat Castro even has a planted double agent who will perform a theater \nof absurd for the world.\n  But these diversions cannot obscure the basic reality. The reality is \nthere can be no excuse for this act of aggression. The reality is that \nCastro's crimes now include an illegal international air assault \nagainst American citizens. The reality is that the time is long overdue \nfor serious action against Castro's Cuba. It should not take the murder \nof four American citizens for the Clinton administration to understand \nthat warming up to Fidel Castro is wrong.\n  The Clinton adminstration has been strong in its rhetoric. Yesterday, \nPresident Clinton said, the shoot down was a ``flagrant violation of \ninternational laws * * * and the United States will not tolerate it.'' \nBut the strong words were not, unfortunately, followed with strong \naction.\n\n  Yes, President Clinton is taking a case to the United Nations to seek \ninternational sanctions. I hope the Clinton administration has the same \nsuccess that the Reagan administration had in 1983 in building an \ninternational coalition against the brutal Soviet attack on Korean \nAirlines flight 007--under the able leadership of U.N. Ambassador Jeane \nKirkpatrick. The Clinton administration has had no success to date in \ninternationalizing the embargo on Cuba. The Clinton administration has \nspent little time and effort in such efforts, focusing instead on \nisolating and invading Haiti--the poorest country in the hemisphere.\n  Yes, President Clinton suspended charter flights to Cuba. But for \nmonths, the Clinton administration has looked the other way as the \ntravel ban to Cuba has been regularly violated.\n  Yes, President Clinton has said there will be further restrictions on \nCuban officials in the United States. But these officials are already \nsupposed to be under strict control. And the Clinton administration \nallowed Fidel Castro to enter the United States last year--to the great \nsatisfaction of the liberal elite who wined and dined the hemisphere's \nlast dictator in New York.\n  Yes, President Clinton said he wanted to work with Congress to \n``promptly reach agreement'' on legislation to enhance the embargo on \nCuba. But the Clinton administration led the charge against such \nlegislation for more than a year--for more than a year--orchestrating a \nSenate filibuster and issuing veto threats.\n  I hope the President might now join us. There will be a conference \ntomorrow morning on the Dole-Helms-Burton bill. We certainly appreciate \nthe President's support.\n  The Congress is waiting for the Clinton administration to follow \nthrough on President Clinton's promise.\n  Yes, President Clinton said he would support more funding for Radio \nMarti to break Castro's information stranglehold on the Cuban people. \nBut he was silent about TV Marti, and the Clinton administration has \ndragged its feet in making the technical improvements to TV Marti which \nwould allow it to be seen by more Cubans.\n  President Clinton did not even restore the status quo to include \nsanctions which he eased last year. On October 6, 1995, President \nClinton announced a series of steps easing the embargo on Castro's \nCuba. At the time, I said the Clinton administration gave Castro a \npropaganda victory and may have prolonged the Castro dictatorship.\n  There are many unilateral steps President Clinton could have and \nshould have taken yesterday: Announcing serious enforcement of the \ntravel ban, opening a Treasury Department office in Miami, denying \nvisas for Cuban Government and party officials, and increased Federal \nBureau of Investigation actions against Cuban agents in the United \nStates.\n  But the most important step was not taken--an unequivocal endorsement \nof the Helms-Dole-Burton Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act. \nThis legislation was passed by the Senate on October 19, 1995, by a \nvote of 74 to 24 and passed by the House 294 to 130 on September 21, \n1995. The conference committee will meet tomorrow morning to reconcile \ndifferences between the two versions, and I expect Senate action before \nthe end of the week.\n  The Libertad bill strengthens the embargo on Cuba, offers real \nincentives for democratic change and takes real action to deter foreign \ninvestment in Cuba. The conference legislation will enable American \ncitizens to use American courts to pursue claims against those who use \nconfiscated property in Cuba. The conference legislation will also deny \nvisas to officials who confiscate American property. Finally, the \nconference report will codify the existing embargo on Cuba, \nconditioning the end of the embargo on democratic change in Cuba. I \nalso expect the conference report to include a strong condemnation of \nCastro's terror in the skies.\n  I know the conferees are receptive to one proposal by President \nClinton--authorizing the use of frozen Cuban assets to compensate the \nfamilies of the latest victims of Castro's regime. That is a good idea. \nIn fact, the conference may look at other uses for the frozen assets--\nfinancing Radio and TV Marti, for example, or supporting the democratic \nopposition in Cuba.\n  As I indicated earlier, we stand ready to hear from the Clinton \nadministration on the Libertad legislation. I hope President Clinton \nwill finally endorse the tough sanctions that Castro really fears. Then \nthe administration's actions will match their rhetoric.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S1341]]\n\n\n                SOLICITING STAFF FOR RESEARCH DISCUSSION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to take a minute of the Senate's \ntime to comment on a recent solicitation made to one of my staff \nmembers.\n  I was very concerned to find out that a market research company is \ncalling congressional staffers and offering them $150 to participate in \na research discussion on the subject of spectrum allocation. My staff \nwas told that for spending 2 hours discussing this subject, the \nindividual would either be paid $150 or could direct the money to be \ngiven to the charity of his or her choosing. The meeting, which my \nstaff has declined to attend, is currently scheduled for tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I have asked the Ethics Committee to comment on this \ndiscussion group offer. They informed my staff that being paid to \nattend such an event is not allowed.\n  Based on the Ethics Committee decision, I hope no Senate staff from \nany office will attend this meeting. What is so disconcerting about \nthis offer is the idea that staff would be paid by an outside source to \ndiscuss an issue that will soon be before this body.\n  As most Members of the Senate know, the broadcast industry has been \nrunning full-page ads on the subject and is expected to soon launch a \nmultimillion-dollar media campaign to defeat any effort to mandate \nspectrum auctions. I support broadcast spectrum auctions and will \ncontinue to do that. Others oppose my efforts, and that is their right. \nIn the public forum of the Senate, we will decide what is the right \nthing to do. As we debate this, we should be careful to live up to the \nletter and spirit of the gift ban.\n  I do not know who hired the research company and what games are being \norchestrated, but this technique is an insult to the Senate. I hope we \nwill not see this type of lobbying or information gathering again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a fax from Shugoll Research Corp. be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Shugoll Research,\n\n                                  Bethesda, MD, February 26, 1996.\n     To: Grant Seiffert\n     Office: Senator McCain\n     From: Mrs. Day\n       We are inviting Capitol Hill staffers to attend a research \n     discussion on behalf of KRC Research & Consulting, a national \n     opinion research organization.\n       This study focuses on the spectrum allocation debate.\n       The purpose of this group discussion is purely information-\n     gathering. All comments will be anonymous.\n       The group will consist of about eight other Hill staffers \n     and a professional moderator who will lead the informal \n     discussion.\n       The group is being held on Wednesday, February 28th.\n       Please call us ASAP so we can reserve a space for you.\n       Our number is (301) 215-7248.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.  In summary, I repeat that I am surprised that a company \nwould offer staffers what would amount to $75 an hour for discussion of \nan issue that is going to be before this body. I hope we do not see a \nrepetition of this kind of activity.\n  I intend to try to find out who hired the Shugoll Research \norganization to do this, and I intend to publicize that organization \nbecause I think it is an unethical act and one that is far beneath \ncertainly the members of the staff of this body.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1340-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1341-S1343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE PEOPLE'S MESSAGE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, being back in my home State of California \nis always a marvelous reality check for me. What an honor it is to \nrepresent the largest State in the Union, the most diversified State in \nthe Union. We have in that State a tremendous farm community. We have \nin that State the Silicon Valley. We have more students, we have more \nseniors, we have more families, we have more working women. We have \nmore of everything--the pluses and the minuses of America: the wealthy, \nthe middle, the poor; the beautiful ocean, the need to preserve that \nresource, tourism.\n  Mr. President, what a reality check I got. I went home, I went to \nschools, from the little kindergarten to graduate schools, to the \nhospitals, to the chambers of commerce, downtown to the cities, to the \nsuburbs, to meeting with community groups of all kinds, every race, \ncolor, and creed, to our beautiful Pacific Ocean, to our facilities in \nneed of earthquake repair, to our farmlands, to our courts, to our \nyoung, to our old, to those in between. That is why it is so good to go \nhome and stay in touch.\n  I hear one message from everyone. This cuts across party lines, it \ncuts across all lines. That is, ``Congress, get on with your work. Take \ncare of this country. Do not play any more games with Government \nshutdown. Stop being radical. Be reasonable. Meet each other halfway, \nmove forward, do not play games with defaulting. Get on with your \nwork.''\n  It was an amen chorus for me. I agree with that. I told my California \ncitizens, regardless of whether they are Democrats, Republicans, or \nindependents, fighting the battles of the past is not what we ought to \nbe doing. That is what we are doing around here; either fighting the \nbattles of the past--and I will explain what I mean--or we are battling \nover Whitewater, when people want us to take care of business.\n  What do I mean when I say we tend to battle over past arguments? It \nwas during the 1950's that a Republican President named Dwight David \nEisenhower said there was an important role for the Federal Government \nto play in education. He wrote the National Defense Education Act. What \nit said is that we better make sure that our students are prepared in \nscience, in research. At that time, the Soviet Union was getting ahead, \npulling ahead in these arenas. This Republican President said to the \nCongress that there is a role for the Federal Government to play. It is \nimportant for our defense that we have an educated work force, that our \nyoung people are skilled.\n  So we decided in the 1950's that there is, in fact, a place for the \nFederal Government in education. Does that mean controlling what goes \non in the classroom? Of course not. What it means is coming in as a \npartner where there is a critical need. An example of this today \ncertainly would be continuing Head Start, the title I program, and \nputting more computers in the schools. These are some areas.\n  In the 1950's, this role was determined. What is happening now, we \nhave radical elements in the Congress who want to do away with the \nDepartment of Education. We would be the only leading power not to have \na Department of Education, a place in a national government where this \nis the focus.\n  We have people in this body who believe in cutting aid to education, \nand, in fact, in the last continuing resolution that we passed, if you \nannualized those cuts, they would be $3 billion plus. I have to say, as \nI went around to the schools, they are very upset about this, from the \nyoung ones to those in universities. There we are, fighting the battles \nof the 1950's on education.\n  Then what happened in the 1960's? In the 1960's, we decided as a \nnation to start Medicare. It was very controversial at first. The \ndoctors opposed it and said it would be socialized medicine. What is \nMedicare? It is insurance for our elderly. It took our elderly and gave \nthem health insurance. Now our system is the envy of the world as it \nrelates to seniors--99 percent of our seniors have health insurance. \nWhy are we opening up that battle now in the 1990's? You cannot take \n$270 billion out of Medicare and expect it to survive. You cannot get a \nway out for people to say, ``I don't need it. I will set up a medical \nsavings account, drop out of Medicare,'' and the wealthiest and \nhealthiest will be gone and the system will go under. But we are \nbattling the fight over Medicare.\n  In the 1970's, under a Republican President, Richard Nixon, we set up \nthe Environmental Protection Agency because the country believed it was \nimportant to stand up and protect our heritage. The Environmental \nProtection Agency--this crowd running this Congress wants to cut \nenforcement by over a third; some even two-thirds. So we are now \nbattling the fight over \n\n[[Page S1342]]\nwhether or not there should be a national role in environmental \nprotection.\n  Now, in the 1980's, we had a big debate over nursing home standards. \nThere were stories that came into the Congress--and I was on the House \nside--horror stories of abuse of senior citizens; frail elderly \ntragically being abused in nursing homes, whether it was scalded in hot \ntubs or sexually abused and mistreated. We decided to set up national \nnursing home standards, and finally those are being implemented. This \ncrowd in this Congress does not think there ought to be Federal nursing \nhome standards.\n  In the 1990's, we all came together behind the concept of community \npolicing, that crime was a problem, and we thought it was a good idea--\nand criminologists joined us, and police joined us--to put the police \nin the neighborhoods, in the communities, let them be a role model for \nthe kids and reflect the communities. Crime will go down. We are \nbeginning to see it work. There is a move to repeal the crime bill that \nhas the money for community policing, that banned assault weapons.\n  What I have done, just looking back to my lifetime that I can \nremember, is go through the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's, 1980's, 1990's, \nshow you education, Medicare, the environment, community policing, the \nEPA, and show you how this Republican Congress is bogged down in the \nbattles of the past. We do not have to refight these battles, my \nfriends. What we need to do is meet each other halfway when we disagree \non budget issues and move forward.\n  Now, here is another area that is being brought up for a new battle. \nIt is a painful issue. It is a difficult issue. And it is yet another \nthat is dragging us back to the future and stopping us from getting \nready for the next century--that my people in California want us to get \nready for.\n  In 1973 the Supreme Court decided Roe versus Wade. It basically said \na woman has a right to choose, it falls into the privacy provisions of \nthe Constitution, and in the beginning of her pregnancy it is her right \nand her choice. Roe versus Wade goes on to say that later on in the \npregnancy the State has an interest and can legislate. Why are we \nreopening that issue? Day in and day out, it is holding up bills on \nthis floor. Why not let Roe versus Wade be the law of the land and move \non? We are never going to agree on every detail. But get the Government \nout of this and let the American people, in the privacy of their own \nhomes and their own communities and their own churches and their own \nfamilies, decide this difficult issue. But, no, we bring it up here, \nday after day, and it stops us from moving forward what we really need \nto do here, which is to agree on how to balance this budget, how to do \nit in a fair way, and get ready for the next century.\n  Now we have a major Presidential candidate vowing to make abortion \nillegal--illegal--in cases of rape. In the 1980's, I wrote an amendment \non the House side that passed. It was a close vote. It was the Boxer \namendment, and it said that States in fact would pay for abortions of \nwomen in poverty who were the victims of rape or incest. I mean, if we \ncannot agree on anything else, can we not agree as human beings, men \nand women together, reasonable people with a conscience, that we should \nnot force a woman to bear the child of a rapist? How radical are we \ngoing to get?\n  I remember the Willie Horton ads that were used against a Democratic \ncandidate for President. Are these candidates saying force a woman to \nhave that rapist's child? Is that where we are heading? And why are we \nbringing this up, day after day? It is even an issue on the D.C. bill \nthat we just refused to end debate on. That is one of the reasons. We \nhave work to do. Why are we reopening these tough battles of the past \nwhen we should, in fact, move on and do our work? We can have the most \nsuccessful America ever because we are the greatest country in the \nworld. We have the most productive workers in the world. If we can stop \nthese battles of the past.\n  I also think, if we could hold off on tax cuts to the wealthiest \namong us, the fight over balancing the budget would be easy. We would \nhave much less to disagree about. Why can we not agree that people who \nearn over $200,000, who do fine, thank you very much, can wait until \nthe budget is actually in balance and then we will look at tax cuts for \nthe very wealthiest? You hear so much today about the average worker \nfalling behind, and this crowd wants to give huge tax breaks to the \nrichest. They cannot even wait until the budget is balanced. Set that \naside. Then let us take our spending issues, meet each other halfway, \nand move on.\n  Let us address the issues of worker insecurity. President Clinton and \nSecretary Robert Reich have been speaking about worker insecurity for \nyears. I remember the President telling workers in California, several \nyears ago, that many of them will have as many as seven or eight jobs \nin a lifetime, and why it is so crucial for them to have the very best \neducation, so they would get the very best jobs and have a chance at \nthe very best worker retraining and be able to get health insurance \nthat is portable, meaning they can take it with them from job to job, \nand make sure the companies cannot raid their pensions, that they can \nhave portable pensions as well.\n\n  Senator Kennedy has talked about solid financial incentives to those \nwho keep good jobs in this Nation. In other words, companies that keep \nthe jobs here, give them incentives. We should move on that now. \nPresident Clinton has said let us give a break to families to help them \neducate their children. We have the ability. Senator Dole has recently, \non the campaign trail, talked about the average worker falling behind. \nWe have the elements of being able to put together a package here that \ncan make life better for our people if we stop battling the battles of \nthe past, wasting our time on a political witch hunt in Whitewater, and \nget on with our work. We have trade agreements that need to be \nenforced. Exports are crucial. And, as President Clinton once told me, \nAmerica needs new customers. That is what we need. But we have to be \nvery strong. We have to stand up to whatever nation would put barriers \nin the way of our exports.\n  We are the most creative in the workplace, from farm exports to \nsemiconductors to entertainment to pharmaceuticals--even cars. We are \nbeginning to see our car exports go up. All of our exports are growing. \nTo put a barrier around our country would be the wrong thing to do. It \nis acting like a frightened person. We have nothing to be afraid of \nwith our country sporting the best and most productive work force in \nthe world and all the business that we need to really move out.\n  I agree with our President that in between unfettered free trade and \nisolationism there is fair trade, which our country must aggressively \npursue. I am the ranking member on a committee that Senator Bond chairs \non international finance. We know how important it is, how crucial it \nis that we stand behind our trade agreements. We have problems going on \nin China, where they are pirating our CD's and our laser discs. This is \na problem. The way to resolve it is to enforce that agreement. Enforce \nthat agreement, not decide we are going to give up on exporting to \nChina where, by the way, the Chinese buy 5 billion movie tickets a year \ncompared to 1.2 billion a year in America.\n  So we have much to do. I get very excited about coming back to work \nwhen I have come back from my State because the people are telling me \nwhat they need from us and I know we can do it. I am so disappointed we \nare now moving into this Whitewater matter instead of some things we \nought to have on our plate. We ought to agree, close down that \nWhitewater investigation. Give it a reasonable amount of time, take it \nout of the realm of politics, and let the special counsel do his work. \nThere is no limit on him. He can go on as long as he wants. He has 100 \nagents on the case and 30 lawyers. The fact of the matter is we are \njust duplicating the work of the special counsel because somebody over \nthere thinks they are going to bring the President down with something \nembarrassing or hurt the First Lady.\n  The country is disgusted with it. I am not saying everybody, but I \nthink the vast majority of people when asked say it has turned into a \npolitical witch hunt. We should be better than that. We have so much to \ndo. We have to get computers into the classrooms and into the homes of \nAmerica. I am working on a bill, a bipartisan effort to get that done. \n\n[[Page S1343]]\n\n  We should increase the minimum wage that is at a 40-year low, if we \nwant to do something to help working people stop falling behind. And \npeople who think it is just teenagers who hold those jobs, I want to \ncorrect the record. People support their families on the minimum wage. \nThat is the fact. And they cannot live at this minimum wage.\n  Yesterday, it may have been the day before, in California, \nconstruction workers rallied in the streets of Los Angeles by the \nthousands. Our Governor in California has decided to refigure the way \nconstruction workers are paid. They are supposed to be paid prevailing \nwages on State contracts. That means the average of the wages in the \narea. He wishes to mess with that formula, if you will. He has directed \na committee to change that formula so that construction workers get 20 \npercent less pay.\n  Is that what we ought to be doing at a time when we are all growing \nto the realization that workers are stagnating? We should be supporting \nprevailing wage laws. One of the reasons many of us voted against this \nD.C. bill is not only because it attacks a woman's right to choose, but \nit would in fact walk away from prevailing wages, and it would say to \nthe city of the District of Columbia forget it; just pay whatever the \ngoing will bear. And that will thrust people into poverty.\n  Let us reach across party lines and work for the American people. \nThey deserve it, and they expect it from us. So I think instead of us \ncoming together on the next thing on our agenda, fighting over \nWhitewater, we should be sitting here debating how we can make sure \nthat as we go into the next century we have the most educated kids, the \nstrongest families, the lowest amount of crime that we can bring to our \ncommunities, the best environmental protection, and cleaning up \nSuperfund sites.\n  I visited a site, Mr. President, San Bernardino, CA, that got caught \nin this continuing resolution because the funds were frozen. If we do \nnot move soon on that Superfund site, the drinking water of 600,000 San \nBernardino residents is going to be poisoned. It is called the Newmark \nSuperfund site.\n  We should stop playing games here. Now, I heard that there is some \nprogress, that in fact the appropriations committee leaders on both \nsides of the aisle got together and they are working to resolve these \nmatters. But my message today is let us reach across those party lines \nand get our work done. The people who drink out of the water in San \nBernardino, they are of every political party. This is not about \npolitics. This is about doing our job.\n  So we need to pass a balanced budget, to meet each other halfway and \nget it done. Put off the tax cut to the wealthiest, and we can get it \ndone.\n  We need a clean debt ceiling so we make sure that the greatest \ncountry in the world does not default on its debt.\n  We need a trade strategy, an economic strategy to lift our people up. \nWe are hearing now across party lines that this is something we should \nbe doing. Let us not let this moment pass. We can do it. You and I have \nworked on some things in the farm bill where we crossed over our \ndivisions on a number of issues, joining together. What we did is going \nto make life better for family farmers. I think we can do that.\n  Transportation and infrastructure is required to move goods through \nour Nation. I went down to the San Diego border. There is tremendous \ntrade as a result of NAFTA. Now, I was not a NAFTA fan, and I have a \nlot of problems with NAFTA. But I vowed, even though I did not support \nit because of the wage disparity and environmental problems and labor \nstandards I did not like, that I was going to make it work. We know \nthere are ways to make it work. We need an infrastructure bill so that \nwe can stand behind trade and make it work, because to get the goods \ninto our country or shipping them out, they have to be able to move.\n  A lot of our local governments want loan guarantees from us. They \nwill raise the money. Loan guarantees can make it work without putting \ntaxpayers unduly at risk.\n  So, in any event, Mr. President, I wanted to use this opportunity to \nkind of give to the Senate and for the Record my state of mind at this \npoint as I come back from a very in-depth visit to my home State, to \ngive a reality check for all of us.\n  To sum it up very succinctly, the people want us to meet each other \nhalfway on our differences and move forward, because a lot of people in \ntoday's economy are not moving forward. They are standing still.\n  If we have the will, we can turn it around. I think there is enough \nsentiment in this body across party lines that I have heard from the \nmajority leader, the Democratic leader, and others in this body, from \nSenator Kennedy to Senator Jeffords to others, that we can reach out to \nmake life better for our people. Instead of taking up these issues that \ndivide us, that are political, that everyone knows have political \nmotivation, let us start working for the people we represent.\n  I thank the Chair very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The gallery will refrain from making comment \non Members' speeches.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nshall object in just a moment, I just want to point out that the \nDemocratic leader has made a proposal with respect to continuing the \nWhitewater inquiry for a limited period of time. We think at a minimum, \nas a courtesy, that proposal needs to be responded to and addressed.\n  Second, we have no idea what the D'Amato amendment is that is \ncontained in this proposal.\n  Third, this provides for moving to immediate passage without an \nopportunity for sufficient debate, in our view, to explore all of the \nimplications.\n  Therefore, for all of these reasons, but particularly because of the \nproposal put forward by the Democratic leader earlier this afternoon, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I note that under the consent that was \nsought, the distinguished Democratic leader or his designee would be \nrecognized to offer an amendment, and I am sure under this arrangement \nhe would have done so and we would have had a way to have both points \nof view considered.\n  However, I understand the objection, and I know there will continue \nto be discussion between the leaders on how this matter can be \naddressed. That would be considered further. \n\n[[Page S1344]]\n\n  In light of that objection just heard, I make the same request for \nthe legislation to be the pending business on Wednesday, February 29, \nat 10:30 a.m. under the same restraints as the previous concept \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, for the same reasons already advanced to \nthe previous request, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1343-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

A bill to provide Federal contracting opportunities for \nsmall business concerns located in historically underutilized business \nzones, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n                        The HUBZone Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure called \nthe HUBZone Act of 1996. The purpose underlying this bill is to create \nnew opportunities for growth through small business opportunities in \ndistressed urban and rural communities which have suffered economic \ndecline. This legislation will provide for an immediate infusion of \ncash and the creation of new jobs in our Nation's economically \ndistressed areas.\n  During the 8 years I served as Governor of Missouri, I met frequently \nwith community leaders who were seeking help in attracting businesses \nand jobs to their cities and towns. We tried various programs. The \nenterprise zone concept met with some limited success in Missouri but \nthe concept was good. Our incentives were limited to State tax relief, \nwhich was not a very significant element, but I believe that the idea \nof providing incentives for locating businesses in areas of high \nunemployment makes sense.\n  Now, in my position representing my State and serving as chairman of \nthe Committee on Small Business, I continue to receive pleas for help. \nWe have not yet found the perfect formula to bring economic hope and \nindependence to these communities. But I believe we are working on it. \nI think we are on the right track.\n  The message for help has changed somewhat. Although help has been \nforthcoming from the Federal Government, high unemployment and poverty \nremain. One community leader, for example, has stressed to me that his \ncity has all the job training funds it is capable of using. He said, \n``Don't send us any more training funds. Send us some jobs.'' What the \ncity, the inner city, and people there need is more jobs.\n  Too many of our Nation's cities and rural areas have suffered \neconomic decline while others have prospered often with Federal \nassistance. In October of last year, I chaired a hearing before the \nSenate Committee on Small Business on ``Revitalizing America's Rural \nand Urban Communities.'' We heard insightful testimony about the \nimportance of changing the U.S. Tax Code, for example, and providing \nother incentives to attract businesses to the communities in need of \neconomic opportunity. Their recommendations have merit, and I urge my \ncolleagues in the committees with jurisdiction over appropriate \nlegislation to take swift action to bring these legislative changes to \nthe Senate floor.\n  What distinguishes the HUBZone Act of 1996 from other excellent \nproposals is that there is an immediate impact this bill can have on \neconomically distressed communities. The HUBZone proposal would benefit \nentire communities by creating meaningful incentives for small \nbusinesses to operate and provide employment within America's most \ndisadvantaged inner-city neighborhoods and rural areas.\n  Specifically, the HUBZone Act of 1996 creates a new class of small \nbusinesses eligible for Federal Government contract set-asides and \npreferences. To be eligible, a small business must be located in a \nhistorically underutilized business zone--that is the basis for the \nacronym ``HUBZone''--and not less than 35 percent of its work force \nwould have to reside in a HUBZone.\n  I will contrast the HUBZone proposal in this legislation today with a \ndraft Executive order that is being circulated by the Clinton \nadministration to establish an empowerment contracting program. I \ncommend the President and the administration for focusing on the value \nof targeting Federal Government assistance to low-income communities. \nHowever, I think that program falls short of meeting the goal of \nhelping low-income communities and its residents.\n  For example, under the President's proposal, any business, large or \nsmall, located in a low-income community would qualify for a valuable \ncontracting preference, even if it does not employ one resident of the \ncommunity. This is clearly a major deficiency or loophole when trying \nto assist the unemployed and underemployed who live in those target \nareas. A further weakness in the President's proposal is the failure to \ndefine clearly and objectively the criteria which makes a community \neligible for his program. We need to avoid creating a new Federal \nprogram that ends up helping well-off individuals and companies while \nfailing to have a significant impact on the poor.\n  The HUBZone Act of 1996 makes the contracting preference available \nonly if the small business is located in the economically distressed \narea and employs 35 percent of its work force from a HUBZone. That is a \nsignificant difference. It is one that is clearly designed to attack \ndeep-seated poverty in geographic locations within the United States.\n  To qualify for the program, the small business would have to certify \nto the Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration that it \nis located in a HUBZone and that it will comply with certain rules \ngoverning subcontracting. In addition, a qualified small business must \nagree to perform at least 50 percent of the contract in a HUBZone \nunless the terms of the contract require that the efforts be conducted \nelsewhere; in other words, a service contract requiring the small \nbusiness' presence in Government-owned or leased buildings, for \nexample. In the latter case, no less than 50 percent of the contract \nwould have to be performed by employees of the eligible small business.\n  Mr. President, the HUBZone Act of 1996 is designed to cut through \nGovernment redtape while stressing a streamlined effort to place \nGovernment contracts and new jobs in economically distressed \ncommunities.\n  Many of my colleagues are familiar with the SBA's 8(a) minority small \nbusiness program and some of the rules which are cumbersome for small \nbusinesses seeking to qualify for the program. Typically, an 8(a) \nprogram applicant has to hire a lawyer to help prepare the application \nand shepherd it through the SBA procedure, which can often take months. \nIn fact, Congress was forced to legislate the maximum time the agency \ncould review an application as a last-ditch effort to speed up the \nprocess. Today, it still takes the SBA at least 90 days, the statutory \nmaximum, to review an application.\n  The HUBZone Act of 1996 is specifically designed to avoid \nbureaucratic roadblocks that have delayed and discouraged small \nbusiness from taking advantage of Government programs. Simply put, if \nyou are a small business located in the HUBZone, employing people from \na HUBZone, you are eligible. Once eligible, the small business notifies \nthe SBA of its participation in the HUBZone program, and it is \nqualified to receive Federal Government contract preferences.\n  Our goal in introducing this measure is to have new Government \ncontracts being awarded to small businesses in economically distressed \ncommunities. Therefore, we have included some ambitious goals for each \nGovernment agency. In 1997, 1 percent of the total value of all prime \nGovernment contracts would be awarded to small businesses located in \nHUBZones. The goal would increase to 2 percent in 1998, 3 percent in \n1999, and 4 percent in 2000 and each succeeding year.\n  HUBZone contracting is a bold undertaking. Passage of the HUBZone Act \nwould create hope for inner cities and distressed rural areas that have \nlong been ignored. Most importantly, passage of the HUBZone bill will \ncreate hope for the hundreds of thousands of unemployed or \nunderemployed people who long ago thought our country had given up on \nthem. This hope is tangible; it is jobs and income.\n  We are going to be holding hearings before the Committee on Small \nBusiness on the HUBZone Act of 1996 and the role our Nation's small \nbusiness community can play in revitalizing our distressed cities and \nrural communities. I really think the HUBZone proposal has great merit. \nI ask my colleagues to look at it, offer comments, \n\n[[Page S1347]]\nif you agree with what we are trying to do, the goal of this program \nand its objective. I welcome cosponsors. I welcome constructive \ndiscussion and input from those who have an interest in seeing economic \nopportunity brought back to inner-city areas and distressed rural \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na section-by-section analysis of its provisions be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1574\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve rail transportation safety, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                      The Rail Safety Act of 1996\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation, \nthe Rail Safety Act of 1996, to improve railroad safety.\n  Mr. President, over the last 2 weeks, there has been a rash of \nrailroad accidents, including two involving large numbers of \npassengers. The first of these accidents occurred in my home State of \nNew Jersey on Friday, February 9. In the middle of the morning rush \nhour, two New Jersey Transit commuter trains collided outside of \nSecaucus, NJ. The crash killed two engineers and one passenger, and \ninjured more than 235 others. The trains were carrying more than 700 \npassengers combined, and the death and injury toll easily could have \nbeen much higher.\n  One week later, right here in the Capital area, 11 people lost their \nlives when a Maryland commuter train collided with an Amtrak train.\n  These accidents have revealed significant gaps in rail safety and the \nfailure to use existing technology to improve safety. I personally \nvisited the site of the New Jersey crash and was chilled by the \ndevastation. There is no way that one could see what happened in New \nJersey and Maryland without feeling a great sense of responsibility \nabout the need to improve the safety of our rail system.\n  Each day, over half a million Americans use commuter railroads to get \nto work. Each year, Amtrak carries an additional 22 million passengers \non its national routes. In addition to those who take the train are the \nmillions of Americans who live near congested freight train routes \nwhich pose their own dangers during accidents, such as spills of \nhazardous materials and fires.\n  I recognize that passenger rail service is among the safest forms of \ntravel. And I think it important that we not scare the public into \nbelieving otherwise. At the same time, in my view, there is much we \nshould be doing to make rail service more safe.\n  Just consider our Nation's commitment to rail safety compared to our \ncommitment to safety on commercial aircraft, which have the better \nsafety \n\n[[Page S1350]]\nrecord. On planes, there are elaborate safety procedures for each \nflight. Flight attendants explain emergency measures at the beginning \nof each trip. Automatic emergency mechanisms are required in each \nplane, highly sophisticated technology tells pilots when problems arise \nand emergency exits are well identified and easy to operate.\n  By contrast, many of today's railroad safety signals and procedures \ndate back almost to the last century. For some reason, the \ntechnological revolution seems to have left rail safety back at the \nstation. Compounding matters, much of our railroad regulatory system \nhas been unchanged for decades.\n  Congress should act promptly to address this problem. We need to \nreview a wide variety of laws and regulations, with one overriding \nphilosophy: The safety of our Nation's rail passengers must come first.\n  Just because railroad passengers only ride 32 inches off the ground \ndoes not mean they deserve less attention or protection than those who \nride 32,000 feet above the ground. That does not mean we should rush to \nimpose unrealistic mandates that would drive up costs beyond the \ncapacity to support changes. But, it still requires that we search for \nways to take on the issues that have been allowed to drag on for too \nmany years, while rail passengers continue to be exposed to danger \nunnecessarily.\n  The Rail Safety Act of 1996 proposes important steps that I think we \nshould take immediately.\n  One of the most critical matters that we should address is the \ncurrent law that establishes the hours of service that rail engineers \nmay work. This law was developed in 1907 and has changed very little \nover the past 90 years. Under the law, it is perfectly legal for a \nlocomotive engineer to work 24 hours in a 32-hour period.\n  Mr. President, those kinds of hours, combined with the demands and \nstresses of an engineer's job, is a recipe for disaster. We would never \nallow pilots or truck drivers to work these kinds of hours; \nrestrictions on these operators are severe. Yet engineers, who are \nresponsible for hundreds and hundreds of people at a time, continue to \nwork under these archaic rules.\n  The Federal Railroad Administration is in the process of studying the \nissue of fatigue, as is the industry. But those studies could be years \nfrom completion. The adverse effect of fatigue on the ability of an \nindividual to perform their job is well documented. We should act now. \nI believe the FRA should have the ability to regulate hours of service \nfor railroad engineers. The FAA has authority to regulate hours of \nservice for pilots and the Office of Motor Carriers has the authority \nto regulate hours of service for commercial drivers. Why should the \nrailroad industry be treated differently?\n  My legislation would direct the Federal Railroad Administration, not \nlater than 180 days after enactment of the bill, to promulgate \nregulations concerning limitations on duty hours of train employees. \nThe bill does not prejudge the FRA's process. It encourages FRA to \ndevelop regulations in a negotiated rulemaking process so that the \ninterests of all parties are fully represented. My bill protects \nrailroad employees by prohibiting any FRA rules from being less \nstringent than the current hours of service law. This provision will \nensure that a future Administration could not abuse its discretion by \nactually increasing the burdens on engineers, contrary to congressional \nintent.\n  Beyond changing the hours of service requirements, we need to explore \nways to use technology to prevent rail accidents. For more than 75 \nyears, automatic train control systems have been available that can \nwarn engineers about a missed signal and automatically stop the train. \nThese systems are right in the train cab. Both visually and audibly \nthese automatic train control systems remind the engineer about their \nlatest signal. In fact, such systems were installed on virtually our \nentire rail network years ago. Unfortunately, that technology has been \nremoved from most tracks, and no related technology was in place to \nprevent the accidents in New Jersey and Maryland. This situation cannot \nbe allowed to continue.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that we should be careful before mandating \nthe automatic train control system if more advanced, satellite-based \ntechnology will be available in the immediate future. But, we cannot \ncontinue to drift. Therefore, my bill directs the FRA, not later than 1 \nyear after the date of enactment, to determine the feasibility of \nsatellite-based train control systems to provide positive train control \nfor railroad systems in the United States. Positive train control \nsystems use a constant flow of information to anticipate potentially \ndangerous situations and order the appropriate measures long before an \naccident might occur.\n  Under this legislation, all rail systems would be required to install \nautomated train control technology. However, this requirement would be \nwaived for those systems that establish, to the satisfaction of the \nDepartment of Transportation, that they will install an effective \nsatellite-based train control system not later than the year 2001. This \nseems a reasonable period to me, though I would invite comments from \ninterested parties on whether a different period would be more \nappropriate.\n  Mr. President, we need to make a judgment about the prospects for the \nnew satellite-based train control technology, one way or the other. \nOtherwise, we will find ourselves back here again in another few years, \nasking the same questions while families grieve and others lie in pain \nin hospital beds.\n  Another set of issues raised by the two passenger accidents is \nemergency escape, crash worthiness of passenger cars, fuel tank \nintegrity, and signal placement. All have contributed to the loss of \nlife and injury.\n  My bill would direct the FRA to examine the possibility of developing \nautomatic escape systems. Not later than 1 year after the date of \nenactment of my bill, the Department of Transportation would be \nrequired to complete a study of the technical, structural, and economic \nfeasibility of automatic train escape devices. If the report is \npositive, the Secretary is authorized to promulgate regulations in this \narea.\n  Mr. President, there is reliable, off-the-shelf technology that is \nused to inflate air bags during violent automobile accidents. That same \ntechnology could be used to automatically open escape routes in violent \ntrain accidents. Such technology might have saved the lives of \npassengers in the Maryland accident, who apparently survived the crash, \nbut who were unable to escape the fire and smoke.\n  Another step I am proposing is to have FRA establish minimum safety \nstandards for locomotive fuel tanks. Not later than 180 days after the \ndate of enactment of my bill, the Department of Transportation would be \nrequired to establish minimum safety standards for fuel tanks of \nlocomotives that take into consideration environmental protection and \npublic safety. The Secretary would be given the authority to limit the \napplicability of the standards to new locomotives.\n  The Maryland accident demonstrated the terrifying nature of fuel-fed \nfires. Many in the industry already are investing in less vulnerable \nfuel tank configurations. But we need to ensure in the future that no \nlocomotives have the kind of exposed, vulnerable fuel tank that \ncontributed to the Maryland disaster.\n  It is also important to ensure that passenger rail cars are produced \nand configured in a safe manner. Not later than 1 year after the date \nof enactment of my bill, the Department of Transportation would be \nrequired to determine whether to promulgate regulations to require \ncrash posts at the corners of rail passengers cars, safety locomotives \non rail passenger trains, and minimum crashworthiness standards for \npassenger cab cars.\n  The death toll in both the New Jersey and Maryland accidents might \nhave been less if the passenger compartments were stronger or if some \nhad not been exposed by the lack of a locomotive at the front of the \ntrain. Amtrak is investigating the possibility of using decommissioned \nlocomotives at the front of their push trains in order to provide \nengineers with a safe platform from which to work and to provide \nadditional protection to the first passenger car in case of a \ncollision. The National Transportation Safety Board has suggested that \npassenger cars be equipped with crash posts at the corner of each car. \n\n[[Page S1351]]\n\n\n  The FRA is developing new safety standards for rail cars. My bill \nwould direct the FRA to consider crash posts and safety locomotives, \nand to make a specific finding about these alternatives.\n  Also, after touring the scene of New Jersey Transit's sideswipe \naccident, I am convinced that unprotected passenger cab cars should be \nheld to a higher standard than other passenger cars. The bill therefore \nrequires FRA to evaluate the possibility of establishing minimum \ncrashworthiness standards for these passenger cab cars, and to issue a \nreport about their conclusions.\n  In addition, the bill directs the FRA to look into signal placement. \nNot later than 1 year after the date of enactment of my bill, the \nDepartment of Transportation would be required to determine whether \nregulations should be promulgated to require that a signal be placed \nalong a railway at each exit of a rail train station; and if \npracticable, a signal be placed so that it is visible only to the train \nthat the signal is designed to influence. If the study determines such \nregulations should be promulgated, the Department of Transportation is \ngiven the authority to promulgate those regulations. Signals should be \npositioned in the best places possible to minimize human error.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that some in the rail community may object \nto the costs of additional safety measures. And these costs cannot be \nignored. Last year, Federal operating and capital assistance to transit \nagencies was cut by some 20 percent from the previous year's funding \nlevel. This reduction represented the single largest cut of any \ntransportation mode in the Transportation appropriations bill.\n  Our Nation derives economic, social, and environmental benefits from \npublic transit agencies. We expect these agencies to provide safe \nservices. Yet, we cut their funding and then wonder why safety is \naffected. We must continue to support mass transit or else we will \nforce commuters off relatively safe buses, subways, and trains and onto \nour Nation's roads, which annually cause the premature death of some \n40,000 Americans.\n  Mr. President, it remains critically important to improve rail \nsafety. I challenge skeptics to visit with the families of loved ones \nwho died in New Jersey and Maryland. See first hand what it means when \nwe compromise on safety. You will not come away unmoved.\n  Mr. President, we in the Congress have an obligation to protect the \npublic. After the Chase, MD, accident of 1987 Congress mobilized and \nquickly enacted sweeping rail safety legislation. As a result, untold \nAmericans have been saved through the mandated use of automatic train \ncontrols on the Northeast corridor, the creation of minimum federal \nstandards for licensing of railroad engineers, certification \nrequirements for predeparture inspections and whistle blower \nprotections for rail employees. I am proud of the part that I played in \ndeveloping that legislation and believe that it has been very \neffective. However, more should be done. The lives and health of \nliterally millions of Americans are at stake.\n  Mr. President, both the Washington and the New York editorials of \nFebruary 21, 1996, make the case for increasing rail safety. I ask \nunanimous consent that they be inserted in the Record as part of my \nstatement.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation. I believe it is a \nresponsible approach to rail safety that builds on the lessons we have \nlearned from our Nation's recent rail safety accidents.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1575\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rail Safety Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act, the following definitions shall \n     apply:\n       (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration.\n       (2) Passenger cab car.--The term ``passenger cab car'' \n     means the leading cab car on a passenger train that does not \n     have a locomotive or safety locomotive at the front of the \n     train.\n       (3) Safety locomotive.--The term ``safety locomotive'' \n     means a cab-car locomotive (whether operational or not) that \n     is used at the front of a rail passenger train to promote \n     passenger safety.\n       (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Transportation.\n       (5) Train employee.--The term ``train employee'' has the \n     same meaning as in section 21101(5) of title 49, United \n     States Code.\n\n     SEC. 3.

PASSENGER CAR CRASH-WORTHINESS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with \n     the Administrator, shall determine whether to promulgate \n     regulations, for the purpose of protecting public safety, \n     to--\n       (1) require crash posts at the corners of rail passenger \n     cars;\n       (2) require safety locomotives on rail passenger trains;\n       (3) establish minimum crash-worthiness standards for \n     passenger cab cars; or\n       (4) carry out any combination of paragraphs (1) through \n     (3).\n       (b) Regulations.--If, the Secretary, acting through the \n     Administrator, determines that promulgating any of the \n     regulations referred to in subsection (a) are necessary to \n     protect public safety, the Secretary, in consultation with \n     the Administrator, shall, not later than 180 days after such \n     date, promulgate such regulations in final form, to take \n     effect as soon as practicable after the date of promulgation \n     of the regulations.\n       (c) Report.--If the Secretary determines under subsection \n     (a) that taking any action referred to in paragraphs (1) \n     through (3) of such subsection is not necessary to protect \n     public safety, not later than the date of the determination, \n     the Secretary shall submit a report to the appropriate \n     committees of the Congress that provides the reasons for the \n     determination.\n\n     SEC. 8. SIGNAL PLACEMENT.\n\n       (a) Study.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary, acting through the \n     Administrator, shall conduct a study of the placement of rail \n     signals along railways. In conducting the study, the \n     Secretary, acting through the Administrator, shall determine \n     whether regulations should be promulgated to require--\n       (1) that a signal be placed along a railway at each exit of \n     a rail station; and\n       (2) if practicable, that a signal be placed so that it is \n     visible only to the train employee of a train that the signal \n     is designed to influence.\n       (b) Regulations.--If, upon completion of the study \n     conducted under subsection (a), the Secretary determines that \n     the regulations referred to in that subsection are necessary \n     for the protection of public safety, the Secretary shall, not \n     later than 180 days after the completion of the study, \n     promulgate those regulations.\n       (c) Report.--If, upon completion of the study conducted \n     under subsection (a), the Secretary determines that \n     promulgating any of the regulations referred to in subsection \n     (a) is not necessary for the protection of public safety, not \n     later than the date of completion of the study, the Secretary \n     shall submit a report to the appropriate committees of the \n     Congress that provides the reasons for that determination.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 21, 1996]\n\n                    Lessons From the Train Disaster\n\n       The horrifying details of death by fire and smoke--of \n     people frantically seeking escape from a mangled commuter-\n     train-turned-furnace Friday night--continue to prompt \n     questions about rail safety policies in general and about \n     what happened in Silver Spring specifically. Some answers \n     must await the findings of investigators from the National \n     Transportation Safety Board. But there are safety procedures, \n     policies and equipment that have been the subjects of debate \n     in the industry for years, and that haunt every autopsy of a \n     train wreck:\n       Signals. What, if any, signals did engineer Richard Orr, \n     aboard Maryland commuter train 286, notice or remember in the \n     final miles before this train slammed into Amtrak's Capitol \n     Limited? Before arriving in Kensington, he passed a signal \n     that should have warned him to be prepared to stop. The \n     signal system is considered highly reliable. But there is a \n     more effective system that goes back to the 1920s: With it, \n     even if the engineer fails to spot or continue to remember \n     the warning signal, he sees a small light in his cab, and \n     each time his train goes through a restrictive signal he \n     hears a whistle. Should he fail to push a lever to \n     acknowledge the signal and then slow down or stop, the train \n     would do so automatically. Why isn't every train equipped \n     with this?\n       They used to be--on any line that was to travel faster than \n     80 mph--under a 1947 Interstate Commerce Commission order. \n     But over time, railroads were permitted on a case-by-case \n     basis to remove the system, in part because the age of fast \n     passenger trains was seen as ending. Besides, railroads \n     argued that the systems were expensive and that the braking \n     systems caused other safety problems for freight trains. \n     Today's signal system for MARC, like those for most lines, \n     does not provide automatic train control.\n       Although railroads today have a better safety record than \n     at any time in history, this history includes earlier \n     crashes--in Seabrook, Prince George's County, in 1978 and in \n     Chase, Md., in 1987--that prompted the NTSB to recommend that \n     all trains in the Northeast Corridor be equipped with \n     automatic stopping devices. They now are.\n       Passenger Escape. Yesterday, federal regulators issued \n     emergency regulations that, in addition to setting 30 mph \n     limits on non-automatic control lines for trains between a \n     station stop and the first signal, included a call for more \n     visible exit signs on train cars. Visible, uncomplicated \n     instructions for opening windows, doors and escape routes \n     ought to be posted everywhere. How about instructions on the \n     back of every seat?\n       Train Design. Though America's trains are among the \n     sturdiest pieces of equipment moving on land or in the skies, \n     there is the question of the Amtrak train's exposed diesel \n     fuel tanks, which splashed the fuel that ignited the terrible \n     fire. Newer models don't have this feature; the sooner the \n     old models are gone the better.\n       ``Push-Pull.'' The MARC train was being pushed by its \n     locomotive, a common practice for quick back-and-forth runs. \n     Passengers may feel safer with a locomotive in front of them, \n     but there is no hard evidence that safety is compromised when \n     it is pushing instead of pulling.\n       Another issue affects public confidence in railroad travel: \n     Maryland transit officials issued conflicting, inaccurate and \n     constantly changing reports on the accident for hours Friday. \n     At first they were telling television stations that no MARC \n     passengers were involved; they gave out a telephone number \n     that assured callers that no passengers on the train had been \n     injured. This was occurring as televised scenes and witness \n     accounts were indicating otherwise. Whatever MARC may have \n     had as an emergency preparedness plan, it failed. Amtrak, on \n     the other hand, seemed to be issuing as much information as \n     it could.\n       More questions are sure to arise as the fact-finding \n     continues. A safe transportation system of any kind requires \n     more than the mere recitation of probability statistics. \n     Public confidence must be taken into account not only by \n     government regulators but also by the industry officials.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 21, 1996]\n\n                     In the Train Wrecks' Aftermath\n\n       Two train collisions seven days apart have brought calamity \n     to the ordinarily quiet and safe commuter systems of New York \n     and Washington D.C. Federal and local officials are \n     responding with intense investigations and emergency \n     measures. They have already found some surprising soft spots \n     in the rail network's safety rules and practices.\n       New Jersey Transit, responding to the metropolitan region's \n     worst commuter train crash in 38 years, quickly eliminated \n     the nighttime split shift that enabled an engineer to work \n     extra-long hours just before his train collided with another \n     on Feb. 9. There was no need to await final analyses of what \n     caused the accident to discontinue a work arrangement that \n     was inherently hazardous.\n       The authorities are still investigating the accident, but \n     it appears that a train bound for Hoboken ran through yellow \n     and red lights that should have warned the engineer to stop \n     before entering tracks where an outbound train had the right \n     of way. The inbound train's engineer, John DeCurtis, was \n     operating during the morning rush hour at the end of a split \n     shift that had started 14\\1/2\\ hours earlier. He had a chance \n     to rest five hours during the middle of the night, but with \n     no cot or quiet space provided. Officials also need to weigh \n     whether Mr. DeCurtis's safety record, which included two \n     previous suspensions for running red lights, was a warning \n     that should have been heeded, and whether the installation of \n     automatic braking systems should be accelerated to prevent \n     such tragic accidents.\n       Similarly in last Friday evening's collision between a \n     Washington-bound commuter \n\n[[Page S1353]]\n     train and an Amtrak train headed north from Washington, the absence of \n     automatic train controls has already emerged as a safety gap \n     in the local system. Even more critically, the cars may have \n     lacked fully operational and clearly marked evacuation routes \n     with the kind of safety instructions that might have \n     prevented the death of eight young Job Corps trainees, who \n     were killed along with three crew members.\n       The signal system on the Maryland track was inadequate. \n     There was a caution light just before a suburban station \n     where the train was stopping anyway, but no similar light \n     immediately after to remind the engineer not to accelerate to \n     a high speed. The train rounded a bend and slammed into the \n     Amtrak train that had been temporarily routed on the same \n     tracks.\n       The Transportation Department responded yesterday with \n     belated but sensible stopgap rules. When a train leaves a \n     station, engineers must proceed no faster than 30 miles an \n     hour. They must call out to other crew members any warning \n     signal they see. All the nation's railroads are instructed to \n     test emergency exits and submit safety plans for Federal \n     review. Clearly, many safety hazards need examination and \n     correction as the result of these two tragedies.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Sarbanes):\n  S. 1576. A bill to provide that Federal employees who are furloughed \nor are not paid for performing essential services during a period of a \nlapse in appropriations, may receive a loan, paid at their standard \nrate of compensation, from the Thrift Savings Fund, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                    THE FURLOUGH RELIEF ACT OF 1996\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, I am introducing \nlegislation with Senator Sarbanes called the Furlough Relief Act of \n1996. Our bill would help Federal employees weather the storm during \nGovernment shutdowns by allowing them access to interest free loans \nfrom their Thrift Savings Plans.\n  About the only thing that Federal employees can rely on today is \nuncertainty. During the last year we have seen one attack after another \naimed at Federal workers. Between assaults on earned retirement \nbenefits, downsizing, and furloughs, these dedicated people have to be \nwondering what's coming next.\n  Today we are operating much of the Government under an emergency \ncontinuing resolution. I fervently hope there will not be another \nshutdown, and I will be doing all I can to prevent one from happening. \nBut there is no guarantee that Federal employees will be able to go to \nwork and earn their paychecks after this continuing resolution expires \non March 15. They could face yet another shutdown. That would mean more \nlost pay, more lost productivity, and more uncertainty.\n  I am a Federal employee Senator. I believe in honest pay for hard \nwork, and I know of no group of Americans that works harder than our \nFederal employees. That is why I am introducing legislation today that \nwill help Federal employees who want to help themselves.\n  As my colleagues know, Federal employees currently are allowed to \nborrow from their tax deferred Thrift Savings Plans for reasons such as \nfurthering their education, buying a home, or undergoing a medical \nprocedure. However, the approval process for a TSP loan can take weeks. \nThere is also no guarantee that the loan will be approved, and if it is \napproved, the borrower must pay interest when paying back the loan.\n  The Furlough Relief Act of 1996 would allow furloughed Federal \nemployees to be automatically eligible for a TSP loan from their \naccount during any Government shutdown. This loan would continue to be \npaid as long as the employee remains on furlough. It would help Federal \nemployees make up for lost wages. When a furlough ends, the employee \nwould be able to pay back the loan without interest.\n  The Furlough Relief Act will cut through the redtape of the TSP loan \nprocess. It will provide a dependable source of income for Federal \nemployees who have been denied their pay, and it will finally give a \nbreak to dedicated people who have not had many breaks in the past \nyear.\n  I think it's time to stop these assaults on Federal employees. We \ncannot continue to devalue Government workers and at the same time \nexpect Government to work better. In my State of Maryland, there are \nthousands of Federal employees making Government work better and making \na difference in the lives of all Americans. I salute them, and I \ndedicate myself to making a difference in their lives.\n                                 ______\n\n\n      By Mr. HATFIELD (for himself and Mr. Sarbanes):\n  S. 1577. A bill to authorize appropriations for the National \nHistorical Publications and Records Commission for fiscal years 1998, \n1999, 2000, and 2001; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n      THE NATIONAL HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS AND RECORDS COMMISSION \n                      REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, it is a great pleasure for me to \ntoday introduce a bill to reauthorize the functions of the National \nHistorical Publications and Records Commission on which I serve. I am \npleased to be joined by my good friend and colleague, Senator Sarbanes. \nSenator Sarbanes and I have a long association with the Commission.\n  This important organization, closely associated with the National \nArchives and Records Administration, has been diligently performing \nsome of the most vital archival preservation work in the country. \nRealizing the importance of preserving historical works and \ncollections, Congress established the National Historical Publications \nand Records Commission in 1934. Its purpose was to collect, edit, and \npublish the papers of the Founding Fathers, the writings of other \ndistinguished Americans, and the documentary histories of the First \nCongress, the Supreme Court, and the process of the ratification of the \nConstitution. In 1974, Congress expanded the Commission's \nresponsibilities to include providing advice and assistance to public \nand private institutions in the development and administration of \narchival systems. In the same year, the NHPRC established a Historical \nRecords Advisory Board in each State to help coordinate overall \npreservation strategies and to ensure that the Commission would have a \nstrong Federal-State partnership for its records programs.\n  Today, the National Historical Publications and Records Commission \nhas not strayed from its original mission. The NHPRC continues to \nscreen and determine the historical works it considers appropriate for \npreserving or publishing. The Commission administers grants to projects \ndedicated to preserving annals essential for historical research, \npublishing historical papers, and archiving nationally significant \nrecords. Without the preservation of these invaluable records, \nhistorians have little hope of accurately analyzing our Nation's \nhistory. Another important aspect of the Commission's objective is to \nencourage and instruct local agencies, schools, museums, and \nindividuals to forge ahead in their actions to preserve and publish \nhistorical works; the tasks facing archival institutions, manuscript \ndepositories, and scholars require more than the valiant efforts of a \nsingle Federal Commission. The valuable work of the Commission is a \nvery good example of a healthy partnership between public and private \ninstitutions, Federal and State agencies. The NHPRC pays no more than \none-third of the funds of the projects that it supports. Thus, the \nprogram is one of aiding and working closely with individuals and local \ninstitutions dedicated to preserving important facets of our history.\n  The number of records that the Commission has preserved and published \nis an impressive tribute to its efficient organization. To date, the \nNHPRC has supported 1,056 archival projects in all 50 States, three \nterritories, and the District of Columbia. These projects have \npublished 717 documentary volumes. Recent project grants have gone to \nan agency in Illinois to preserve Abraham Lincoln's legal papers and to \na center in Atlanta to publish the papers of Martin Luther King, Jr. In \naddition, the Commission has produced 8,280 reels of microfilm as well \nas 1,822 microfiche. Finally, the NHPRC has supported a total of 274 \ndocumentary editing projects. As the numbers suggest, the Commission \nhas been quite successful in its mission to preserve and publish the \nNation's historical works.\n  The bill I am introducing today seeks to extend authorization of \nappropriations for an additional 4 years in amounts up to $10 million \nannually. This appropriation would cover fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, \nand 2001. One hundred percent of the appropriations go \n\n[[Page S1354]]\nentirely toward project grants; the National Archives bears the \nadministrative costs. The American public may be assured that their \ninvestment is well spent by the NHPRC.\n  Passage of this important legislation will reassure America's \ncommunity of scholars, librarians, and archivists working closely with \nthe NHPRC that Congress is committed to the important mission of the \nCommission. In the past, Congress has clearly supported the work of the \nNHPRC and has recognized the importance of the Commission's efforts to \nensure that the words, thoughts, and ideas of our Nation's historic \nindividuals are collected from fragile or deteriorating source material \nand placed in books or on microfilm. Passage of this bill will ensure \nthat present and future generations of inquisitive minds will have \naccess to our history.\n  Mr. President, this bill will allow the NHPRC to continue its \nvaluable work for the next 4 years--work that will be of the utmost \nbenefit to scholars, researchers, libraries, and the public. Our \nNation's history needs to be preserved, and the future generations of \nAmericans deserve the right to have accurate records of their past. The \npreservation of our historical documents will protect and enrich our \nNation's wonderful history. I am proud to be a sponsor of this \nlegislation and confident in urging my colleagues to give their support \nto this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1577\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE NATIONAL \n                   HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS AND RECORDS COMMISSION.\n\n       Section 2504(f)(1) of title 44, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (F) by striking out ``and'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (2) in subparagraph (G) by striking out the period and \n     inserting in lieu thereof a semicolon; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraphs:\n       ``(H) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1998;\n       ``(I) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1999;\n       ``(J) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2000; and\n       ``(K) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2001.''\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with \nSenator Hatfield in introducing legislation to reauthorize the National \nHistorical Publications and Records Commission for 4 years.\n  It has been my privilege to alternate with Senator Hatfield in \nserving as the representative of the U.S. Senate on the National \nHistorical Publications and Records Commission, Senator Hatfield \nrepresented the Senate from 1983 to 1988, and I succeeded him until my \nterm expired last year. The Commission has had strong bipartisan \nsupport throughout its history, and I trust will continue to do so.\n  The NHPRC's statutory mandate is to promote the preservation and use \nof America's historical legacy. The work of the NHPRC assures all \nAmericans that the history of our Nation will be documented, that vital \nhistorical records will be kept safe, and that historians and others \nwill have ready access to those records.\n  Grants awarded through the National Historical Publications and \nRecords Commission are producing valuable results. In my own State of \nMaryland, the Commission is helping scholars edit, and presses publish, \neditions of papers that document the emancipation of slaves and the \ncareers of important historical figures.\n  Other important discoveries have resulted from grants awarded to \nscholars by the Commission. For example, NHPRC grants resulted recently \nin the discovery of the longest document yet known that Abraham Lincoln \nwrote in his own hand, a group of letters written to James Madison by a \nfamous jurist in the era of our revolution, an the original drawing \nmade by Architect William Thornton for the ground plan of the U.S. \nCapitol.\n  Although the Commission has been doing this work since it was \nestablished by Congress in 1934, its efforts remain relevant to today's \nconcerns. We have seen States and local governments across the country, \nwith advice and assistance from the Commission, establish archival \nprograms. We have seen the Commission launch several projects to deal \nwith the growing problem facing archivists in controlling and accessing \nvaluable electronic records, and helping historians make their \ndocumentary editions accessible electronically on the Internet.\n  Mr. President, it is important that the Commission continue its \nrespected work in preserving the heritage of our Nation. The \nreauthorization legislation I am joining Senator Hatfield in \nintroducing is a practical and important step in ensuring continuity of \nthe National Historical Publications and Records Commission. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in ensuring its swift passage.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1578. A bill to amend the Individuals With Disabilities Education \nAct to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1997 through 2002, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n   THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1996\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today I am pleased and proud to introduce \nthe Individuals With Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1996. \nThese amendments will guide our actions into the next century as we \nplan and secure educational opportunities for over 5 million American \nchildren with disabilities. Many recent polls have ranked education as \none of the top concerns of Americans. These polls are a wakeup call. We \nmust help America's children succeed and be able to demonstrate that \nthey have succeeded. We must find ways to affect the culture of \neducation, not through intrusive mandates, but through incentives for \npartnership and innovation. We must not give up on any child. We must \nview planning a child's education as a collaborative process. These \nimportant goals are the basis of the reauthorization of the Individuals \nWith Disabilities Education Act, commonly referred to as IDEA.\n  As everyone knows I am new to this business of drafting Federal \nlegislation. I am not new to the effects of Federal legislation on \nindividual lives. In my surgical practice, I have sometimes been able \nto save lives because of Federal legislation and sometimes in spite of \nthe barriers such legislation imposed on my efforts.\n  Thus, I take my responsibility as chairman of the Disability Policy \nSubcommittee very seriously. I am grateful for the partnership of my \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Tom Harkin, who was a partner in the \nentire process, and whose past leadership of this subcommittee was and \nis an inspiration.\n  I have been both cautious and careful as I have weighed \nrecommendations for amendments bought to me to change IDEA.\n\n\n  The Right of a Child with a Disability to an Education is Preserved\n\n  IDEA is a civil rights statute. It guarantees access to a free \nappropriate public education for children with disabilities. This \nunderstanding was established clearly in the predecessor to IDEA, \nPublic Law 94-142, which was enacted in 1975. IDEA is founded in the \n14th amendment of the Constitution, which is the equal protection \nclause. This connection is reinforced through 20 years of case law and \nbipartisan legislative history. The IDEA amendments introduced today \nwill not undermine the civil right of any child with a disability to a \nfree appropriate public education.\n  Public Law 94-142 was based on five principles.\n  First, educational planning for a child with a disability should be \ndone on an individual basis. Public Law 94-142 required that an \nindividualized education program [IEP] be developed for each child with \na disability.\n  Second, parents of a child with a disability should participate in \nthe development of their child's IEP. Public Law 94-142 required such \nparticipation.\n  Third, decisions about a child's eligibility and education should be \nbased on objective and accurate information. Public Law 94-142 required \nevaluation of a child to establish his or her need for special \neducation and related services and to determine the child's progress.\n  Fourth, if appropriate for a child with a disability, he or she \nshould be educated in general education with \n\n[[Page S1355]]\nnecessary services and supports. Public Law 94-142 required educational \nplacements based on such determinations.\n  Fifth, parents and educators should have a means of resolving \ndifferences about a child's eligibility, IEP, educational placement, or \nother aspects of the provision of a free appropriate public education \nto the child. Public Law 94-142 required that if the parents of a child \nrequested one, they were entitled to an impartial due process hearing. \nAnd, if differences between parents and educators could not be resolved \nthrough administrative proceedings such as a local due process hearing \nor a State-level review of the facts in the situation, either side \ncould use court to settle the matter. In 1986, the law was amended to \nclarify that the Federal courts have the power to require the awarding \nof attorneys' fees to parents who prevail in administrative proceedings \nor court actions.\n  The amendments offered today will not undermine any of these five \nprinciples or their manifestation in IDEA.\n  In fact, this reauthorization of IDEA reinforces its basic principles \nand adds to the law a viable set of tools with which to help adults \nhelp children with disabilities prepare for a successful future.\n\n\n                    Focused Accountability Expected\n\n  The amendments address accountability. People involved in educational \nplanning for a child with a disability will be expected to show \nresults--where a child is and where a child is going in terms of the \ngeneral education curriculum. How does he or she do in the classroom? \nHow does he or she do on local or statewide assessments of student \nprogress? Is a child getting appropriate services and supports to \ndemonstrate what he or she knows and can do? The amendments reshape \nexpectations for children with disabilities and create a common frame \nof reference--the general education curriculum. Most children with \ndisabilities can learn and benefit from the general education \ncurriculum. Some may need to learn it at a slower pace or in a modified \nform. Some may need to demonstrate what they have learned in a \ndifferent way than their peers. Nonetheless, they can learn and \ntherefore, should have the opportunity to learn, what their brothers, \nsisters, and friends are learning.\n\n  Unless we secure the general education curriculum as the educational \nanchor for most children with disabilities, their ability to succeed on \ndistrict-wide and statewide assessments of student progress will be \njeopardized. If they fail or perform poorly on such assessments, \nbecause they were taught from a watered-down general education \ncurriculum or a different curriculum, we are reinforcing the beliefs of \npeople who say that children with disabilities cannot learn as much or \nas well as other children. We also are reinforcing the beliefs of \npeople who prefer separate educational opportunities for children with \ndisabilities. Moreover, if children are taught from a watered-down \ngeneral education curriculum or a different curriculum, we may \ninadvertently create a justification for ignoring children with \ndisabilities when undertaking school reform initiatives.\n  If the general education curriculum is the focus for planning for a \nchild with a disability, it will improve communication throughout the \nsystem--a child with a disability and peers, educators and the child's \nparents, special education teachers and general teachers, related \nservices professionals and teachers, and parents of children with and \nwithout disabilities. Such a focus also will affect expenditures and \nuses of personnel. The emphasis will shift to what services and \nsupports are necessary in order for a child with a disability to \nsucceed in the general education curriculum. This shift may save a \nschool district money, while continuing an appropriate education for a \nchild with a disability. Lines of responsibility will blend--the \nquestion will become--``How do we make the general education curriculum \nwork for a particular child with a disability?'' If this blending of \nresponsibility takes off, and I believe it will work, not only will \nchildren with disabilities benefit, but children at risk will benefit, \nbecause personnel will acquire new skills and supports that equip them \nto serve all children.\n\n\n             Culture in the Educational Environment Changed\n\n  The amendments will affect the culture of schools--to create new \nbases for teamwork, to reinforce existing partnerships, and to provide \nincentives to view the delivery of educational services to children \nwith disabilities not as a distinct, separate mandate, but as an \nintegral part of the overall business of education. I come to this \nconclusion from personal experience.\n  Giving an individual a new heart, a chance at a longer life with \nquality, is the ultimate high. When that moment comes, I am filled with \npowerful emotions--pride, love, prayers of thanks, satisfaction, and a \nprofound appreciation of the power of teamwork. Reaching that moment \nand the critical ones that follow it is not possible without teamwork, \ninvolving the transplant recipient, the donor's bereaved family, the \norgan donor coordinator, medical, surgical, technical and nursing \nstaff, counselors, and the recipient's family. This process is long, \ncomplex, emotional and risky, but it is not a contest. Everyone has a \ncommon goal. Information is compiled and analyzed. Options are \nconsidered. Differences are aired. Decisions are made.\n  As I became engaged in the reauthorization of IDEA I realized that \nplanning the education of any child with a disability should not be \nviewed as a contest, but as an opportunity for teamwork. The bill \nincludes many provisions which encourage and reinforce teamwork. \nParents will be a source of information when compiling evaluation data \non a child suspected of having or known to have a disability. Parents \nwill have the opportunity to participate in all meetings in which \ndecisions which affects their child's education are made. Parents of \nchildren with disabilities will have the opportunity to help develop \nschool-based improvement plans designed to expand and improve \neducational experiences for their children. Teachers--those who do or \ncould work with disabled children--will be involved in providing and \ninterpreting information on the educational and social strengths, \nprogress, and needs of children with disabilities, which would be used \nin IEP meetings.\n  School districts will see a substantial reduction in paperwork under \nIDEA and will have increased flexibility on the use of personnel and \nthe fiscal tracking of the use of personnel. Because of these \namendments we will see more reasons for educators and parents to have \ncommon goals; fewer reasons for administrators to call IDEA burdensome; \nmore general and special education teachers and related services \npersonnel working together; more children with disabilities succeeding \nin the general education curriculum; more children with disabilities \nparticipating in school reform initiatives; and most important, more \nchildren at risk of failure will succeed.\n  We will not see these changes overnight. They will take time. The \namendments to IDEA restructure the 14 discretionary or support \nprograms--totaling $254 million in authorizations--to facilitate and \nrealize these changes, as well as others. Thirty million dollars are \nauthorized for a new Systems Change State Grant Program. States will \ncompete for access to these dollars. The purpose of this grant program \nis to provide funds to help States to address problems that have \nstatewide implications. For example, States could use grant awards to \ndesign effective ways for general education and special education \nteachers to work in the same classrooms; to develop effective within-\nschool options for addressing behaviors subject to school disciplinary \nmeasures; or to arrange effective transitions for children with \ndisabilities from early intervention to preschool programs, from high \nschool to the adult world, or at other important times in a child's \nlife.\n  The amendments clearly link funding for personnel training and \nresearch to the needs of children with disabilities, their families, \nschool personnel, and school districts. Any institution that seeks a \ntraining grant will be obligated to identify a personnel shortage that \nthey intend to address. Any institution that seeks to train teachers to \nwork with blind children must teach trainees how to teach Braille.\n  With regard to research grants, I appreciate the fact that research \ntakes extended effort. Research results are never immediate and are \noften modest building blocks toward some broader area of knowledge. \nResearch infrastructure requires a sustained, predictable commitment to \nfunding. However, \n\n[[Page S1356]]\nthe amendments offered today expect researchers to keep their eye on \nthe child in the classroom, the teacher in the classroom, the principal \nin the school, the child's parents, the school district, or the State \neducation agency. Researchers will be expected to provide information \nthat benefits children with disabilities, their teachers, or other \ntargeted audiences. Practical research will be valued. Through this \nreauthorization, the allocation of research dollars will emphasize \nlines of inquiry that will result in information that teachers or \nothers can use to help children with disabilities succeed in the \ngeneral education curriculum.\n\n  The amendments also sustain and strengthen the Federal support for \ninformation that helps children with disabilities, their parents, \nteachers, related service personnel, early intervention professionals, \nadministrators, researchers, teacher trainers, and others learn about, \naccess, and use state-of-the-art tools and strategies to be effective \nas partners in the business of education. The amendments require \ngrantees who are involved in the business of information gathering and \ndissemination and the grantees who are responsible for technical \nassistance to make a difference--to know their audiences, to provide \nthem with information and assistance that they need and can use, and to \nverify that their efforts counted, not just in terms of numbers of \npeople reached or pieces of paper disseminated, but in terms of lives \nchanged.\n  I certainly know the difference between an established and an \nexperimental surgical procedure, and I know what it takes to teach new \ntechniques to professionals across the country, and to do it well. It \nis my hope that the standards of information and dissemination and \ntechnical assistance achieved in medicine will come to be expected \nwithin the professional community serving infants, toddlers, children, \nand youth with disabilities. I think it is reasonable to expect that \nwhen anyone asks for information or assistance from a federally funded \nsource, that source is prepared to say, ``This will work; or, this will \nwork if certain conditions are present; or, this works 50 percent of \nthe time; or this might work.'' This reauthorization moves us toward \nincreased confidence in the information requested, received, or offered \nunder information dissemination and technical assistance activities \nfunded through IDEA. With increased confidence will come the \nopportunity to be a better equipped participant and partner in the \nidentification, evaluation, selection or design of educational \nopportunities for children with disabilities.\n\n\n           Helping Each Child Is an Investment in the Future\n\n  The amendments also address another priority of many Americans--\nintervening in the lives of children before they fail, before they are \nlabeled, or before they are lost. Effective intervention and targeted \nprevention are themes that cut across many of the provisions in the \nreauthorization of IDEA.\n  Early intervention. The bill reauthorizes part H, the Early \nIntervention Program, in IDEA. Part H was originally enacted in 1986. \nThis program, in which all States participate, has been extremely \neffective in reaching infants and toddlers with disabilities early in \ntheir young lives, often at birth. This early intervention program \nhelps these small ones, and their parents, unlock their abilities and \nbecome prepared to realize maximum benefits from their later preschool \nand school experiences.\n  The amendments direct the Federal Government to develop a model \ndefinition and service delivery standards for infants and toddlers at \nrisk of being developmentally delayed. Early intervention professionals \nare very successful at diagnosing and serving infants and toddlers with \ndisabilities, that is, disabilities which are discernable before, \nduring, or shortly after birth. These professionals are experienced in \ndeveloping appropriate intervention strategies for such children. They \nare less successful in identifying infants and toddlers who show more \nsubtle signs indicative of later disability. I anticipate that the \nmodel definition and service standards, which will draw from the \nexperiences of States which currently are serving at-risk populations, \neventually will provide early intervention professionals with the tools \nto identify and reach greater numbers of at-risk infants and toddlers.\n  The amendments also give States increased administrative flexibility \nwith regard to the transition of a child from an early intervention \nprogram funded by part H into a preschool program funded by section 619 \nof part B of IDEA. This flexibility will provide an incentive to focus \non what is best for a particular child--allowing the child to remain in \nan early intervention program after his or her third birthday during a \nschool year and to transition to a preschool program in the next school \nyear. This flexibility permits the child's individualized family \nservices plan [IFSP] to be the child's IEP until planning is done for \nthe next school year.\n  As a surgeon I understand the importance and effect of early \nintervention in a medical situation. As a Senator I have been reminded \nof the benefits of Headstart and have witnessed the benefits of early \nintervention and preschool programs at the Kennedy Institute at \nVanderbilt University. I have no doubt that as we continue to invest \nFederal funds in the very young lives of infants and toddlers with \ndisabilities, we will deliver to our schools children who can learn \nmore easily, participate more fully, and be less distinguishable from \ntheir peers in terms of expectations, progress, and friendships.\n  Labeling deemphasized. These amendments lessen the need for and \nmeaning of labels. School districts will be required to report the \nnumber of children with IEP's, and the number of students in each of \ntwo placement categories. They will not be required to continue \nreporting the numbers of children in twelve disability categories, by \nage group, or by multiple types of placements. This will significantly \nreduce the longstanding reporting burden imposed on school districts \nand States. I anticipate that this administrative relief will translate \ninto less interest in and use of disability labels in schools and \nclassrooms.\n  The amendments encourage States to adopt placement-neutral funding \nformulas. Thus, over time there will be fewer incentives for \nsegregated, label-driven educational placements for children with \ndisabilities.\n  Under certain conditions, school districts also will have the \nopportunity to commingle IDEA dollars with other funds when serving \nchildren with disabilities--when children with disabilities are in \ngeneral education classrooms being taught by general and special \neducation teachers; when children eligible for services under IDEA are \nbeing served with children identified as disabled under the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act or section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act; or when \na school has a school improvement plan in effect. This flexibility in \nthe use of IDEA dollars will cause school officials to rethink how \nservices may be delivered more efficiently and more effectively; cause \nlabeling to be viewed as less relevant or necessary; and cause teachers \nto view their roles in reaching children as complementary and their \nresponsibilities for helping all children succeed as a joint effort.\n\n  The amendments recognize that many children from minority backgrounds \nare inappropriately identified as being eligible for special education \nand related services under IDEA. It is anticipated that with the \nopportunity to use IDEA funds in more flexible ways, parents, teachers, \nand administrators will not need to use the referral and evaluation \nprocedures connected to special education as frequently as in the past \nto secure more or different services for children from minority \nbackgrounds.\n  No child to be lost or forgotten. The amendments take a broad view of \nthe concept of ``dropout.'' In the amendments numerous, interrelated \nprovisions have been crafted to reduce the likelihood that child with a \ndisability will either figuratively or literally drop out of school and \nbecome disconnected from peers and professionals who can contribute to \nthe child's growth and success in school. These provisions will require \naffirmative efforts on the part of educators, other professionals, and \nthe parents of the child to keep the child connected in meaningful ways \nto the business of learning. Three sets of provisions particularly \nshould result in fewer children with disabilities being lost or \nforgotten. \n\n[[Page S1357]]\n\n  Integrated transition services for secondary school students with \ndisabilities. Developing a secondary student's IEP for a particular \nyear should not be an activity divorced from transition planning for \nthe child that may encompass multiple years. Therefore, the amendments \nmake transition planning for a child 14 or older a part of the IEP \nprocess. This clarification should result in simplification of \nadministrative procedures. Secondary school personnel and personnel \nresponsible for transition services, to the extent that they are \ndifferent, will have a common process--the development or modification \nof a student's IEP--in which to make contributions and through which to \ninfluence what others may propose. Parents and students with \ndisabilities will continue to have direct roles in the planning process \nas well. Students at the designated age of majority, in States where \nthis is permitted, will be able to be the principal representative of \ntheir own interests and preferences.\n  Clarification of fiscal responsibilities for related services. In \norder to succeed in school and connect to the social culture of school, \nchildren with disabilities may need more than specially designed \ninstruction. They may need one of many related services, such as speech \ntherapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, or counseling. Such \nservices may be critical at any time in the school years of a child \nwith a disability, because they help a child acquire the tools to blend \nin and be accepted by peers and teachers--to communicate, to walk, to \nsit, to function more independently, to hold a pen, use a keyboard, or \nto use socially appropriate behavior. Accessing related services \npersonnel can be costly and is not always easy, even when cost is not a \nfactor. The amendments clearly establish that fiscal responsibility for \nsuch services extends beyond school districts; spell out the broader \nobligation of local and State agencies that could and should absorb \nsuch costs; and indicate that school districts have the opportunity to \nseek reimbursement from such agencies, when a child's eligibility for \nsuch services, funded by other than a local school district, is known.\n  School discipline and civil rights. A few children with disabilities \nsometimes pose a danger to themselves or others, or are so disruptive \nthat neither they or their classmates can learn. Such children should \nnot, must not, be abandoned.\n  How to best address such situations was the most contentious issue \nduring the development of this reauthorization of IDEA. Educators \nreported that current provisions in IDEA prevent them from removing \ndisabled students who are dangerous from school. One exception in \ncurrent law is when a student with a disability brings a weapon to \nschool. Such a student can be removed from his or her current \neducational placement for up to 45 days. Parents of children with \ndisabilities argued strenuously that if IDEA were to make it easier for \neducators to remove disabled students who are dangerous or seriously \ndisruptive from their educational placements, the law would give \neducators a reason to serve children with disabilities in more \nsegregated settings or not at all. Moreover, parents argued that \nincreasing educators' ability and discretion to remove children with \ndisabilities from their current educational placements, without \nparental consent, would provide educators with the opportunity to \ndivert responsibility for having inappropriately served children with \ndisabilities in the first place and reward educators for the actions or \ninactions that led to the dangerous or disruptive behavior.\n  The amendments to address this issue are not in the bill. I plan to \ncontinue working on this issue with my colleagues, with professional \norganizations and associations who have already contributed to this \nprocess, and especially with parents. I have come to consider both the \ncontentions of educators and those of parents to be valid. I anticipate \ncreation of an amendment that will strike a balance between the \neducators' responsibility to maintain safe schools and the right of \nchildren with disabilities, even when they engage in dangerous or \nseriously disruptive behavior, to continue their education.\n  I anticipate negotiating a discipline amendment that will: Define \ndangerous behavior; sustain a commitment from schools to involve \nparents in their children's education before crises develop; reach an \nagreement on a mechanism that allows the removal of a student with a \ndisability in an expedited manner when the student is truly a danger to \nhimself or herself or to others; and that will allocate resources to \ntrain principals and to train teachers and students in conflict \nresolution strategies and related behavior management techniques.\n  We have a long history of bipartisan commitment to IDEA. We must \ncontinue to be courageous, on both sides of the aisle, in our \ncommitment to improve the lives of our citizens with disabilities, most \nespecially children. We must continue to be courageous in our \ncommitment to making American schools the best they can be for all of \nour children.\n\n  In our hearings on IDEA in May 1995, a mother from Kentucky came in, \neven though her son Ryan had died, and told us her son's story. I \nremember that she said she was guided in her advocacy by a quote from \nDaniel Burnham, who said:\n\n       Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men's \n     blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big \n     plans, aim high and hope they work, remembering that a noble, \n     logical diagram, once recorded, will never die, but long \n     after we are gone will be a living thing asserting itself \n     with ever-growing insistency.\n\n  This is the kind of courage children with disabilities must bring to \ntheir everyday lives. This is the kind of courage that parents of \nchildren with disabilities show every day as they dream their dreams \nand work, step-by-step, toward a better, more independent, more \nproductive life for their child. This is the kind of courage that \nAmerica's dedicated and professional teachers bring to their work with \nAmerican students every school day, aiming high and hoping their big \nplans work.\n  We can do no less. We will do no less. These amendments will keep us \non track.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a short list of \nimprovements to IDEA, and a section-by-section summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Individuals With Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1996\n\n          SUMMARY OF CHANGES MADE TO CURRENT LAW BY FRIST BILL\n\n\n               Part A--General provisions (Secs. 601-610)\n\n     Sec. 601--Short Title/Findings/Purpose\n       Updates ``Findings''--to reflect changes made in the \n     education of children with disabilities over the past 20 \n     years (since enactment of P.L. 94-142), and to restate that \n     the ``right to equal educational opportunities'' is inherent \n     in the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.\n       Updates ``Purposes'' of IDEA--to incorporate all relevant \n     IDEA programs in the purpose statements (i.e., the basic \n     State grant program under Part B, the early intervention \n     program for infants and toddlers with disabilities under Part \n     H, and the various support programs under Parts C through E, \n     including systems change activities, coordinated research and \n     personnel preparation, and coordinated technical assistance, \n     dissemination, and technology development and media \n     services).\n     Sec. 602--Definitions\n       Adds definitions of ``behavior management plan'', \n     ``educational service agency'' (to replace ``intermediate \n     educational unit''), ``general education curriculum'', \n     ``inappropriately identified'', ``individualized family \n     service plan (IFSP)'', ``infant or toddler with a \n     disability'', ``outlying areas'', ``parent'' (to include \n     guardians), ``public or private nonprofit agency or \n     organization'', ``supplementary aids and services'', \n     ``systems change activities''; ``systems change outcomes'', \n     and ``unserved and underserved''.\n       Deletes definitions of ``research and related purposes'', \n     ``public and private agency'', and ``youth with a \n     disability''; and moves the definition of ``transition \n     services'' to sec. 614(i).\n       Revises definitions of--\n       (1) ``IEP''--by removing all substantive provisions, and \n     referring to sections 614(d)-614(j), where all provisions \n     (both process and content) are contained.\n       (2) ``Institution of Higher Education (IHE)''--by making a \n     simple cross reference to the Higher Education Act of 1965, \n     etc.\n       (3) ``Related Services''--by adding ``orientation and \n     mobility services'' (to be consistent with current policy of \n     the Education Department).\n       Makes technical and conforming changes to several other \n     definitions e.g., by adding a definition for the term ``child \n     with a disability (current law defines the plural ``children \n     with disabilities''), and alphabetizes and adds heading to \n     terms.\n     \n[[Page S1358]]\n\n     Sec. 603--Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP). \n         (Provisions regarding the administrative staffing of \n         OSEP)\n       Amends sec. 603--to allow OSEP to ``accept voluntary and \n     uncompensated services in furtherance of the purposes of this \n     Act.''\n     Sec. 604--Abrogation of State Sovereign Immunity. (Current \n         law provides that the Federal Government has the right to \n         bring a suit against a State for violation of IDEA)\n       No changes.\n     Sec. 605--Acquisition of Equipment and Construction of \n         Necessary Facilities\n       Repealed.\n     Sec. 606--Employment of Individuals with Disabilities\n       No changes.\n     Sec. 607--Grants for the Removal of Architectural Barriers\n       Repealed.\n     Sec. 608--Requirements for Prescribing Regulations. (Current \n         law requires a 90-day public comment period for \n         regulations proposed under Part B of the IDEA)\n       Makes technical and conforming changes.\n     Sec. 609--Eligibility for Financial Assistance. (Current law \n         provides that no grants may be made for projects that \n         focus exclusively on children aged 3-5, unless the State \n         is eligible for a preschool grant under sec. 619)\n       Makes technical and conforming changes.\n     Sec. 610--Administrative Provisions Applicable to Parts D and \n         E\n       (Parts D include support programs under IDEA concerning \n     research, personnel training, etc. The Senate bill (1) \n     reduces the number of support programs from 14 to 7, and (2) \n     reorganizes the remaining provisions contained in Parts C \n     through G of current law into three Parts: Part C--State \n     Systems Change Grants, Part D--Coordinated Research and \n     Personnel Preparation, and Part E--Technical Assistance, \n     Support, and Dissemination.) The Senate bill reorganizes and \n     substantially revises sec. 610, as described below:\n       1. Requires Secretary to develop and implement a \n     comprehensive plan for activities under D and E, to enhance \n     services to children with disabilities under parts B and H.\n       2. Identifies eligible applicants for awards (SEAs, LEAs, \n     IHEs, private nonprofit organizations, Indian tribes, and, in \n     some cases, ``for profit'' organizations); and specifies that \n     the Secretary may limit individual competitions to one or \n     more categories of applicants, etc.\n       3. Extends current provisions regarding outreach to \n     minorities (i.e., requires at least one percent of the total \n     funds appropriated under parts D and E to be used for \n     outreach purposes for ``HBCUs'' and IHEs with minority \n     enrollments of at least 25 percent. This is a continuation of \n     current law.\n       4. Provides that the Secretary may, without rulemaking, \n     limit competitions to projects that give priority to one or \n     more targeted areas set out in the bill--so long as each \n     project addresses the needs of children with disabilities and \n     their families.\n       5. Sets out specific applicant responsibilities.\n       6. Includes provisions for application management--\n     including (1) requiring a peer review process, with detailed \n     criteria for selection of panel members, and (2) providing \n     that the Secretary may use a portion of funds under Parts D \n     and E (a) to pay nonfederal entities for administrative \n     support, (b) for Federal employees to monitor projects, and \n     for evaluation of activities carried out under these \n     programs.\n\n\n  part b--assistance for education of all children with disabilities \n                            (secs. 611-620)\n\n     Sec. 611--Entitlements and Allocations\n       1. Retains the ``child count'' formula.\n       2. Expands the list of activities that a State may carry \n     out if it retains Part B funds at the State level (e.g., to \n     meet performance goals, and to develop and implement the \n     mediation process required by sec. 615, systems change \n     activities authorized under part C, and a statewide \n     coordinated services system, etc.).\n       3. Revises the $7,500 minimum subgrant provision (which \n     prohibits subgrants to very small LEAs that would receive \n     less than $7,500 under sec. 611). The bill (1) eases this \n     restriction by giving States the option to decide whether to \n     make subgrants of less than that amount, and (2) adds \n     preschool funds under sec. 619 to the amount that could be \n     counted in determining if an LEA meets the $7,500 minimum. \n     (Bill retains the provision requiring that, if a State \n     doesn't make a subgrant to an LEA, it must use those funds to \n     provide FAPE to children residing in the LEA).\n       4. Defines ``outlying areas'' as including the Federated \n     States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and \n     the Republic of Palau and requires the outlying areas to use \n     their Part B funds in accordance with the purposes of IDEA, \n     and not for other purposes, as permitted under P.L. 95-134.\n       5. Makes technical changes regarding grants to the \n     Secretary of the Interior, and makes other technical and \n     conforming changes.\n     Sec. 612--State Eligibility\n       1. Simplifies provisions related to State participation \n     under Part B--by combining most of the elements of current \n     sections 612 (State eligibility) and 613 (State plans), so \n     that all conditions of State eligibility (including policies \n     on FAPE, procedural safeguards, LRE, etc.) appear in one \n     comprehensive section.\n       2. Amends ``child find'' requirements (Sec. 612(a)(3))--to \n     codify current Department policy, which provides that, so \n     long as a child meets the ``two-pronged'' test as a ``child \n     with a disability'' under sec. 602(4) (i.e., has a disability \n     and needs special education), the child does not have to be \n     classified by a specific impairment or condition in order to \n     be eligible for service under Part B.\n       3. Amends LRE provisions (Sec. 612(a)(5))--to ensure that \n     the State's funding formula does not result in placements \n     that violate the policy that children are placed in the least \n     restrictive environment, and (2) that the state educational \n     agency examines data to determine if significant racial \n     disproportionality is occurring in the evaluation and \n     placement of children under this Act; and if either situation \n     is identified, to take appropriate corrective action.\n       4. Amends provisions on Transition from Part H to Preschool \n     Programs (Sec. 612(a)(9))--to conform Part B with the \n     transition planning requirements under Part H (Sec. \n     678(a)(8)) (i.e., to ensure the LEA staff participate in \n     transition planning conferences convened by the Part H lead \n     agency, in order to ensure an effective transition for \n     infants and toddlers with disabilities who move into \n     preschool programs under Part B.\n       5. Addresses unilateral placements by parents (Sec. \n     612(a)(10))--to clarify that if the parents of a child with a \n     disability unilaterally place the child in a private school \n     and a hearing officer agrees with the parent's placement, the \n     LEA may be required to reimburse the parents. However, the \n     amount of reimbursement may be reduced or denied--(1) if \n     prior to removal of the child from the public school, the \n     parents do not provide a statement to the LEA rejecting its \n     proposed placement, or (2) upon a judicial finding of \n     unreasonableness the respect to actions taken by the parents.\n       6. Strengthens requirements on ensuring provision of \n     services by non-educational agencies (Sec. 612(a)(12)) (i.e., \n     while retaining the single line of responsibility of the SEA \n     (Sec. 612(a)(11)), the bill provides (1) that if a non-\n     educational agency is responsible for providing or paying for \n     services that are also necessary for ensuring FAPE to \n     children with disabilities, that agency must pay for, or \n     provide such services directly or by contract or other \n     arrangements, (2) that the State must ensure that interagency \n     agreements or other mechanisms are in effect between \n     educational agencies and non-educational agencies for \n     defining respective financial responsibilities, resolving \n     interagency disputes, and for interagency coordination, and \n     (3) that the State must establish a mechanism by which local \n     educational agencies may seek reimbursement from agencies for \n     the costs of providing related services and disseminate those \n     procedures to local educational agencies.\n       7. Amends ``comprehensive system of personnel development'' \n     (CSPD) requirements (Sec. 612(a)(14))--to simplify and reduce \n     the burden of such requirements, especially the data \n     provisions, and make the requirements more meaningful.\n       8. Amends ``Personnel Standards'' to include use of \n     paraprofessionals (Sec. 612(a)(15))--to allow districts to \n     utilize appropriately trained and supervised \n     paraprofessionals to provide services.\n       9. Conforms the IDEA to general education initiatives (sec. \n     612 (a)(16) and (17))--by requiring States to (1) establish \n     performance goals and indicators for children with \n     disabilities, and (2) ensure that these children participate \n     in general State and district-wide assessments, with \n     appropriate accommodations, where necessary, and that \n     guidelines are developed for participation in alternative \n     assessments for those children who cannot participate in \n     state and district-wide assessments.\n       10. Consolidates funding requirements under current law in \n     one place (Sec. 612(a)(18)), and deletes non-germane \n     provisions.\n       11. Consolidates the public participation requirements of \n     current law in one place (Sec. 612(a)(19)), and provides \n     language to reduce burden--by clarifying that, if the State's \n     policies and procedures have been subjected to public comment \n     through a State rulemaking process, no further public review \n     or public comment period is required.\n       12. Amends provisions on State Advisory Panels--by (1) \n     specifying other categories of participants of such panels, \n     (2) adding new duties of the Panel (e.g., advise the SEA \n     developing corrective action plans to address findings \n     identified through Federal monitoring reports, and to \n     developing and implementing policies related to coordination \n     of services), and (3) providing that a State panel \n     established under the ESEA or Goals 200: Educate America Act \n     may also serve as the State Advisory Panel if it meets the \n     requirements of this part.\n       13. Significantly reduces paperwork and staff burden, by no \n     longer requiring States to submit three-year State plans. \n     Once a State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the \n     Secretary that it has in effect policies and procedures that \n     meet the eligibility requirements of the new sec. 612, the \n     State does not have to resubmit such materials, unless those \n     policies and procedures are change.\n       14. Simplifies provisions related to participation of \n     LEAs--by (1) replacing the LEA application requirements in \n     sec. 614 of current law with new ``LEA eligibility'' \n     provisions in sec. 613, and (2) conforming those provisions, \n     as appropriate, to the new State eligibility requirements \n     under sec. 612.\n     Sec. 613--LEA Eligibility\n       1. Simplifies provisions related to participation of LEAs--\n     by (1) replacing the LEA application requirements in sec. 614 \n     of current \n\n[[Page S1359]]\n     law with new ``LEA eligibility'' provisions in sec. 613, and (2) \n     conforming those provisions, as appropriate, to the new State \n     eligibility requirements under sec. 612.\n       2. Includes ``Maintenance of Effort'' provision--to ensure \n     that the level of expenditures for the education of children \n     with disabilities within each LEA from State and local funds \n     will not drop below the level of such expenditures for the \n     preceding fiscal year; but provides four specific exceptions \n     (i.e., (1) decreases in enrollment of children with \n     disabilities, (2) end of LEA's responsibility to provide an \n     exceptionally costly program to a child with a disability \n     [because child leaves the LEA, etc.], (3) retirement or other \n     voluntary departure of special education staff who are at or \n     near the top of the salary schedule, and (4) end of unusually \n     large expenditures for equipment or construction). (Bill \n     retains ``excess costs'' and ``supplement--not supplant'' \n     provisions of current law.)\n       3. Provides greater flexibility to LEAs in the use of Part \n     B funds, while still ensuring that children with disabilities \n     receive needed special education and related services. The \n     bill identifies specific activities that an LEA may carry out \n     (notwithstanding the excess cost and noncomingling \n     requirements in secs. 613(3)(B) and 612(a)(18)(A)(ii)), \n     including using Part B funds for--\n       Incidental benefits (i.e., LEAs could provide special \n     education services to a child with a disability in the \n     regular classroom without having to track the costs of any \n     incidental benefits to non-disabled students from those \n     services).\n       Simultaneous services on a space-available basis (i.e., \n     special education and related services that are provided to \n     ``IDEA-eligible'' children could simultaneously be provided, \n     on a space available basis, to children with disabilities who \n     are protected by ``ADA-504'').\n       A coordinated services system (i.e., an LEA could use up to \n     5 percent of its Part B funds to develop and implement a \n     coordinated services system that links education, health, and \n     social welfare services, and various systems and entities in \n     a manner designed to improve educational and transitional \n     results for all children and their families, including \n     children with disabilities and their families).\n       A school-based improvement plan (i.e., an LEA could (if \n     authorized by the SEA) permit one or more local schools \n     within the LEA to design, implement, and evaluate a school-\n     based improvement plan for improving educational and \n     transitional results for children with disabilities and, as \n     appropriate, for other children, consistent with the \n     provisions on incidental benefits and simultaneous services \n     in sec. 613(a)(4) (A) and (B)).\n       4. Provides that an LEA may join with other LEAs to jointly \n     establish eligibility under Part B.\n       5. Significantly reduces paperwork and staff burden for \n     SEAs and LEAs--by providing that once an LEA demonstrates to \n     the satisfaction of the SEA that it has in effect policies \n     and procedures that meet the eligibility requirements of the \n     new sec. 613, the SEA may consider that those requirements \n     have been met; and the LEA would not have to resubmit such \n     materials, unless those policies and procedures are changed.\n       6. Simplifies local involvement with a State's \n     Comprehensive System of Personnel Development--and requires \n     that a local educational agency only, to the extent \n     appropriate, contribute to and benefit from the State \n     Comprehensive System of Personnel Development.\n     Sec. 614--Evaluations, Reevaluations, IEPs, and Educational \n         Placements\n       1. Simplifies State and local administration of provisions \n     on evaluation, IEPs, and placements--by placing all such \n     provisions in one newly established sec. 614.\n       2. Addresses Evaluations and Reevaluations:\n       Reduces cost and administrative burden--by requiring that \n     existing evaluation data on a child be reviewed to determine \n     if any other data are needed to make decisions about a \n     child's eligibility and services. (If it is determined by \n     appropriate individuals that additional data are not needed, \n     the parents must be so informed of that fact and of their \n     right to still request an evaluation; but no further \n     evaluations are required at that time unless requested by the \n     parents.)\n       Includes protections in evaluation procedures--by requiring \n     LEAs to ensure that tests and other evaluation materials are \n     relevant, validated for the specific purpose for which they \n     are being used, etc.; and retains the nondiscriminatory \n     testing procedures required in current law.\n       3. Addresses IEP provisions:\n       Consolidates all substantive provisions on IEPs (both \n     content and process) in one place (secs. 614(d)-614(j)), and \n     re-orders the provisions, so that there is a logical \n     sequence--from (1) procedures for developing IEPs, (2) IEP \n     content, (3) measuring and reporting on each child's \n     progress, and (4) reviewing and revising the IEP.\n       Requires IEP team to consider specific factors in \n     developing each child's IEP, including (1) basic information \n     about the child (e.g., most recent evaluation results, \n     child's strengths, and parent concerns for enhancing the \n     child's education), and (2) other special factors and \n     possible remedies, as appropriate (e.g., in the case of a \n     child with a visual or hearing impairment, limited English).\n       Revises content of IEPS--by (1) replacing ``annual goals \n     and short term instructional objectives'' with ``measurable \n     annual objectives'', (2) placing greater emphasis on ensuring \n     that each child, as appropriate, has the opportunity to \n     progress in the general curriculum, and to participate with \n     nondisabled children in various environments.\n       Amends provisions on transition services (i.e., the bill \n     requires that transition services needs (1) be considered for \n     all students with disabilities beginning at age 14 (or \n     younger . . .), and, as appropriate, addressed under the \n     applicable components of the IEP (e.g., levels of \n     performance, objectives, and services), and (2) be considered \n     in light of the student's participation in the general \n     curriculum (e.g., a vocational education or school to work \n     program).)\n       The bill (1) retains current law requiring a statement of \n     transition services beginning at age 16 (or younger), and (2) \n     moves the definition of ``transition services'' from Part A \n     to sec. 614(I).\n       4. Adds a provision regarding transfer of rights at the age \n     of majority (i.e., requiring that, at least one year before a \n     student reaches the age of majority under State law, the IEP \n     must include ``a statement about the rights under this Act, \n     if any, that will transfer to the student on reaching the age \n     of majority under sec. 615(j).''\n     Sec. 615--Procedural Safeguards.\n       1. Revises the written notice provision--(a) to set out the \n     specific content of notices to parents, and (b) to reduce \n     burden under current law and regulations--by permitting \n     notices to include only a brief summary of the procedural \n     safeguards under Part B relating to due process hearings (and \n     appeals, if applicable), civil actions, and attorney fees--\n     together with a statement that a full explanation of such \n     safeguards will be provided if the parents request it or \n     request a due process hearing, etc.\n       2. Reduces potential conflict between LEAs and parents of \n     children with disabilities--by requiring States to make \n     mediation available to such parents, on a voluntary basis. \n     (The use of mediation can resolve disputes quickly and \n     effectively, and at less cost.)\n       3. Provides clearer notice of the existence of a conflict \n     between an LEA and the parents of a child with disabilities. \n     The bill requires the parents to provide the LEA a written \n     notice of their intent to file a complaint (request a due \n     process hearing) under Part B, on any matter regarding the \n     identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the \n     child or the provision of FAPE to the child, 10 calendar days \n     prior to filing the complaint, if the parents (1) have new \n     information about any matter described above, and (2) are \n     initiating a complaint about such a matter, and have signed \n     the most recent IEP of the child.\n       The bill further states that (1) if, prior to filing the \n     complaint, the parents have new information on any matter \n     described above, they must provide the information to the LEA \n     along with the notice of intent to file a complaint; and (2) \n     if the parents were duly informed by the LEA of their \n     obligation to file such a notice, and fail to do so, ``the \n     time line for a final decision on the complaint shall be \n     extended by 10 calendar days.''\n       4. Amends provisions on attorney fees--by clarifying that \n     ``the determination of whether a party is a prevailing party \n     under this section shall be made in accordance with the law \n     established by the Supreme Court in Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 \n     U.S. 424 (1983);'' and (2) that, ``for the purpose of this \n     section, an IEP meeting, in and of itself, shall not be \n     deemed a proceeding triggering the awarding of attorneys \n     fees''.\n       5. Permits the transfer of parental rights to a student \n     with disabilities upon reaching the age of majority under \n     State law; and provides that if (under State law) such a \n     student is determined to not have the ability to provide \n     informed consent under Part B, the State must have procedures \n     for appointing the parent or another person to represent the \n     student's interests throughout the student's eligibility \n     under this part.\n       6. Makes other technical and conforming changes.\n     Sec. 616--Withholding and Judicial Review\n       Makes technical and conforming changes.\n     Sec. 617--Administration\n       1. Adds a provision prohibiting the Secretary from \n     rulemaking via policy letters or other statements. (The bill \n     provides that, in order to establish a new rule that is \n     required for compliance and eligibility under Part B, the \n     Secretary must follow standard rulemaking requirements.)\n       2. Adds a provision requiring the Department of Education \n     to widely disseminate, on a quarterly basis, a list of \n     correspondence from the Department during the previous \n     quarter that describes the Department's interpretations of \n     this part and the implementing regulations.

Therefore, no major amendments \n     are proposed. However, the bill:\n       1. Provides greater flexibility in addressing the needs of \n     ``at risk infants and toddlers'' in those States not \n     currently serving such children--by permitting Part H funds \n     to be used for referring those children to other (non-Part H) \n     services, and conducting periodic follow-ups on each referral \n     to determine if the child's eligibility under Part H has \n     changed.\n       2. Provides for a review of the definition of \n     ``developmental delay''--by requiring the Federal Interagency \n     Coordinating Council (FICC) to convene a panel to develop \n     recommendations regarding a model definition of \n     ``developmental delay''--to assist States, as appropriate, \n     with their own respective definitions.\n       3. Facilitates the provision requiring a smooth transition \n     for toddlers with disabilities from the Part H program to \n     preschool services under Part B--by permitting the planning \n     to begin up to 6 months before the child's 3rd birthday, if \n     the parents and agencies agree.\n       4. Provides technical changes related to (1) membership on \n     the FICC (2) responsibilities of the State and Federal \n     Interagency Coordinating Councils, and (3) definitions of \n     terms; and makes other technical and conforming changes.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            The First Bill--Commonsense Improvements to IDEA\n\n       1. Eliminates the major bureaucratic burden of three-year \n     plan submissions.--State and local educational agencies will \n     make only one plan or application, instead of the currently \n     mandated submission of once every three years. Under the \n     First bill, state and local agencies will update their plans \n     only if they report substantial changes.\n     \n[[Page S1361]]\n\n       2. Reduces burden on school funding sources to pay for \n     supports and related services.--The First bill helps local \n     districts pay for supports and related services by requiring \n     that other agencies pay their fair share of the cost of \n     services to children who are eligible for those agencies' \n     services.\n       3. Cuts mandatory data collection by 50%.--The First bill \n     cuts data collection and reporting burdens on state and local \n     educational agencies. Currently, agencies are required to \n     report numbers of children receiving special education by \n     age, by four placement categories and by the disability of \n     the student. Under the Frist bill, agencies will report only \n     the total number of children receiving special education and \n     the number of children in each of only two placement \n     categories.\n       4. Reduces litigation by adding mediation.--If there is a \n     dispute over an IEP, school districts and families will be \n     able to use mediation to try to resolve issues instead of \n     automatically having to go to a due process hearing.\n       5. Eliminates regulation through Department of Education \n     policy letters.--The Frist bill will reduce the burden of new \n     regulations on state and local educational agencies. Policy \n     letters issued by the Department of Education will no longer \n     be used for purposes of eligibility and compliance \n     monitoring. Letters may be issued only for non-regulatory \n     guidance and purposes of explanation and clarification of \n     existing policy.\n       6. Relieves burden by allowing flexible local control of \n     funds:\n       A. Allows flexibility in the use of funds for school \n     improvement and coordination with general education reform.--\n     States will be allowed to use up to 1% of the funds received \n     under Part B, and local districts may use up to 5% of Part B \n     funds to develop better services for all children, including \n     children with disabilities. In addition, school districts \n     will be allowed all of their Part B funds to establish \n     school-based improvement plans designed to improve \n     educational results for children with disabilities.\n       B. Relieves financial burden of the current maintenance of \n     effort requirement.--The Frist bill allows local education \n     agencies to reduce the overall level of spending for \n     educating children with disabilities by the following; when \n     the reduction results from lower per-teacher staff costs or \n     per-pupil student costs, when a reduction is due to a one-\n     time expenditure in the preceeding fiscal year, or when there \n     are decreases in district enrollment of students with \n     disabilities.\n       C. Eliminates wasteful fiscal tracking mandates.--Building \n     and district administrators will no longer be required to \n     keep track of the educational benefits to non-disabled \n     children when a child with a disability is provided special \n     education and related services in the regular education \n     classroom.\n       7. Reduces the administrative burden of student \n     evaluations.--The Frist bill will simplify and streamline the \n     process of student evaluation. Initial evaluations and \n     reevaluations will focus on collecting only the information \n     that is necessary for educational planning. Reevaluations \n     will take place when additional information is needed, or at \n     natural transitions such as when a student moves from \n     elementary school to junior high.\n       8. Cuts data collection requirements of personnel \n     development programs.--The Frist bill simplifies and reduces \n     data collection requirements for a state to maintain its \n     Comprehensive System of Personnel Development (CSPD). In \n     addition, local control will increase because school \n     districts will decide their level of participation in the \n     state's CSPD.\n       9. Cuts paperwork and providers administrative relief in \n     IEP process.--The Frist bill eliminates mandated short-term \n     objectives in an IEP. Paperwork will be reduced by the \n     elimination of short-term objective tracking and repetitive \n     reporting of test results and other information in the IEP. A \n     flexible, sensible, workable schedule of educational reports \n     to parents of children with disabilities will be determined \n     by the IEP team.\n       10. Empowers school officials in disciplining children.--\n     For the first time since its enactment, IDEA will contain \n     comprehensive language that will untie school officials' \n     hands when disciplining students with disabilities. \n     [Currently under discussion, will be worked out by date of \n     mark-up and then inserted]\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Disability Policy, I am pleased to join Senator Frist, \nthe chair of that subcommittee, in introducing the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act [IDEA] Amendments of 1996. It has been a \nprivilege and a pleasure for me to work with Senator Frist and our \nrespective staffs in developing this reauthorization proposal. I also \nwould like to compliment Pat Morrissey, Senator Frist's staff director \nfor the Subcommittee on Disability Policy for her efforts to enhance \nthe partnership between parents of children with disabilities and the \neducational community.\n  The amendments we are proposing today provide fine-tuning to powerful \neducation legislation with a long and successful history. Just 3 months \nago, on November 29, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the signing \nof Public Law 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of \n1975, now known as part B of IDEA. The purpose of this law is simple--\nto assist States and local communities to meet their obligations to \nprovide equal educational opportunity to children with disabilities in \naccordance with the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment of \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  As we look back on that day two decades ago, we know that this law \nhas literally changed the world for millions of children with \ndisabilities. Prior to the enactment of Public Law 94-142, 1 million \nchildren with disabilities in the United States were excluded entirely \nfrom the public school system, and more than half of all children with \ndisabilities did not receive appropriate educational services.\n  On that day in 1975, we lit a beacon of hope for millions of children \nwith disabilities and their families. We sent a simple, yet powerful \nmessage heard around the world that the days of exclusion, segregation, \nand denial of education for children with disabilities are over in this \ncountry. And we sent a powerful message that families count and they \nmust be treated as equal partners\n  Because of IDEA, tremendous progress has been made in addressing the \nproblems that existed in 1975. Today, every State in the Nation has \nlaws in effect assuring the provision of a free appropriate public \neducation for all children with disabilities. And over 5,000,000 \nchildren with disabilities are now receiving special education and \nrelated services.\n  For many parents who have disabled children, IDEA is a lifeline of \nhope. As one parent recently told me:\n\n       Thank God for IDEA. IDEA gives us the strength to face the \n     challenges of bringing up a child with a disability. It has \n     kept our family together. Because of IDEA our child is \n     achieving academic success. He is also treated by his \n     nondisabled peers as ``one of the guys.'' I am now confident \n     that he will graduate high school prepared to hold down a job \n     and lead an independent life.\n\n  In May, Danette Crawford, a senior at Urbandale High School in Des \nMoines, testified before the Disability Policy Subcommittee. Danette, \nwho has cerebral palsy, testified that:\n\n       My grade point average stands at 3.8 and I am enrolled in \n     advanced placement courses. The education I am receiving is \n     preparing me for a real future. Without IDEA, I am convinced \n     I would not be receiving the quality education that Urbandale \n     High School provides me.\n\n  We are now graduating the first generation of students who have had \nthe benefits of the provisions of IDEA. Already, for example, since \n1978 the percentage of incoming college freshman with disabilities has \nmore than tripled from 2.4 percent to over 9 percent. We once heard \ndespondency and anger from parents. We now hear enthusiasm and hope, as \nI have, from a parent from Iowa writing about her 7-year-old daughter \nwith autism. She said, ``I have no doubt that my daughter will live \nnearly independently as an adult, will work, and will be a very \npositive contributor to society. That is very much her dream, and it is \nmy dream for her. The IDEA has made this dream capable of becoming a \nreality.''\n  Mr. President, these are not isolated statements from a few parents \nin Iowa. They are reflective of the general feeling about the law \nacross the country. The National Council on Disability [NCD] recently \nconducted 10 regional meetings throughout the Nation regarding progress \nmade in implementing the IDEA over the past 20 years. In its report, \nNCD stated that ``in all of the 10 regional hearings * * * there were \nringing affirmations in support of IDEA and the positive difference it \nhas made in the lives of children and youth with disabilities and their \nfamilies.'' The report adds that ``all across the country witnesses \ntold of the tremendous power of IDEA to help children with disabilities \nfulfill their dreams to learn, to grow, and to mature.''\n  These comments, as well as testimony presented at the four hearings \nheld by the Subcommittee on Disability Policy, make it clear to me that \nmajor changes in IDEA are not needed nor wanted. IDEA is as critical \ntoday as it was 20 years ago, particularly the due process protections. \nThese provisions level the playing field so that parents can sit down \nas equal partners in designing an education for their children.\n  The witnesses at these hearings did make it clear, however, that we \nneed to fine-tune the law--in order to make sure that children with \ndisabilities are \n\n[[Page S1362]]\nnot left out of educational reform efforts that are now underway, and \nto take what we have learned over the past 20 years and use it to \nupdate and improve this critical law.\n  Based on 20 years of experience and research in the education of \nchildren with disabilities, we have reinforced our thinking and \nknowledge about what is needed to make this law work, and we have \nlearned many new things that are important if we are to ensure an equal \neducational opportunity for all children with disabilities.\n  For example, our experience and knowledge over the past 20 years have \nreaffirmed that the provision of quality education and services to \nchildren with disabilities must be based on an individualized \nassessment of each child's unique needs and abilities; and that, to the \nmaximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities must be educated \nwith children who are not disabled and children should be removed from \nthe regular educational environment only when the nature and severity \nof the disability is such that education in regular classes with the \nuse of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved \nsatisfactorily.\n  We have also learned that students with disabilities achieve at \nsignificantly higher levels when schools have high expectations--and \nestablish high goals--for these students, ensure their access to the \ngeneral curriculum, whenever appropriate, and provide them with the \nnecessary services and supports. And there is general agreement that \nincluding children with disabilities in general State and district-wide \nassessments is an effective accountability mechanism and a critical \nstrategy for improving educational results for these children.\n  Our experience over the past 20 years has underscored the fact that \nparent participation is a crucial component in the education of \nchildren with disabilities, and parents should have meaningful \nopportunities, through appropriate training and other supports, to \nparticipate as partners with teachers and other school staff in \nassisting their children to achieve to high standards.\n  There is general agreement today at all levels of government that \nState and local educational agencies must be responsive to the \nincreasing racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity that prevails in \nthe nation's public schools today. Steps must be taken to ensure that \nthe procedures used for referring and evaluating children with \ndisabilities include appropriate safeguards to prevent the over or \nunder-identification of minority students requiring special education. \nServices, supports, and other assistance must be provided in a \nculturally competent manner. And greater efforts must be made to \nimprove post-school results among minority students with disabilities.\n  The progress that has been made over the past 20 years in the \neducation of children with disabilities has been impressive. However, \nit is clear that significant challenges remain. We must ensure that \nthis crucial law not only remains intact as the centerpiece for \nensuring equal educational opportunity for all children with \ndisabilities, but also that it is strengthened and updated to keep \ncurrent with the changing times.\n  The basic purposes of Public Law 94-142 must be retained under the \nproposed reauthorization of IDEA: To assist States and local \ncommunities in meeting their obligation to ensure that all children \nwith disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public \neducation that emphasizes special education and related services that \nare designed to meet the unique needs of these children and enable them \nto lead productive independent adult lives; to ensure that the rights \nof children with disabilities and their parents are protected; and to \nassess and ensure the effectiveness of efforts to educate children with \ndisabilities.\n  We also need to expand those purposes to promote the improvement of \neducational services and results for children with disabilities and \nearly intervention services for infants and toddlers with \ndisabilities--by assisting the systems change initiatives of State \neducational agencies in partnerships with other interested parties, and \nby assisting and supporting coordinated research and personnel \npreparation, and coordinated technical assistance, dissemination, and \nevaluation, as well as technology development and media services.\n  Mr. President, this bipartisan bill we are presenting here today \nprovides the fine-tuning that is needed to up-date current law along \nthe lines I have described. These amendments will help ensure that \nchildren with disabilities have equal educational opportunities along \nwith their nondisabled peers to leave school with the skills necessary \nfor them to be included and integrated in the economic and social \nfabric of society and to live full, independent productive lives as \nadults.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to quote Ms. Melanie Seivert \nof Sibley, IA, who is the parent of Susan, a child with Downs syndrome. \nShe states:\n\n       Our ultimate goal for Susan is to be educated academically, \n     vocationally, [and] in life-skills and community living so as \n     an adult she can get a job and live her life with a minimum \n     of management from outside help. Through the things IDEA \n     provides . . . we will be able to reach our goals.\n       Does it not make sense to give all children the best \n     education possible? Our children need IDEA for a future.\n\n  Mr. President, IDEA is the shining light of educational opportunity. \nAnd we, in the Congress, must make sure that the light continues to \nburn bright. We still have promises to keep. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act Amendments of \n1996.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GLENN (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Levin, Mr. Cochran, \n        Mr. Pryor, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 1579. A bill to streamline and improve the effectiveness of \nchapter 75 of title 31, United States Code (commonly referred to as the \n``Single Audit Act``); to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                the single audit act amendments of 1996\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \namend the Single Audit Act of 1984. This legislation will both improve \nfinancial management of Federal funds and reduce paperwork burdens on \nState and local governments, universities and other nonprofit \norganizations that receive Federal assistance. I am happy that the \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Stevens, joins \nwith me in cosponsoring the bill, as do Senators Levin, Cochran, Pryor, \nCohen, Lieberman, and Brown, all fellow members of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee.\n  Over the last several years we have made great strides in reforming \nthe sloppy and wasteful state of Federal financial management. The \nChief Financial Officers Act of 1990, which I strongly support, was a \nmajor accomplishment in this regard. Much more remains to be done, \nhowever, to achieve greater accountability for the hundreds of billions \nof dollars of Federal assistance that go to or through State and local \ngovernments and nonprofit organizations. Much more also remains to be \ndone to reduce the auditing and reporting burdens of the Federal \nassistance management process. The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, \nwhich I introduce today, goes a long way toward achieving these goals.\n  The Single Audit Act was enacted in 1984 to overcome serious gaps and \nduplications that existed in audit coverage over Federal funds provided \nto State and local governments, which now amount to about $200 billion \na year. Some governments rarely saw an auditor interested in examining \nFederal funds, others were swamped by auditors, each looking at a \nseparate grant award. The Single Audit Act remedied that problem by \nchanging the audit focus from compliance with individual Federal grant \nrequirements to a periodic single overall audit of the entity receiving \nFederal assistance. The act also set specific dollar thresholds to \nexempt small grant recipients from regular audit requirements. This \nstructured approach of entity-wide audits simplified overlapping audit \nrequirements and improved grantee-organization administrative controls.\n  The Single Audit Act also served an important purpose of prompting \nState and local governments to improve their general financial \nmanagement practices. The act encouraged the governments to review and \nrevise their financial management practices, including instituting \nannual financial statement audits, installing new accounting systems, \nand implementing monitoring systems. The improvements represented long-\nneeded and long-lasting \n\n[[Page S1363]]\nfinancial management reforms. Studies by the General Accounting Office \n[GAO] confirmed these accomplishments. The success of the act also \nprompted the Office of Management and Budget [OMB] to apply single \naudit principles to educational institutions and other nonprofits that \nreceive or passthrough Federal funds (OMB Circular No. A-133, ``Audits \nof Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit \nOrganizations,'' March 1990).\n  During my tenure as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I \nrequested that GAO study the implementation of the Single Audit Act and \nsuggest any needed changes. The resulting report, Single Audit: \nRefinements Can Improve Usefulness (GAO/AIMD-94-133, June 1994), \nreviewed the successes of the act, but also pointed out specific \nmodifications that could improve the act's usefulness. The legislation \nI introduce today is based on GAO's findings, and in fact, was \ndeveloped in cooperation with GAO and OMB. Moreover, OMB is presently \nrevising its Circular A-133 consistent with the purposes of this \nlegislation. Finally, the bill also reflects comments received from \nState, local and private sector accounting, and audit professionals, as \nwell as program managers. Altogether, the legislation will strengthen \nthe act, while simultaneously reducing its burdens.\n  First, the legislation extends the act to cover nonprofit entities \nthat receive Federal assistance. Again, these organizations are \ncurrently subject to the single audit process under OMB Circular A-133. \nBroadening the act's coverage in this way ensures that all nonFederal \ngrantee organizations will be covered uniformly by a single audit \nprocess.\n  Second, the bill reduces audit and related paperwork burdens by \nraising the single audit threshold from $100,000 to $300,000. This \nwould exempt thousands of smaller State and local governments and \nnonprofits from Federal single audit requirements. It would still \nensure, however, that the vast majority of Federal funds would be \nsubject to audit testing. Needless to say, it would also not interfere \nwith the ability of Federal agencies to audit or investigate grantees \nwhen needed to safeguard Federal funds.\n  Third, the bill would improve audit effectiveness by establishing a \nrisk-based approach for selecting programs to be tested during single \naudits for adequacy of internal controls and compliance with Federal \nprogram requirements, such as eligibility rules. The Single Audit Act \nhas required audit testing solely on the basis of dollar criteria. \nUsing the risk-based approach will ensure coverage of large programs, \nas well as others that are actually more at risk.\n  Fourth, the legislation improves the contents and timeliness of \nsingle audit reporting to make the reports more useful. Currently, \nauditors often include a number of different documents in a single \naudit report. These documents are designed to comply with auditing \nstandards but leave many confused. A summary document, written in plain \nlanguage, would greatly increase the usefulness of single audit \nreports.\n  Shortening the reporting timeframes will also make the single audit \nreports more useful. The current practice of filing reports 13 months \nafter the end of the year that was audited significantly reduces their \nutility. An ideal period would be the Government Finance Officers \nAssociation's standard of 6 months for timely reporting by State and \nlocal governments. However, given the multiple audits that some State \nauditors have to perform, the legislation establishes a 9-month \nstandard. Moreover, the legislation gives flexibility for extensions as \nneeded. The overall goal, still, is to shorten the reporting timeframe \nto make the single audit reports more useful to assess the stewardship \nof organizations entrusted with Federal funds and to prompt any needed \ncorrective actions.\n  Fifth, the legislation increases administrative flexibility. OMB is \nauthorized to issue rules to implement the act and may revise certain \naudit requirements as needed, without seeking amendments to the act. \nFor example, OMB would be authorized to raise even higher the $300,000 \nthreshold. Auditors also will have greater flexibility to target \nprograms at risk.\n  In these and other ways, the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 will \nstreamline the underlying Single Audit Act, update its requirements, \nreduce burdens, and provide for more flexibility. This legislation \nbuilds on the significant accomplishments of the 1984 act and I am \nconfident that the Senate will move the legislation expeditiously.\n  In December 1995, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs held a \nhearing on the status of Federal financial management, including the \nSingle Audit Act. Charles Bowsher, the Comptroller General of the \nUnited States and, Kurt Sjoberg, the California State auditor, \nrepresenting the National State Auditors Association, strongly \nsupported the legislation and recommended that it be enacted. Edward \nDeSeve, Office of Management and Budget Controller, also applauded the \nlegislative effort.\n  The support of the Comptroller General and the State auditors is \nespecially important. The Comptroller General was instrumental in \nadvising the Congress when the original Single Audit Act was enacted. \nHe followed the subsequent implementation of the act and has made the \nrecommendations for improving the act that was the basis for the \ncurrent legislation. I give great weight to his recommendations for \namending the Single Audit Act. State auditors, for their part, are key \nplayers in the single audit process. They conduct or arrange for \nthousands of single audits each year. So, their views are also \ncritically important. Following the December hearing, the National \nState Auditors Association met to discuss the legislation and decided \nunanimously to support its enactment. I submit their letter of support \nfor the Record.\n  Finally, I commend to my colleagues the fact that this legislation is \nbipartisan. Again, Senator Stevens, chairman of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, joins with me in cosponsoring the bill, as do \nSenators Levin, Cochran, Pryor, Cohen, Lieberman, and Brown. This \nbipartisanship also extends to the House of Representatives. With this \nbipartisan support, I am sure that this good Government legislation can \nsoon become law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 1579\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The 1984 Act replaced multiple grant-by-grant audits \n     with an annual entity-wide audit process for State and local \n     governments that receive Federal assistance. The new bill \n     would broaden the scope of the Act to cover universities and \n     other nonprofit organizations, as well. It would also \n     streamline the process. Thus, the bill would improve \n     accountability for hundreds of billions of dollars of Federal \n     assistance, while also reducing auditing and paperwork \n     burdens on grant recipients.\n       The bill was developed on the basis of GAO review of \n     implementation of the Single Audit Act ``Single Audit: \n     Refinements Can Improve Usefulness,'' GAO/AIMD-94-133, June \n     21, 1994). Major stakeholders in the single audit process \n     were consulted during the drafting process. Support for the \n     bill was confirmed at a December 14, 1995, hearing of the \n     Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n       The 10 years' experience under the 1984 Act demonstrated \n     that the single audit concept promotes accountability over \n     Federal Assistance and prompts related financial management \n     improvements by covered entities. Experience also showed, \n     however, that process can be strengthened. This bill would \n     (1) improve audit coverage of federal assistance, (2) reduce \n     Federal burden on non-Federal entities, (3) improve audit \n     effectiveness, (4) improve single audit reporting, and (5) \n     increase administrative flexibility.\n\n\n                         Improve Audit Coverage\n\n       The bill would improve audit coverage of Federal assistance \n     by including in the single audit process all State and local \n     governments and nonprofit organizations that receive Federal \n     assistance. Currently, the Act only applies to State and \n     local governments. Nonprofit organizations are subject \n     administratively to single audits under OMB Circular A-133, \n     ``Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other \n     Nonprofit Organizations.'' -Including nonprofit organizations \n     under the Act would result in a common set of single audit \n     requirements for Federal assistance.\n\n\n                         Reduce Federal Burden\n\n       The bill would simultaneously reduce Federal burdens on \n     thousands of State and local governments and nonprofits, and \n     ensure audit coverage over the vast majority of Federal \n     assistance provided to those organizations. It would do so by \n     raising the dollar threshold for requiring a single audit \n     from $100,000 to $300,000. While this would relieve many \n     grantees of Federal single audit mandates, GAO estimated that \n     a $300,000 threshold would cover, for example, 95% of direct \n     Federal assistance to local governments. This is commensurate \n     with the coverage provided at the $100,000 threshold when the \n     Act was passed in 1984. Thus, exempting thousands of entities \n     from single audits would reduce audit and paperwork burdens, \n     but not significantly diminish the percentage of Federal \n     assistance covered by single audits.\n\n\n                      Improve Audit Effectiveness\n\n       The bill would improve audit effectiveness by directing \n     audit resources to the areas of greatest risk. Currently, \n     auditors must perform audit testing on the largest--but not \n     necessarily the riskiest--programs that an entity operates. \n     The bill would require auditors to assess the risk of the \n     programs an entity operates and select the riskiest programs \n     for testing. As the President of the National State Auditors \n     Association said, ``It makes good economic sense to \n     concentrate audits where increased corrective action and \n     recoveries are likely to result.''\n\n\n                     Improve Single Audit Reporting\n\n       The bill would greatly improve the usefulness of single \n     audit reports by requiring auditors to provide a summary of \n     audit results. The reports would also be due sooner--9 months \n     after the year-end rather than the current 13 months. \n     Interpretations of current rules lead auditors to include 7 \n     or more separate reports in each single audit report. Such a \n     large number of reports tends to confuse rather than inform \n     users. A summary of the audit results would highlight \n     important information and thus enable users to quickly \n     discern the overall results of an audit. Federal managers \n     surveyed by GAO overwhelmingly support the summary reporting \n     and faster submission of reports.\n\n\n                  Increase Administrative Flexibility\n\n       The bill would enable the single audit process to evolve \n     with changing circumstances. For example, rather than lock \n     specific dollar amount audit thresholds into law, OMB would \n     have the authority to periodically revise the audit threshold \n     above the new $300,000 threshold. OMB also could revise \n     criteria for selecting programs for audit testing. By giving \n     OMB such authority, specific requirements within the single \n     audit process could be revised administratively to reflect \n     changing circumstances that affect accountability for Federal \n     financial assistance.\n\n\n                   Conclusion: Good Government Reform\n\n       Developed by GAO and endorsed by the National State \n     Auditors Association, the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 \n     represents consensus good government legislation that will \n     improve accountability over Federal funds and reduce burdens \n     on State and local governments and nonprofit organizations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    National State\n\n\n                                         Auditors Association,\n\n                                  Baltimore, MD, January 29, 1996.\n     Hon. John Glenn,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Governmental Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Glenn: The National State Auditors Association \n     has voted unanimously to support the proposed bill to amend \n     the Single Audit Act of 1984. My state audit colleagues and I \n     believe that the proposed legislation is an excellent measure \n     that deserves to be passed into law as soon as possible.\n       The Single Audit Act amendments provide a unique \n     opportunity to address the needs of federal, state and local \n     government auditors and program managers. The original act is \n     over 10 years old and the amendments address many of the \n     changes that have occurred over the years in the auditing \n     profession and in government financial management. The bill \n     is the result of open and constructive dialog along the \n     stakeholders. Over the last several months, we have worked \n     closely with congressional staff as well as representatives \n     of the General Accounting Office and the Office of Management \n     and Budget. As currently drafted, the bill provides needed \n     improvements to financial accountability over federal grant \n     funds.\n       While there are several excellent provisions in the amended \n     act, two are particularly noteworthy. First, the minimum \n     threshold of receipts requiring any entity to have a single \n     audit performed is raised in the bill to $300,000. Similarly, \n     the thresholds for larger recipients are also adjusted. These \n     modifications will relieve many state and local governments \n     of unnecessary federal mandates and generate savings of audit \n     costs. Second, the amendments allow federal and state \n     governments to focus audit resources on ``high-risk'' grants \n     where the potential for savings is the greatest. It makes \n     good economic sense to concentrate audits where increased \n     corrective action and recoveries are likely to result.\n       In summary, the National State Auditors Association is \n     pleased to fully support the amendments to the Single Audit \n     Act of 1984 and assist you in any way possible to facilitate \n     its passage this year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Anthony Verdecchia,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Craig, Mr. Faircloth, \n        Mr. Grams, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Lott, Mr. McCain, \n        Mr. Pressler, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Smith, Mr. Thomas, \n        and Mr. Thompson):\n  S.J. Res. 49. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to require two-thirds majorities for \nbills increasing taxes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                TAX LIMITATION CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, during the next 8 weeks, millions of \nAmericans will file their income tax returns. According to estimates by \nthe Internal Revenue Service, individuals will have spent about 1.7 \nbillion hours on tax-related paperwork by the time their returns are \ncompleted. Businesses will spend another 3.4 billion hours. The Tax \nFoundation estimates that the cost of compliance will approach $200 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, if that is not evidence that our Tax Code is one of \nthe most inefficient and wasteful ever created, I do not know what is. \nMoney and effort that could have been put to productive use solving \nproblems in our communities, putting Americans to work, putting food on \nthe table, or investing in the Nation's future are instead devoted to \nconvoluted paperwork.\n  It is no wonder that the American people are frustrated and angry, \nand that they are demanding radical change in the way their Government \ntaxes and spends. It is no wonder that tax reform has become one of the \nmajor issues of this year's Presidential campaign.\n  Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution with more than a \ndozen of my colleagues that represents the first concrete step toward \ncomprehensive tax reform. The resolution, which we call the tax \nlimitation amendment, would establish a constitutional requirement for \na two-thirds majority vote in each House of Congress for the approval \nof tax-rate increases. \n\n[[Page S1367]]\n\n  A companion resolution, House Joint Resolution 159, was introduced in \nthe House of Representatives on February 1 by Congressman Joe Barton of \nTexas and 155 other House Members.\n  The two-thirds supermajority that we have proposed was among the \nrecommendations of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax \nReform, appointed by Majority Leader Bob Dole and Speaker Gingrich. The \nCommission, chaired by former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, advocated a \nsupermajority requirement in its recent report on how to achieve a \nsimpler, single-rate tax to replace the existing maze of tax rates, \ndeductions, exemptions, and credits that makes up the Federal income \ntax as we know it today.\n  Here are the words of the Commission:\n\n       The roller-coaster ride of tax policy in the past few \n     decades has fed citizens' cynicism about the possibility of \n     real, long-term reform, while fueling frustration with \n     Washington. The initial optimism inspired by the low rates of \n     the 1986 Tax Reform Act soured into disillusionment and anger \n     when taxes subsequently were hiked two times in less than \n     seven years. The commission believes that a two-thirds super-\n     majority vote of Congress will earn Americans' confidence in \n     the longevity, predictability, and stability of any new tax \n     system.\n\n  Mr. President, in the 10 years since the last attempt at \ncomprehensive tax reform, Congress and the President have made some \n4,000 amendments to the Tax Code. Four thousand amendments. That means \nthat taxpayers have never been able to plan for the future with any \ncertainty about the tax consequences of the decisions they make. They \nare left wondering whether saving money for a child's education today \nwill result in an additional tax burden tomorrow. They can never be \nsure that if they make an investment, the capital gains tax will not be \nincreased when they are ready to sell. Rules are changed in the middle \nof the game, and in some cases, the rules have been changed even after \nthe game is over. President Clinton's tax increase in 1993 \nretroactively raised taxes on many Americans, including some who had \ndied.\n  The volatility of the Tax Code is not new. You will recall that the \nincome tax was established in 1913 with a top rate of 7 percent; fewer \nthan 2 percent of American families were even required to file a tax \nreturn. Just 3 years later, on the eve of the First World War, the top \nrate soared to 67 percent. By the Second World War, the top rate had \nrisen again--to 94 percent--and it remained in that range through the \n1950's. Of course, by that time, the tax had been expanded to cover \nalmost every working American.\n  Ten years ago, President Reagan succeeded in reducing the number of \ntax rates to just two--15 percent and 28 percent. But it was not long \nbefore additional rates were established, and taxes were raised again \nunder the Clinton administration.\n  The tax limitation amendment would put an end to the roller coaster \nride of tax policy that has so bedeviled hard-working Americans. And it \nguarantees more than stability and predictability. It will also ensure \nthat taxes cannot be raised--whether we ultimately adopt a single-rate \ntax as the Kemp commission has proposed, a national sales tax as \nSenator Lugar has proposed, or some alternative--unless there is \nsufficient consensus and strong bipartisan support in Congress and \naround the country.\n\n  Mr. President, the last tax increase to have cleared the Congress was \nproposed by President Clinton in 1993, and you will remember that it \nwas the largest tax increase in history.\n  I was serving in the House of Representatives at the time. It seemed \nto me that most Americans strongly opposed the plan. The calls, \nletters, and faxes from my constituents in Arizona ran about 10 to 1 in \nopposition to the President's tax plan. There was a lot of opposition \nin Congress, too. The opposition was bipartisan--Republicans and \nDemocrats. Unfortunately, the President was able to hold onto enough \nmembers of his own party in the House to pass it there, but only with \npartisan Democrat support.\n  The story was different in the Senate. Not more than 50 Senators were \nwilling to support the largest tax increase in history. A measure would \nnormally fail on a tie vote--in this case, 50 to 50. The reason the tax \nincrease passed was that the Vice President, as in the case of any tie \nin the Senate, had the right to cast the deciding vote. That is his \nright under the Constitution. The tax bill was not passed improperly, \nbut it is notable that the largest tax increase in history managed to \nbecome law without the support of a majority of the people's elected \nSenators. To me, that is a travesty.\n  The tax increase of 1990--the next largest in history after the 1993 \nlaw--passed with a majority of 54 percent in the Senate and 53 percent \nin the House. That was only slightly better. Yet given the size of the \nincrease and the burden it placed on the American economy, it seems to \nme that there should have been greater consensus to pass it, too. \nTaxing away people's hard-earned income is an extraordinary event--or \nat least it should be. However, in Washington, it has become routine.\n  A two-thirds majority vote is, as George Will put it, ``one way of \nbuilding into democratic decisionmaking a measurement of intensity of \nfeeling as well as mere numbers.'' He noted that supermajority \nrequirements are a device for assigning special importance to certain \nmatters, and maybe taxation should be one of them.\n  The last two tax increases were passed without much intensity of \nfeeling at all--without any real consensus that a majority of Americans \nsupported them.\n  Some people might say, fine, there should be consensus, but ours is a \ngovernment of majority rule. I would respond by noting that \nsupermajority requirements are not new to the Constitution. Two-thirds \nvotes are required for the approval of treaties, for conviction in an \nimpeachment proceeding, for expulsion of a member from either body, for \nproposed constitutional amendments, and for certain other actions.\n  If it is appropriate to require a two-thirds vote to ratify a compact \nwith a foreign country, it seems to me that it is certainly appropriate \nto require a two-thirds vote to approve a compact with our own citizens \nthat requires them to turn over a greater share of what is theirs to \nthe Government.\n  I want to quote briefly from one of our Founding Fathers, James \nMadison. He was, of course, a strong supporter of majority rule. Yet he \nargued eloquently that the greatest threat to liberty in a republic \nwould come from unrestrained majority rule. This is what he said in \n``Federalist No. 51'':\n\n       It is of great importance in a republic not only to guard \n     the society against the oppression of its rulers, but to \n     guard one part of the society against the injustice of the \n     other part.\n\n  If Madison were here today, I believe he would conclude, first of \nall, that the Tax Code is oppressive to our people. Americans never \npaid an income tax until early in this century. By 1948, the average \nAmerican family paid only about 3 percent of its income to the Federal \nGovernment. The average family now sends about 25 percent of its income \nto Washington. Add State and local taxes to the mix, and the burden \napproaches 40 percent. That is oppression.\n  Note that Madison also warned, in the quotation I just read, about \npitting one part of America against the rest of the country. That is \nhappening here as well. Certain segments of our society--some call them \nspecial interests--have learned in recent years how to feed at the \npublic trough while spreading the cost among all taxpayers. This cost-\nshifting has left the country with a debt that is $4.9 trillion and \ngrowing. Our Founding Fathers could never have imagined such \nprofligacy, or I believe they would have imposed constitutional limits \non taxing and spending at the very start of the Republic.\n  If you are interested in lobbying reform, I will tell you this: a \ntwo-thirds requirement for tax changes would probably do more to \ncurtail lobbying for special breaks than just about anything else we \ncould do. Since every tax break must be offset with a tax increase on \nsomeone else to ensure revenue neutrality--and the second part of the \nequation, remember, would be out of reach without massive political \nsupport--the two-thirds requirement would make it virtually impossible \nfor special interests to gain special advantage in the Tax Code.\n  Confidence. Stability. Predictability. These are things that a two-\nthirds supermajority would bring to the Tax \n\n[[Page S1368]]\nCode. Combine this with comprehensive tax reform that is aimed at \nsimplifying the law and minimizing people's tax burden, and we could \nsee an explosion of economic growth and opportunity unmatched in this \ncountry for many years.\n  Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting the \ntax limitation amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 49\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as \n     part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States within seven years after \n     the date of its submission by the Congress:\n\n                              ``Article--\n\n       ``Section 1.

Mr. President, the taxpayers will lose one of their \nbest friends in the Department of Defense next month, when Derek J. \nVander Schaaf retires as deputy inspector general.\n  Mr. Vander Schaaf has served as one of the Pentagon's top watchdogs \nfor almost 15 years, since December 1981. During that tenure, Mr. \nVander Schaaf has managed an aggressive program of audit, inspection, \nand investigation which has ferreted out waste, fraud, and abuse in DOD \nactivities, resulting in more than $20 billion of documented savings to \nthe taxpayer.\n  Mr. Vander Schaaf has also provided invaluable assistance to the \nCongress with his honest and forthright comments on DOD's policies and \nprograms. Over the years, Mr. Vander Schaaf has testified before the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, on which I serve, on numerous occasions. He has met \npersonally with me and my staff on many more occasions to brief us on \nDOD programs and proposals. Mr. Vander Schaaf's testimony has always \nbeen informative, and it has often been crucial to the success of our \noversight and investigative efforts.\n  Mr. Vander Schaaf is a forceful advocate of increased competition in \nDOD procurement, independent testing and evaluation of new weapons \nsystems, improvements in DOD financial systems, and increased use of \ncommercially available products and services. We have relied upon his \nsupport in our efforts to eliminate wasteful and unlawful practices \nsuch as excessive inventory spending, abusive off-loading of contracts \nfrom DOD to other agencies, and the improper disclosure of confidential \nprocurement information. The savings from these efforts have been \nsubstantial.\n  Mr. Vander Schaaf has not always been the most popular figure at the \nPentagon. Nobody who takes on as \n\n[[Page S1370]]\nmany issues and makes as many tough calls as he has could be. But this \nis a price willingly paid by one who, like Mr. Vander Schaaf, believes \nthat service to the public and to the taxpayer is the highest \nobligation.\n  And so we thank Mr. Vander Schaaf for his service. We will miss him, \nand the taxpayers will miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1369-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the \nbudget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office \nunder section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for \nSenate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, \nthe first concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough February 13, 1996. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, \nand revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1996 concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. \nRes. 67), show that current level spending is above the budget \nresolution by $15.7 billion in budget authority and by $16.9 billion in \noutlays. Current level is $43 million below the revenue floor in 1996 \nand $5.6 billion above the revenue floor over the 5 years 1996-2000. \nThe current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the \nmaximum deficit amount is $262.6 billion, $17 billion above the maximum \ndeficit amount for 1996 of $245.6 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated January 23, 1996, Congress cleared and \nthe President signed the Gloucester, Massachusetts Marine Fisheries \nLaboratory Act (the targeted CR, P.L. 104-91), two continuing \nresolutions (P.L. 104-92 and P.L. 104-99), the Saddleback Mountain-\nArizona Settlement Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-102), the Telecommunications \nAct of 1996 (P.L. 104-104), the Farm Credit System Regulatory Relief \nAct (P.L. 104-105), the National Defense Authorization Act for 1996 \n(P.L. 104-106), the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act (P.L. 104-\n107), an act to extend certain expiring authorities of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs (P.L. 104-110), and an act to award a Congressional \nGold Medal to Ruth and Billy Graham (P.L. 104-111). These actions \nchanged the current level of budget authority, outlays, and revenues.\n  The report follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 1996.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, George Will recently had a column \nabout our method of punishment in the United States.\n  We have chosen prison as a way to solve our problems of crime, and \nunquestionably, there are many people who commit crimes of violence who \nmust be put into prison.\n  But it is also true that many are in prison who are not there for \ncrimes of violence.\n  Obviously, we should do more to deal with the causes of crime. Show \nme an area of high unemployment--whether it is African-American, \nHispanic-American, or white--and I will show you an area of high crime. \nTo effectively prevent crime, we have to do more in the area of job \ncreation for people of limited skills.\n  The suggestion of shame as a punishment strikes me as being much less \nexpensive and perhaps just as effective. We ought to at least \nexperiment with it.\n  The old stockades that the Puritans used had shame as the main \npunishment.\n  The George Will column, which I ask to be printed at the end of my \nremarks, ought to be considered carefully by people in the penal field.\n  The column follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 1, 1996]\n\n                           The Sting of Shame\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       A New Hampshire state legislator says of teenage vandals, \n     ``These little turkeys have got total contempt for us, and \n     it's time to do something.'' His legislation would authorize \n     public, bare-bottom spanking, a combination of corporal \n     punishment and shaming-degradation to lower the offender's \n     social status.\n       In 1972 Delaware became the last state to abolish corporal \n     punishment of criminals. Most states abandoned such \n     punishments almost 150 years ago, for reasons explained by \n     Prof. Dan M. Kahan of the University of Chicago Law School in \n     an essay to be published in the spring issue of that school's \n     Law Review. But he also explains why Americans are, and ought \n     to be, increasingly interested in punishment by shaming. Such \n     punishment uses the infliction of reputational harm to deter \n     crime and to perform an expressive function.\n       Around America various jurisdictions are punishing with \n     stigmatizing publicity (publishing in newspapers or on \n     billboards or broadcasting the names of drug users, drunk \n     drivers, or men who solicit prostitutes or are delinquent in \n     child support); with actual stigmatization (requiring persons \n     convicted of drunk driving to display license plates or \n     bumper stickers announcing the conviction and requiring a \n     woman to wear a sign reading ``I am a convicted child \n     molester''), with self-debasement (sentencing a slumlord to \n     house arrest in one of his rat-infested tenements and \n     permitting victims of burglars to enter the burglars' homes \n     and remove items of their choosing); with contrition \n     ceremonies (requiring juvenile offenders to apologize while \n     on their hands and knees).\n       In ``What Do Alternative Sanctions Mean?'' Kahan argues \n     that such penalties can be efficacious enrichments of the \n     criminal law's expressive vocabulary. He believes America \n     relies too heavily on imprisonment, which is extraordinarily \n     expensive and may not be more effective than shaming \n     punishments at deterring criminal actions or preventing \n     recidivism.\n       There are many ways to make criminals uncomfortable besides \n     deprivation of liberty. And punishment should do more than \n     make offenders suffer; the criminal law's expressive function \n     is to articulate society's moral condemnation. Actions do not \n     always speak louder than words, but they always speak--always \n     have meaning. And the act of punishing by shaming is a \n     powerful means of shaping social preferences by instilling in \n     citizens an aversion to certain kinds of prohibited behavior.\n       For most violent offenses, incarceration may be the only \n     proper punishment. But most of America's inmates were not \n     convicted of violent crimes. Corporal punishment is an \n     inadequate substitute for imprisonment because, Kahan says, \n     of ``expressive connotations'' deriving from its association \n     with slavery and other hierarchical relationships, as between \n     kings and subjects.\n       However, corporal punishment became extinct not just \n     because democratization made American sensibilities acutely \n     uncomfortable with those connotations. Shame, even more than \n     the physical pain of the lash and the stocks, was the salient \n     ingredient in corporal punishment. But as communities grew \n     and became more impersonal, the loosening of community bonds \n     lessened the sting of shame.\n       Not only revulsion toward corporal punishment but faith in \n     the ``science,'' as it was called, of rehabilitation produced \n     America's reliance on imprisonment. And shame--for example, \n     allowing the public to view prisoners at work--occasionally \n     was an additive of incarceration. It is so today with the \n     revival of chain gangs.\n       Recent alternatives to imprisonment have included fines and \n     sentencing to community service. However, both are \n     inadequately expressive of condemnation. Fines condemn \n     ambivalently because they seem to put a price on behavior \n     rather than proscribe it. The dissonance in community-service \n     sentences derives from the fact that they fail to say \n     something true, that the offenders deserve severe \n     condemnation, and that they say something false, that \n     community service, an admirable activity that many people \n     perform for pleasure and honor, is a suitable way to signify \n     a criminal's disgrace.\n       Sentences that shame not only do reputational harm and \n     lower self-esteem, their consequences can include serious \n     financial hardship. And Kahan argues: ``The breakdown of \n     pervasive community ties at the onset of the Industrial \n     Revolution may have vitiated the stake that many individuals \n     had in social status; but the proliferation of new civic and \n     professional communities--combined with the advent of new \n     technologies for disseminating information--have at least \n     partially restored it for many others.''\n       Today America has 519 people imprisoned for every 100,000 \n     citizens. The figures for Mexico and Japan are 97 and 36 \n     respectively. America needs all the prison cells it has and \n     will need more. But policies of indiscriminate incarceration \n     will break states' budgets: The annual cost of incarceration \n     is upward of $20,000 per prisoner and $69,000 for prisoners \n     over age 60. It would be a shame to neglect cheaper and \n     effective alternatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1371-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1371-S1372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL ENGINEERS WEEK--FEBRUARY 18-24\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the week of February 18-24 has \nbeen designated ``National Engineers Week.'' It is with great pleasure \nthat I rise today to speak in appreciation of the contributions of the \nengineering profession's 1.8 million members.\n  It is fitting that we celebrate National Engineers Week around the \ntime of George Washington's birthday. Our first President was, in many \nrespects, the country's first engineer. Trained as a surveyor and \nengineer, President Washington encouraged private initiatives for \ninvention, technical advancements, and education. He also promoted the \nconstruction of roads, canals, and docks and ports--often with private \ncapital. He also sought appropriate designs for the new Nation's public \nbuildings.\n  The engineering disciplines have had a tremendously positive and \npervasive influence on our society. Their achievements are represented \nin bridges, roads, harbors, canals, and ship channels, and also in our \narchitecture, manufacturing, scientific technology, industrial design, \ntransport, and the delivery of various forms of energy to the Nation's \nfactories, farms, schools, businesses, and homes.\n  Creative engineering is manifest also in the spirit of invention and \nexploration. From the development of new oil drilling equipment to the \nspace program, engineering is a key source of our prosperity. Indeed, \nengineering's achievements are so widespread we tend to take them for \ngranted, but we must not. By acknowledging the accomplishments of the \nNation's engineers we also generate support for engineering education \nand interest in pursuing careers in the profession.\n  Mr. President, the finals of the National Engineers Week Future City \nCompetition are held during this commemorative week. The competition \nfeatures seven teams of seventh and eighth grade students who present \ntheir designs for cities in the 21st century using computer simulations \nand scale models. I want to congratulate all the engineers, teachers, \nand students from each of the regions competing in this demanding \nprocess, and wish each of them well in this contest and in their future \nendeavors.\n  I would also like to particularly salute the more than two dozen \nprominent engineers among the 1996 all stars of the profession who are \nleading others in a variety of activities, from school visits to media \nforum events.\n  Among the 1996 all stars are: Ron Haddock, president and CEO, Fina \nOil and Chemical Co.--Dallas; Tommy Knight, president and CEO, Brown \nand Root--Houston; John Murphy, CEO, Dresser Corp.--Dallas; Stephen D. \nBechtel, chairman Emeritus, The Bechtel Group, Inc.; Dr. Mary Cleave of \nNASA's Goddard Space Flight Center; John H. Gibbons, assistant to the \nPresident for Science and Technology; PBS' Bill Nye, the science guy; \nDr. Arati Prabhaker, director of the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology; and John F. Welch, chairman and CEO, General Electric \nCo.\n\n[[Page S1372]]\n\n\n                  THE RETIREMENT OF BRUNO M. PONTERIO\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to wish great \ncongratulations to Bruno M. Ponterio, who retired on December 22, 1995, \nafter 32 years of dedicated service to the Ridge Street School in Rye \nBrook, NY.\n  Mr. Ponterio was honored on December 12, 1995 by generations of \nstudents, teachers, families, and friends of the Ridge Street School at \na ceremony celebrating his magnificent career. Mr. Ponterio was the \nschool's assistant principal for 7 years and its beloved principal for \n25 years. He announced his retirement in June of 1995 but as a \ntestimony to their love and appreciation for his work, school \nofficials, parents, and children appealed to him to stay on until the \nend of the year.\n  Marked by a constant dedication to the future of both the Ridge \nStreet School and the children who roam its corridors, Mr. Ponterio has \nset an example for educators nationwide. For 32 years he has served as \na role model, a father figure, a leader, and a friend and it is fitting \nthat the Blind Brook Board of Education has decided to rename the \nschool the Bruno M. Ponterio Ridge Street School. I congratulate him on \na wonderful career and on behalf of so many in New York thank him for \nhis years of service and guidance.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in wishing him the \nbest of luck in his much deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1371-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE TRAVELERS AID SOCIETY OF DETROIT\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Travelers \nAid Society of Detroit, MI. The Travelers Aid Society provides many \nneeded and worthwhile services to tens of thousands of residents of \nMetro Detroit.\n  Travelers Aid Society of Detroit assists people in crises related to \nmobility--the homeless, victims of domestic violence, children \ntraveling alone, the physically challenged, and 50,000 travelers each \nyear at Detroit Metropolitan Airport.\n  Through their programs of comprehensive case management, including \nthe Homeward Bound Program, TAS has pioneered the ``Continuum of Care'' \nconcept of helping families and individuals climb out of homelessness. \nHomeward Bound, begun in 1992, was developed with the collaboration of \n38 public and private human service agencies and organizations. To \ndate, more than 500 families have recovered from the effects of \nhomelessness because of the project.\n  TAS has been a pioneering agency in adopting comprehensive case \nmanagement for the human services field. Travelers Aid is also the \nState of Michigan's representative to the Interstate Compact on \nRunaways, helping to return home some 250 runaway youths each year.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in honoring Travelers Aid Society \nfor the fine work it has done for people of the Detroit area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1372-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IN OPPOSITION TO ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, on Saturday afternoon we were all \ntroubled by the announcements that two civilian aircraft belonging to \nthe Brothers to the Rescue, organization had been shot down by a Cuban \nMig-29. This event, described by the President and other world leaders \nas ``abominable'' and ``abhorrent'' is yet another signal that business \nas usual continues in Castro's tyrannical regime.\n  President Clinton has referred to the attack in the press as, ``an \nappalling reminder of the nature of the Cuban regime: repressive, \nviolent, scornful of international law.'' I couldn't agree with him \nmore. However, this action requires more than just a rhetorical \nresponse. Almost a year ago Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, had begun work on legislation designed to \ntighten the embargo and isolate the brutal regime of Fidel Castro. It \nis time for the Congress to complete action on this bill.\n  The President announced a series of actions he proposed in response \nto this unwarranted attack. These included: ensuring that the families \nof the pilots are compensated; imposing restrictions on Cuban nationals \ntraveling in the United States; suspending United States charter \nflights into Cuba; and passing the Helms-Burton Act. The Helms-Burton \nlegislation, referred to as the Cuban Libertad Act, includes a number \nof provisions which would: strengthen international sanctions against \nthe Castro government in Cuba; develop a plan to support a transition \ngovernment leading to a democratically elected government in Cuba; and \nenact provisions addressing the unauthorized use of United States-\ncitizen-owned property confiscated by the Castro government.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to see that President Clinton has \ncommitted to take action on this situation and has decided to support \nthe Cuban Libertad Act. This is a welcome shift in his policy of \nengagement with Fidel Castro, to include steps taken last year to ease \nthe Cuban sanctions.\n  Mr. President, the policy of engagement has failed. Therefore, it is \ntime to complete action on the Helms-Burton bill, the Cuba Libertad \nAct. This is the next step in a long road leading toward releasing \nCastro's dictatorial ties that have bound the people of Cuba.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1372-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1372-S1373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN SERVICE MEMBERS\n\n Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize a courageous group of 1.25 million veterans whose \ncontributions in our victory in the Second World War have gone for too \nlong largely unnoticed. The military policy at that time, of \nsegregation and exclusion from combat roles, would make one believe \nthat there were no African-American combatants in the war against Nazi \nGermany.\n  In late 1944, German forces mounted what would be their final \noffensive in the Belgian Ardennes. This maneuver, later to gain infamy \nas the ``Battle of the Bulge,'' pressed into service 2,500 black troops \nas separate platoons in white companies. Black units, like the 333d \nField Artillery Battalion, would also participate as combatants.\n  These brave young men performed superbly. They were part of the \nvaliant effort to hold off the Germans until help, in the form of \nGeneral Patton's 3d Army, could defeat the last gasp of the Third \nReich.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I feel it \nis so appropriate that we recognize those soldiers who served their \nNation so proudly overseas--despite the second-class treatment they \nthen received here. Specifically I would like to single out a group of \n11 soldiers from the 333d Field Artillery Battalion who made the \nultimate sacrifice in the defense of our Nation.\n  It is common knowledge that the battle in Bastogne saw the massacre \nof American POW's by German troops. The tragedy of Malmedy immediately \ncomes to many minds. The event was well documented and the town's \ninhabitants erected a monument in honor of the troops who were trying \nto deliver their town to freedom.\n  A similar horrible event occurred only 14km away in Wereth. Here the \n11 black soldiers who were executed and tortured there, go almost \nwholly unmentioned in most texts about the fight for Bastogne. Their \nunit had become bogged down in the mire and mud and had suffered \ncasualties from both artillery and Luftwaffe attacks. Much of the unit \nwas captured. These 11 men escaped on foot, armed with only 2 rifles. \nIn the town of Wereth they found refuge with a Belgian family, but were \nlater captured by German troops. Because they refused to tell the \nGermans the identities of Allied sympathizers, they suffered a similar \nfate as their comrades in Malmedy. The Panzer troops first humiliated, \nthen beat, and finally executed the 11 black soldiers.\n  War crimes investigators had no witnesses to the massacre and the \ninquiry was ended. The incident was nearly forgotten after the war.\n  After many years the town of Wereth dedicated a permanent monument to \nthe men who lost their lives to free Belgium and defend liberty.\n  It is long past time that America too learn of and appreciate the \nsacrifice of these soldiers. During this Black History Month let us \ncommemorate the supreme effort and sacrifice of the men of the 333d \nField Artillery Battalion and all patriotic black veterans who \n\n[[Page S1373]]\nhave answered the call to defend this great Nation of ours. Many faced \ncruel prejudice at home and in the military, yet they went on to truly \ndistinguish themselves when their country needed them most. May they \nrest in peace. Thank God for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1372-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WILLIAM D.

HARRY HAMILTON\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today with deep sadness to \npay tribute to the life of an outstanding educator and civil rights \nleader, Dr. Harry Hamilton, who died on Monday, February 5, after a \nbattle with Alzheimer's disease.\n  Dr. Hamilton was most recently Director of the Minority and \nDisadvantaged Student Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison \nCollege of Agricultural and Life Sciences where he had a positive \nimpact on countless people. In this position, Dr. Hamilton helped to \nrecruit minority students to the agricultural program at the University \nof Wisconsin. As a distinguished chemist, Dr. Hamilton was also editor \nof the Madison based Agronomy Journal. Dr. Hamilton's reputation was \none of the reasons the University of Wisconsin is consistently \nrecognized as one of the top public institutions of higher learning in \nthe world.\n  Not only was Harry Hamilton an exceptional educator, he was a leader \nin race relations in my State of Wisconsin. Dr. Hamilton was one of the \nfounders of the Madison, WI, chapter of the National Association for \nthe Advancement of Colored People in the 1940's, and was also the \nchapter's president in the 1940's. As a prominent civil rights leader, \nDr. Hamilton was also a member of the Mayor's Commission on Human \nRights in the 1960's and was chairman, in 1963, of the local chapter of \nthe United Negro College Fund. He was an active member in his church, \nthe First Congregational United Church of Christ and was sent as an \nofficial delegate to the funeral of Martin Luther King in 1968.\n  Dr. Hamilton was born in Talladega, AL, in 1907 where he went to \ncollege and later taught as a chemistry professor at Talladega College. \nDr. Hamilton also attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he \nearned a master's degree in chemistry in 1935 and a Ph.D. in 1948. Yet, \nwith all of these personal accomplishments, Dr. Hamilton's sense of \ncivic responsibility increased. He was a tremendous role model for \nanyone who wants to make their community a better place to live.\n  Dr. Hamilton is survived by his wife of 61 years, Velma, and three \nchildren, Harry Jr., Muriel, and Patricia, who, like Dr. Hamilton, have \nbeen recognized for their contributions to the community. Both Harry \nand Velma Hamilton were awarded the Alexander Company's Civic \nLeadership Award and have been recognized by the Madison Rotary Club \nwith a Humanitarian Service Award for their efforts. The Van Hise \nMiddle School in Madison, WI was renamed Hamilton Middle School in \nhonor of Velma and the school's science lab was named for Harry \nHamilton. The Hamilton family has earned each and every recognition \nthey have received and should serve as a powerful example of true \npublic service.\n  The death of Dr. Harry Hamilton is a loss to all of us. Without his \npresence it is more important today that we focus our efforts on the \nthings that Dr. Hamilton valued. His commitment to family, the students \nhe taught and mentored, volunteerism, and the cause of civil rights \nmust continue if we are to honor his memory. In this way, his legacy \nwill live on for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1373-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SEABEES BATTALION 27\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to commend the great \nservice that was performed by the men of Naval Mobile Construction \nBattalion Twenty Seven in September of 1995 after the tornado that \nransacked Great Barrington, MA in May. Their ability to clear massive \namounts of debris without damage to nearby civilian residences is \nworthy of praise. The dedication and hard work exhibited by each of the \nSeaBees was combined in a solid team effort that succeeded in removing \ndebris and constructing firebreaks in a quick and efficient manner. As \na result, the residents of the Great Barrington area were spared \nfurther destruction and loss.\n  The men of the Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 27, LCDR A.M. \nEdgar, EOC Timothy R.

I wish to \npublicly express my gratitude before the Senate and pay tribute to \ntheir efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1373-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1373-S1374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ONE CHILD AT A TIME\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, usually we insert articles in the \nCongressional Record because we have some specific legislative remedy \nthat the item we insert in the Record supports. In December, I read an \narticle in Newsweek by Margaret Crane and cut it out and put it aside. \nI have just re-read that article. It is the story of one child but \nreally is the story of many children.\n  I do not know what we should do in terms of policy, other than I know \nwe should be more sensitive to children all over this country who have \nenormously serious problems.\n  I am asking that the Crane article be printed in the Record, not with \nthe idea that I have any immediate legislative remedy, but because we \nshould be reflecting on this type of need.\n  The article follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, Dec. 11, 1995]\n\n                          One Child at a Time\n\n                          (By Margaret Crane)\n\n       The 10-year-old came toward me. She looked like a typical \n     preteen: small-boned with a face like a flower, dark eyes and \n     a tiny turned-up nose covered by freckles resembling \n     sprinkles of nutmeg. Her shoulder-length blond hair was \n     pulled back with a black velvet headband. She started talking \n     animatedly about her friends, her favorite subjects in school \n     and how much she loved to ride a 10-speed bike. This was my \n     first meeting with Mary (not her real name) a year ago.\n       The more she talked, the less she resembled the child I'd \n     read about who had lived through torment that most of us \n     never experience in our worst nightmares. She entered the \n     juvenile system five years ago. She had been sexually abused \n     by an uncle, her father and her father's friend. Her divorced \n     mother, an attractive woman who is borderline retarded, is \n     now seeing a man whose children may be be taken from him by \n     the state. The boyfriend has a history of child abuse \n     documented in a report that is longer than a Russian novel. \n     The child's paternal grandfather molested another of his \n     daughters and served time in prison.\n       Since Mary was removed from her home, she has been caught \n     in that purgatory known as protective care and passed around \n     like a stack of papers--three foster homes, two residential \n     treatment centers and eight schools. \n\n[[Page S1374]]\n     Her appearance is deceptive. When I first met her, she was very \n     troubled. She wet her pants and was on medication to control \n     the problem. She behaved sexually toward boys and could get \n     verbally and physically aggressive. She threatened suicide a \n     couple of times and mutilated herself, pulling out her hair \n     or banging her head against a wall during tantrums. With \n     intensive therapy she has learned to better manage her anger.\n       I am Mary's Court Appointed Special Advocate--a voice \n     speaking up for her in court. I'm neither a social worker nor \n     a lawyer, but a trained volunteer assigned by a family-court \n     judge to look out for Mary's ``best interests'' so she \n     doesn't languish in protective custody.\n       I became a CASA after a friend asked me to get involved. \n     She felt that I could empathize with these kids because of \n     the complexities of my own childhood. I agreed to do it and \n     went through 30 hours of training, because as a mother of \n     three healthy kids, I felt I could not ignore other children \n     who are in greater need. My only hesitation was the time \n     commitment. I'm a freelance writer, and I was concerned about \n     juggling two jobs.\n       There are some 37,000 advocates like me across the country. \n     We telephone and visit families, gathering facts to track \n     kids and their parents who get lost in the labyrinth of \n     foster care. CASAs report their findings to judges who often \n     have just minutes to decide where a child will live and for \n     how long.\n       The importance of our work is underscored by the \n     highly publicized death of Elisa Izquierdo, 6, in New York \n     last month. Elisa, living with her father, was returned to \n     her mother after his death last year. Her mother allegedly \n     smashed the child's head against a wall. How do these \n     youngsters fall through the cracks? In my district, social \n     workers may be assigned more than 50 cases, supervisors \n     twice as many. CASA volunteers are assigned only one. We \n     serve, at no cost to taxpayers, as an additional safety \n     net, working alongside a multitude of professionals to try \n     and ensure that children like Elisa do not return to \n     unsafe homes.\n       Elisa's tragedy has spurred me to fight harder to help \n     Mary. Since I took on her case, I've had unique access to a \n     family file filled with incidents of abuse that would sicken \n     the hardest heart.\n       In a summer hearing, the court brushed aside the mother's \n     poor choice of companion and her lack of parenting skills, \n     and moved toward reunifying mother and daughter. The mother's \n     psychological evaluation suggested that she should have her \n     child back as long as they both continue therapy and Mom \n     attended parenting and life-skills classes. Mary was then \n     staying with her mother every other weekend. The judge \n     decided to increase visits by one day a week and assess the \n     case in two months.\n       In September the judge ruled that Mary should return home \n     full time under the legal, watchful eye of the Division of \n     Family Services. Early next year the case will be reviewed \n     for the mother to regain permanent custody. I worry that this \n     decision will be based not only on what's best for the child \n     but on the need to clear an overcrowded docket of a case that \n     has gone on too long and is costing too much.\n       I'm not convinced living with her mother is the safest \n     place for Mary. Mom is a good person who loves her daughter, \n     Mary loves her mother and wants to remain home. But Mom has \n     displayed poor parental judgment in the past. Once she failed \n     to get medical attention for Mary when she injured herself \n     seriously on a visit.\n       From the beginning, I knew reunification was the goal. But \n     I really hoped it might not happen. Those handling the case, \n     including the social worker, therapists, lawyers and I, \n     charted Mary's future: where she'd be safest, have friends \n     and someone to help with her homework. In my opinion, she \n     should be with a paternal aunt who clearly loves her niece \n     and wants to help.\n       In my area, there are some 800 kids who've been removed \n     from their homes and placed in care. Before I became an \n     advocate, I had no idea what happened to these youngsters and \n     never considered how I could help. As more of us fight for \n     these abused and neglected children, perhaps the level of \n     public awareness will be raised and we'll be able to protect \n     more before they're lost forever.\n       I'm still aghast at the judge's recent decision to send the \n     child home full time with Mom pending the final court ruling \n     next year. The county's family services will continue to \n     insist Mary and her mom attend therapy and have intervention \n     services until that time, and I'll continue to monitor the \n     whole family.\n       For the next few months I have a fighting chance to keep my \n     one CASA child safe, if they let me. At least I can comfort \n     myself with the knowledge that as long as I'm on this case, I \n     will do the best that I can with the worst that I have to \n     deal with.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1373-4", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        UNITED STATES CONGRESS-GERMAN PARLIAMENT STAFF EXCHANGE\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, since 1983, the United States \nCongress and the German Parliament, the Bundestag, have conducted an \nannual exchange program for staff members from both countries. The \nprogram gives professional staff the opportunity to observe and learn \nabout each other's political institutions and convey Members' views on \nissues of mutual concern.\n  A staff delegation from the United States Congress will be chosen to \nvisit Germany May 19 to June 1 of this year. During the 2 week \nexchange, the delegation will attend meetings with Bundestag Members, \nBundestag party staff members, and representatives of political, \nbusiness, academia, and the media. Cultural activities and a weekend \nvisit in a Bundestag Member's district will complete the schedule.\n  A comparable delegation of German staff members will visit the United \nStates for 3 weeks this summer. They will attend similar meetings here \nin Washington and visit the districts of congressional Members over the \nFourth of July recess.\n  The Congress-Bundestag Exchange is highly regarded in Germany, and is \none of several exchange programs sponsored by public and private \ninstitutions in the United States and Germany to foster better \nunderstanding of the politics and policies of both countries.\n  The U.S. delegation should consist of experienced and accomplished \nHill staff members who can contribute to the success of the exchange on \nboth sides of the Atlantic. The Bundestag sends senior staff \nprofessionals to the United States. The United States endeavors to \nreciprocate.\n  Applicants should have a demonstrable interest in events in Europe. \nApplicants need not be working in the field of foreign affairs, \nalthough such a background can be helpful. The composite United States \ndelegation should exhibit a range of expertise in issues of mutual \nconcern in Germany and the United States such as, but not limited to, \ntrade, security, the environment, immigration, economic development, \nhealth care, and other social policy issues.\n  In addition, U.S. participants are expected to help plan and \nimplement the program for the Bundestag staff members when they visit \nthe United States. Participants are expected to assist in planning \ntopical meetings in Washington, and are encouraged to host one or two \nstaff people in their Member's district over the July Fourth break, or \nto arrange for such a visit to another Member's district.\n  Participants will be selected by a committee composed of U.S. \nInformation Agency personnel and past participants of the exchange.\n  Senators and Representatives who would like a member of their staff \nto apply for participation in this year's program should direct them to \nsubmit a resume and cover letter in which they state why they believe \nthey are qualified, and some assurances of their ability to participate \nduring the time stated. Applications may be sent to Kathie Scarrah, in \nmy office at 316 Hart Senate Building, by Friday, March 15.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1374-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1374-S1375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE DISPUTE WITH RUSSIA\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to address a recent \ntrade dispute which threatens tens of thousands of American jobs and \nhundreds of millions in American exports.\n  On February 19, the Russian Government notified us that it will soon \nstop importing poultry products if its complaints about American food \nsafety standards are not met. On top of this, what little will enter \nRussia these next few weeks will be subject to a sharp increase in \ntheir taxes on imported poultry.\n  American poultry exports to Russia--our largest poultry export \ncustomer--total more than $700 million a year and represent over 20 \npercent of all American exports to Russia.\n  Mr. President, the Delmarva Peninsula is home to 21,000 poultry \nworkers, produces more than 600 million birds per year, and is a major \nsupplier to the Russian poultry market. Last summer, for example, \nAllen's Family Food, of Seaford, DE, exported 1,300 tons of frozen \npoultry to Russia.\n  At one time or another, I have probably met with every poultry grower \nand processor in my State of Delaware. I've seen every step in the \nprocess, from the poultry house to the packaging plant to the freezers \nat the Port of Wilmington. I'll put the Delaware poultry industry up \nagainst any foreign or domestic challenger in terms of sanitary \nstandards, particularly any Russian plant. \n\n[[Page S1375]]\n\n  But teams of Russian inspectors have come into our country, into our \npoultry processing facilities--including plants such as Manor Farms and \nAllen's Foods in my own State of Delaware--and have failed each and \nevery operation. Literally a 100 percent failure rate.\n  I find this simply unbelievable. This tells me that their real agenda \nis not health and safety. We demand the same standards for the poultry \nwe ship to Russia as we do for poultry which shows up in American \nsupermarkets and on our kitchen tables every day.\n  That's why in recent years, Russia's consumers, particularly in the \ngreat urban centers such as Moscow and St. Petersburg, have bought more \nand more poultry products from America. They recognize a good value \nwhen they see it. We can produce better tasting, more nutritious, less \nexpensive poultry in America, and ship it to Russia, for a lower price \nthan the current Russian poultry industry can. They are still \nstruggling to get out from under the inefficiencies of the old economic \nsystem.\n  If this ban goes into effect, Mr. President, the Russian people will \nlose a major high-quality supplier for a popular staple of their diet, \nand their food bills will go up.\n  The last thing that the Russian economy needs now is an increase in \nthe price of an important food commodity. It is largely because of \ninflation that the ruble, and with it the Russian economy, is in so \nmuch trouble already.\n  And if this ban goes into effect, Mr. President, American poultry \ngrowers and processors, in Delaware and in the rest of the country, \nwill be denied access to an important market. They have earned their \nplace on the shelves of Russian stores through their hard work, know-\nhow, and efficiency. They should not be shut out by some bureaucrats' \narbitrary ruling.\n  Now, Mr. President, I understand that there are a lot of things going \non behind the decision to ban American poultry exports. There is the \nstill powerful pull of the old bureaucratic ways--old habits are hard \nto break, especially when it comes to protecting domestic industries \nfrom the new experience of foreign competition.\n  Here is a good example of how our domestic industry, which has grown \nup in a highly competitive environment, can do well in international \nmarkets. It's no wonder the Russian domestic poultry industry wants \nsome protection, even if it means higher costs and lower quality for \nRussian consumers.\n  Mr. President, here in the United States, arguably the freest market \nin the world, we are in the midst of a heated national debate on \ninternational trade and competition. Just imagine what they are going \nthrough in the states of the former Soviet Union, where competition on \nthe basis of quality and price is a new concept.\n  And this is a Presidential election year over there, too. I know that \nI don't have to explain how the elimination of a major foreign \ncompetitor could fit into an election year agricultural policy.\n  But that is no excuse for the Russian Government's action against \nAmerican poultry producers. We cannot allow this decision to stand.\n  I have spoken to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman directly, and I \napplaud the effort he and his negotiating team have made to resolve \nthis dispute.\n  The Russian Government must be made to understand that these steps \nagainst the United States poultry industry are steps away from the \ninternational economic community they tell us they are eager to join.\n  The IMF has just announced another loan to Russia, worth $10.2 \nbillion. This money is intended to smooth the transition from the old \nCommunist command economy to a more efficient, open, market economy. \nThe terms of the loan include requirements that the Russians continue \nto reform their economy.\n  And as the Russians are well aware, the terms of the loan provide for \nmonthly installments over those 3 years. Evidence of backsliding, of \nreneging on commitments to open the Russian economy, could be grounds \nfor terminating the loan at any point.\n  Russia tells us that they want to join the World Trade Organization \nand America has supported their application to join the WTO. As a \nmatter of fact, right now the United States has a representative on the \nWTO working group that must approve Russia's trade practices.\n  Our representative must make crystal clear to the Russians that \nactions like the bogus ban on American poultry imports violates the \nspirit and the letter of international agreements, such as the WTO.\n  I can't imagine they would want this stain on their record when they \ncome to argue that they are ready to undertake the responsibilities of \nfull participation in the international trading system.\n  But, because this review process could take up to a year, I am asking \nPresident Clinton to appoint an interagency working group to \ninvestigate immediate retaliatory trade actions against the Russians.\n  I sincerely hope that before any such retaliation becomes necessary, \nwe can convince the Russian Government to turn back from the course \nthat they have announced.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1374-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1375-S1376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TELL THE TRUTH ON THE BUDGET\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to draw everyone's \nattention to a column written about 2 weeks ago by Washington Post \nwriter William Raspberry. In ``The Awful Truth About a Tax Cut,'' he \noutlines chapter and verse on how America simply cannot afford a tax \ncut at a time that a fiscal cancer is eating away the country. While \npollster politicians are talking about a tax cut, the debt grows and \ninterest payments on that debt are spiraling out of control.\n  We have to wake up and take responsible action to kill this fiscal \ncancer. Otherwise, the America we know will cease to exist.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Mr. Raspberry's February 12 column be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 12, 1996]\n\n                    The Awful Truth About a Tax Cut\n\n                         (By William Raspberry)\n\n       If telling unpalatable truth is political suicide, Sen. \n     Ernest F. Hollings must have a death wish. He's not just \n     figuratively shouting from the rooftop the politically \n     unspeakable--that there can be no balanced federal budget \n     without a tax increase; he's threatened to throw himself from \n     the rooftop if anybody proves him wrong.\n       ``If anybody comes up with a seven-year balanced budget \n     without a tax increase,'' he said again the other day, ``I'll \n     jump off the Capitol dome.''\n       But surely that's an empty threat. Aren't the White House \n     and congressional Republicans both claiming to have achieved \n     what Hollings says is impossible? Isn't the only substantial \n     difference between them the size of the tax cut? So why isn't \n     Hollings jumping?\n       ``None of the plans they're talking about balances the \n     budget--or comes near it,'' the South Carolina Democrat told \n     me. ``Just the service on the debt is growing so fast it's \n     just not going to be possible without a tax increase.''\n       What masks this painful truth, he says, is a ruse practiced \n     by Democrats and Republicans alike: counting the Social \n     Security trust fund as an asset that reduces the apparent \n     size of the budget shortfall.\n       With the huge ``baby boom'' cohort now paying more in \n     Social Security taxes than current retirees take out, the \n     system is running a theoretical surplus. But this surplus is \n     being spent along with the general revenues for current \n     government expenses. The trust fund gets an IOU that must \n     eventually be redeemed by--guess who?--taxpayers.\n       The point Hollings wants to make, though, is not just that \n     this amounts to dishonest bookkeeping. It is, he insists, \n     also illegal.\n       He ought to know. It was legislation he wrote (along with \n     the late John Heinz ``who did the work on this'') that made \n     it illegal. Nearly six years ago, Congress passed--and \n     President Bush signed into law--Section 13301 of the Budget \n     Enforcement Act that includes this language:\n       ``The concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays \n     and revenue totals of the old-age, survivors and disability \n     insurance programs established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection...''\n       ``That says in plain language they can't use the trust fund \n     to cut the deficit,'' Hollings observes. ``And yet they keep \n     doing it. The president and the Congress like to spend the \n     Social Security money because it makes the budget look like \n     it's moving toward balance. Wall Street likes it because if \n     we don't come scurrying in to borrow from Wall Street, \n     interest rates don't go up.\n       ``But it's illegal, and they know it. I complain, they \n     shrug their shoulders; they call it a `unified budget,' as \n     though that changes something. If they don't like the law, \n     why don't they change it? The truth is they're \n\n[[Page S1376]]\n     afraid to repeal it, and they're afraid to obey it.''\n       Hollings insists it's not wounded pride of authorship that \n     has him shouting into the wind. The important issue is not \n     the technical violation but the disaster it hides. Says \n     Hollings:\n       ``Everybody is wringing their hands about what will happen \n     on Social Security seven years from now, or in the year 2025, \n     or whatever. The problem is here and now. We are broke right \n     now. Not Social Security. Social Security is paid for. \n     Medicare is paid for. It's the general government--defense \n     and the rest of it--that's not paid for. And because it's \n     not, interest on the debt is running about a billion dollars \n     a day. And here's the point: There's just no amount of \n     spending cuts and loophole closings and freezes that is going \n     to produce a savings of a billion dollars a day.\n       ``Unless we raise taxes, we are just `fiddling while Rome \n     burns.' ''\n       He says it, knowing that a call for a tax increase (while \n     his colleagues debate the size of the tax cut) is, if not \n     suicidal, at least politically dangerous.\n       ``Look, we all have to run for reelection, and we all take \n     polls,'' he said. ``To do what I'm doing is sheer stupidity--\n     unless you can get a movement going to face up to what has to \n     be done.''\n       Unfortunately, no such movement seems in the offing. The \n     people are in a mood to punish any politician who tells them \n     the truth as they know the truth to be about our fiscal \n     disorder. It's time to pay the piper. And that's the \n     truth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1375-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PEACEMAKERS ARE UP AGAINST AN UNDETERRED CHINA\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, our policy toward China is, in the \nwords of our colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, one of \nzigzagging.\n  I want to have a good relationship with China, but I do not want it \nat expense of a free Taiwan that has a free press and a multiparty \nsystem.\n  Recently, I read an excellent column by Georgie Anne Geyer, who has \nhad a great deal of experience in the field of international relations.\n  Her comments on the China situation should be of interest to all of \nmy colleagues, as well as their staffs, and I ask that they be printed \nin the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The column follows:\n\n             Peacemakers Are up Against an Undeterred China\n\n       Washington.--Now, let's see if I understand this:\n       Last summer, the more-or-less communist government in \n     Beijing (population China: 1.2 billion) set its People's \n     Liberation Army loose to make Taiwan (population: 21 million) \n     sit up and take notice. First, Beijing stirred things up a \n     bit by conducting ballistic missile tests off the Taiwanese \n     coast--not exactly a neighborly act.\n       Then, the Chinese leaders provided Ambassador Charles \n     Freeman, a specialist on China who was visiting Beijing this \n     winter, with the astonishing news that they were seriously \n     considering launching missile strikes on Taiwan this spring \n     every day for a month. Freeman, who was for many years in our \n     Beijing Embassy, took their warnings most seriously, and in a \n     recent speech at The Heritage Foundation, went so far as to \n     say:\n       ``These exercises are not an empty show of force. They are \n     a campaign of military intimidation that could, and may well \n     as the coming year unfolds, extend into the actual outbreak \n     of combat in the Taiwan Strait and even strikes against \n     Taiwan targets.''\n       So what do our doughty leaders here do? Well, these warlike \n     growls from Beijing did not seem very nice at all (wasn't \n     China supposed to become capitalist now, anyway?). At first, \n     our responses were just the kind the frontal-assault Chinese \n     like to evoke in barbarians: ambiguous. The new American \n     ambassador to Beijing, former Sen. James Sasser of Tennessee, \n     went so far as to suggest, when asked at a press conference \n     in Beijing what the United States would do if the Chinese did \n     attack Taiwan, that, aster all, we had long recognized that \n     Taiwan was a part of China . . .\n       And how the Chinese smiled behind their missiles.\n       Then, for once in the past three years of China-bungling, \n     the administration actually did the right thing. On Dec. 19, \n     it quietly sent the USS Nimitz to the Taiwan Straits, the \n     politically treacherous waterway between Taiwan and China. \n     This was important: It marked the first time American ships \n     had patrolled the straits since the Nixon/Kissinger ``peace'' \n     with China in 1976.\n       It is hard to ignore the Nimitz, if only because the \n     nuclear-powered U.S. carrier comes with five escort ships \n     equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles. But the master chess-\n     playing Chinese also understood perfectly: This was exactly \n     the way they had always played the ``Great Game'' in Asia.\n       Ah, but then the White House got cold feet over having done \n     such an awful thing. ``No, no, not us,'' they said--in \n     effect. ``We didn't send that big bad Nimitz. (Would we do \n     such a thing? Nobody here but us peacemakers.)'' No, the \n     decision to sail in waters that, for political reasons, we \n     had not entered for 17 years had been made by the ship's \n     commander alone--and that was because of bad weather in \n     alternate waters.\n       Now, unfortunately or fortunately, Hong Kong has an active \n     weather bureau, and those officious fellows there immediately \n     took on what was clearly none of their business and said the \n     weather had been just fine in those days. And so the Chinese, \n     who don't know much about us either, wrote the whole thing \n     off as just ``more American lying.''\n       In the end, the threat was dispensed with, the Chinese \n     remained undeterred, and American policy toward China was and \n     is as imprecise and lacking in consensus as ever (Secretary \n     of State Warren Christopher did not even mention the word \n     ``China'' in a recent major foreign-policy address at \n     Harvard).\n       Let us try to make some sense of all this:\n       China and, indeed, all of Asia are at a turning point whose \n     outcome will assuredly shape the form of Asia, and our \n     interests in it, for the next 20 years. In China, as Deng \n     Xiao Ping comes to the end of his life. President Jiang Zemin \n     is becoming more and more hard-line (he has even been wearing \n     the once-hated Mao suits). Increasingly he has been placating \n     the hard-line People's Liberation Army.\n       Gerrit Gong, director of Asian Studies for the Center for \n     Strategic and International Studies here, recently met with \n     the military command in Beijing, and told me that he sees the \n     military pressures on the government as becoming intense. \n     ``The older military feel that the revolution is not over,'' \n     he said, ``and that their comrades' blood must still be \n     vindicated. They want to send a message to Taiwan and Japan \n     that they're still strong.''\n       The Taiwan elections in March, plus Beijing's fear of \n     American recognition of a potentially ``independent'' Taiwan, \n     are what drives the Chinese. With their studied \n     obstreperousness, blended with the constantly reinforced \n     belief that they can bluff this administration, they are \n     playing two games: (1) to threaten and contain the United \n     States, and (2) to diminish the international standing or \n     independent dreams of little, but rich Taiwan.\n       Emboldened by no real American policy--and now assured by \n     the White House that the Nimitz was just ``off course''--\n     Beijing this last week took the first steps toward setting an \n     actual timetable for the ``reunification'' of Taiwan with the \n     mainland--after Hong Kong in 1997 and Macao in 1999. This is \n     serious business.\n       Our former ambassador to Beijing, James Lilley, who \n     understands these games, shakes his head at the seeming \n     ``mystery'' that so many here see in how to deal with them. \n     ``The Nimitz was exactly the right signal to China,'' he told \n     me. ``The sea is our battleground. Actually we are in the \n     catbird's seat--but we are letting ourselves be jerked \n     around.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1376-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1376-S1377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF SPARROW HOSPITAL\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Sparrow \nHospital in Lansing, MI, on its 100th anniversary. Sparrow Hospital has \na long and activist history of serving the people of mid-Michigan.\n  In 1896, a group of dedicated young women met at Lansing's Downey \nHotel to discuss the growing need for a community hospital. Armed with \nsheer determination, the 114 charter members of the Women's Hospital \nAssociation opened an 11-bed hospital. The women's dream of hospital \nownership was realized with the purchase of the James Mead House on \nNorth Cedar Street in 1899.\n  Realizing that a larger health care facility was needed to meet the \ndemands of the growing Lansing area, Edward W. Sparrow, one of \nLansing's pioneer developers, whose wife was a member of the Women's \nHospital Association, donated the $100,000 and land at 1215 E. Michigan \nAvenue to build a new hospital. Two years later, on November 6, 1912, \nthe 44-bed Edward W. Sparrow Hospital opened its doors. At the \ndedication ceremonies, it was avowed that the purpose of the new \nhospital was ``receiving, caring for and healing the sick and injured, \nwithout regard to race, creed or color.''\n  Sparrow Hospital has continued to live up to its avowed purpose. \nSparrow is a not-for-profit organization, guided by volunteer boards, \ncomprised of people who represent a wide spectrum of the community. \nSince 1896, Sparrow has provided care to mid-Michigan residents \nregardless of their ability to pay.\n  Through the efforts of its founders and many others, Lansing's first \nhealth service has grown to become today's Sparrow Hospital. Sparrow \nHospital currently has over 600 physicians, nearly 3,000 associates and \n1,400 volunteers in a comprehensive health system for an eight-county \npopulation of nearly 1 million people. Each year, Sparrow Hospital \ntreats over 120,000 people.\n\n[[Page S1377]]\n\n  The spirit of volunteerism has made Sparrow Health System a very \nspecial organization, an organization where service to the community \ncomes first. I know that my Senate colleagues join me in honoring \nSparrow Hospital on its 100th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/27/senate-section/article/S1376-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1996\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
