Mr. President, I have asked for, and received, this time \ntoday so a good many Members of the Senate can talk about one of the \nmost important issues that the Senate will consider this year; that is, \nthe issue of tax cuts. And certainly promises made are promises to be \nkept.\n  Those of us in the Republican Party are absolutely committed to \nproviding a budget package that will produce a respectable tax cut to \nthe American people, and especially to American families--families and \nfamily groups--who for some years have not received the benefit of the \nkind of consideration under our current tax law that we think they \nought to. Certainly no policy of the Federal Government, no Federal \nlaw, should conflict or make it difficult for the family unit of our \nsociety to exist, and we believe the current tax structure does just \nthat.\n  This special order this morning will be conducted by two Senators who \nhave led the issue of family tax cuts and family consideration, Senator \nCoats and a freshman Senator who was one of the leaders in the House in \nthe past few years on this key issue, Senator Grams.\n  So at this time, I yield to Senator Coats to allocate the time \naccordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Idaho for his introductory \nstatements, for his support for this effort, and for yielding the time \nto Senator Grams and me.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Coats, Mr. Grams, Mr. Kyl, and Mrs. Hutchison \npertaining to the introduction of S. 572 are located in today's Record \nunder ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, could I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Indiana, \nthere is no time remaining.

Mr. President, we hope later today to be bringing to the \nfloor the line-item veto. Senator McCain and I are leading that effort. \nWe are in final stages of negotiation as to the final form of the \nlegislation. It is something that has been discussed at length over the \npast several years. Senator McCain and I have offered it alternately \nand jointly several times. We have not been able to secure the \nnecessary 60 votes to break a filibuster on the line-item veto or to \nsecure a budget waiver.\n  This is the year we believe that it is time for the Senate and time \nfor the Congress to fulfill its commitment to the American people on an \nitem that an overwhelming majority of the American people support. Poll \nafter poll show the support for line-item veto in the 70 to 80 percent \nrange; 43 Governors enjoy the line-item veto and have for many, many \nyears and have effectively demonstrated that it works in their State.\n  Line-item veto is simply a measure by which the President can provide \na check and balance against the gaming that Congress has engaged in on \nappropriations bills, in particular, and also on tax bills, I would \nsay, in terms of attaching an item that has not been exposed to the \nlight of debate on that item and a separate vote on that item, but has \nbeen attached to an otherwise necessary appropriations bill or tax bill \nthat is being sent to the President.\n  Under the current law, the President has only one of two options: \nEither accept the entire bill as it is written--sometimes it covers \nthousands of items--either accept that or reject the entire bill. So \nthe President, in a sense, is being held in a position that some will \ndescribe as blackmail but others will say is at least extraordinarily \ndifficult because it allows Members of Congress, when they see a \npopular bill moving through the Congress, to attach an item that could \nat best be described as pork barrel, an item that does not benefit the \nnational interest, but an item that goes to the benefit of a very \nselected parochial interest.\n  We are annually embarrassed by the disclosure in the popular news \nmedia of some of the items that have been attached to these bills. \nConstituents say, ``How in the world could you pass that? How in the \nworld could you allow a grant that studies the well-being of America's \nlawyers? How could you pass something that would allow the study of the \nbathing habits of South American bullfrogs? How in the world could it \nbe made a priority the expenditure of money to refurbish the Lawrence \nWelk Museum,'' and on and on and on it goes, schools in France, special \nbridges, special buildings--items that go toward, I suppose, pleasing a \nselected constituency in someone's congressional district or someone's \nState, but certainly would not fall within the list of priorities and \nreceive, I believe, a majority vote if that specific item was debated \non the floor of the Senate and voted on.\n  But Members know, if a bill is rolling through here that provides \nnecessary funds for the Department of Defense, as this supplemental \nappropriations bill we have been dealing with this week does, or a \nmeasure provides earthquake relief or hurricane relief for either \nCalifornia or Florida or other parts of our country, or if a measure \ngoes to fund something popular or needed or necessary health care \nmeasures, veterans' benefits, whatever, they know that the President is \ngoing to find it very, very hard to veto that entire bill to get rid of \nthe extra pork that is attached to that bill.\n  And so the President's only choice is to veto the whole thing and \nsometimes, as a consequence of that, shut down the entire Government or \naccept the bill, and more likely than not, he has to accept the bill.\n  Line-item veto gives the President the opportunity to say, ``I'll \ntake that bill, but I won't take this special interest provision that \nis on line 16 of page 273, and I'm going to line-item veto that \nparticular item.''\n  This is a check and balance on what I would say are the egregious \nhabits of Congress to accomplish in the dark of night without the light \nof debate, without the risk of a yea-or-nay vote on a particular item, \nto accomplish something that could never be accomplished in full debate \nand with a vote. It is designed to check that practice.\n  Congress, if it thinks that the President has not followed its \nwishes, can bring that item up, because under the Constitution, if the \nPresident vetoes an item, we can override that item. Yes, it takes a \ntwo-thirds vote. It ought to be harder to spend the taxpayers' dollars, \nparticularly on those items that the executive branch does not think \nare appropriate and have not had the normal process of authorization \nand debate and vote so that their constituents, our constituents, know \nwhere we stand on these particular items. That is the whole concept and \npurpose behind line-item veto.\n  The President of the United States has supported line-item veto. Some \npeople have said, ``Why would Republicans want to give a Democratic \nPresident the line-item veto?'' We think the Presidency deserves that \nauthority to check the excessive and unnecessary, unwarranted spending \nhabits of Congress that do not follow the normal procedures in devising \nthese spending items.\n  So we will be debating that. I expect the debate to be fairly fierce. \nWe probably will get a filibuster on our efforts. This is the year, \nthough, that if we are going to fulfill our commitment to the American \npeople to make substantive changes in the way we do business, this is \nthe year to do it.\n  We will hear all kinds of excuses about delegation of power and will \nthis really work and how much will this save. I guarantee you, it will \nsave more than if we do nothing. This is a debate between the status \nquo, let us keep doing things the way we are doing them; oh, we will \npromise to change, we will promise to do it differently, we will summon \nthe will, we will do what is necessary--no, we will not, because we \nhave not. Year after year, decade after decade, promises--just \nrhetoric--no reality, no fulfillment of the promise.\n  This is the time. I am deeply and bitterly disappointed that we could \nnot pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. That would \nhave provided the mechanisms by which we can eliminate this debt which \nwould force us to own up to our responsibilities, which we have not \ndone over the past several decades. But at the very least let us enact \nline-item veto so that we can get at some of this problem and so that \nwe can restore credibility with the American people that we are \nresponsible in handling their money and we can eliminate this practice \nof providing pork-barrel spending that never gets the debate it \ndeserves and is never subjected to a vote.\n  Mr. President, we will be talking a lot about that later. I think my \n5 minutes has about expired. Given the fact no one was available to \nspeak, I thought it might be more interesting than a quorum call.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] is recognized to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/16/senate-section/article/S4002-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4002-S4004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TAX CUT PROPOSALS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was intending to come to the floor today \nto speak briefly about the work that is going on in the other body in \nwhich the majority party is proposing a tax cut of nearly $200 billion \nover the coming 5 years. So I listened with some interest to the \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate about the formation of something \ncalled a 500 Club, apparently a group of Senators who feel that the \nSenate also should move quickly on a tax cut.\n  I was especially interested in a couple of things. I was interested \nin the fact that at least a couple of the speakers this morning were \nthe same speakers who were on North Dakota radio programs in recent \nweeks talking about the need for a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget. They talked about their desire to balance the Federal \nbudget, the fact that they were the willing warriors, willing to stand \nup and fight and do the right things and have the courage to cut \nspending to balance the Federal budget.\n  All this is very curious to me. There must be some arithmetic book \nsomewhere in America that tells us that if you are in a very big \nfinancial hole, what you ought to do is just keep digging. It seems to \nme, if you are in a very big hole, you stop digging and \n[[Page S4003]] start trying to figure a way out of it. And you do not, \nit seems to me, whether you run a business, whether you are operating \nyour own family financial situation, or whether you are trying to \nmanage the fiscal affairs of the Federal Government, decide that the \nway to address a serious deficit problem is to cut revenue.\n  I guess if the question is should we reduce taxes, should we try and \nfigure out what is popular and then stand up and proclaim ourselves for \nthat, I would say sign up most of the Members of the Senate; they sure \nwant to do the popular thing. It is the easy thing to do. But I guess \nthe question these days is not so much what is popular but what is \nright.\n  I also noted this morning that in this Chamber there rested on an \neasel several charts that showed the popularity of the proposed tax \ncuts. Obviously, people have done polling, and it shows if the American \npeople are asked the question, ``Would you like a $500 tax credit per \nchild,'' the answer is overwhelmingly ``Yes.'' ``Would you like an \nexpanded IRA program?'' The answer is, ``Oh, yes.''\n  Well, I happen to think that some of those things are worthy goals. I \nwould likely support some of those initiatives in the future. But is it \nbelievable that those who proclaim most loudly in this Chamber that \nthey are for a balanced Federal budget are the first ones to come to \nthis floor with their charts showing what their polls have shown--that \ntax cuts are popular? So now they say, ``Now we are forming a club for \ntax cuts.'' What happened to balancing the budget?\n  Is 2 weeks a lifetime in the memory of those who proclaim that we \nneed to balance the budget? I happen to think we ought to balance the \nbudget. I happen to think we also ought to be serious about it. I think \nit is more than just posturing. I think it is performing. I think it is \nheavy lifting. And the fact is those who now say our next step in \nbalancing the Federal budget is to cut Federal revenue I think just \nmissed the basic arithmetic class.\n  Now, I understand that they say, well, this is a families first plan. \nI refer to the Joint Committee on Taxation. The Joint Committee on \nTaxation did an analysis that was disclosed on Monday, and it said that \nthree times as much of the proposed tax breaks will go to those earning \nover $100,000 a year as will go to those earning under $100,000 a year. \nSo this is for families, apparently wealthy families, or at least it is \nweighted in a way to give most of them to those who already have \nsubstantial income and substantial wealth. It's an unusual way of \ndefining families.\n  I guess there is nothing wrong with that, if that is what one \nbelieves, but it seems to me, if we were in a situation where a tax cut \nwould be the first step to balance the budget--and I cannot conceive of \nthat being the case, but if we were in that position, it seems to me, \nif one were interested in families, one would construct an approach \nwhich says the bulk of this benefit will go to working families in this \ncountry, not that the bulk of the benefit will go to the wealthy \nfamilies.\n  Every time you stumble through the forest and come across a stream, \nit seems to run in a predictable direction, and that is what happens in \nthis Chamber. It is hard to break bad habits.\n  I came here in 1981, serving in the House of Representatives, and I \nrecall the discussion about the tax cut proposal then. The tax cut \nproposal was going to balance the Federal budget. An economist named \nLaffer told us so, and of course it turned out to be a laugher. He is \nstill an economist, but trillions of dollars of debt have piled up as a \nresult of faulty economic strategy. And so we had a very large tax cut \nand a very significant Federal deficit, and the American people will \nend up paying for that.\n  The question now is, at a time when our country suffers from a very \nsubstantial deficit and a massive accumulated debt, what do we do to \ndeal with it? Some say, ``Well, let us change the U.S. Constitution and \nthat will deal with it.'' Of course, it will not. You can change the \nConstitution 2 minutes from now and 4 minutes from now the debt and \ndeficit will be exactly the same as it was when you started.\n  Cutting the deficit will require individual actions by Members of the \nSenate and the House. Those individual actions must be, it seems to me, \na combination of several approaches. You either need less spending or \nmore revenue or a combination of both. But it seems to me incredible \nthat the first step out of the box, for those who spent the last month \ntalking about how desperately they wanted to change the American \nConstitution and how fervently they wanted to balance the Federal \nbudget, is to say we are going to do that now by reducing the Federal \nGovernment's revenue.\n  I know they will stand up and say, ``Well, you are heartless. Gee, \ndon't you think that tax cuts matter to families?\"\n  Yes, they do. I understand the genesis of all this. This is about \npolls and popularity. This is about doing the easy thing and also, \nincidentally, doing the wrong thing. I do not think the President ought \nto propose tax cuts, and I do not think the majority party of the House \nor Senate ought to propose them. And I do not think anybody on this \nside of the aisle ought to propose them either. Our job at this point \nis to deal responsibly with the Federal budget deficit. We ought to cut \nspending and use the money to cut the deficit. When we have done that \njob and only then should we start talking about cutting revenue.\n  Let me say that again because I think it is important. I know the \neasiest thing is to sort of waltz over to the floor and talk about our \nnew plan to cut taxes. Well, gee, that is popular, but it is wrong. Our \nfirst responsibility is to decide to cut Federal spending, and all of \nus ought to be involved in that. And I would say to my friends on the \nmajority side of the aisle that many of them have a willingness to do \nthat. I applaud them for it. And I think many on our side of the aisle \nhave a similar willingness to cut Federal spending. Cut Federal \nspending and use the savings to cut the Federal deficit. When we have \nfinished that job, and only when we have finished that job, should we \nthen decide that it is time to cut some taxes.\n  I think a number of the proposals to cut taxes are good proposals and \nhave merit, and I would support them under the right circumstances at \nthe right time. But I have to say that to hear again today and to hear \nfor the last several weeks those who were boasting the loudest about \ntheir determination to cut the Federal deficit and to change the \nConstitution to do so, to hear this I think misses a few steps along \nthe way in our desire in this country, in our understanding that we \nmust in this country reduce the Federal deficit. They then come to the \nfloor a week or two later and say, now, our next step is not to push \nfor a constitutional amendment; our next step is to push for a tax cut, \nand then they come to the floor and put charts all over the back of \nthis room to tell us how enormously popular these tax cuts are.\n  Well, spend some more money for those polls and tell us something we \nknow next time. We know that. Tax cuts are enormously popular. So poll \nagain. Spend a little more money and put up another chart. Tax cuts are \npopular.\n  The popular thing is not always the right thing. The right thing at \nthis point is to understand the bull's eye of this target. The bull's \neye is to deal with the Federal budget deficit. And most people back \nhome in Montana, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and elsewhere, in my judgment, \nbelieve the responsible approach would be to aggressively cut spending, \nuse the money to aggressively cut the deficit and then turn to the next \nitem on the agenda which would be to find ways to change this Tax Code \nthat give some benefit to families, that preserve an incentive for \nsavings.\n  Understand that I am not someone who objects to the goal. But I am \nsomeone who believes that this is the wrong time. This is the wrong \ntime for this kind of policy to be proposed to this Congress. I would \nalso say when we talk about things like the capital gains tax cut and \nwe say this is just for families out there, I am going to give them a \nchance at some point to show if it is for families. We will find out if \nit is for families. I am going to offer an amendment.\n  If we really have, at this point, some discussion about capital \ngains, I am going to offer an amendment and say: OK, let us have \ncapital gains; you have \n[[Page S4004]] the votes to have capital gains. I will give you an \namendment that says you can take up to $1 million in capital gains \nduring your lifetime, but no more than $1 million. Of course, $1 \nmillion does not mean very much to the people in this country who are \ngoing to benefit from the suggestions we are seeing, but I want to see \nwho supports families that have less than $1 million and who supports \nfamilies that have more. Because if we are going to construct tax cuts \nthat help families, let us target them, let us help American families \nwho are out there working and struggling and trying to make ends meet.\n  Again I say, at the risk of being overly repetitive this morning, I \nhope all of those who spent the last couple of months talking about the \ndangers of the Federal deficit would stay in harness and be part of the \nteam, keep marching and keep pulling when it comes to dealing with the \ndeficit. We must not be diverted by polls and charts and by the \nattractiveness of deciding now is the time, with the kind of deficit we \nhave, to propose nearly $200 billion in tax cuts during the coming 5 \nyears.\n  I read my children children's books from time to time. They love the \nBerenstain Bears. The one I read them most often, perhaps, is the ``The \nBerenstain Bears Get the Gimmies,'' and in that book the parents can \nsimply never seem able to control the habit of the Berenstain cubs \nsaying ``Gimmie this, gimmie that, gimmie this.'' It is the way I feel \nabout the tax cut proposals in the House and Senate by people who talk \nabout the need to deal with the deficit and come to the floor saying: \nGimmie this tax cut, gimmie that tax cut because it will gain favor \nwith the American people.\n  That is not what this is all about, it seems to me. Our \nresponsibility is to do the right thing. And I hope it will be agreed \nby everyone in this Chamber that the right thing is to aggressively \nwork to cut Federal spending and then to decide to use that savings to \ncut the Federal budget deficit, and then, when we finish that job, to \ndecide that we will turn our attention to dealing with the tax issues \nas they affect families--yes, all American families, and, yes, families \nthat work and struggle and spend most of their day trying to make ends \nmeet. That, it seems to me, represents the priorities all of us have an \nobligation to pursue here in this Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

Mr. President, I have a couple of comments I wanted to \nmake, a couple in response to the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota and also one concerning line-item veto.\n  We heard from the Senator from Indiana many of the good things that \nwould come in terms of accountability with the adoption of a \nresponsible line-item veto for our procedure here in this Chamber. I \nsuggest he may have overlooked one thing.\n  It is true the President of the United States, whether he is a \nRepublican or a Democrat, whether he is a liberal or a conservative, \nwould be held accountable for those things in which he really believed. \nIf you look at a spending bill that goes to the desk of the President \nof the United States that has 100 unrelated spending matters in it, \nthere is pork for all the favorites, yet there may be something in \nthere for veterans benefits. So he will stand up and say, ``I am \nagainst all this pork but I have to sign it because I am for the \nbenefits for veterans. They are well deserved.'' If we had line-item \nveto, he can support those things he proclaims to support and reject \nthose that he proclaims to reject.\n  But the one thing that was not articulated by the Senator from \nIndiana is it also makes us more accountable, in that once you veto one \nitem and that item is sent back to the Senate and to the House, it \nforces those Members to get on record so they can no longer answer \ntheir mail saying I was really against all those pork projects but I \nhad to do it for the veterans.\n  So I think the name of the line-item veto is really accountability \nfor the President as well as for the Members of the House and the \nMembers of the Senate.\n  As far as the families first bill, I would only like to suggest, if \none heard the complete presentation on this bill, he would see this \ncould be accomplished and we could balance the budget by the year 2002, \nhave the tax relief for the families, and at the same time have a \nslight growth in Government--not cut any Government programs.\n  I think it was well articulated by the Senator from Minnesota that, \nif we had a 2-percent growth cap, this would accomplish what we are \ntrying to accomplish. But when you look at some of the tax cuts that \nare going to be suggested in the families first bill, you have to go \nbeyond the economics of it and look at the social aspects. It is a fact \ntoday that a family of four making $25,000, living together happily--if \nthat family, the man and wife, should get a divorce and continue to \ncohabit out of wedlock, and each become the head of a household, they \ncan increase their take-home pay by 13 percent. That is the issue we \nare trying to get to.\n  The unfairness of the earnings test for our senior citizens in \nAmerica--I have had people come to me in town hall meetings and say, \n``For the first time in my life I have been forced to be dishonest \nbecause I am not reporting income that I am making, because I do not \nthink it is right for the Government to come along and say I cannot \nhave the Social Security I was entitled to because I want to remain \nproductive after age 65.''\n  So I hope when people are considering the families first bill and the \nvarious tax cuts on the American family--all ages of that family--that \nthey consider there are aspects other than economic aspects to be \nconsidered.\n  Since the 1960's we have gotten ourselves into a position where \nfamilies are no longer important, no longer relevant, no longer \nsignificant. This is what the revolution of November 8 was all about. \nWe are going to reverse that.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am going to take some leader time. We \nare, hopefully, about to come to some agreement on the business of the \nday, but until that happens I have a statement I wish to make on \nanother matter.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/16/senate-section/article/S4004-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4004-S4005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MISSOURI RIVER MASTER MANUAL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last week, Senator Baucus introduced the \nMissouri River Water Control Equity Act. I have cosponsored that bill \nbecause all the analysis of the current master manual guidelines for \nmanaging the dams along the Missouri River that I have seen confirms \nthat change in the corp's management of the river is long overdue.\n  The assumptions about economic uses that drive the management of the \nriver have not been seriously reexamined or revised in 50 years. In \nthose 50 years, times and conditions have changed dramatically. But the \nmanagement of the river has not kept pace.\n  In 1992, the General Accounting Office noted that the master manual \nfor operating the dams is outdated. GAO concluded that the corps has \nbeen managing the river based on ``assumptions about the amount of \nwater needed for navigation and irrigation made in 1944 that are no \nlonger valid.''\n  According to GAO, ``the plan does not reflect the current economic \nconditions in the Missouri River Basin.''\n  The Corps of Engineers, caught between the competing self-interest of \nthe upstream and downstream States, has recommended only modest \nrevisions in the master manual. In May 1994, the corps selected a \n``preferred alternative,'' which calls for shortening the navigation \nseason by 1 month and a higher spring flow rate.\n  Given the conditions that now exist along the Missouri River, these \nchanges are clearly insufficient to equitably distribute the economic \nbenefits of the river. For example, shortening the navigation season by \nonly 1 month means that the concerns of the \n[[Page S4005]] navigation industry--which accounts for less than 1\\1/2\\ \npercent of the economic benefits of the river--will continue to drive \nmanagement of the river for the foreseeable future.\n  A recent review of the master manual revision by the Environmental \nProtection Agency found that more emphasis should be placed on \nrecreation and less on navigation. EPA concluded that, ``The preferred \nalternative identified in the draft environmental impact statement is \nlikely to result in little, if any, improvement to the Missouri River \necosystem.''\n  Navigation is a declining $15 million industry. Recreation in the \nupstream States is a growing industry worth more than $50 million \ntoday. Continuing to give clear precedence to navigation cannot be \njustified.\n  And while I am intrigued by the corps' proposal to increase the \nspring rise to more closely mimic natural flow conditions, I am \nconcerned about possible impacts on bank erosion. The Missouri River \nhas for years been plagued by bank erosion and siltation, which slowly \nbut inexorably takes productive land from the shores and deposits it in \nthe river, smothering fisheries and reducing\n the hydroelectric generating potential of the dams. It is critical \nthat the corps develops and implements a systematic plan to reduce \nerosion along the river.\n\n  Under current management conditions, the four upstream States, \nMontana, Wyoming, South Dakota, and North Dakota--States that \nsacrificed prime river bottom land for the construction of dams--\nreceive 32 percent of the benefits from the river. The four downstream \nStates receive 68 percent of the economic benefits. To illustrate how \nminor are the corps' proposed changes to the master manual, under the \nreferred alternative, downstream States continue to receive 68 percent \nof the economic benefits.\n  Times have changed. Management must change with them. In the business \nworld, management that fails to adjust to changing conditions does not \nsurvive. The corps should strive to better reconcile the management of \nthe river with the economic conditions that exist today.\n  Given the results of the GAO report, the corps' own evaluation, and \nthe EPA review of that analysis, the proposed revisions in the master \nmanual should have gone much farther. Greater consideration should have \nbeen given to increasing the permanent pool from its current level of \n18 million acre-feet. It is clear that there are significantly greater \nrecreation and wildlife habitat benefits at higher permanent pool \nlevels. Given the immense and growing economic value of recreation in \nthe upstream States, the management priorities for the river need to \nchange.\n  I intend to do everything possible to encourage the corps to \nrecognize the changes and trends in the use of the river and to develop \nmore defensible management guidelines. The bill introduced last week is \na first step. It focused a beam of light on this process and reveals \nthe long-overdue changes that should be made.\n  This process will be long and arduous. To succeed in achieving \nmeaningful change, a great deal more education and discussion will be \nrequired. I hope that my colleagues will approach this issue with an \nopen mind and allow their judgment to be guided by objective analysis \nof the conditions today, rather than by memories of what they were 50 \nyears ago.\n  In the end, management policy for the river should be driven by facts \nand reason and a desire for equity. I am confident that if those are \nthe criteria employed, more serious and defensible change will \ncertainly result.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask that I may speak as in morning \nbusiness for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 3 weeks ago, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, of which I am a member, held a very interesting hearing on \ndrug trafficking and the increase of drug use in the United States. I \nwould like to say a few words on the subject.\n  California has now replaced Florida as the major point of importation \nof cocaine in the United States. The California Bureau of Narcotics \nEnforcement reports that 80 percent of the clandestine methamphetamine \nmanufacturing labs seized and dismantled in the United States are in \nCalifornia. More illegal drugs are coming into this Nation today than \never before. And Federal efforts at stopping the flow of drugs into \nthis Nation are simply inadequate.\n  Last week, I met with the head of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, Thomas Constantine, who told me that the DEA knows of \nat least forty 727-sized planes controlled by the Cali drug cartel in \nColombia being used to smuggle cocaine into this country--forty 727-\nsized planes. Most of these planes are offloaded in northern Mexico, \nand drugs are moved across the California border and other Southwest \nborders.\n  Mr. Constantine also indicated to me that the Cali drug cartel's net \nprofit last year was $7 billion, that the cartel controls the air \ntraffic control system of Colombia, that they control the phone \ncompany, which allows them to backtrack and tape all phone calls, and \nthat they are first-rate practitioners of intimidation and violence.\n  Consider just some of the following, Mr. President. Cocaine smuggled \nacross the California line accounts for at least 70 percent of the \ndrugs sent over the entire Southwest border by rings based in Mexico, \nmaking the State the prime staging area for the shipment of cocaine \nfrom cartels in Colombia and other South American countries.\n  Last year, the amount of cocaine seized coming across the United \nStates-Mexican border plummeted, and not a single pound of cocaine was \nconfiscated from the more than two million trucks that passed through \nthree of the busiest entry points along the Southwest border--Laredo \nand El Paso in Texas, and Nogales in Arizona.\n  According to the Los Angeles Times, only 3.7 percent of laden trucks \nare comprehensively inspected at three San Diego-area ports of entry. \nThe average rate along the entire Southwest border is 11.4 percent. \nHowever, last year, laden trucks crossing the border increased 51 \npercent, and empty trucks increased 38 percent.\n  Let me say clearly, I believe current Federal efforts to stop the \nentry of illegal drugs are not working.\n\n\n                        The Line Release Program\n\n  Let me describe one example of the failure of the Federal Government \nto stop drug smuggling. It's called the line release program. I believe \nthis program should be discontinued immediately pending an evaluation \nof its effectiveness. Three weeks ago, I wrote to Secretary Robert \nRubin making that recommendation.\n  The line release program was created in 1986 to expedite commerce \nentering the United States from Canada. In recent years, the program \nwas expanded to the Mexican border as well.\n  Under the line release program, so-called low-risk United States \ncompanies are permitted to ship goods from Mexican manufacturers \nwithout inspection. But the line release program has had a major \nunintended effect. In the single-minded pursuit of increased commerce, \nmore trucks and commercial vehicles are being waved through border \ncheckpoints without being inspected. The result: The amount of illegal \ndrugs coming across the border is higher than ever before.\n  According to a Los Angeles Times story from February 13, 1995, since \nthe line release program was implemented, shipments of goods have \nincreased dramatically at four critical points of entry along the \nUnited States-Mexico border--Laredo and El Paso in Texas, Nogales in \nArizona, and San Diego in California. Yet, even as the number of \nshipments increased, the rate of inspections and drug seizures \ndecreased dramatically.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this Los Angeles Times story be printed \nin the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [[Page S4006]] (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The same Los Angeles Times story states that not 1 \nsingle pound of cocaine was seized at three of the major points of \nentry into the United States in 1994. Not 1 pound.\n  One local official reportedly said:\n\n       Obviously, we're in an area of international trade. We're \n     not in a situation where we can just stop traffic for the \n     sake of narcotics risk. . . We examined three percent of all \n     the laden trucks that crossed. That is a lot of trucks.\n\n  Right? Wrong.\n  My view is quite different. Increased commerce does not justify \nincreased drug smuggling. It is time to close down our border to \nillegal immigrants and to illegal drug smuggling. It is unacceptable to \nhave a Federal program in place that comprehensively checks just 3 \npercent of the trucks coming across the border where we know the \nhighest level of drug smuggling occurs.\n  Let me give you an idea of one incident in California. This past \nNovember, 5 tons of cocaine was headed to a home in Rialto in San \nBernardino County. I am not talking about bags of cocaine. I am not \ntalking about pounds of cocaine. I am not talking about kilograms of \ncocaine. I am talking about tons--5 tons in 1 shipment going to one \nhouse in Rialto, California. That is the level on which drug smuggling \nis now taking place.\n  On February 27, 1995, I sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Rubin \nasking the administration to discontinue the line release program in \nCalifornia pending an immediate evaluation of its capability to seek \nout and confiscate drugs coming across the border.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Recently, I asked the Customs Service, particularly \nthe Director of Customs, for a complete list of the more than 10,000 \nindividuals and companies that have been approved to participate in \nthis so-called line release program. I have yet to be provided with \nthat list.\n  In addition, this past Friday, I wrote to Secretary Rubin regarding a \nMarch 10 story in the Associated Press.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter and the Associated Press \nstory be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Associated Press story to which I \nrefer cited two particularly alarming items.\n  First, the owner of a harbor warehouse in Los Angeles who continues \nto this day to profit from a Customs Service inspection station located \non his property, even though he is currently under federal indictment \non charges of bribing an immigration agent $10,000 for false documents \nfor himself and employees.\n  Second, the Treasury Department inspector general's office has failed \nto secure a single indictment of a Federal official in the western \nregion in the last 5 years, despite numerous allegations of wrongdoing.\n  The inspector general's office, which is responsible for \ninvestigating criminal offenses at the Customs Service and other \nagencies within the Treasury Department, has been successful in other \nregions of the country, having obtained 14 felony convictions in the \nNortheast region, 8 in the Southern region, and 1 in the Central \nDivision--but none in the Western region where the problem is the most \nserious.\n  These allegations are very disturbing, and I believe they deserve the \nfull and immediate attention of the Justice Department.\n\n\n                          Operation Hard Line\n\n  The Clinton administration recently announced a new Federal \ninitiative to address the problem of cocaine smuggling across the \nsouthwest border. This effort, termed ``Operation Hard Line,'' will \ntransfer between 40 and 80 Customs agents to the southwest border, \ndirect new funds toward needed resources and technology, and focus with \ngreater intensity on intelligence-gathering and assessment.\n  It is too early to say if Operation Hard Line will have an impact. \nBut I am very skeptical. The problems at the border are simply too \ngreat for Band-Aid solutions.\n  Enforcing the border is a Federal responsibility and the fact is that \nthe job is not being adequately performed.\n  The Federal Government must take strong action and make a long-term \ncommitment to go after drug traffickers. The administration must demand \nthat Mexico assist the United States in this effort in every way, as \nthis Nation is assisting Mexico in so many other areas.\n  Forty 727-size planes constantly land in northern Mexico, offload \ntons of cocaine, and move them through our borders. How this happens \nand how we are going to stop it is something we must address. We cannot \ntolerate corruption at high levels in the Government of Mexico as is \nnow being written up on the front pages of our newspapers, where a \nMexican official responsible for stopping narcotics has a bank account \nof several million dollars. Where do we believe that money came from?\n  As a member of both the Judiciary and the Foreign Relations \nCommittees, I intend to take an aggressive oversight role of Federal \nefforts to stop drug smuggling across this Nation's borders and will \nreport regularly to my colleagues in the Senate on the progress.\n  I will also begin to explore legislation to deny United States \nforeign aid to countries such as Colombia, who do not take appropriate \nsteps to control the flow of contraband out of their own countries.\n  This administration has just sent $20 billion in loan guarantees to \nMexico, of which $6 billion has already been drawn down. I think the \nUnited States deserves cooperation from the highest levels of the \nMexican Government in what is a major scourge on the relationship \nbetween our two countries, the trafficking of large amounts of cocaine.\n  Shortly, I hope to see for myself the Customs Service's surveillance \nefforts at the border. Recently, it was described in a television \nreport on NBC's ``Dateline.'' What the story showed was a former \nCustoms agent pointing out a truck, a huge container truck, going right \nthrough a Customs' checkpoint, and saying, ``This truck is a known drug \nsmuggler. Watch what happens.'' And the truck went right through under \nthe ``line release'' program.\n  I find it hard to accept that the Federal Government is so desperate \nto increase commerce that it will allow drugs to freely enter the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for providing me with this opportunity to \nupdate my colleagues. I will report further on developments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Feb. 12, 1995]\n\n           Border Inspections Eased and Drug Seizures Plunge\n\n                             (By H.G. Reza)\n\n\n   customs: corruption probes focus on u.s. policy to promote mexico \n                    trade. few trucks are examined.\n\n       San Diego.--The amount of cocaine seized from Mexican \n     trucks and cargo at the border plummeted last year, as U.S. \n     Customs Service officials pressed on with a program to \n     promote trade by letting most commercial cargo pass into this \n     country without inspection.\n       Not a single pound of cocaine was confiscated from more \n     than 2 million trucks that passed through three of the \n     busiest entry points along the Southwest border where federal \n     officials say most of the drug enters the country.\n       Of the 62,000 pounds of cocaine that Customs seized from \n     commercial cargo nationwide, less than a ton was taken from \n     shipments along the border with Mexico.\n       One reason for the sharp decline in seizures is that \n     Customs officials appear to be doing a poor job of \n     identifying and inspecting those trucks and cargo containers \n     being used for drug smuggling, according to an internal \n     report obtained by The Times.\n       ``The target selection methods are * * * critical and \n     apparently in more need of improvements given the huge number \n     of examinations without success,'' said the Dec. 13 report by \n     a Customs analyst.\n       Officials say liberalized importing procedures have \n     dramatically increased the number of trucks crossing the \n     border from Mexico, producing trade benefits for both \n     countries. And now the Customs Service is considering new \n     measures to speed up the entry of air and auto travelers into \n     the United States.\n       But, according to records and interviews, the facilitation \n     policy also has become the focal point of wide-ranging \n     corruption probes at a number of Southwest border crossings \n     and inspection facilities.\n       [[Page S4007]] Since last summer, federal authorities have \n     been looking into allegations that corrupt Customs officials \n     and inspectors are tipping smugglers that certain shipments \n     and vehicles have been targeted for narcotics inspections.\n       Sources said investigators also are examining allegations \n     that:\n       Some inspectors and officials in San Diego were bribed by \n     Mexican drug rings to remove intelligence information from \n     Customs computers.\n       Investigators also are focusing on allegations that \n     smugglers are transporting drugs in the uninspected trucks \n     that bring cargo from Mexico.\n       A principal target, sources said, is an inspector who in \n     1990 attempted to release a propane tanker although drug-\n     sniffing dogs had sounded the alarm. The tanker later was \n     found to be carrying four tons of cocaine.\n       Inspectors and officials in the Long Beach area were bribed \n     to allow trucks from Mexico and contraband, including AK-47 \n     rifles and ammunition from China, to be smuggled into the \n     ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles in ship containers.\n       The investigation is concentrating on private warehouses in \n     the Long Beach area where cargo containers are examined by \n     Customs inspectors for contraband, drugs and compliance with \n     importation laws. The warehouses are customarily paid a fee \n     for use of their facilities and assisting in the inspections.\n       But sources said importers allegedly were charged up to \n     $425 per container for hundreds of examinations that were \n     never done. Investigators have been told that two Customs \n     officials received kickbacks.\n       In interviews, Justice Department officials declined to \n     confirm or deny the existence of the investigations. ``If \n     anyone has information regarding corruption within the \n     Customs Service, we would certainly be interested in \n     receiving that information,'' said Assistant U.S. Atty. \n     Michael Flanagan in Los Angeles, who is overseeing some of \n     the investigations.\n       Customs officials declined to comment on the \n     investigations. They also defended their low seizure rates \n     and the ``facilitation program'' that since the late 1980s \n     has allowed increasing numbers of trucks and cargo containers \n     to go uninspected at the border.\n       Lou Samenfink, Customs cargo control branch chief in \n     Washington, said he does not know why seizures have fallen \n     off and pointed out that the Customs Service instituted a new \n     and improved random system in October for identifying \n     shipments to be inspected.\n       ``It could just as easily be that [drugs are] not there,'' \n     he said. ``It could certainly mean that our targeting policy \n     is wrong, or that it's so effective that the smugglers aren't \n     using commercial cargo to bring drugs in.''\n       The Drug Enforcement Administration reports that 244,626 \n     pounds of cocaine were seized nationwide by federal law \n     enforcement agencies in 1993, the most recent year for which \n     statistics are available. And officials estimate that only \n     about 10% of the cocaine smuggled into the country is seized.\n       Joaquin Legarreta, spokesman for the DEA intelligence \n     center in El Paso, said most cocaine enters the United States \n     across the Mexican border, and most comes through regular \n     ports of entry in commercial trucks and passenger vehicles.\n       In 1986, Customs began a ``facilitation'' policy to speed \n     up the shipment of cargo from Canada, and the program was \n     expanded to the Mexican border in recent years.\n       As part of this policy, ``low-risk'' U.S. importers are \n     allowed to ship commodities from a Mexican manufacturer \n     virtually without inspection, after passing a rigorous \n     background check. Under the so-called ``line release'' \n     program, some importers go months without having their \n     shipments inspected.\n       Former Customs Commissioner William Von Raab, who helped \n     establish the program on the Canadian border, said he was \n     shocked when it later was used on the Mexico border.\n       ``It's terrible. [This] was developed to be used at a \n     border with the highest level of integrity and lowest level \n     of risk,'' Von Raab said. ``I certainly would never have \n     deployed it at the Mexican border.''\n       The San Diego district has the lowest inspection rate for \n     commercial trucks, records show. Only 3.7% of the laden \n     trucks are inspected at Otay Mesa, Calexico and Tecate in \n     California and Andrade in Arizona, compared to an average \n     rate of 11.4% along the entire U.S.-Mexico border.\n       ``Obviously, we're in an area of international trade,'' \n     said Rex Applegate, port director of the San Diego district. \n     ``We're not in a situation where we can just stop traffic for \n     the sake of narcotics risk. . . .We examined 3% of all the \n     laden trucks that crossed. That is a lot of trucks. That is a \n     lot of intrusion.''\n       Sources said inspections are conducted randomly, once every \n     500 to 2,500 entries, and certain shipments are targeted \n     based on intelligence information.\n       The facilitation program has resulted in increased truck \n     traffic all along the border, especially last year when \n     records show that laden trucks increased 51% and empty trucks \n     increased 38%. In anticipation of the North American Free \n     Trade Agreement a year ago, U.S. and foreign investors opened \n     new manufacturing plants on the Mexican side of the border, \n     triggering an increase in cargo shipments to this country.\n       Numerous inspectors and agents have told The Times they \n     believe that the facilitation policy has provided narcotics \n     smugglers with an easy way of bringing tons of cocaine into \n     the U.S.\n       ``The smugglers know our system as well or better than \n     us,'' said Jay Erdmann, an inspector for 25 years who is \n     retiring next month. ``Why should they smuggle the dope \n     through the desert when they can use line release?''\n       San Diego port director Applegate said the importing and \n     drug targeting procedures are ``very sophisticated.''\n       ``Quite frankly, the line inspector is not aware of this,'' \n     Applegate said. ``These guys are like platoon sergeants \n     questioning the war strategy.''\n       But he also said inspectors have a responsibility to target \n     vehicles, based on behavioral analysis of the drivers.\n       ``This risk assessment * * * depends a lot on the \n     inspector's own knowledge,'' Applegate said.\n       A Dec. 13 document entitled ``1994 Port Tracking Report'' \n     said Customs concentrates its drug enforcement efforts on \n     shipments from 16 ``high-risk'' countries in South and \n     Central America and the Caribbean.\n       The report said that, although most ``high-risk containers \n     pass through the Mexican border, ``substantially less'' \n     cocaine was seized there last year than the previous year.\n       Nationwide, customs inspectors and agents seized 62,850 \n     pounds of cocaine from commercial land, air and sea haulers \n     last year--only 2,000 pounds less than in 1993.\n       But along the Southwest border, 1,765 pounds was \n     confiscated in 1994--all at Calexico--compared to 7,708 \n     pounds in 1993 and 234 pounds in 1992 when truck traffic was \n     lighter. Customs statistics show there was a similar decline \n     in marijuana seizures, from 17,736 pounds in 1993 to 9,459 \n     pounds last year.\n       Officials were unable to provide statistics for cocaine \n     seizures in previous years along the entire border.\n       At the Otay Mesa commercial port--third largest on the \n     border and located seven miles east of San Diego--there were \n     no cocaine seizures in the past three years. There also were \n     no seizures during the period at El Paso, the second largest \n     commercial border crossing.\n       Laredo, Tex., the biggest commercial port, had no cocaine \n     seizures last year. Inspectors there found 5,027 pounds of \n     drug in 1993 and none in 1992.\n       Meanwhile, Customs officials have two new proposals to make \n     it easier for airplane and auto travelers, not just trucks, \n     to enter the United States, The Times has learned.\n       One plan under study, called Airport 2000, would require \n     airline employees to input the names of passport holders into \n     Customs computers.\n       Customs inspectors would then check the names for criminal \n     records or ties to drug smuggling. If the name used by the \n     traveler does not arouse suspicion, he would be allowed to \n     leave the airport without having to go through Customs \n     inspection.\n       ``Airport 2000 is a concept developed here and is passenger \n     oriented,'' said Dennis Shimkoski, a Customs Service \n     spokesman in Washington.\n       A plan being studied in San Diego would make optional the \n     now-mandatory license plate check of every vehicle entering \n     this country from Mexico. Like Airport 2000, the\n      plan was conceived to cut costs and ease entry into the \n     United States.\n       Computer checks of license plates have led to the seizure \n     of hundreds of stolen vehicles and thousands of pounds of \n     drugs. The computer checks also tell an inspector if the \n     vehicle is suspected of being used in smuggling and if the \n     driver has a criminal record.\n       Applegate dismissed complaints from inspectors and Customs \n     agents that the plan signals a retreat from the drug war and \n     invites corruption in the ranks of inspectors.\n       ``The issue is very simple. Our land border traffic is \n     increasing, and our budget is not,'' Applegate said. ``There \n     would be a certain number of inspectors who would view this \n     as the grossest sellout in customs history. [But] how much is \n     it costing the Customs Service to input all this data and \n     what are we getting for it?''\n       Von Raab, the former Customs commissioner, said he believes \n     that the proposals will weaken enforcement efforts. ``I have \n     always seen Customs as a regulatory agency to guard borders \n     and collect tariffs,'' he said.\n       Customs inspectors and agents have complained for years \n     about what they call a loophole in the facilitation program. \n     They alleged in interviews that drug rings are paying \n     unscrupulous truck drivers and trucking companies to smuggle \n     cocaine and other drugs--but Customs officials do not subject \n     drivers and trucking companies to the same background checks \n     as importers and manufacturers.\n       A veteran investigator who has worked on several high-\n     profile drug cases in San Diego said that ``you can have the \n     biggest drug dealer in Mexico drive a truck through the \n     compound * * * and the [line-release program's] computer \n     would never tell you who he was, even if he used his real \n     name.''\n       ``That's correct,'' said Barry Fleming, who supervises the \n     line release program in San Diego. ``Right now, I have to \n     agree with the inspectors. [The problem is] the carriers. How \n     do we operate in the unknown where we don't know the risk of \n     the driver, the tractor [truck] or the trucking company?''\n       When asked why there were no cocaine seizures at the Otay \n     mesa commercial port between 1992 and 1994, Fleming said: \n     ``Is it [because of faulty] targeting? Probably it is. We \n     don't have enough intelligence.''\n       Carolyn Goding, president of the San Diego Brokers Assn., \n     agreed that there is ``nothing \n     [[Page S4008]] to stop an unscrupulous driver from throwing \n     some cocaine underneath the seat.'' However, she said the \n     program ``is working well for the honest importer by helping \n     facilitate the movement of cargo.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Rubin,\n     Secretary, Department of the Treasury,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Rubin: In an earlier letter, dated February \n     17, 1995, I requested an investigation and reevaluation of \n     federal efforts to seize illicit narcotics coming across this \n     nation's borders. Since then, I've learned a great deal more \n     and today I am writing to express my strong belief that the \n     Customs Service's ``line release'' program (as we know it \n     today) should be discontinued in California pending an \n     evaluation of its ability to seek out and confiscate illicit \n     contraband entering this country.\n       I understand approximately 10,000 companies now participate \n     in a broad effort to move large trucks across the border with \n     Mexico, often without inspection of cargo. I have asked the \n     Customs Service for a full list of the companies approved to \n     take part in the ``line release'' program but have yet to \n     receive this information. I would like to re-state my request \n     for this information.\n       My strong belief that the ``line release'' program should \n     be discounted pending further review is based on a number of \n     factors:\n       (1) It is known that the Cali Cartel in Columbia is \n     shipping tons of illegal drugs on planes as large as 727's to \n     Mexico, and then transporting drugs across the border and \n     into the continental United States in trucks. Recent press \n     reports have documented increased incidents of illegal \n     smuggling since the ``line release'' program began, and a \n     dramatic decrease of inspection and drug seizures. In fact, \n     in 1994 not a single pound of cocaine was confiscated from \n     more than two million trucks that passed through three of the \n     busiest entry points along the southwest border--Laredo and \n     El Paso in Texas, and Nogales in Arizona.\n       (2) Hearings of the Senate Judiciary Committee have \n     demonstrated that drug smuggling is on the rise and \n     California has become the major point of cocaine importation \n     in the United States.\n       (3) An internal Treasury document recently brought to my \n     attention, and subsequently printed in a news report this \n     past Friday, suggests that serious deficiencies in the ``line \n     release'' program may actually facilitate the flow of illegal \n     drugs into California.\n       These developments have served only to increase my \n     skepticism as to whether the ``line release'' program ever \n     made sense at all. In 1993, before NAFTA, Customs officials \n     seized almost four tons of cocaine off trucks crossing the \n     border; in 1994 it was down to less than a ton. Attached is a \n     story from yesterday's New York Times which very accurately \n     reflects the way I feel. I have also attached recent stories \n     printed in the Los Angeles Times which raise alarming \n     questions about illegal drug smuggling across this nation's \n     2,000 mile border with Mexico.\n       In my opinion, the ``line release'' program only encourages \n     the continued and increased flow of drug smuggling. \n     California simply cannot be the testing ground for programs \n     that are ineffective and which only invite increased drug \n     smuggling.\n       I would appreciate a response as soon as possible regarding \n     this matter. I would also like your views as to whether you \n     believe Operation Hard Line, the new initiative by the \n     Customs Service to tackle the problem of cocaine smuggling \n     into California, adequately addresses the problems raised \n     about the ``line release'' program.\n       Thank you, in advance, for your personal attention to this \n     matter. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Rubin,\n     Secretary, Department of the Treasury,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Rubin: Two weeks ago, I wrote to you \n     regarding my strong belief that the ``line release'' program \n     currently being administered by the Customs Service should be \n     discontinued in California pending an evaluation of its \n     effectiveness to seek out and confiscate illicit contraband \n     entering the United States. I have not yet received a \n     response.\n       I believe strongly that this is a urgent matter which \n     merits your priority attention. To this end, I am also \n     enclosing a copy of an Associated Press story from yesterday \n     which raises additional questions about the situation at the \n     border, including an alleged 1993 incident in which the then-\n     District Director of the Customs Service, who was later \n     promoted, may have prevented investigators from conducting a \n     surprise inspection of the ``line release'' program at the \n     southwest border. This investigation was aimed at determining \n     whether unauthorized trucks, potentially carrying drugs, were \n     allowed to cross the border without inspection.\n       As I stated in my February 27 letter, I believe the ``line \n     release'' program only encourages the continued and increased \n     flow of drug smuggling across the southwest border.\n       Again, I urge your priority attention to this matter and \n     look forward to a response to my original letter as soon as \n     possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Mar. 10, 1995]\n\n   Customs Fails To Act on Suspension for Indicted Warehouse Operator\n\n                           (By Michael White)\n\n       Los Angeles.--Eight months after a harbor warehouse owner \n     was indicted on bribery charges, he's still profiting from a \n     Customs Service inspection station on his property although \n     investigators urged that it be shut down.\n       That illustrates a lack of clout that frustrates the U.S. \n     Treasury Department's Office of the Inspector General in its \n     role as watchdog over some of the government's biggest \n     moneymakers, including Customs and the Internal Revenue \n     Service, according to interviews and government records.\n       The problem is particularly acute in the agency's Western \n     region where, unlike the rest of the country, inspector \n     general's investigators have failed to obtain a single \n     indictment of a federal official in five years.\n       ``I think that was one of the reasons I was hired two years \n     ago, was to change the direction, and that doesn't happen \n     over night,'' said James Cottos, assistant inspector general \n     for investigations in Washington.\n       In the case of the harbor warehouse, the inspector \n     general's auditors recommended last October that National \n     Distribution Services be suspended from doing business. Its \n     owner, Steve Moallem, had been indicted on charges he paid an \n     immigration agent $10,000 for false documents for himself and \n     employees, records show.\n       Being picked as the site for an examination station can \n     mean big profits for a warehouse operator, who charges \n     importers for storing and unloading cargo to be inspected.\n       Neither Customs nor the Treasury Department itself has \n     acted on the recommendation to suspend the company.\n       ``We can't force the (Customs) agency to do anything,'' \n     said Rick Dory, a Treasury Department attorney.\n       Customs spokeman Mike Flemming said the case is up to \n     Treasury officials in Washington.\n       The Inspector General's Office is charged with \n     investigating criminal offenses by management level employees \n     at Customs, the IRS, the Secret Service and a variety of \n     other Treasury agencies.\n       During Cottos' tenure, Treasury's Northeast Region has \n     logged 14 felony convictions. The Southern Region has had \n     eight and the Central Division one. Statistics for the \n     office's performance before his tenure were not available \n     because good records were not kept, Cottos said.\n       In the West, however, things are different.\n       The inspector general's office was absent last year when \n     the Justice Department launched a corruption investigation \n     among Customs officials in Los Angeles and San Diego, said a \n     source familiar with the investigation.\n       The unusual move was made at the insistence of witnesses \n     who doubted the effectiveness of the inspector general's \n     office, said the source, who spoke only on the condition of \n     anonymity.\n       The concern stemmed in part from a 1993 incident in which \n     the inspector general's office tried to investigate \n     allegations that cocaine-laden trucks were crossing the \n     border unimpeded under a Customs program intended to speed \n     the flow of cargo from Mexico.\n       In that case, inspector general investigators, accompanied \n     by Customs narcotics agents trying to make unannounced \n     inspections of vehicles and records at the Otay Mesa port of \n     entry near San Diego, were denied entrance by Customs \n     officials.\n       Under orders of Custom's San Diego District Director Rudy \n     Camacho, the investigation team was told to leave, according \n     to several sources who witnessed the incident.\n       They returned the next week in a visit arranged with \n     Camacho's office, but by then word of the operation had \n     leaked to truckers and import brokers they were targeting, \n     according to a January 1994 memo by the investigators.\n       ``Rudy Camacho ran them out of San Diego,'' said one \n     veteran inspector familiar with the incident.\n       Camacho, later promoted to commissioner of Customs' Western \n     region, said he told the investigators to leave because they \n     had, without his authorization, brought Customs inspectors \n     along. He said he had sole authority over Customs inspectors' \n     activities and scheduling.\n       His office later cooperated fully with the investigators, \n     he said.\n       Cottos said Treasury agencies often resist his office's \n     attempts to investigate internal wrongdoing.\n       ``People don't want anybody else to come in and do an \n     investigation of them,'' he said.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 330 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  Mr. President, I think a substitute amendment to my amendment has \nbeen agreed to by both sides.\n  Briefly, it says that a pending agreement between the United States \nand Russia that would allow Russia to buy American nuclear reactors and \ntechnology, known as a ``Section 123 Agreement,'' be canceled unless \nthe President certifies to Congress that the Russian nuclear agency \nwill not sell nuclear reactors to Iran.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to \nthe Bumpers amendment to rescind funding for the national wind tunnel \ncomplex [NWTC]. I believe this project to be a sound investment in the \nfuture of the competitiveness of the U.S. commercial aviation industry.\n  NASA is pursuing the development of two new wind tunnels as a part of \nthe NWTC strategy to provide facilities for aircraft testing with \ntechnology not currently available in the United States. These \nfacilities would allow the commercial aviation industry to continue to \ncompete on an international level for the next generation of wide-body \ncommercial transportation aircraft.\n  The United States has built only one major wind tunnel in the past 30 \nyears and while the existing wind tunnels have been upgraded over the \nyears, none has been able to keep pace with the state-of-the-art \ncapability, productivity, and technology of new, modern--and largely \nforeign-owned--wind tunnels. The United States has recently seen its \nshare of the international commercial transport aircraft market fall \nfrom 100 percent to an estimated 65 percent. While we still enjoy a \ncommanding presence in this vital industry, we must now prepare \nourselves to be competitive in the future.\n  Contrast our actions with those of our European competitors who have \ninvested in six new Government-financed wind tunnels over the last 15 \nyears. These investments pay dividends in the commercial aircraft \nmarket as can be witnessed by the increasing marketshare of European \ncompanies such as Airbus.\n  The fiscal year 1995 VA-HUD bill provided $400 million as a down-\npayment to begin construction of these two facilities. This investment \nfollows funding in fiscal year 1994 to study the feasibility of wind \ntunnels. NASA estimates the final cost of the wind tunnel complexes to \nbe $2.5 billion and has plans for the facilities to be up and running \nby 2002. I agree with those who are calling for the greater industry \ninvolvement in this project and look forward to working with my \ncolleagues and industry officials to help make cost-sharing a reality. \nI have spoken personally with the CEO's of major commercial aviation \nmanufacturers who all agree with NWTC is needed to ensure their \ncontinued competitiveness. Now is not the time to waver in our support \nfor the domestic aircraft industry.\n  In anticipation of the Administration's continued support of the \nNational Wind Tunnel Complex Program, an industry teaming agreement was \nsigned among Boeing, McDonnel Douglas, Lockheed, Northrup-Grumman, \nPratt & Whitney, and General Electric to support the development of the \nfacilities. NASA has been in the process of evaluating feasible sites, \nincluding the NASA Ames Research Center located in the San Francisco \nBay area. The Ames Research Center, which is currently home to several \noperational wind tunnels, meets most of the technical criterion NASA is \nlooking for and can be a model of government and private industry \nworking together toward mutual interests.\n  While the Administration has not met the condition set forth in the \nfiscal year 1995 VA-HUD bill, they have, in fact, requested that the \nfunds be carried over to allow for a more complete site selection \nprocess. I ask my colleagues to agree with the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee's recommendation to grant the administration time to move \nahead with this important investment in the future of domestic aviation \ntechnology. I oppose the Bumpers amendment to rescind funding for the \nnational wind tunnel complex and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to explain why I believe the \nSenate should reject the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arkansas to cancel funding for wind tunnels.\n  Before getting into the arguments for proceeding with this program, I \nwant to remind my colleagues of some essential facts about the bill \nbefore us. This bill, labeled the Defense supplemental and rescissions \nappropriations, will cut the Federal deficit.\n  Its first goal is to replenish critical parts of the Defense \nDepartment's budget, and it does that by transferring funds from other \nareas. That means we are not asking the American taxpayers to borrow.\n  And because this is an opportunity to shave the Federal budget, this \nbill also contains $1.5 billion of cuts in Government spending for the \nsole purpose of reducing the deficit. Here is more proof that one does \nnot need to amend the Constitution to shrink the deficit.\n  But the Federal budget is always an exercise in setting priorities. \nCertain needs, from the country's military security to our social \nfabric, have to guide how we make choices about Government spending. \nAnd I would argue that we need to keep planning for the future, \nespecially to invest in opportunities to sustain the country's economic \nstrength and jobs.\n  That is why I question and oppose the amendment by my friend from \nArkansas. Yes, it is tempting to give up on the effort involved in \nNASA's plan for exploring the potential for building wind tunnels in \nthe United States. But it is the wrong thing to do at the wrong time. \nIt would be a retreat from the future, and another blow to this \ncountry's ability to maintain a prosperous commercial aircraft \nindustry.\n  Since 1915, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA] \nand its predecessor agency have worked closely with the country's \naircraft industry, providing one another with technical support. And, \nin turn, that technical support and the entrepreneurship of our \nairplane manufacturers have made the aircraft industry one of America's \ngreat economic successes. America is the world's leader, and the \nindustry generates not only billions of dollars in export sales but \nalso supports tens of thousands of jobs across our country. NASA's \naeronautics research program is a proven investment in jobs--good\n jobs for Americans. And it is particularly important at time when \nforeign competitors, particularly Airbus, receive major help from their \ngovernments.\n\n  The subject before us, wind tunnels, are a key part of the NASA \nAeronautics Program, and may be a vital tool for keeping our aircraft \nindustry the world's leader. these tunnels are the facilities in which \ncompanies test and refine their new designs. New designs can be largely \nanalyzed through computer simulations but in the final analysis \ncompanies must test physical models in advanced wind tunnels.\n  Wind tunnels are also precisely the kind of investment in which a \ngovernment role is both appropriate and necessary--valuable national \nfacilities that help a range of companies but which are so expensive \nthat no one company or even group of companies can readily fund by \nthemselves.\n  I want to note that our Government has operated wind tunnels for \ndecades, serving both commercial and defense needs. But there's a very \nbig catch. The tunnels in the United States are mostly 40 years old. In \nstark contrast, Europe has wind tunnels that are much more modern. Our \ncompanies can test its designs on the other side of the ocean, in \nforeign countries therefore.\n  That leads to an extremely serious dilemma for American aircraft \nmanufactures--either test their new aircraft designs in less \nsophisticated facilities here in the United States, or test in Europe \nwhere data on the best new American designs would undoubtedly end up in \nthe hands of foreign competitors.\n  I want to emphasize one important point here: NASA wind tunnels \ndirectly support a major U.S. industry--an industry which in turn \ngenerates sales, jobs, and I hasten to add, considerable tax revenue. \nAnd West Virginia is one of the States with the right conditions to \nbuild the wind tunnels. We have the most inexpensive and abundant \nsupply of electricity in the Nation. And along \n[[Page S4011]] with our natural and other infrastructure resources, we \nare a state brimming with talented people ready to forge ahead building \nand operating this leading edge technology. Pulling the rug out from \nthis initiative, aimed directly at improving this country's economic \nsituation, seems reckless.\n  The amendment from the Senator of Arkansas would cancel a decision \nmade by Congress last year to devote $400 million to planning just how \nto overcome this serious gap between America's wind tunnels and those \nin foreign countries. Because of the high economic stakes involved for \nour Nation, Congress appropriated the money to begin developing a new \npair of state-of-the-art American wind tunnels.\n  Congress also conditioned that funding on an expectation that the \nadministration would lay out a clearer plan on how to proceed with this \neffort and how to obtain the necessary commitments from the private \nsector. NASA is now finishing its assessment of future wind tunnel \nneeds and how much industry is willing to share the costs of new \nfacilities. The administration is asking this body to preserve the \nmoney until that study is completed and a full assessment can be made. \nAgain, in light of the stakes--involving jobs and the future of a \ncritical industry--I really think it's more than reasonable to reserve \nthese funds if we are fully convinced they'll be a worthwhile \ninvestment.\n  The Senate should await the results of that assessment before we take \nrash action today that would bring an end to this initiative and its \npotential for the country. We should wait for the full facts, and not \ntake precipitous action that risks jeopardizing a vital export \nindustry. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Bumpers' \namendment because it is reasonable to link further United States \nfunding for technical cooperation with the Russians on the space \nstation with Russia's arrogant sale of nuclear reactors to Iran.\n  The Bumpers amendment makes the choice for the Russian Government \nquite simple. On the one hand, the Russians can continue to develop \neconomic relations with the United States and move onward into the 21st \ncentury on the cutting edge of space-based technology. Or the Russians \nban pursue a dangerous nuclear relationship with Iran one of the \nworld's most reprehensible governments. But Russia cannot have it both \nways.\n  The two greatest threats facing the security of the United States and \nits allies are Islamic fundamentalism and nuclear proliferation. The \nproposed Russian sale of nuclear reactors to Iran is an intersection of \nthese threats. Even the Russians must realize the danger this poses to \ntheir own nation. I am truly surprised that no reasonable figure of \nauthority in Russia is willing to confront that obvious reality. \nDespite all the rhetoric that one hears from Moscow about the threat of \nIslamic fundamentalism to the south of Russia, it appears that short-\nterm profit is the most important interest for the Russian Government.\n  Recently the head of the Russian Ministry of Nuclear Power compared \nthe profit he could turn from nuclear sales to Iran with the level of \nassistance that the United States gives to Russia. In essence he said \nthat the funds the United States provides to Russia could easily be \nreplaced by unrestricted worldwide sales of reactors and uranium. This \nreckless and insulting view of our Nation's efforts to develop a \nstronger relationship with Russia may have escaped comment by President \nClinton, but it will not pass muster in the Senate.\n  The United States will not join in a bidding war with terrorist \ncountries like Iran for the fickle friendship of the current Russian \nGovernment. Our appeal to Russia is broadly based upon reason and \nprinciple. While economic assistance has been a feature of the United \nStates' effort to build closer ties with Russia, far exceeding any aid \nhas been our willingness to build closer relations. We have extended an \nopen hand in order to help Russia recover from the wounds of 70 years \nof totalitarian, Communist government. If bean counting bureaucrats in \nthe Russian Nuclear Power Ministry see more profit by tying Russia's \nfuture to Iran--then let them have at it. But they can't--and won't--\nhave it both ways.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by my friend from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers. While we share \nmany similar interests and beliefs, it seems that we are usually on \nopposite sides of the issue when it comes to debating NASA and \naerospace issues. In this case, I believe my friend's amendment is \nmisguided and would bring a premature end to what promises to be \nvaluable national facility.\n  I would also like to congratulate the chairman of the HUD/VA \nAppropriation Subcommittee, Senator Bond, as well as Senator Mikulski \nfor laying out the very convincing arguments for proceeding with this \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, no one can doubt the vital role which wind tunnels \nplay in the design of aircraft and engines. In fact in my earlier \ncareer, I had first-hand experience with what can be learned with these \ntype of facilities. I would like to begin my remarks with a short \ndescription of how these facilities are actually used.\n  Wind tunnels are used in two major ways for airplane design. First, \nthey are used to develop and confirm aerodynamically the geometric \nshape of the airplane and its wings. Improvements in airplane \naerodynamics lead to reduced fuel consumption and improved economics. \nWhile computer testing, called computational fluid dynamics, is playing \nan increasingly important role in aircraft design, it has in no way \nreplaced wind tunnel development and testing.\n  The second major way wind tunnels are used in airplane design is to \nhelp predict handling qualities, controllability, aerodynamic loads, \nfuel consumption, inlet/nozzle/nacelle and such important \ncharacteristics as takeoff and landing speeds. Wind tunnel testing \nprovides the most accurate method for predicting crucial airplane \ncharacteristics. Wind tunnel test data are used in preflight prediction \nof drag, weight, and propulsive efficiency.\n  Mr. President, during the debate on wind tunnels we will hear \nmentioned two particular parameters used to describe the capability of \nwind tunnels. The first term is ``Mach number'' and the second is \n``Reynolds number.'' Mach number is the more familiar term and is \ndefined as a ratio of vehicle speed to the speed of sound. \nDetermination of Mach number is critical for high-speed flight.\n  The Reynolds number is defined as the ratio of the inertia forces to \nthe viscous forces that a fluid exerts on a surface as it flows past. \nThe Reynolds number is also related to Mach number.\n  The National Academy of Sciences has found that ``high productivity, \nhigh Reynolds-number subsonic and transonic development wind tunnels * \n* * [will lead to improved aircraft] cruise and takeoff/landing \nperformance by at least 10 percent each.'' Mr. President, a 10-percent \nimprovement in airplane performance benefits our economy and our \nenvironment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the executive \nsummary from the aforementioned National Academy study, Aeronautical \nFacilities: Assessing the National Plan for Aeronautical Ground Test \nFacilities.\n  The value of such scientific advances in helping to keep the American \naircraft industry in the forefront of international sales is obvious. \nIn fact, had it not been for the outstanding work done over many, many \nyears by our aerodynamicists using the world's most advanced wind \ntunnels, our leadership in both military and commercial aircraft would \nnever have taken place. Commercial sales of U.S. aircraft would not \ncomprise our largest single factor in balance of payments outside of \nagriculture. Now we see foreign nations with more modern tunnels than \nwe have, along with an expanding group of scientists and \naerodynamicists. This does not bode well for America's future lead in \ndesigning and building the finest aircraft in the world. That is \nimportant for both our military and commercial aircraft.\n  Existing U.S. wind tunnels have served us well; and have helped make \nthe U.S. aircraft industry the world leader. In fact much of what has \nbeen learned from wind tunnels has occurred in my home State of Ohio, \nat NASA's Lewis Research Center. Unfortunately the upgrades and \nimprovements to the \n[[Page S4012]] existing inventory of wind tunnels have been already \nbeen made. Existing U.S. wind tunnels have the following problems: \nInadequate capability in Reynolds number; low productivity, with \nemphasis on research; average of facilities is between 30-40 years, \nwith the associated problems of old technology and high maintenance \ncosts.\n  In fact, all but two of the U.S. wind tunnels have been operating for \nmore than 30 years, and the two exceptions are low Reynolds number, \nspecial purpose facilities used only for light commercial and military \nairplane development.\n  Mr. President, most existing U.S. wind tunnels were funded by the \nFederal Government. And as my colleagues have discussed, the newer \nfacilities in Europe have been built with substantial Government \nsupport. While I believe that Senator Bumpers is correct in pointing \nout the apparent disparity in the industry's contribution to this \nfacility, I would argue that a final deal has not yet been signed. I \nwould encourage the administration to continue to pursue the best \npossible sharing of cost.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by asking our colleagues to look to \nthe future. In 10-20 years I hope that environmentally acceptable, \nsupersonic commercial airliners and transports will be a practical, \neconomic reality, and will be manufactured in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to vote against the Bumpers \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned summary of the \nNational Academy study be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the study was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                [From the National Academy Press, 1994]\n\n  Assessing the National Plan for Aeronautical Ground Test Facilities\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       At the request of the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration and Department of Defense, the Aeronautics and \n     Space Engineering Board (ASEB) of the National Research \n     Council independently reviewed the findings of the \n     interagency National Facilities Study (NFS). In order to make \n     the ASEB report available shortly after the NFS report, the \n     NFS Task Group on Aeronautical R Facilities briefed the \n     ASEB periodically during its study. After release of the NFS \n     report, the ASEB held a far-ranging workshop to critique the \n     NFS results. The workshop involved 49 experts in aeronautical \n     technology development; ground test facilities; and, \n     especially, the use and operation of wind tunnels. The \n     purpose of this report is to document and explain the ASEB's \n     assessment of the NFS report, including recommendations for \n     future action.\n       The conclusions and recommendations of the NFS seem to be \n     supported by factual material wherever it was available, \n     although in some cases they are based on the best judgment of \n     the study participants. The following nine items summarize \n     the ASEB's findings and recommendations. The first five items \n     reinforce key thrusts of the National Facilities Study. The \n     ASEB concurs with each of these items. The last four are \n     recommendations for additional action that go beyond the \n     recommendations of the National Facilities Study.\n\nRecommendations reinforcing the key thrusts of the national facilities \n                                 study\n\n       1. The ASEB agrees with the NFS report that significant \n     aerodynamic performance improvements are achievable, and the \n     nation that excels in the development of these improvements \n     has the opportunity to lead in the global market for \n     commercial and\n      military aircraft.\\1\\ The highest priority facilities for \n     achieving these performance improvements are new high-\n     productivity, high-Reynolds-number subsonic and transonic \n     development wind tunnels.\\2\\ The NFS report estimates that \n     cruise and takeoff/landing performance could be improved \n     by at least 10 percent each. Performance improvements are \n     essential for the U.S. aeronautics industry to maintain or \n     increase market share. Based on the information available \n     to it, the ASEB considers these projected increases in \n     performance to be potentially attainable and believes that \n     the proposed facilities could substantially facilitate \n     such improvements.\n     \\1\\Footnotes to appear at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       These forecast advantages do not include the probable \n     operating and development cost reductions that would accrue \n     to future U.S. military aircraft programs. In addition to \n     direct cost reductions, access to improved ground test \n     facilities would make advanced military aircraft more \n     competitive in the world market, thereby further reducing the \n     defense burden carried by U.S. taxpayers. Foreign sales of \n     U.S. military aircraft result in lower unit costs for U.S. \n     government and foreign purchasers.\n       2. The ASEB agrees with the NFS report that new high \n     Reynolds number ground test facilities are needed for \n     development testing in both the low speed and transonic \n     regimes to assure the competitiveness of future commercial \n     and military aircraft produced in the United States. The NFS \n     report documents that Reynolds and Mach number performance of \n     the best subsonic and transonic development wind tunnels in \n     the United States and Europe\n      are close to parity.\\3\\ However, the average age of major \n     U.S. tunnels is about 38 years, and many of the older U.S. \n     wind tunnels are subject to costly maintenance and \n     breakdown. Furthermore, there are no adequate domestic \n     alternatives for many older U.S. facilities. For example, \n     during the past several years U.S. manufacturers have \n     conducted a large amount of their low speed testing in \n     European facilities during refurbishment of the Ames \n     Research Center 12-foot subsonic wind tunnel, which is 48 \n     years old.\n\n  TABLE ES-1--PROPOSED CAPABILITIES OF NEW LOW SPEED AND TRANSONIC WIND \n                                 TUNNELS                                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Tunnel parameter         Low speed tunnel        Transonic tunnel   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReynolds Number........  20 million at Mach 0.3   28.2 million at Mach 1\n                          (full span model) 35     (full span model).   \n                          million at Mach 0.3                           \n                          (semi-span model).                            \nMach Number............  0.05-0.6...............  0.05-1.5.             \nProductivity...........  5 polars per occupancy   8 polars per occupancy\n                          hour*.                   hour.                \nOperating cost.........  \n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/16/senate-section/article/S4009-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4035-S4046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

Beattie)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and Senator Jeffords and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself and Mr. \n     Jeffords, proposes an amendment numbered 337.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new title:\n\n                        TITLE   --MISCELLANEOUS\n\n       Sec.   01.--Notwithstanding sections 12106, 12107, and \n     12108 of title 46, United States Code, and section 27 of the \n     Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (46 App. U.S.C. 883), as applicable \n     on the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Transportation may issue a certificate of documentation for \n     the vessel L. R. BEATTIE, United States official number \n     904161.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment introduced \ntoday with my friend from Vermont, Senator Jeffords. This amendment \nwould authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue a certificate \nof documentation to grant coasting rights to the vessel L.R. Beattie. \nThis certificate is commonly known as a Jones Act waiver.\n  The L.R. Beattie, a 500 passenger, triple deck cruise boat, was \noriginally built and flagged in the United States. The ship was later \nbrought by a Canadian company, although it was never flagged in Canada. \nIt has since been sold to a U.S. company and was bought last year by \nLake Champlain Shorelines Cruises of Burlington, VT.\n  Lake Champlain Shorelines Cruises bought the L.R. Beattie to operate \ntours on Lake Champlain and plans to rename it the Spirit of Ethan \nAllen II. This boat will be the showcase of a flourishing cruise \nindustry on Lake Champlain. This boat will support over 30 Vermonters \nworking on these cruises. But before this boat may begin carrying \npassengers on Lake Champlain, Congress must pass a Jones Act waiver for \nthe L.R. Beattie because of its brief history under Canadian ownership.\n  A Jones Act waiver is a routine and noncontroversial bill. It does \nnot cost U.S. taxpayers a penny. It simply authorizes the Secretary of \nTransportation to issue a certificate of documentation to allow a \nvessel to operate on U.S. waters.\n  But a Jones Act waiver for the L.R. Beattie has languished in \nCongress for more than a year. The Oceans Act of 1994, H.R. 4852, which \nreauthorized Coast Guard operations, contained a Jones Act waiver for \nthe L.R. Beattie. The House of Representatives easily passed this bill. \nUnfortunately, it died in the Senate at the end of last year's session.\n  This year, Senator Jeffords and I introduced legislation, S. 172, to \nallow the L.R. Beattie to receive a Jones Act waiver. The Senate \nCommerce Committee will soon consider this bill with other Jones Act \nwaivers. The time table for final passage of these Jones Act waivers, \nhowever, may be too late for Lake Champlain Shoreline Cruises because \nof the fast-approaching cruise season. Without this simple, \nnoncontroversial Jones Act waiver, this small business in Vermont could \ngo out of business, throwing over 30 Vermonters out of work.\n  Senator Jeffords and I have authored this amendment to respond to the \nspecial circumstances surrounding a Jones Act waiver for the L.R. \nBeattie.\n  I want to thank Senator Hollings, the ranking member of the Senate \nCommerce Committee, and Senator Pressler, the chairman of the Senate \nCommerce Committee, for their invaluable cooperation on this amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I join my senior Senator in this amendment, which will \nhelp make Vermont summers on Lake Champlain a little bit better.\n  Mr. President, I wish to thank the managers of this legislation for \naccepting this important amendment. I would especially like to thank \nthe chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Pressler, and the \nranking member, Senator Hollings, for their assistance with this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. President, included in the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, Jones Act \nwaivers allow for vessels transporting \n[[Page S4036]] cargo within U.S. waters which are not U.S. built, \nowned, and manned be given the right to do so. With the passage of this \namendment, the Spirit of Ethan Ellan II, which was built in the United \nStates and operated under Canadian ownership for a short time, will be \nable to resume operations as a United States vessel on Lake Champlain \nin time for the summer tourist season. The Spirit of Ethan Allen II \nwill provide an invaluable service to Vermonters and tourists who come \nto appreciate Vermont's beautiful setting. I can think of no better way \nto view this beautiful and historic lake.\n  This vessel will be the only one of its kind in Vermont, offering \nscenic cruises, wedding and prom receptions, and dinner parties. In \naddition, the Spirit of Ethan Allen II will be active in charity \nfundraisers and a program called Education on the Lake, informing young \npeople of the geological and historical character of the Lake Champlain \narea.\n  In addition, the Spirit of Ethan Allen II will host events for \nvisiting conferences and conventions in the Burlington area, enhancing \nthe experience of those who stay in the area's hotels and inns. Lake \nChamplain Shoreline Cruises will employ over 25 people to operate the \nvessel, making a significant contribution to the continuing development \nof the Burlington waterfront area.\n  I am pleased that this legislation will ensure that the Spirit of \nEthan Allen II begins operating in time for the summer tourist season.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 337) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 338\n\n    (Purpose: To state the sense of the Senate that indefinite and \n  unconditional extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is \n essential for furthering the security interests of the United States \n                  and all the countries of the world)\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk. and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth], for himself, Mr. \n     Glenn, Mr. Helms, Mr. Levin, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Nunn, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 338.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate point, insert the following:\n       The Senate finds that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \n     of Nuclear Weapons, herein after referred to as the NPT, is \n     the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation \n     regime;\n       That, with more than 170 parties, the NPT enjoys the widest \n     adherence of any arms control agreement in history:\n       That the NPT sets the fundamental legal and political \n     framework for prohibiting all forms of nuclear \n     nonproliferation;\n       That the NPT provides the fundamental legal and political \n     foundation for the efforts through which the nuclear arms \n     race as brought to an end and the world's nuclear arsenals \n     are being reduced as quickly, safely and securely as \n     possible;\n       That the NPT spells out only three extension options: \n     indefinite extension, extension for a fixed period, or \n     extension for fixed periods;\n       That any temporary or conditional extension of the NPT \n     would require a dangerously slow and unpredictable process of \n     re-ratification that would cripple the NPT;\n       That it is the policy of the President of the United States \n     to seek indefinite and unconditional extension of the NPT.\n       Now, therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) indefinite and unconditional extension of the NPT would \n     strengthen the global nuclear non-proliferation regime;\n       (2) indefinite and unconditional extension of the NPT is in \n     the interest of the United States because it would enhance \n     international peace and security;\n       (3) the President of the United States has the full support \n     of the Senate in seeking the indefinite and unconditional \n     extension of the NPT.\n       (4) all parties to the NPT should vote to extend the NPT \n     unconditionally and indefinitely; and\n       (5) parties opposing indefinite and unconditional extension \n     of the NPT are acting against their own interest, the \n     interest of the United States and the interest of all the \n     peoples of the world by placing the nuclear non-proliferation \n     regime and global security at risk.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to propose an amendment on \nbehalf of myself and Senators Glenn, Helms, Levin, McCain, and Nunn, \nwhich calls for the indefinite and unconditional extension of the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  In only 4 weeks, the parties to the NPT will gather in New York to \ndecide the future of this critical agreement. This resolution sends an \nunequivocal message to all the countries of the world that this body \nregards making the NPT permanent as absolutely essential. It also sends \na clear signal to any country opposing indefinite and unconditional \nextension of the treaty that that nation is acting against not only \nagainst its own interest, but also against the interest of the United \nStates and indeed of the people of the entire world, because their \nposition places the nuclear non-proliferation regime and global \nsecurity at risk.\n  March 5 marked the 25th anniversary of the entry into force of the \nNPT. That treaty is universally regarded as the the single most \nimportant component of the international effort to prevent the spread \nof nuclear weapons. Indeed, it is the very foundation upon which the \nentire global nuclear non-proliferation regime was constructed.\n  When the five declared nuclear weapons states ratified the NPT, they \npledged to end the nuclear arms race, to undertake measures toward \nnuclear disarmament and not in any way to assist nonnuclear weapon \nstates in gaining nuclear weapons.\n  For their part, the nonnuclear parties to the treaty pledged not to \nacquire nuclear weapons and to accept a system of safeguards to verify \ntheir compliance. Thus, in joining the NPT, these countries transformed \nthe acquisition of nuclear weapons from an act of national pride to a \nviolation of international law.\n  Those who negotiated the NPT never expected that the treaty alone \nwould end the global nuclear proliferation threat. Yet, I think even \nthey could be surprised by its successes toward that end. Today, there \nremain only 5 declared nuclear weapons states--not the 20 or 30, many \nexperts had once projected. There are also only three so-called \n``threshold'' states.\n  The NPT has provided the overarching structure to end the nuclear \narms race. With the ratification of START I, and the ongoing work of my \nable and distinguished colleagues in the Foreign Relations Committee on \nSTART II, the race now is to bring down the number of nuclear weapons \nas quickly, safely and securely as possible.\n  Another indicator of treaty's success has been the steady increase of \nits membership. Today, with more than 170 parties, the NPT has the \nwidest adherence of any arms control agreement in history. When backed \nby strong nonproliferation policies and verification measures including \ninternational safeguards, the NPT curbs inclinations countries may have \nin believing they need the bomb for safety. Thus, it advances the \nsecurity of all the world's nations.\n  Unfortunately, the NPT was established with a limited life-span. The \ntreaty provides that 25 years after its entrance into force, a \nconference of the parties will be convened to decide whether the NPT \nwill remain in force indefinitely, for one fixed period of time or for \na series of fixed periods. The treaty further provides that the \ndecision on extension will be made by majority of parties to the \ntreaty. The result will be legally binding for all parties, whatever \nvote they cast.\n  I believe it is beyond question that indefinite extension is \nessential. The NPT must be made permanent if we are to contain the \nterrible threat posed to all nations by the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons.\n  Anything short of indefinite extension would deal a major blow to the \nglobal nuclear nonproliferation regime because at the end of any \nspecified extension period, the treaty could be undermined. The global \nnorm prohibiting the further acquisition of nuclear weapons would thus \nbe destroyed.\n  We must never allow such an outcome that would jeopardize the entire \nnuclear nonproliferation regime--so \n[[Page S4037]] painstakingly crafted over the past quarter century.\n  In the aftermath of the cold war, the decisions we make today about \nglobal security will dramatically affect the lives of generations to \ncome. No decision is more important than the one the world faces next \nmonth on the future of the NPT.\n  Despite the critical need for making the NPT permanent, a number of \ncountries are actively opposing indefinite extension. Most troubling to \nme are the strongly negative positions taken by Mexico and Egypt--two \nnations which have received so much support from the United States over \nthe years.\n  Some of the countries opposing the U.S. position say that indefinite \nand unconditional extension of the NPT should be made contingent on the \nratification of a comprehensive test ban treaty or an agreement to cap \nthe amount of material available for nuclear explosives. Others seek \nuniversal membership in the NPT or a timetable for complete nuclear \ndisarmament.\n  By holding the NPT's future hostage to such goals, these countries \nundermine the likelihood of the treaty's indefinite extension. What \nthey do not seem to realize, ironically, is that in doing so they also \njeopardize the very framework critical to the achievement of their own \ngoals.\n  Indefinite extension of the NPT does not preclude adjustments to the \nnuclear nonproliferation regime. In fact, it would make permanent the \nclimate of trust conducive to more restrictive controls over weapons-\ngrade nuclear materials and related technologies and activities.\n  Given the narrow focus of the NPT conference next month, the only \nquestion treaty parties should ask is whether the world is a safer \nplace with the treaty in force. I believe that the answer to that \nquestion is unambiguously ``yes''. Indefinite and unconditional \nextension is thus the only choice that makes sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include my name \nas a cosponsor of the amendment offered by my colleague and friend from \nDelaware, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator \nRoth, expressing the sense of the Senate on the future of the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, better known as NPT, which \nentered into force on March 5, 1970.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, next month, representatives of the 173 \nmembers of the NPT will gather in New York to determine how long the \ntreaty shall remain in force.\n  I support this amendment because I believe that the NPT, despite some \nshortcomings--and it has been far from perfect--still continues to \nadvance U.S. national security interests and a peaceful world order.\n  Accordingly, I urge all my colleagues to join in a sense of the \nSenate in favor of an indefinite and unconditional extension of the \nNPT. The NPT has come under attack over the years for not having fully \nhalted the global spread of nuclear weapons, particularly in the case \nof certain NPT parties, with Iraq, Iran, and North Korea being the most \ncelebrated examples.\n  Some critics say the NPT gives too much emphasis on promoting \npeaceful uses of nuclear technology and not enough on its safeguards \nsystem. This argument has been directed specifically at the enforcement \nof the primary goal of safeguards; namely, the timely detection--timely \ndetection--of the diversion of a significant quantity of special \nnuclear material for nuclear explosive uses. Simply put, the more \ncountries come to engage in large-scale commercial uses of bomb-usable \nmaterials, the more likely it will be that some such materials will \nwind up in the hands of black marketeers or terrorists or nations bent \non proliferation and getting their own nuclear weapons capability.\n  Other criticisms, particularly coming from certain developing \ncountries, have alleged that the NPT focuses too much on preventing the \nglobal spread of nuclear weapons and not enough on promoting nuclear \ndisarmament. Anti-NPT propagandists have condemned the treaty's alleged \nsystem of atomic apartheid and its hidden purpose of, as they say, \ndisarming the unarmed.\n  Other critics have found fault with the treaty's easy exit clause, \npermitting a State to leave the treaty on 90 days' notice. The treaty \ndoes not define certain key terms like nuclear explosive device and \nmanufacture. Nor does it prohibit exports of sensitive nuclear weapons-\nrelated technology.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert in the Record at the \nend of my remarks an analysis prepared by Dr. Leonard Weiss, the staff \ndirector for the minority of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \nwhich describes and assesses these and several additional criticisms of \nthe NPT.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, why should the United States press for an \nindefinite extension of such an imperfect treaty?\n  Rather than rebut all of the allegations made by the treaty's \ncritics, or recount all of the many arguments used on behalf of the \ntreaty by its proponents, I would like to summarize briefly my own \nviews on why the NPT should be extended indefinitely.\n  First, to the ends. The world community needs a formal legal \ninstrument to give form and substance to the international effort to \nreduce and eliminate nuclear weapons. Given its near-universal support \nin the world community, the NPT helps to delegitimize the further \nproliferation--and, ultimately, the possession--of nuclear weapons. It \ncontributes to a global nonproliferation ethic that is invaluable to \ninternational security. Any short-term extension or extensions would \nonly weaken the incentives of the nuclear-weapon states to expedite \ntheir nuclear disarmament activities. Such short-term extension options \namount, in my opinion, to NPT confidence-reduction measures.\n  Now, as to the means. The NPT was never intended as a silver bullet, \nas something magic. Nobody expects the NPT to act as a panacea to the \nglobal nuclear weapons proliferation threat. The NPT works best when it \nis supported by complementary national policies of its parties. For \nexample, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and \nChina have undertaken binding legal obligations that they will not in \nany way assist the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Each of these \nnuclear-weapon states must promulgate domestic laws and regulations to \nensure this commitment is being upheld. At a time when each of these \ncountries--including most particularly our own country--is experiencing \ngreat pressure to relax export controls under the false flag of \neconomic competitiveness, now is not the time to abandon or weaken an \nobligation that serves to preserve responsible national systems of \nsanctions and export controls. Without the NPT, the world nuclear \nmarket would become a free-for-all--the new motto of the so-called \npost-cold war world order would soon become, ``Sell what you can while \nyou can. At the same time prepare for the worst.''\n  As to fairness, the NPT involves reciprocal duties on the parts of \nthe nuclear-weapon states and the non-nuclear-weapon states. The former \nhave no choice. They must not assist other countries to get the bomb, \nthey must negotiate in good faith to curb the nuclear arms race, pursue \nnuclear disarmament, and work toward a treaty on general and complete \ndisarmament. The latter also have no choice: they must not acquire the \nbomb, they must agree to safeguards over the full scope of their \nactivities involving nuclear material, and also pursue global \ndisarmament objectives. Though these are very different types of \nobligations, it is not correct to condemn the treaty as simply \ndiscriminatory. I doubt that this treaty would have 173 parties, 173 \nnations all signed up, if those nations truly believed that this treaty \nwas discriminatory. If the treaty--backed by strong national \nnonproliferation policies--helps to prevent the spread of nuclear \nweapons, all nations stand to gain the freedom from fear of regional or \nglobal nuclear wars.\n  Now what are our next steps? The NPT is not a quick fix. It must be \nsupplemented by strong national leadership and international \ncooperation. Here are just a few suggestions of some \n[[Page S4038]] specific initiatives that are needed to complement the \nNPT regime.\n  No. 1. Increased efforts by all countries to integrate fundamental \nNPT obligations into domestic laws and regulations of all states party \nto the treaty. I have proposed legislation in our own country here and \nsent a bill, S. 102, that seeks to bring U.S. controls over exports of \nnuclear dual-use goods into line with U.S. obligations under the NPT \nand nuclear supplier guidelines. Now, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis effort and to examine very closely the various pending proposals \nto reauthorize the Export Administration Act to ensure that these bills \nwill advance rather than undercut our international nonproliferation \ncommitments.\n  For those who may think my use of the term ``undercut'' is a bit \nharsh, I would encourage them to read a report prepared last year by \nthe General Accounting Office at my request. The report is entitled \n``Export Licensing Procedures for Dual-Use Items Need to be \nStrengthened.''\n  No. 2. Pursuit of an international moratorium, preferably a ban, on \nthe commercial sale, production, or use of separated plutonium or \nhighly enriched uranium. In other words, bomb-rich material. A partial \nban on the production of such materials for weapons or outside of \nsafeguards is--assuming for now that it would not amount to a license \nto produce such materials under safeguards--a useful first step but is \nby no means a substitute for this more important goal. We cannot for \nlong sustain an international arrangement that smiles upon large-scale \ncommercial uses of such materials in certain privileged states while \nfrowning upon such activities elsewhere. In other words, we need \nconsistency of our policy.\n  No. 3. Reaffirmation by the nuclear weapon states of their intention \nto live up to their obligation under article 6 of the NPT. In \nparticular, we need rapid progress both on START II and on further \nreciprocal and verifiable cuts of strategic nuclear arsenals around the \nworld, including those of France, the United Kingdom, and China. The \nnuclear-weapon states must devote less effort to attacking the basic \ngoal of nuclear disarmament and more effort to exploring the means by \nwhich this objective can be achieved.\n  No. 4. Negotiation at the earliest possible date of a verifiable--\nunderline verifiable--permanent comprehensive ban on the testing of \nnuclear explosive devices, with emphasis on those words ``verifiable,'' \n``permanent,'' ``comprehensive,'' and ``ban.''\n  No. 5. Increased transparency both of the size and disposition of \nexisting nuclear arsenals around the world, along with the size and \ndisposition of existing stockpiles of weapons-usable nuclear material, \nincluding so-called civilian material. The ability of the United States \nto monitor the ultimate disposition of its own nuclear materials in \ninternational commerce is badly in need of improvement, as the GAO \nrecently concluded in its report ``U.S. International Materials \nTracking Capabilities are Limited.'' That report was prepared at my \nrequest, also. The longer such shortcomings are permitted to exist, the \nsooner the NPT will find itself in the position of the emperor with no \nclothes.\n  No. 6. Strengthen both the capabilities and finances of safeguards \nimplemented under the NPT. The Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act, \nenacted last year as title 8 of the foreign Relations Authorization Act \nfor fiscal years 1994 and 1995, Public Law 103-236, contains a sense of \nthe Congress urging 24 specific improvements in these safeguards. As \nthe author of those provisions, I intend to monitor closely U.S. \nefforts to advance these much-needed reforms in the months ahead.\n  No. 7. Reaffirmation of the prevention, not management, of \nproliferation as the foremost goal of U.S. nonproliferation policy.\n  I see a great deal of attention being directed to implementing \nmilitary responses to proliferation. The more I see of these efforts, \nhowever, the more convinced I become that the best defense against such \nweapons is to redouble our efforts to prevent their proliferation in \nthe first place. One single attack using a biological or nuclear weapon \ncould destroy virtually any city anywhere, regardless of the best of \ndefenses. Stopping proliferation is somewhat analogous to fighting \ncancer: A few ounces of prevention will yield many kilograms of cure.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, even if these and other proposals were \nto be implemented today and even if the NPT is finally extended \nindefinitely, we will still have to live with a global nuclear weapons \nproliferation threat. I would prefer to address this threat, however, \nhaving a permanent NPT and these supplementary measures in my \ndiplomatic tool kit rather than not having them.\n  Accordingly, I hope that all my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthe amendment of my distinguished colleague from Delaware on behalf of \nan indefinite extension of the NPT. Let us just get on with the \nbusiness of nonproliferation.\n  Mr. President, one additional remark. If we did not have the NPT, I \nthink we would have to invent it. This is a group of 173 nations that \ngradually, over a series of 5 years, since back in the early 1970's, \nhas come together to say that they forswear the development of nuclear \nweapons in return for our cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear \nenergy. We have supported that. We have been actively pursuing that.\n  I do not believe that we need any more of these 5-year period \nreviews. I would like to see this extended indefinitely, and that is \nwhat the U.S. policy is trying to do as the 173 nations meet at the \nU.N. in New York next month, and I hope that they pass this as an \nindefinite extension of the NPT to show we are truly serious about this \nmatter.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n        The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty: Strengths and Gaps\n\n                           (By Leonard Weiss)\n\n\n                            I. Introduction\n\n       The evolution of a strong nonproliferation ethic in the \n     world is, ultimately, the best stable long-term tool to \n     prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. Such an ethic can \n     stimulate, and is, in turn, stimulated by the creation of \n     international institutions incorporating the notion of \n     nonproliferation at their core. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty\\1\\ (NPT), despite the confused philosophy of its \n     provenance, has become such an institution and has \n     demonstrated its value especially during the past few years. \n     It remains, however, a flawed institution that requires \n     considerable tending to, including constant efforts to obtain \n     a consensus of its parties concerning evolving \n     interpretations of its provisions in order to maintain its \n     effectiveness as a nonproliferation tool, if not its survival \n     altogether.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       It should not come as a surprise that the Treaty is an \n     imperfect nonproliferation instrument. It was created in \n     response to nonproliferation concerns arising from burgeoning \n     nuclear trade accelerated by a misguided atoms-for-peace \n     policy, trade promoted aggressively by nuclear policymakers, \n     technocrats, and diplomats whose visions of nuclear \n     technology-generated prosperity obscured the very real \n     national and international security problems being created. \n     Those problems, when they emerged, seem to have been viewed \n     as much in terms of the threat to future nuclear commerce as \n     they were in terms of the threat of life. Accordingly, the \n     Treaty was designed to endorse and encourage the spread of \n     nuclear technology for peaceful purposes at the time it was \n     to constrain, indeed prevent, the development and manufacture \n     of nuclear weapons.\n       The incompatibility of these aims became apparent after the \n     Treaty went into effect in 1970 as some nuclear suppliers, \n     particularly Germany and France (one an NPT party and the \n     other pledged at the time to act as an NPT party) prepared to \n     export technology and equipment for production of fissionable \n     material, albeit under safeguards administered by the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to countries that \n     either were not NPT parties and were embarked on secret \n     military programs to develop nuclear weapons (Pakistan and \n     Brazil) or were NPT parties whose nonproliferation \n     credentials were suspect at the time (South Korea).\n       What followed over the next few years, and is continuing \n     today, was the development\n      of other institutions outside NPT designed to patch the \n     omissions, ambiguities, ill-conceived constraints and \n     other flaws in the Treaty. Thus, we now have nuclear \n     supplier agreements, bilateral agreements, national and \n     multinational export controls, national technical means of \n     surveillance and international intelligence links, and \n     positive and negative security assurances to assist us in \n     keeping genie in the bottle. These tools, along with the \n     NPT and the associated IAEA safeguards system, are \n     referred to, collectively, as the nuclear nonproliferation \n     regime, a regime that is still evolving in the direction \n     of greater effectiveness, but is not yet at the point \n     where any of the nuclear weapon states would be prepared \n     to put their nuclear arsenals aside with confidence.\n       [[Page S4039]] Why is this so, and why has it been \n     necessary to create all these auxiliary tools to combat \n     proliferation? What have we learned over the past 25 years \n     that, had we known it in the 1960s, would have enabled us to \n     construct a better NPT and a better safeguards system? And, \n     in the end, does it matter, i.e., would a stronger NPT enable \n     us to rely for our security on this institution?\n\n\n            ii. a review of the major elements of the treaty\n\n                          A. Articles I and II\n\n       Article I mandates that each nuclear-weapon-State Party to \n     the Treaty may not transfer to any recipient nuclear weapons \n     explosive devices or control over such weapons or explosive \n     devices directly or indirectly; and may not in any way \n     assist, encourage, or induce any non-nuclear-weapon State to \n     manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other \n     nuclear explosive devices, or to obtain control over such \n     weapons or explosive devices. Article II prohibits non-\n     nuclear-weapon-States from receiving those things which \n     weapon-States are prohibited in Article I from giving, and \n     are specifically prohibited from manufacturing or otherwise \n     acquiring nuclear explosive devices.\n       The first problem with Articles I and II is that it is \n     unclear what constitutes ``assistance'', ``encouragement'', \n     or ``inducement'' to a non-nuclear-weapon-State; the second \n     problem is that it is unclear what constitutes \n     ``manufacture'' of a device; the third problem is that it is \n     unclear what constitutes a nuclear device because there is no \n     consensus on the definition of a nuclear explosion; and the \n     fourth problem is that there is no prohibition on a non-\n     weapon-State assisting another non-nuclear-weapon-State to \n     acquire nuclear weapons.\n       George Bunn and Roland Timerbaev, who were among the \n     negotiators of the text of the NPT, have written on the \n     question of what constitutes ``manufacture''\\2\\, and quote \n     the testimony of the Chief of the American delegation, \n     William C. Foster, before the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee. Foster said that ``the construction of an \n     experimental or prototype nuclear explosive device would not \n     be covered by the term `manufacture' as would be the \n     production of components which could only have relevance to a \n     nuclear explosive device''. He also made reference to \n     ``activities'' by a non-weapon-State that would ``tend'' to \n     put the Party in noncompliance of Article II if the purpose \n     of those activities was the acquisition of a nuclear \n     explosive device.\\3\\\n       In order to allay concerns about how one would determine \n     the purpose of certain fuel cycle activities that could be \n     peaceful or weapons-related, Foster added that: ``Neither \n     Uranium enrichment nor the stockpiling of fissionable \n     material in connection with a peaceful program would violate \n     Article II so long as those activities were safeguarded.'' \n     The reference to safeguards in his statement is immaterial, \n     because if a program is, indeed, peaceful, then there is no \n     violation of Article II even if the activity is \n     unsafeguarded. (In that case, the Party would be in \n     noncompliance with Article III, but that is another matter). \n     This points up a problem that runs throughout the NPT--lack \n     of definitive interpretation. Bunn/Timmerbaev write that the \n     Foster criteria for manufacture have generally been accepted \n     as authoritative interpretations by historians of the NPT \n     negotiations, but whether all current Parties to the NPT \n     would agree with those interpretations is unclear. It is \n     important to note that until the Iraq situation arose, there \n     was no indication that many of the Parties to the NPT viewed \n     the International Atomic Energy Agency as an appropriate \n     verification instrument to ensure that non-nuclear \n     weaponization activities weren't being carried out. Indeed, \n     there were debates in the past as to whether IAEA inspectors \n     were obligated to report any untoward activities they \n     observed (e.g., noting the presence of bomb components such \n     as machined hemispherical metal shells somewhere on the \n     premises) that were unrelated to the negotiated safeguards \n     agreement.\n       However, the Iraq situation and the South African decision \n     to abandon its nuclear weapons program has allowed the IAEA \n     to put its toe in the water on non-nuclear weaponization \n     activities. In the case of Iraq, the agency has been provided \n     information by the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) regarding \n     the Iraqi program and in the case of South Africa, the IAEA \n     was invited to examine with full transparency the scope, \n     nature, and facilities of the weapon program after \n     dismantlement. This included some non-nuclear weapon \n     components. This coupled with the acceptance by the NPT \n     members of the IAEA's ability to do ``special inspections'' \n     in the wake of the Gulf War is a start toward significant \n     reform.\n       By contrast, one may also note that the U.S./North Korea \n     Framework Agreement makes no mention of any non nuclear \n     weaponization activities or the disposition of any weapon \n     components that North Korea may have manufactured, and the \n     IAEA considers North Korea not in compliance with its \n     safeguards obligations because of its failure to allow \n     inspection of two nuclear waste sites. Ostensibly, if North \n     Korea were to allow these inspections and the result were to \n     show that all the plutonium in North Korea can be accounted \n     for, North Korea would then be considered by the IAEA an NPT \n     Party in good standing since there are not other allegations \n     officially pending regarding its NPT commitments.\n       Since the existence of a North Korean nuclear weapons \n     program in an assumption shared by most observers of the \n     scene, it is hard to believe that some weapon components have \n     not been manufactured by North Korea. However, it appears \n     that the IAEA will ignore this possible violation of the NPT, \n     at least for the time being, until it can account for all the \n     nuclear material in North Korea.\n       Another issue concerning manufacture is that of R & D, \n     particularly design information. Japan, in 1975, submitted a \n     paper to the Geneva Disarmament Conference arguing that the \n     NPT does not explicitly prohibit weapons-oriented R & D short \n     of actual production of nuclear explosive devices.\\4\\ In \n     rebuttal, much has been made of a statement made by the \n     drafters during the NPT negotiations that receipt by a non-\n     weapon-State of ``information on design'' of nuclear \n     explosives is barred by virtue of the probibition on \n     assistance in the ``manufacture'' of such explosives\\5\\; \n     however, it is unclear whether this can be extended to \n     prohibit a non-weapon-State from doing its own design without \n     external assistance.\n       It is a stretch to argue that the Foster criteria barred \n     such activity based on an assumption that the only purpose of \n     design is to acquire a nuclear explosive device. Some years \n     ago, Los Alamos asked some recently hired young physicists \n     with no weapons background to design a weapon based on the \n     open literature to see if it could be done and thereby to \n     gauge the possible extent of proliferation by this route. The \n     purpose of the activity was not to manufacture nuclear \n     weapons. The Treaty's vague language on ``manufacture'', \n     unless appropriately interpreted, would appear to allow \n     anyone to design weapons using the Los Alamos experiment and \n     rationale without violating the Treaty.\n       Once again, however, even if the Treaty were to be air \n     tight on this issue, verification of compliance would be \n     virtually impossible.\n       It is evident the Foster criteria do not settle the \n     question of what constitutes ``manufacturing''. The criteria \n     also don't settle some other important questions that arise \n     from consideration of the safeguards regime. Such \n     consideration will also reflect on the question of what \n     constitutes direct or indirect assistance or encouragement to \n     manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons which are \n     discussed in a later section.\n\n                             B. Article III\n\n       Article III has four parts. Article III.1 begins by \n     requiring Non-weapon-State Parties to accept safeguards, ``as \n     set forth in an agreement to be negotiated and concluded'' \n     with the IAEA in accordance with the IAEA's statute and \n     safeguards system, ``for the exclusive purpose of \n     verification of the Parties' NPT obligations with a view to \n     preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to \n     nuclear weapons''.\n       The remainder of Article III.1 states that safeguards \n     procedures shall be followed with respect to all source or \n     special fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear \n     activities within the territory of the State, under its \n     jurisdiction, or carried out under its control anywhere.\n       Note that while there is nothing in this language \n     explicitly referring to the effectiveness of safeguards, \n     effectiveness is to be inferred from the context. That is \n     because the Treaty cannot be an effective non-proliferation \n     instrument if it allows equipment, material, and technology \n     that could be used for nuclear explosive purposes to be \n     transferred with\n      ineffective safeguards attached. Unfortunately, this point \n     was not explicitly addressed by the drafters, and the \n     question of the relationship of trade to effectiveness of \n     safeguards (as opposed to the mere attachment of \n     safeguards) has accordingly become a contentious issue.\n       In their deconstruction of the language of Article III.1, \n     Bunn/Timerbaev argued that Article III.1 authorizes the IAEA \n     to verify that non-nuclear components for nuclear weapons are \n     not being manufactured.\\6\\ It would not be a difficult case \n     to make if the Article did not contain so much emphasis in \n     connecting safeguards to nuclear materials rather than \n     equipment (either nuclear or non-nuclear). As a result, Bunn \n     and Timerbaev lean part of their argument on an \n     interpretation of the phrase stating the purpose of \n     safeguards as ``verification of the fulfillment of (the \n     State's) obligations assumed under this Treaty with a view to \n     preventing diversion of nuclear energy * * *'' Bunn and \n     Timerbaev connect the clause ``with a view to preventing \n     diversion * * *'' to the State's obligations under the Treaty \n     not to manufacture weapons, but an equally if not more \n     plausible interpretation is that the antecedent of this \n     clause is safeguards, and that the clause has been added to \n     provide focus as to how safeguards relate in a practical way \n     to the State's NPT obligations. (Indeed, under the Bunn/\n     Timerbaev interpretation, Article III.1 would put States \n     under an NPT obligation to establish effective physical \n     security over nuclear materials. That it does not was \n     recognized and remedied by the voluntary (!) Physical \n     Security Convention developed by the IAEA and adopted by many \n     (NPT and non-NPT) countries with nuclear programs).\n       This is not to say that a case can't be made for safeguards \n     applying to non-nuclear weaponization activities, and Bunn/\n     Timerbaev have made the best case possible. It is just that \n     the emphasis in Article III on material safeguards along with \n     the history \n     [[Page S4040]] of safeguard negotiations and agreements \n     provide no confidence that a majority of members of the IAEA \n     that are State Parties to the NPT share this broad view of \n     safeguards. Taking the broadest view of the stated purpose of \n     safeguards as ``verification of the fulfillment of a (Non-\n     weapon-State's) obligations'' under the NPT could arguably \n     subject to inspection the agreements and arrangements by \n     which non-weapon-States allow weapon-States to place nuclear \n     weapons on their territory (Inspections of the agreements \n     could ensure that there were no protocols under which \n     transfer of authority or control over the weapons could take \n     place). Whether the weapon-States would agree to have the \n     IAEA inspectors examine these arrangements is, one suspects, \n     more than problematical.\n\n                             Article III.2\n\n       This Article provides that suppliers Party to the Treaty \n     shall not provide nuclear materials or equipment for \n     processing, use or production of such materials to a non-\n     weapon-State unless safeguards are attached. Over a period of \n     years, it became apparent that a more detailed and finer \n     screen for nuclear transfers than this had to be devised in \n     order to ensure uniformity of compliance by suppliers. The \n     result was the so-called ``Zangger'' list of nuclear items to \n     which safeguards must be attached, and, more recently, a list \n     of dual-use items requiring safeguards as well. In addition, \n     the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) has identified nuclear \n     export items requiring consideration of ``restraint'' and \n     ``consultation'' before the item is sent.\\7\\\n                             Article III.3\n       This Article is designed to ensure that safeguards \n     arrangements will not intrude on the ability of non-weapon-\n     States to obtain assistance for or otherwise develop their \n     nuclear energy activities. It references Article IV which has \n     been the basis for many complaints over the years regarding \n     the policies of the suppliers, particularly the U.S. Article \n     III.3 reflects the mindset of the nuclear establishments and \n     the non-weapon-States at the time of the drafting of the \n     Treaty, which was that the Treaty was also to be an \n     instrument for facilitating international nuclear commerce. \n     This mindset resulted in a safeguards system that was \n     designed more for its nonintrusiveness than for its \n     effectiveness. This is still a problem despite the \n     improvements in the wake of the Gulf War.\n\n                             Article III.4\n\n       Provides for a timetable by which States Party to the \n     Treaty must enter into appropriate safeguards arrangements. \n     This timetable has not been met many times in the past, but \n     the most egregious example was that of North Korea, which \n     took six years to enter into a safeguards agreement with the \n     IAEA. No sanction was imposed on North Korea or other \n     violators of this provision.\n\n                   The Safeguards System of the IAEA\n\n       The IAEA was established in 1957 in the wake of the U.S. \n     Atoms-for-Peace initiative and began operating an inspection \n     program in the early 60's designed to detect diversions of \n     significant quantities of nuclear material. The NPT expanded \n     the scope of the agency's work significantly, and in \n     response, the IAEA developed a model safeguards agreement for \n     NPT Parties contained in the document INFCIRC/153.\n       In this document, the IAEA states that the goal of \n     safeguards is the prevention of proliferation by ``the timely \n     detection of diversion of significant quantities of nuclear \n     material from peaceful nuclear activities to the manufacture \n     of nuclear weapons or of other explosive devices or for \n     purposes unknown, and the deterrence of such diversion by the \n     risk of detection''.\n       This was adopted in 1970 at a meeting of the so-called \n     Committee of the Whole which deliberated for 11 months before \n     the text of INFCIRC/153 was approved. Mr. Rudolph Rometsch \n     was the head of the IAEA's Department of Safeguards at the \n     time, and he was recently quoted in an interview saying that \n     the 1970 Committee meeting led to ``a sort of dogma for field \n     work--if not to a taboo. It was a question whether inspection \n     should be designed also to detect undeclared facilities. The \n     conclusion was clear at the time: looking for clandestine \n     activities was out of the question and the inspection system \n     was designed accordingly''\\8\\.\n       Thus, inspectors paid attention only to activities or \n     structures within defined strategic points, and were \n     discouraged from asking questions about anything else lest \n     they become persona-non-grata with the State (which had the \n     right to refuse an inspector) and perhaps ultimately at IAEA \n     headquarters.\n       INFCIRC/153, in addition to laying out the obligation on \n     the part of the State to have safeguards apply to all its \n     peaceful nuclear activities (so-called ``full scope \n     safeguards''), also stresses the importance of protecting \n     industrial and commercial secrets, not interfering in \n     peaceful nuclear activities, and not hampering economic and \n     technological development in the safeguarded state. This is \n     in keeping with the Agency's dual role. Its charter makes it \n     a promoter of nuclear energy at the same time it is to verify \n     that no diversions have taken place.\n       As a result, much negotiation follows the signing of the \n     main Safeguards Agreement between the IAEA and the State to \n     be inspected. The main agreement is followed (ostensibly \n     within 90 days) by Subsidiary Arrangements that specify what \n     the Agency and the State have to do in order for safeguards \n     to be applied. Nuclear installations must be listed, and \n     requirements for reporting to the Agency are specified in \n     negotiated detail. These subsidiary arrangements are not \n     published.\n       The most specific safeguards documents are the facility \n     attachments to the Subsidiary Arrangements. These state \n     exactly what will be done at each facility containing nuclear \n     material, and lay out the ``Material Balance Areas'' the \n     Agency will establish for accounting purposes. The flow of \n     nuclear material across these areas must be reported to the \n     Agency. The facility attachments also specify the points at \n     which measurements can be taken or samples withdrawn, the \n     installation of cameras, the access to be afforded to \n     inspectors, the records to be kept, and the anticipated \n     frequency of inspections. These negotiated arrangements are \n     also not published.\\9\\\n       Some years ago, the Agency developed internally a set of \n     technical objectives that provide a guideline for determining \n     the level of inspection and reporting that would ensure that, \n     at least for declared facilities in an NPT State, the goal of \n     timely detection by any diversion of a significant quantity \n     of nuclear materials would be met. Concern by inspected \n     States about intrusiveness has resulted in negotiated \n     safeguards agreements that do not come close to meeting these \n     technical objectives, and therefore cannot be said to be \n     producing effective safeguards by any objective criterion. \n     Inspected States have also leaned on the Agency to not even \n     exercise its full rights under the Agreements. In some cases, \n     the Agency itself refrains from exercising its full rights in \n     order to conserve resources.\n       This is a basic problem in that the IAEA's safeguards \n     agreements do not provide for the agency to inspect any \n     location--declared or undeclared--at any time (outside of \n     regularly scheduled routine inspections) without some \n     evidence that the site should be subject to inspection. Nor \n     do the agreements provide for IAEA inspectors to verify use \n     of any material formally exempted from safeguards. Thus, when \n     inspectors doing a routine inspection in Iraq\n      before the war were asked about buildings adjacent to an \n     Iraqi reactor, they were told it was used for nonnuclear \n     research. Since they were undeclared sites and IAEA had no \n     evidence of suspect activity, the agency had no basis to \n     inspect the building, which, as it turned out, contained a \n     radiochemical laboratory used for research on plutonium \n     separation.\n       Furthermore, the safeguards agreements ensure that there is \n     no such thing as a surprise inspection, even though, in \n     principle, IAEA has the right to make ``unannounced'' or \n     short-notice inspections. Routine inspections must provide \n     the state with at least 24 hours notice, and IAEA must advise \n     the State periodically of its general program of announced \n     and unannounced inspections, specifying the general period \n     when inspections are foreseen. Hence, States generally know \n     when and where inspections will occur, and in any case, have \n     control over the timing of admission of inspectors to the \n     country and to the facility.\n       The Gulf War has produced a situation where the IAEA has \n     successfully used its authority to conduct special \n     inspections in Iraq backed up by U.N. authority, and has \n     received voluntary offers from a number of states to allow \n     such inspections of declared or undeclared facilities. One of \n     those states was North Korea, which afterward withdrew its \n     offer after the agency demanded to inspect two sites the \n     North Koreans didn't want inspected. Those sites will be \n     inspected at some time in the future (at least 5 years) under \n     the U.S./North Korea framework agreement, which has the \n     unfortunate effect of leaving the agency holding the bag \n     despite its claims of access.\n       The IAEA has also not resolved the problem that it cannot \n     verify the peaceful use of nuclear materials exempted by the \n     agency from inspection. Such materials may involve (1) \n     special fissionable material in gram quantities used for \n     instrumentation; (2) nuclear material for production of \n     alloys or ceramics in non-nuclear applications; (3) plutonium \n     (Pu) of a certain isotope concentration (e.g., high in Pu-\n     238); or (4) limited quantities ranging from 1kgm of Pu to 20 \n     tons of depleted uranium. Iraq used an exemption for a spent \n     fuel assembly to conduct research on separating plutonium \n     without informing the agency. The agency had no authority to \n     routinely verify what Iraq said it was doing with the spent \n     fuel assembly.\n       It should be emphasized that the IAEA's problems are not \n     only with the Iraqs of the world. It has problems with many \n     states who are not suspected of weapons development. As \n     Lawrence Scheinman has pointed out; ``Over the past twenty \n     years, the Agency has experienced restraints on its right of \n     access, on the intensity and frequency of inspection efforts, \n     and even on the extent to which it could exercise its \n     discretionary judgment in planning, scheduling, and \n     conducting inspection''\\10\\.\n       To this should be added that the Agency's technical \n     objectives are themselves unrealistic because they are based \n     on ``significant quantities'' of fissionable material that \n     are at least twice as large as the amounts that a non-weapon-\n     State might need to construct its first nuclear explosive \n     device.\n       Why doesn't the IAEA lower the amount it considers a \n     ``significant quantity''? Because inspections would then have \n     to be more frequent and more intrusive, and the agency \n     [[Page S4041]] currently has neither the financial nor the \n     political support to make this move.\n       Raising the financial question exposes the agency's ``dirty \n     little secret''. Because safeguards are supposed to be \n     applied nondiscriminatively, much of the Agency's safeguards \n     budget goes to safeguards in Germany, Japan, and Canada, \n     while the largest current proliferation concerns are \n     elsewhere. The agency, which has been on a zero-growth budget \n     for the better part of a decade, attempts to address its \n     budget problems by slacking off on some inspections of \n     facilities it considers not of proliferation concern. But in \n     so doing it converts its nondiscriminatory character to the \n     status of myth and risks internal political turmoil. It \n     cannot help this because the cost of safeguarding bulk-\n     handling nuclear facilities such as enrichment, reprocessing, \n     or fuel fabrication plants is enormous, requiring, in most \n     cases, on-site location of inspectors and much better \n     instrumentation and measurements. While the IAEA has only \n     been required to safeguard small reprocessing plants thus \n     far, the ability of the agency to safeguard effectively \n     (leaving aside the expense) a commercial scale reprocessing \n     plant, such as the one being built at Rokkasho in Japan, has \n     been called into question by many people over the years. A \n     very interesting analysis done by Marvin Miller11 for \n     the Nuclear Control Institute shows that, for a reprocessing \n     plant with an 800 tonne/yr. capacity and an average plutonium \n     content of 0.9%, with a (1)% uncertainty in the \n     input measurement of plutonium (and assuming this dominates \n     the error in measuring MUF); and with a material balance \n     calculation done once a year, the absolute value of the MUF \n     variance (i.e., the error in measuring MUF) will be 72 kgm/\n     yr. In that case, the minimum amount of diverted plutonium \n     that could be distinguished form this measurement ``noise'' \n     with detection and false alarm probabilities of 95% and 5% \n     respectively is 246 kgm or more than 30 significant \n     quantities.\n       No other conclusion is admissible than that ``timely \n     detection'' of plutonium diversion from a reprocessing plant \n     is an oxymoron. This problem was recognized during \n     consideration of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act (NNPA) of \n     1978 where the concept of ``timely detection'' of a diversion \n     was translated into the concept of ``timely warning'' of \n     weapons development or construction. The intent of the \n     authors was that, from a technical point of view, timely \n     warning was unavailable in the case of plutonium diversion if \n     it is assumed that the non-nuclear elements of the bomb have \n     been constructed or assembled a priori. The NNPA provided \n     that the President could still allow U.S.-origin spent fuel \n     to be reprocessed in a foreign country if political factors \n     make the risk of proliferation sufficiently low even though \n     ``timely warning'' of weapons construction would not be \n     available to the United States. Not wanting to admit that \n     reprocessing, especially commercial scale reprocessing, was a \n     dangerous, not effectively safeguardable, activity, Reagan \n     Administration officials boldly and falsely interpreted the \n     NNPA language as incorporating political factors into the \n     definition of timely warning, thereby depriving the concept \n     of any objective meaning. (See 12 for a full discussion \n     of the history of the ``timely warning'' criterion in the \n     NNPA).\n       In like manner, the IAEA insists that bulk-handling \n     facilities can be effectively\n      safeguarded, but Miller's analysis shows that this is not \n     the case, and if the definition of a ``significant \n     quantity'' of plutonium were to be changed (i.e., the \n     amount lowered), the inability to do ``timely detection'' \n     would become still worse.\n       The response to these practical problems from within the \n     agency has been dismaying. Some have advocated lowering the \n     technical objectives, i.e., moving the goalposts so that \n     effectiveness of safeguards couldn't be so easily challenged.\n       To be sure, the agency has been chastened by its Iraq \n     experience, and is currently crafting a new safeguard \n     approach that aims to detect tiny amounts of fissile material \n     through environmental monitoring techniques such as wall \n     swabs and water samples. This will undoubtedly raise the cost \n     of safeguards and it remains to be seen how well these \n     proposals will be received by the members of the IAEA and the \n     signatories of the NPT.\n       Back in 1981, when the Reagan Administration was \n     formulating its non-proliferation policy, the Department of \n     Defense, in an interagency memo, expressed concern about the \n     IAEA's ``susceptibility to Third World * * * politics, its \n     lack of an intelligence capability and the limits of its \n     scope and jurisdiction''. While some of this complaint is \n     being addressed in the wake of the Gulf War (the IAEA is \n     considering how to use intelligence information brought to it \n     by member States), the Pentagon's 1981 warning ``against \n     undue reliance on the IAEA by those responsible for national \n     security'' within the U.S. government has as much resonance \n     today as in 1981 and will continue especially for as long as \n     production of fissile materials continues.\n\n                             C. Article IV\n\n       This article incorporates, in paragraph 2, one aspect of \n     ``the NPT bargain'' in which non-weapon-States Party to the \n     Treaty, in return for their adherence, ``have the right to \n     participate in the fullest possible exchange of equipment, \n     materials and scientific and technological information for \n     the peaceful use of nuclear energy''. The same paragraph also \n     calls on parties of the Treaty to cooperate in contributing \n     ``to the further development of the applications of nuclear \n     energy for peaceful purposes, especially in the territories \n     of non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty, with due \n     consideration for the needs of the developing areas of the \n     world''.\n       In past years, the major complaints about the NPT by non-\n     weapon-States have centered on this Article. these complaints \n     range from a generic one that the technologically advanced \n     States have not provided technical assistance or have not \n     sufficiently shared their nuclear know-how with others, to \n     specific complaints that the Nuclear Suppliers Group, and \n     especially the United States, in seeking to control nuclear \n     and dual-use exports or to exercise consent rights in nuclear \n     agreements, are engaged in willful and systematic violation \n     of Article IV.\n       There are a number of things to say about this. First, \n     Article IV does not modify the\n      requirements of Articles I and II not to assist or receive \n     assistance respectively in the manufacture of nuclear \n     explosive devices. Second, as indicated earlier, \n     verification of NPT obligations under Article III ``with a \n     view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from \n     peaceful uses to nuclear weapons'', cannot be effectively \n     carried out at this time for enrichment and reprocessing \n     facilities under the safeguards system that is the \n     instrument for the implementation of Article III.\n       Accordingly, the transfer of facilities, equipment, or \n     technology to a non-weapon-State for the production of highly \n     enriched uranium or plutonium should be interpreted as not in \n     keeping with Article III's implicit qualification that \n     effective safeguards must be applied to all peaceful nuclear \n     activities. Otherwise, nuclear-weapon-States making such \n     transfers could find themselves in violation of Article I, \n     and the NPT would become an instrument for proliferation.\n       Indeed, it is apparent that some States--Iraq, Libya among \n     them--signed the NPT because they saw Article IV as a \n     possible route to obtaining nuclear weapons-related \n     technology and equipment.\n       To date, there has been no formal resolution of the \n     argument over Article IV, but one can interpret the Nuclear \n     Suppliers Agreement to exercise restraint in nuclear trade \n     involving export of reprocessing or enrichment technology as \n     recognition that Article IV should not be interpreted as \n     liberally as it appears to read. Unfortunately, the potential \n     recipients of such trade do not accept this tightened \n     interpretation, and were it not for the fact that the \n     economics of the back end of the fuel cycle have become so \n     egregious, the argument might well be as loud today as it was \n     in 1977 when the Carter Administration began moving away from \n     the earlier policy of relatively unrestricted nuclear trade.\n       It is ironic that the Carter Administration and the U.S. \n     Congress were roundly denounced in 1978 for requiring, in the \n     NNPA, that Full Scope Safeguards be a nuclear export \n     criterion. With few exceptions, the nuclear suppliers refused \n     to go along despite the inferral that their opposition meant \n     they put export profits above support for the NPT. Eventually \n     all came around and adopted the criterion themselves, but it \n     took the Gulf War to do it.\n       Finally, it is unfortunate, if understandable, that Article \n     IV is so fixated on nuclear technology cooperation. Assuming \n     the need for tangible incentives to produce NPT signatories \n     in the first place a much better NPT would have resulted if \n     Article IV had made cooperation in every development (not \n     just nuclear) the quid pro quo for an NPT signature. That \n     way, the fight over Article IV might have been avoided, and \n     it would have made the phrase ``with due consideration for \n     the needs (emphasis added) of the developing'' world more \n     trenchant.\n                             D. Article VI\n\n       Article VI expresses the second part of the ``NPT bargain'' \n     (Article IV expresses the first part). In this Article, \n     ``each of the Parties to the Treaty (especially including the \n     weapon-States)'' undertakes to pursue negotiations in good \n     faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the \n     nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament \n     under strict and effective international control''.\n       Let us begin by noting that, at least in quantitative \n     terms, the nuclear arms race, as usually defined, that \n     included the U.S., the Former Soviet Union, Great Britain, \n     and France is over. None of these countries is increasing \n     their stockpile of nuclear arms (that may also be true of \n     China, but evidence is not forthcoming). If one defines the \n     nuclear arms race as including weapons modernization, even if \n     the numbers aren't going up, then the race may not yet be \n     over. It is to this issue that a Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty (CTBT) is most relevant, not to mention the fact that \n     a CTBT is referenced in the Preamble to the NPT. Without \n     testing, radical new designs of nuclear weapons are \n     problematical, although simulation codes are now very highly \n     advanced. Therefore, the insistence by some non-weapon-State \n     Parties of the NPT that a CTBT be a short-term goal of the \n     NPT weapon states to fulfill part of their Article VI \n     responsibilities is not unreasonable. A CTBT would have other \n     non-proliferation benefits in that it would raise the \n     political barriers to overt testing by nuclear states not \n     Party to the NPT. Thus, the NPT is playing a useful role by \n     providing a forum \n     [[Page S4042]] and a rationale for those countries interested \n     in having a CTBT to push the weapon-States, particularly the \n     U.S., into a serious negotiation to formalize the current \n     moratorium. Some members of the Treaty are taking the \n     position that they will refuse to vote for indefinite \n     extension unless and until further progress is made toward \n     nuclear disarmament. Despite this threat, it is hard to \n     escape the conclusion that if the Cold War hadn't ended, the \n     prospect of a CTBT being completed in the near future, let \n     alone substantial progress toward nuclear disarmament, would \n     be poor despite the pressure on the weapon-States stemming \n     from their desire for an indefinite extension of the NPT when \n     the decision comes up at the 25-year Review Conference in \n     April, 1995.\n       But the Cold War is over, and the U.S. now finds itself in \n     the ironic position of possibly being outvoted on the \n     extension issue by a group of countries who want progress in \n     nuclear disarmament, perhaps don't mind at the same time \n     discomfiting the weapon-States, and perhaps also enjoy the \n     fact that many of them were asked by the U.S. to sign the NPT \n     during the 80s despite their having no nuclear energy program \n     or prospects whatsoever.\n       Could the NPT unravel over this issue? Hardly. There is no \n     serious current prospect of any NPT Party leaving the Treaty \n     or organizing a movement to terminate the Treaty. A majority \n     vote to recess the Review Conference for one or more years \n     while a CTBT is negotiated is possible. A limited extension \n     of the Treaty is also a possibility, in accordance with the \n     language of Article X (discussed in the next section). This \n     limited extension (which could be for a very long time) could \n     be divided into shorter periods with votes scheduled at the \n     end of each such period to determine whether the Treaty \n     should be extended into the\n      succeeding period. It is conceivable that the start of each \n     such period of extension could be made contingent on some \n     requirement for a certain degree of disarmament by the \n     weapon-States.\\13\\\n       The linkage of the extension vote to specific progress \n     toward nuclear disarmament is believed by some to be a risky \n     strategy. The latter is based on the threat of lowering \n     political barriers to proliferation if the weapon-States \n     don't take their obligations under Article VI more seriously, \n     and there is no doubt that the weapon-States do not wish to \n     see those barriers lowered. However, it can be argued that an \n     indefinite extension provides confidence that allows the \n     weapon-States to continue reducing their weapons stockpile, \n     while a limited extension designed to push the weapons-States \n     into faster progress could, if other political factors make \n     accelerated progress impossible, have the perverse effect of \n     putting a ceiling on progress precisely because of the fear \n     that the Treaty might end and new nuclear powers might then \n     emerge.\n       As of this writing (November, 1994), the U.S. does not have \n     the votes to prevail on extending the Treaty indefinitely. It \n     appears likely that, in the absence of some new factor in the \n     debate, the Review Conference will either be recessed pending \n     completion of CTBT negotiations or will vote for a long-term, \n     but not indefinite, extension with periodic reviews of \n     progress toward disarmament.\n\n                            E. Article VIII\n\n       This Article lays out the procedures for amending the \n     Treaty. For a proposed amendment to be adopted, the text must \n     first be submitted to the Depositary Governments (U.S., U.K., \n     Russia) for circulation to all Parties to the Treaty. Then, \n     if requested by at least one third of the Parties to the \n     Treaty, a conference is convened to consider the amendment. \n     Adoption occurs only if the amendment is approved by:\n       1. A majority of the Parties to the Treaty.\n       2. All nuclear weapon-States Party to the Treaty.\n       3. All Parties who, on the date of circulation of the \n     proposed amendment, are members of the Board of Governors of \n     the IAEA.\n       The amendment then goes into force for those Parties that \n     have ratified it when a majority of the Parties to the Treaty \n     have filed their instrument of ratification. Thus, approved \n     amendments to the Treaty apply only to those Parties who wish \n     to have them apply and have so indicated via ratification.\n       The remainder of this Article provides for the five-year \n     Review Conferences that have taken place since 1970.\n                              F. Article X\n\n       This next-to-last Article of the NPT provides that after \n     giving three months notice and an explanation, each Party has \n     the ``right to withdraw from the Treaty if it decides that \n     extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of the \n     Treaty, have jeopardized the supreme interests of its \n     country''.\n       The Article also provides for the 25th year Review \n     Conference to decide, by majority vote, whether the Treaty \n     shall be extended indefinitely or for an additional fixed \n     period or periods. As pointed out in a recent paper by Bunn, \n     Van Doren, and Fischer\\14\\, this language would allow for the \n     NPT to be extended for an indefinite number of fixed periods \n     unless a majority vote taken at the end of some fixed period \n     were to terminate the Treaty.\n       It was the first paragraph of Article X that Saddam Hussein \n     would have employed to leave the NPT after putting into place \n     the infrastructure to build nuclear weapons. Since there is \n     no presumption in the Article of sanctions for leaving the \n     Treaty, the only real protection against the use of the \n     treaty to gain technology, equipment, and materials that \n     could be useful for weapons is to impose a set of \n     multilateral (and unilateral) export controls on appropriate \n     items with sanctions for violations of those controls. This, \n     of course, files in the face of the philosophy of laissez-\n     faire technology transfer embodied in Article IV, but is \n     necessary if the nonproliferation regime is to be worthy of \n     its name.\n\n\n                  III. Conclusions and Recommendations\n\n                 A. Strengthening the safeguards system\n\n       We have already discussed the deficiencies of the system in \n     conjunction with the discussion of Article III. To remedy \n     those deficiencies would require the following \n     (nonexhaustive) changes to the system:\n       1. The IAEA must require more transparency in the nuclear \n     activities of its members. Among other things this should \n     include a complete list of sensitive or dual-use items \n     requiring export controls, and registry of trade in such \n     items. This list should contain the union of those items \n     brought to the table by IAEA members and not the \n     intersection; and should cover all sensitive technologies, \n     whether obsolete, current, or advanced.\n       2. The IAEA must have access to intelligence information \n     obtained through national technical means concerning sites \n     that may require inspection, and must have an unequivocal \n     right to inspect such sites at short notice.\n       3. Safeguards should apply to nuclear plants and equipment \n     as well as materials. INFCIRC/153 safeguards which apply to \n     the entire fuel cycle of a non-weapon-State Party to the NPT, \n     should be combined with the INFCIRC/66 safeguards, which \n     address plants and equipment as well as material for non-NPT \n     Parties. Any nuclear\n      facility, whether it contains material or not should be \n     subject to inspection on short notice.\n       4. Safeguards should also apply to uranium concentrates \n     such as U3O8, not just to UO2, and to nuclear \n     wastes containing fissionable material.\n       5. A definition of effective safeguards should be adopted \n     based on agreed measures of performance embodying appropriate \n     technical objectives. That is the agency must be able to say \n     that with a specified (high) degree of probability and a \n     specified (low) false alarm rate, the diversion of a \n     significant quantity of specified nuclear material will be \n     detected withing a specified amount of time (depending on the \n     material) which is well in advance of the time needed by the \n     diverter to convert the material into a nuclear explosive \n     device, assuming that all non-nuclear weapon-related \n     activities have been carried out.\n       6. The amount of nuclear material in a ``significant \n     quantity'' should be reduced by at least a factor of 2 in the \n     case of both uranium and plutonium.\n       7. All States with safeguarded nuclear activities should be \n     required to post a bond with the IAEA based on that State's \n     GDP and the size and sensitivity of its nuclear program. \n     Safeguards violations and other violations of IAEA \n     regulations and NPT commitments, as well as a decision to \n     leave the NPT should result in forfeiture of part or all of \n     the bond.\n       8. Safeguards should be imposed on non-nuclear materials \n     useful in manufacturing weapons such as Tritium, Lithium-6, \n     and Beryllium.\n       9. Safeguards should be established over nuclear research \n     and development activities and facilities.\n       10. The annual Safeguards Implementation Report of the \n     Agency should be a public docment.\n\n            B. Interpreting the NPT to strengthen the regime\n\n       The NPT, being a document negotiated among many people from \n     different nations and with different political objectives and \n     constraints, is inevitably a document of compromises, laced \n     with imprecise language, nuanced meaning, and cognitively \n     dissonant passages. Depending on how the Treaty is \n     interpreted, it is either, as claimed, the core of the \n     world's non-proliferation regime, or it is a tool for \n     proliferants to hide their ambitions and legitimize their \n     activities.\n       There are at least two main areas where the non-\n     proliferation regime can be strengthened via an \n     interpretation of the language of the NPT. The first involves \n     the language\n      of Article I requiring that each weapon-State NPT Party not \n     in any way to assist a non-nuclear weapon-State to \n     manufacture nuclear explosive devices.\n       As Eldon Greenberg\\15\\ has pointed out, the negotiating \n     history of the NPT does not permit one to conclude that \n     simply because safeguards are applied to a nuclear transfer, \n     then the transfer is legitimate. (Transfer of the components \n     of an explosive device is prohibited even if safeguards are \n     attached.) Moreover, the very real possibility that an NPT \n     Party may be a proliferator in disguise makes it incumbent \n     upon suppliers to make judgments about the ultimate use of \n     exported technology and equipment. Such judgments could take \n     into account the economic and technical need for the exported \n     items.\n       Accordingly, it is at least arguable that the transfer of \n     reprocessing equipment or technology to a non-weapon-State, \n     because \n     [[Page S4043]] such technology cannot be effectively \n     safeguarded and exhibits no compelling economic need anywhere \n     in the world, constitutes prohibited assistance under Article \n     I.\n       Article I's language prohibiting indirect assistance by a \n     weapon-State may also be interpreted as prohibiting nuclear \n     assistance of any kind by weapon-States to non-weapon-States \n     not party to the NPT, on the grounds that such assistance \n     releases resources by those States that may be used in \n     unsafeguarded nuclear programs--perhaps devoted in part to \n     weapons development.\n\n           C. Some flaws in the treaty that ought to be fixed\n\n       1. The NPT does not forbid a non-weapon-State from \n     possessing nuclear weapons. (It forbids the acquisition, but \n     in theory a country which weapons could sign the NPT as a \n     non-weapon-State and not give up weapons already made).\n       2. There is nothing in the Treaty that prohibits a non-\n     weapon-State Party to the Treaty from assisting another non-\n     weapon-State to manufacture or otherwise acquire the bomb.\n       3. The treaty should be clarified to ensure no challenge to \n     the notion that safeguards includes the ability to search for \n     non-nuclear activities relevant to bomb-making, including \n     R To ensure that this doesn't convert the IAEA into a \n     university on weapons design, only inspectors from current or \n     former weapon-States should be involved in this activity.\n       4. The Treaty does not require the IAEA to verify the \n     obligation of a non-weapon-State not to receive assistance in \n     the manufacture or acquisition of nuclear weapons.\n       5. The Treaty does not require the IAEA to verify that \n     exports of nuclear hardware by NPT suppliers to non-weapon-\n     States are carrying safeguards.\n       6. The Treaty does not define the point at which one can \n     say that construction of a nuclear explosive device has \n     begun. The Foster criterion relating ``manufacture'' to \n     construction of a component having relevance only to a \n     nuclear explosive device could constitute such a definition. \n     In that case, activities involving machines capable of \n     creating such components could become subject to special \n     inspections.\n       7. The Treaty does not prohibit a non-weapon-State from \n     using nuclear energy for military purposes but is unclear as \n     to permitted ``military uses'' that are exempt from \n     safeguards. In his recent book, David Fischer\\16\\ posed \n     questions as to whether a non-weapon-State could build a \n     reactor, claim it is the prototype of a naval reactor and \n     thereby exempt its fuel from safeguards. Likewise a State \n     could withhold material from safeguards upon becoming an NPT \n     Party by claiming (to itself--it has no obligation to inform \n     the IAEA) that the material is for a permitted military \n     purpose. Finally, the Treaty appears to allow a ``military'' \n     enrichment plant whose output is only for naval reactors to \n     be unsafeguarded, and the Treaty appears to allow \n     unsafeguarded nuclear exports for permitted military use.\n       8. The Treaty's language in Article III.3 has been used to \n     support arguments against making safeguards more intrusive. \n     The Treaty should state as a principle that whenever a \n     conflict occurs between effective safeguards application and \n     compliance with Article IV, resolution in favor of effective \n     safeguards shall govern.\n       9. The Treaty does not embargo transfers of sensitive \n     equipment, materials or technology--but it should whenever \n     effective safeguards do not apply.\n       10. The Treaty does not provide for sanctions for violators \n     or for withdrawal from the Treaty.\n       11. The Treaty is difficult to amend, but worse than that, \n     only those parties ratifying the amendment are subject to it.\n       12. The Treaty does not preclude possession and stockpiling \n     of plutonium or highly enriched uranium by a non-weapon-\n     State, regardless of economic or technical justification or \n     the effectiveness of safeguards.\n       13. The Treaty does not preclude nuclear trade with States \n     not Party to the NPT.\n       14. The Treaty's provision on withdrawal does not provide \n     for any disposition of nuclear assets or payment for nuclear \n     assistance received by the withdrawing State by virtue of its \n     NPT membership.\n\n   D. What should be our level of reliance on the NPT as a security \n                                measure?\n\n       As stated at the outset, there is no question that the NPT \n     has been a valuable\n      institution. It has helped create a non-proliferation ethic \n     that has raised the political barriers, at least in \n     democratic States, to overt proliferation. It has played a \n     useful role as an anchor or central element in all the \n     discussions about security with the Newly Independent \n     States and other States in Eastern Europe. It provided an \n     outlet for U.S./Soviet cooperation during the days of the \n     Cold War that made it more difficult for each side to \n     demonize the other and thereby lowered the risk of war. It \n     has provided an outlet for countries desiring to play a \n     role on the world stage in disarmament to do so without \n     becoming weapon-States themselves. It provided a way for \n     South Africa to give up its weapons program with a minimum \n     of lingering doubt and suspicion because of IAEA \n     verification, and it provided a basis for dealing with the \n     North Korean weapons program.\n       On the other hand, the NPT has also has been a convenient \n     political cover for countries known to be interested in \n     acquiring nuclear weapons, played no essential role in \n     turning around the past South Korean and Taiwanese \n     clandestine weapons programs, did not produce an appropriate \n     response to Iraq's weapons program until after Saddam Hussein \n     invaded Kuwait and was militarily defeated, and provides no \n     restraint on the stockpiling of weapons materials by any \n     State as long as they are under safeguards.\n       Since many of its adherents joined because of the promise \n     of technical assistance and technology transfer, the Treaty \n     does not incorporate any nuclear trade restrictions, leaving \n     it to the suppliers alone to decide what should or should not \n     be transferred.\n       And in the end, the ability to leave the Treaty with 90 \n     days notice means that there is no essential barrier to a \n     country, with the technological known-how to build weapons, \n     and that sees nuclear weapons as its best option for \n     enhancing its security, from proceeding to build them.\n       Even if the Treaty and the safeguards system had been \n     originally constructed with the needed reforms discussed in \n     this paper, its implementation would still ultimately depend \n     on the resolve of the international community acting through \n     the Board of Governors of the IAEA (which occasionally has a \n     proliferator as Chair) and the UN Security Council.\n       Nonetheless, the warts exhibited by the Treaty and its \n     still evolving safeguards system do not vitiate the political \n     value of the nonproliferation norm that has been nurtured by \n     the Treaty and the rest of the non-proliferation regime--the \n     nuclear weapons free zones, the Tlatelolco and Rarotonga \n     Treaties, the export control laws and agreements (both \n     multilateral and unilateral), and other instruments.\n       In sum then, the Treaty cannot be a substitute for measures \n     one might otherwise take in protecting one's security. And \n     without reform it does not provide a good model for dealing \n     with proliferation threats other than nuclear, such as \n     chemical, biological, or missile, but it is an important \n     adjunct whose absence would raise current anxiety levels \n     about the spread of weapons of mass destruction.\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, opened \n     for signature July 1, 1968, 21 U.S.T. 483, 729 U.N.T.S. 161.\n     \\2\\George Bunn and Roland M.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my two distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Roth and Glenn, and the other original cosponsors \nin urging the adoption of the sense-of-the Senate language on the \nunlimited and unconditional extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty at the upcoming renewal session beginning next month. The \nimportance of the treaty to U.S. nonproliferation efforts can hardly be \nexaggerated. The Committee on Governmental Affairs held a hearing on \nTuesday of this week, with a panel of distinguished witnesses, which \nserved to highlight the strong bipartisan support for extension of the \ntreaty. I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution of \nendorsement of the unlimited and unconditional extension of the NPT.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  [[Page S4044]] Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished \nmanager, we are ready for a voice vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 338) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for himself, Mr. \n     Byrd, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \n     Pressler, Mr. Burns, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Simpson, \n     Mr. Lugar, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Conrad, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 339.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 110. SENSE OF SENATE ON SOUTH KOREA TRADE BARRIERS TO \n                   UNITED STATES BEEF AND PORK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has approximately 37,000 military \n     personnel stationed in South Korea and spent over \n     $2,000,000,000 last year to preserve peace on the Korean \n     peninsula.\n       (2) The United States Trade Representative has initiated a \n     section 301 investigation against South Korea for its \n     nontariff trade barriers on United States beef and pork.\n       (3) The barriers cited in the section 301 petition include \n     government-mandated shelf-life requirements, lengthy \n     inspection and customs procedures, and arbitrary testing \n     requirements that effectively close the South Korean market \n     to such beef and pork.\n       (4) United States trade and agriculture officials are in \n     the process of negotiating with South Korea to open South \n     Korea's market to United States beef and pork.\n       (5) The United States meat industry estimates that South \n     Korea's nontariff trade barriers on United States beef and \n     pork cost United States businesses more than $240,000,000 in \n     lost revenue last year and could account for more than \n     $1,000,000,000 in lost revenue to such business by 1999 if \n     South Korea's trade practices on such beef and pork are left \n     unchanged.\n       (6) The United States beef and pork industries are a vital \n     part of the United States economy, with operations in each of \n     the 50 States.\n       (7) Per capita consumption of beef and pork in South Korea \n     is currently twice that of such consumption in Japan. Given \n     that the Japanese are currently the leading importers of \n     United States beef and pork, South Korea holds the potential \n     of becoming an unparalleled market for United States beef and \n     pork.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the security relationship between the United States and \n     South Korea is essential to the security of the United \n     States, South Korea, the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of \n     the world;\n       (2) the efforts of the United States Trade Representative \n     to open South Korea's market to United States beef and pork \n     deserve support and commendation; and\n       (3) The United States Trade Representative should continue \n     to insist upon the removal of South Korea's nontariff \n     barriers to United States beef and pork.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nurging the United States Government to remain firm in its effort to \nopen the Korean market to American beef and pork exports. The United \nStates has initiated a section 301 case on the issue, and this \namendment will put the Senate on record in support of the USTR and our \nstockgrowers.\n  We have been a good friend to South Korea over the years. And South \nKorea has abundant evidence of our friendship.\n  Fifty-seven thousand Americans gave their lives in the Korean war. \nToday, nearly 40,000 American men and women are on the line of what is \nstill one of the world's most dangerous regions. We are right to be \nthere because our presence helps keep the peace in a critically \nimportant region.\n  We are also a critically important market for Korea. We Americans buy \nKorean cars, kim chee, semiconductors and more. In total $17 billion in \nimports from Korea in 1993, and more than that, almost $20 billion last \nyear.\n  So we are good friends to Korea, but friendship works both ways. The \nleast Korea can do is to be as open to our products as we are to \ntheirs.\n  Beef is a perfect example. Today, American meat exports to Korea are \nblocked by a web of nontariff barriers.\n  Unscientific shelf-life requirements require chilled beef in Korea to \nbe sold in very unrealistically short periods of time, combined with \nthe Customs regulations that deliberately delay beef shipments at the \nports, which creates a catch-22 situation, making it almost impossible \nto sell red meat in Korea.\n  If Korea would remove these barriers, the meat industry estimates \nthat the return could be as much as $240 million this year alone and by \nthe turn of the century, our meat exports would rise to $1 billion a \nyear.\n  So the issue is simple: Ambassador Kantor is asking Korea to live by \nthe standards that most trading nations already live by and that they \nhave, as Koreans, accepted by their entry into the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  Up to now, they have not done so. One barrier has been abolished \nsimply to be replaced by others. We have been patient for years, and \nthe time has now come to be firm.\n  We have, therefore, as Americans initiated a section 301 case on the \nissue, and history shows that when we have a good case--and we do--and \nwe show that we are serious--and we are--section 301 cases get results.\n  This sense-of-the-Senate amendment will put us on record in support \nof that case and strengthen Ambassador Kantor and his negotiators in \ntheir effort. I hope our stockgrowers can count on the support of the \nSenate. I ask for support of this amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution on the question of Korean trade practices offered by \nthe distinguished Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus]. It encourages the \nUnited States Trade Representative to insist on South Korea's removal \nof unfair nontariff trade barriers to United States beef and pork \nproducts. The issue is, unfortunately, a familiar one in our trading \nrelations with the Pacific--nontariff barriers to our trade, amounting \nto effective closure of their markets to our goods, regardless of \ntariff schedules, despite agreements to the contrary, flying in the \nface of our conception of free trade. The question of nontariff \nbarriers, of closed market practices has bedeviled trade with Japan, \nand now is bedeviling our trading relations with Korea, as well as \nChina.\n  The specific issue is the Korean market for United States chilled \nbeef and pork products, a potentially lucrative market worth as much as \n$240 million in exports this year, and growing to the $1 billion annual \nrange by the end of the century. The issue has festered since at least \n1988 when American meat producers filed a petition concerning Korean \ndiscriminatory practices under section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. \nAmerican producers succeeded in getting proceedings in a GATT panel, \nand this resulted in three bilateral trade agreements, in 1989, 1990, \nand 1993. Then in 1994 the USTR did accept the section 301 petition \nbrought by American meat and pork producers, alleging unjustifiable \nregulatory restrictions that effectively block their export products \nfrom the Korean market.\n  Now, Mr. President, what is the current result of nearly a decade of \ncomplaining, initiation of a 301 case, action under the GATT, extended \nnegotiations, and the signing of several additional agreements? The \ndirector of the USTR's Asian division has informed my staff that as of \ntoday the total of United States imports into Korea of chilled pork is \nzero and red meat is minimal. The results are zero and minimal. This is \nAmerica's fourth largest agricultural market, yet we cannot get meat \ninto it, despite the signing of numerous agreements and constant \nnegotiations. This dismal situation is not for lack of trying: USTR \nengaged the Koreans in consultation in mid-January, and resumed \nnegotiations just this month. The negotiations just concluded have \napparently failed to get \n[[Page S4045]] market access. What we are seeking is a specific \ntimetable from the Koreans to eliminate what is obvious to both them \nand us as burdensome regulatory practices designed for the sole purpose \nof keeping United States meat products out of Korea.\n  It is time for the Koreans to settle this issue. We have asked for \nthe Koreans to reform their current antiquated regulatory requirements, \nestablish an interim system to go into effect immediately, letting \nUnited States products into their market, and to permanently revise \ntheir regulations according to a specific timetable. While the Koreans \nannounced last September that they intend to reform their system, they \nhave stalled on doing so. The Koreans, in the latest round of \nnegotiations this month would not agree to the establishment of such an \ninterim system that would allow trade to take place. The Trade \nRepresentative has recently announced that the United States is now \nprepared to take the case to the newly-formed World Trade Organization \n[WTO] for ``consultations'' on the scientific basis for Korean meat \nexclusions, opening up a second track of discussions and dispute \nsettlement, if it comes to that. I strongly encourage this route, \nexposing the Korean practices widely in a multilateral forum, raising \nthe visibility of the problem. It would serve as an excellent test case \nof the WTO dispute settlement procedures. What is the WTO for, I ask my \ncolleagues, if not for this type of situation? Of course, at any time \nthe Koreans can avoid that by providing us with an interim regime of \nmarket access.\n  Similar problems are being experienced with the Koreans in \ntelecommunications equipment, with the Koreans refusing to certify an \nupdated AT switch already operating in the Korean market in order for \nAT to compete in a new round of Korean procurement. Here again the \ndiscriminatory behavior is in violation of a United States-Korean \nbilateral agreement. The Koreans have had 2 years to investigate and \ncertify the switch, but recently announced they would need another 70 \nweeks to test it. Seventy weeks. This is just plain delay, calculated \nto give a Korean-made switch more time to compete.\n  Similar situations have occurred in regard to other products, such as \nmedical devices, bottled water, raisins, and candy. Let's take a recent \nexample of chocolate. The Korean Minister of Health is refusing entry \nof five containers of Mars chocolate claiming insufficient label \ninformation, with new requirements never before announced. Several of \nthe containers have been held since last December. The alleged missing \ninformation was not notified to either the United States or the World \nTrade Organization, and the resulting obstruction of trade is a \nviolation of Korea's obligation under the WTO agreement to publish \nregulations affecting trade and administer them in a ``uniform, \nimpartial and reasonable manner.'' We are getting nowhere fast with the \nKoreans on this matter either, which is resulting in substantial \nfinancial damage to an American company. Last week the Korean \nGovernment stiffed the United States Trade Representative's negotiators \non the matter.\n  Korean behavior on United States trade is clearly reaching a level of \nconcern which can affect our overall bilateral relationship. It is \naffecting, in my view, the strength, fairness, and durability of our \nrelationship with South Korea. American national security, the health \nof our defense budget, and our ability to continue to honor our \ncommitment to defend South Korea depends on our overall long-term \neconomic health. Our economic health is dependent, to a significant \ndegree, on good trading balances, and such balances have been \nconsistently negative with North Asian countries, Japan, China, and to \na lesser extent, Korea. Korea needs to understand that trade and mutual \ndefense are a two-way street. First, on trade the United States is \nvital to Korean exports of automobiles, semiconductors, and other \nitems, now approaching $20 billion in annual revenues to Korean \nmanufacturers. Second, the Koreans expect us to come to their defense \non a moment's notice, because we have made a commitment to do so. I \nexpect the Koreans to be forthcoming, to lean over backward to \naccommodate our trade, to honor the agreements we have reached with \nthem in the spirit with which they were intended--that is, to give\n United States products reciprocal access to the Korean market. In \naddition, obfuscation, stonewalling, and erecting baloney barriers to \nsuch access violates the spirit of our overall relationship, and by \nthat I mean our overall security relationship. Economic health is \nfundamental to America national security, and fundamental to the \ncontinuation of a strong United States-Korean defense relationship.\n\n  I suggest that the officials with whom we have had such an excellent \nrelationship with in the Korean defense establishment get in touch with \nthe foot-draggers in the agencies stalling on United States trade and \nturn the lights on. The time is overdue for reciprocity on the part of \nKorea. I am going to watch closely for Korean agreement to set a \nspecific timetable for allowing United States meat and pork into Korea, \nfor allowing AT to compete in the 1995 Korean procurement cycle, for \nrelease of confectioneries from Korean ports to Korean store shelves, \nand in general for a change in attitude toward its most reliable \ndefender. The United States is stationing nearly 40,000 of the 100,000 \npersonnel we have deployed to the Pacific for the defense of Korea, we \nshed the blood of tens of thousands more against invasion from the \nnorth during the Korean war. Korea is considered one of the two so-\ncalled ``major regional conflicts'' around which we are basing the \nforce structure and budget parameters of our defense budget. From what \nI am reading, the product with the best chance of gaining ready access \nto the Korean Peninsula is American troops, gladly accepted for the \ndefense of Seoul. It is time for Korea to understand the critical \nimportance of a healthy trading relationship, and it is time for Korea \nto treat the United States as an economic ally as well as a military \nally.\n  I commend the Senator from Montana for bringing this matter to the \nSenate's attention. The Trade Representative is doing the best he can \nto cope with Korean behavior, and if he eventually needs the benefit of \ncongressional pressure on nontrade matters, I am sure it will be \navailable.\n  I also commend the Trade Representative on his recent success in \nregard to the progress he has made with the third of our north Asian \ntrading partners, China. Late last month the USTR successfully \nnegotiated an agreement with China to provide protection of \nintellectual property rights for United States companies and provide \nmarket access for such products. Just last week, he was able to \nconclude another agreement with the Chinese to gain Chinese compliance \nwith a 1992 agreement for better access for nearly 3,000 different \nUnited States products over a period of several years. The Chinese did \nnot fully comply with that accord, and now we have an agreement, \napparently, to abide by the earlier agreement.\n  Mr. President, the Chinese also need to understand that it is not \nenough to sign agreements, but that they must be abided by in a spirit \nof cooperation, in an effort to make them work, and not dance around \nthem. The Chinese want to be a member of the World Trade Organization, \nand so they threatened to forego implementing existing agreements until \nwe agree to give them another carrot in terms of support for membership \nin this organization. But, Mr. President, the proof of the pudding is \nin the eating, on these agreements. They must be energetically \nimplemented. I believe that it would be very useful if the Senate \nconducted frequent reviews of the record of our trading partners in \nimplementing the agreements they have signed with us. Implementation is \nthe key, for instance to the extensive agreements we signed with \nBeijing on intellectual property. And it is certainly key to the \nvarious bilateral agreements we have signed with the Koreans. \nCompliance with the provisions of the WTO should also be insisted upon \nfor Korea, and China if she is admitted.\n  I hope that the Trade Representative will ensure that his Korean, as \nwell as Chinese, counterparts are made aware of this Senate resolution \nand accompanying statements, and that they will understand the \nimportance of these various trade matters to the Senate and the United \nStates.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to state that I am informed that \nthis \n[[Page S4046]] has been cleared by the Members on this side on the \nsubcommittee involved. So I am prepared to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 339) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, on March 16, 1903, Teddy Roosevelt was \nPresident. Civil War veterans still held annual reunions. The Wright \nbrothers were testing their first aircraft, and baseball was preparing \nfor the very first World Series that fall. And Mike Mansfield was born \nin Brooklyn, NY.\n  Today Mike turns 92. And I ask the Senate's indulgence while I pay \ntribute to this extraordinary man.\n  Mike's family moved to Great Falls, MT, when he was just 3 years old. \nWhen America joined the First World War in 1917, Mike--at the ripe old \nage of 14--fibbed about his age and enlisted in the Navy.\n  He is one of the very few Americans to serve in the Army, the Navy, \nand the Marines. My guess is that if America had had an Air Force back \nthen, he would have made all four. And at the age of 92, he is still \nthe youngest World War I veteran in America.\n  After leaving the military, Mike returned to his home in Montana--to \nButte and then to Missoula. While working as a miner in Butte, he met \nand married Maureen Hayes.\n  Maureen, then a Butte schoolteacher, persuaded Mike to leave the \nmines and get on with his education. And not only Montana, but our \nwhole country should be grateful to her for that.\n  Although Mike did not have a high school degree, he passed an \nentrance exam and was admitted to the University of Montana. And he \nnever looked back. He obtained a bachelors and masters degree in \ninternational affairs and then became a professor of East Asian and \nLatin American history at the university.\n  Then, in 1942, Mike Mansfield was elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. In his very first term, he was recognized as one of \nAmerica's leading experts on East Asia.\n  President Roosevelt personally selected him as a special envoy to \nChina in 1944, and the report Mike filed on his return is still a model \nof depth, clarity, foresight, and sound advice on foreign policy.\n  After a decade in the House Mike was elected U.S. Senator. He served \nin the Senate for 24 years. For 17 of those years, longer than anyone \nin history, he served as the Senate majority leader. And while most \npeople now think first of his national and international leadership, he \nwas always a great Montana Senator.\n  As Mike Malone, the dean of Montana historians, puts it:\n\n       Mansfield's protection of the state's interests in \n     Washington was legendary. He became so much a part of the \n     state's political landscape that the names Montana and \n     Mansfield seemed nearly inseparable.\n\n  Norman Maclean recounts an example of this in his last book, ``Young \nMan and Fire'', when he talks about Congressman Mansfield in action \nafter the Mann Gulch fire of August 1949:\n\n       The act had been almost as swift as the thought. . . . By \n     October 14, little more than two months later, Mike Mansfield \n     had rushed through Congress his amendment to the Federal \n     Employees' Compensation Act doubling the amount allowed to \n     nondependent parents of children injured or killed while \n     working for the Federal Government--from a pitiful two \n     hundred to four hundred dollars. A rider attached to this \n     amendment made it retroactive to include the Mann Gulch dead.\n       In our State of Montana, we would vote for him for anything \n     (in ascending order) from dogcatcher to President of the \n     United States to queen of the Helena Rodeo.\n\n  What was true for 14 Mann Gulch families was true for the whole \ncountry. Mike Mansfield knew what was right and he knew how to get it \ndone. Whether it was labor relations, the Vietnam war, environmental \nprotection, extending the right to vote to young people, or any of the \nother great issues of the 1950's, 1960's, and 1970's, Mike Mansfield \nwas there and he was right.\n  When Mike retired from the Senate--having served longer than anyone \nin history as majority leader--it was only to begin a new career. \nPresident Carter appointed Mike as Ambassador to Japan. And his \nperformance was so exceptional that although Mike always has been and \nalways will be a Montana Democrat, President Reagan asked him to stay \non in Tokyo for another 8 years.\n  Today, at age 92, Mike is on his third career as an East Asian \nadviser for Goldman Sachs. Although admittedly, he is taking it easy. \nHe has slowed down to a mere 5 days of work a week.\n  And of course, he is still the smartest, best-informed, wisest \nstatesman Montana and America have. Like I told the people at the \nGovernor's Conference on Aging at the Copper King in Butte last summer, \nwhen I really get stumped and I need the best advice there is, I go to \nMike Mansfield.\n  Mr. President, Mike Mansfield has lived the American Dream.\n  From Teddy Roosevelt to Bill Clinton.\n  From the copper mines of Butte to private meetings with Presidents \nand kings.\n  Sailor, veteran, miner, professor, Congressman, Presidential envoy, \nSenator, majority leader, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, \nbanker, wise man.\n  But to Montanans, always just plain ``Mike.''\n  I hope you and all of our colleagues will join me in saying ``thank \nyou,'' to Mike, and wishing this great and good man a happy birthday \nand many more to come.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/16/senate-section/article/S4046-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4046-S4049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 340\n\n   (Purpose: To require monthly reports on United States support for \n         Mexico during its debt crisis, and for other purposes)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Mexico is an important neighbor and trading partner of \n     the United States;\n       (2) on January 31, 1995, the President approved a program \n     of assistance to Mexico, in the form of swap facilities and \n     securities guarantees in the amount of $20,000,000,000, using \n     the Exchange Stabilization Fund;\n       (3) the program of assistance involves the participation of \n     the Federal Reserve System, the International Monetary Fund, \n     the Bank of International Settlements, the World Bank, the \n     Inter-American Development Bank, the Bank of Canada, and \n     several Latin American countries;\n       (4) the involvement of the Exchange Stabilization Fund and \n     the Federal Reserve System means that United States taxpayer \n     funds will be used in the assistance effort to Mexico;\n       (5) assistance provided by the International Monetary Fund, \n     the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank may \n     require additional United States contributions of taxpayer \n     funds to those entities;\n       (6) the immediate use of taxpayer funds and the potential \n     requirement for additional \n     [[Page S4047]] future United States contributions of taxpayer \n     funds necessitates Congressional oversight of the \n     disbursement of funds; and\n       (7) the efficacy of the assistance to Mexico is contingent \n     on the pursuit of sound economic policy by the Government of \n     Mexico.\n\n     SEC. ____03.

DEFINITION.\n\n       As used in this title, the term ``appropriate congressional \n     committees'' means the Committees on Banking and Financial \n     Services and International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committees on Foreign Relations, and \n     Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment because of \nthe urgency of time and the need to ensure that a full report of the \nactivity of the Mexican bailout be available to the Congress.\n  The facts are these. The first article of our Constitution deals with \nCongress and the preeminent power it conveys on Congress, and I might \nsay responsibility, of appropriating money.\n  It was the abiding belief of the Founding Fathers, and I believe the \nabiding belief of this country's citizens, that expenditures of money \nbe made by elected officials. Taxation without representation is \ntyranny. The reality is this country and our Constitution and our \nsystem demand that someone be accountable for funds that are expended \nand that those people be elected by the voters of this country. The \nConstitution could not be clearer on the subject.\n  Years ago, in the 1930's, a small Exchange Stabilization Fund was \nstarted with a modest amount of money at the time. I think it is fair \nto say, and most Members would agree, that has grown to a horrendous \namount. The reports are that the amount in that fund is somewhere \nbetween $25 and $30 billion, probably a little closer to the higher \nnumber.\n  Most Americans were astounded earlier this year when on January 31 \nthe President of the United States announced that he would take $20 \nbillion of that money without the benefit of appropriation, without \ndeliberation of Congress--as a matter of fact, bypassing Congress--and \nuse that in a program of assistance to Mexico, and specifically the $20 \nbillion would be put at risk through swaps and security guarantees \ninvolving $20 billion from the Exchange Stabilization Fund.\n  Mr. President, it is very clear the kind of impact that has on this \nNation. One need only look at what has happened to the value of the \ndollar versus the yen and the mark since that announcement was made.\n  Now, Mr. President, the Exchange Stabilization Fund is American \ntaxpayers' money that is meant to stabilize the currency of the United \nStates. When our currency falls out of bed and our money has been \ndiverted to bailing out the Mexican currency, who is it that is going \nto defend the United States dollar? Where will the money come from to \nstabilize the United States dollar?\n  If there is a purpose for the Exchange Stabilization Fund, it surely \nmust be to defend the United States dollar.\n  Now, what this amendment calls for is a simple, straightforward \nreport to Congress on a monthly basis. It involves things like changes \nin policy of Mexico, disbursements from the Exchange Stabilization \nFund, accounting for United States credits, guarantees and loans to \nMexico.\n  What it asks for, Mr. President, are the simple facts. There is some \nindication that the administration may be reluctant to disclose these \nfacts to the Congress, but I believe this is the minimum that we ought \nto do. If we are going to take our responsibilities as appropriators \nseriously, we ought to at least demand the information on how the \nmoney, this huge amount of money, is being used. That is what this \namendment does.\n  Mr. President, there are two other aspects of this measure that I \nwould like to call to the Members' attention. One is the very sincere \ninterest Americans had in helping the Mexicans and the Mexican economy. \nI sincerely believe the President wanted to help the Mexicans when he \ndiverted this huge amount of money to the support of the peso. But it \nis also my belief that far from building stronger, better, closer \nrelationships with Mexicans, this has done the opposite. I wish to draw \nthe Members' attention to an article that appeared in the El Norte \nnewspaper on January 30 of this year.\n\n       Seventy-four percent of the population of Mexico City wants \n     the Mexican Government to turn down the $40 billion worth of \n     guarantees the United States is offering.\n\n  Obviously, the reference is there not only to the Exchange \nStabilization Fund money but the other funds that have been involved.\n\n       In Mexico City, 78 percent of the respondents and in \n     Monterrey 64 percent distrust President Zedillo's pledge not \n     to accept any conditions that would undermine national \n     sovereignty.\n\n  Mr. President, the reality is this. While the Mexican President had \ntaken a strong oath not to accept any conditions that jeopardize their \nsovereignty--and it implied that much of the money could come condition \nfree--the administration in the United States was saying none of this \nmoney would go to Mexico unless there were strong changes in policy, \nand they did accede to that.\n  Now, that is part of why this report is so important. What we have is \none \n[[Page S4048]] side saying there is going to be real guarantees and \nreal changes in policy so the guarantee would get repaid, and the \npeople who are getting the money are saying loudly and clearly, no, we \nhave not accepted conditions; we are not going to accept conditions.\n  Now, the reality is there apparently have been some conditions set \nand some conditions accepted on the part of the Mexicans.\n  The question for this body is do we insist on knowing what they are. \nI believe we should. That is what this amendment is all about. It is a \nsimple, straightforward request for a monthly report on exactly what is \nhappening, on exactly what U.S. taxpayers' money is being used and how \nit is being used, and what changes of policy are.\n  We have been in touch with the Treasury Department over this \namendment for more than a week, almost a week and a half. In that time, \nthey have expressed concerns about having to detail this information. \nOne of the concerns they have mentioned that I think is a legitimate \nconcern is a concern that any sensitive information they would convey \nto Congress would be kept confidential.\n  Mr. President, they have not sent me language on that, but I wish to \nassure the body that I am sensitive to that, that if, indeed, there is \ninformation that should be kept confidential, I believe strongly that \nthat request by the administration ought to be honored. And I wish to \ncommit publicly in the Chamber that we will work with them to urge the \nconferees to include in the measure that may come back from conference \nsuch information as appropriate to ensure confidentiality.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado for \noffering this amendment, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor.\n  This amendment is essentially the same as legislation I introduced \nearlier this year to require monthly reports by the United States \nTreasury on the Mexican economy. It is critical that this information \nbe conveyed to Congress on a timely basis so that we, who are \nresponsible for the protection of United States tax dollars, are fully \ninformed as to the risk of Mexico's failure to repay those dollars.\n  The reason for this risk is that while we stand here, the Mexican \neconomy is deteriorating. Inflation has reached 40 or 50 percent, \nproduction is falling rapidly and the Mexican peso continues to drop \nlike a rock. Mexican citizens are suffering from the massive reduction \nin the purchasing power of their pesos.\n  Many economists suggest that Mexico's economic problems could have \nbeen avoided if the right economic policies were followed. However, \nthey were not. Now that United States taxpayer money is at risk, it is \nmore important than ever that the Congress be informed about economic \ndevelopments in Mexico.\n  In order for Congress to gauge this risk, information is key. This \namendment will guarantee that the Congress is kept fully informed about \ndevelopments in Mexico so that taxpayer dollars can be protected.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, at this point I ask unanimous consent to \nadd the names of Senators D'Amato, Mack, and Nickles as cosponsors of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, Senator Brown, \nfor his legislation. Indeed, he has warned the Congress, the American \npeople, and the administration the danger of having a situation whereby \nwe become the banker and where the people of Mexico as a result of the \nharsh conditions imposed look to the United States as the culprits as \nopposed to being the saviors, as opposed to being the helpers.\n  Here we are, extending we do not know how much. That gets to the \nheart of the amendment of the Senator. I have had legislation in \nhearings in the Banking Committee where we considered whether we should \nput a cessation of dollars after a certain amount is expended in 1 \nyear. We were thinking that after $5 billion was expended to any one \ncountry, that there should be a requirement to come to Congress to get \nthe appropriate authority, authorization, and appropriations. After \nall, that is what the Constitution says. We are the body charged with \nthe responsibility of appropriating these funds.\n  Whether or not legally the administration could maintain the position \nthat by use of the stabilization funds this is not an appropriation or \nwould not require an appropriation of this Congress is something that \nreasonable people might debate. Indeed, in the Treasury report by the \ngeneral counsel of the Treasury to the Secretary of the Treasury on \npage 6, that report indicates that the use of the stabilization funds \nis appropriate provided that--and I am paraphrasing--it does not become \na loan.\n  I suggest if this is not a loan, we are stretching the legal language \nto the point that it becomes pretty difficult to differentiate. It \nreally did not say loan, it said ``foreign aid.'' If this $20-billion-\nplus package is not foreign aid, I do not know what we would call it. \nSome of these dollars, it has been testified before the Banking \nCommittee, will be used by the Mexican Government to repurchase or to \nmeet its, the Government's, obligations; not as it relates to currency, \nthe Government's obligations, Government debt.\n  I suggest that crosses the line, notwithstanding what the legislation \nof the Senator does, and I am proud to support it and cosponsor it. It \nsays: Tell us what you are doing with the money. Tell us what you are \ndoing. We have a right to know. The American people have a right to \nknow and Congress should not abdicate this most basic responsibility.\n  Let me tell you how shrouded this whole situation becomes. We do not \nknow whether or not we have committed--the administration has committed \nus--to loaning $20, $30, $40 billion, and some people have suggested it \nmay be, indeed, even closer to $50 billion that the United States of \nAmerica, the people, the taxpayers of this country will be responsible \nfor.\n  We know we have heard $20 billion from the exchange fund. Is it true? \nDo we not have a right to know whether or not the United States has \npledged $10 billion through IMF funds, which we know our allies were \nnot happy with, some of our European allies? But on a promise, a \nsupposed promise that we, the United States of America, would make \navailable $10 billion to this fund? That is $20 billion plus $10 \nbillion over and above. That puts us in for $30 billion.\n  Question: World Bank? How much money is going to come from the World \nBank and how much money have we put into the World Bank? So now we are \nover $30 billion and growing, as it relates to our commitments. \nCertainly, we have a right to know. That is what this legislation does.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 341 to Amendment No. 340\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the pending \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 341 to amendment No. 340.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add at the end of the proposed amendment the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC.   . REPORT ON ILLEGAL DRUG TRAFFICKING IN MEXICO.\n\n       The President shall transmit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees no later than June 1, 1995 detailing \n     the illegal drug trafficking to the United States from \n     Mexico:\n       (1) A description of drug trafficking activities directed \n     toward the United States;\n       (2) A description of allegations of corruption involving \n     current or former officials of the Mexican government or \n     ruling party, including the relatives and close associates of \n     such officials; and\n       (3) The participation of United States financial \n     institutions on foreign financial institutions operating in \n     the United States in the movement of narcotics-related funds \n     from Mexico.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I understand my amendment may not be in \norder. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to \nwithdraw the amendment, because I understand there was an agreement I \nwas not aware of. I certainly would not look to violate that agreement.\n   [[Page S4049]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 341) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I do not believe I have yielded the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, it is my intent, if not on this \namendment--and I thought it would be appropriate to attempt to further \nenhance the amendment, let me tell you, by way of a reporting \nrequirement. I have become aware--it has become painfully obvious to \nthis Senator, and during the hearings we had a number of witnesses who \ntestified to the absolute corruption of many of the officials in the \nMexican Government at many levels--Governors, military police, whole \nsections of the Government that are dedicated to one thing--their own \nenrichment. It should become painfully obvious to the administration, \nand they know--they know, proof positive--that Mexico has become the \nleading transshipment country as it relates to illegal drugs and \nnarcotics, particularly cocaine, into the United States of America.\n  It has become so widespread, it has become so commonplace, that we \ncan, indeed, even identify the planes that come in regularly from \nColombia to the United States, carrying drugs and bringing back money. \nIf you have a drug cartel operating from Colombia into Mexico with \nregular transshipment of drugs for money and then the drugs coming into \nthe United States, it is rather obvious that we are choosing to look \nthe other way. It is obvious the Mexican Government at most levels is \nlooking the other way. If we are serious in terms of our fight against \ncrime, let me suggest that close to 60 percent of violent crime comes \ndirectly as a result of drugs--60 percent.\n  Take a look at your inner core cities. You see the problem there. You \ntalk about all the social problems, but just keep pouring the drugs in \nand look the other way as our neighbors to the south, to whom we are \nmaking available up to $40 billion, do little, if anything. Indeed, \nmany of their highest officials and people at various important levels \nin Government are involved in drug trafficking.\n  This Senator will be seeking a report by June 1, 1995, by this \nadministration, by the President, detailing and calling for him to make \navailable to the people of the United States that information which our \nGovernment has as it relates to that drug dealing. Here we are sending \n$40-plus billion to Mexico. I think it is about time that we said, ``If \nwe are going to help you with your currency, we want to know exactly \nwhat is taking place.'' And this administration and every \nadministration has an obligation to do something about it.\n  Let me be very clear and precise. I do not think the previous \nadministration did much, if anything, except do everything they could \nto push through our agreements--such a wonderful thing, our trade, we \nhave Salinas, he is a wonderful guy, the people on top are wonderful, \ngreat business opportunity, et cetera. The corruption, the deprivation \nof human rights, the sham of the democracy, all of that put to the \nside. The fact is that people in high places and high officials in high \nplaces are making billions of dollars, dealing in billions of dollars \nin illegal narcotics. We look the other way. ``Don't rock the boat. \nThis is so important. They have made great strides. They have \nprivatized.'' Who has made the money? The oligarchy. A handful of \nbillionaires have become richer. When those dollars plunged, who do you \nthink sold out at the high and who got stuck at the low when the peso \nfell? Do you think the billionaires who controlled the profits in \nMexico were down here on this chart? I will tell you where they were. \nThey were up here, up here--billions.\n  We have American taxpayer dollars going down there. I have to tell \nyou that at the least we should know what is taking place with that \nmoney. At least we should have the reports on a monthly basis so that \nwe can report to the citizens so that they know how their tax dollars \nare being spent. I have never heard of a bailout program or a program \ndesigned to help one's country when the people do not have a right to \nknow. People have a right to know how we spend their money here. Why \nshould they not have the right to know how their money is being spent \nsouth of the border? I would like to know why they should not have a \nright to know. Do you mean to tell me that the Mexican track record in \ngovernment is one that is so magnificent that we would be insulting \nthem, we would be insulting their national sovereignty to ascertain \nexactly what this money is being used for? If that is the case, then we \nshould suspend sending money down. I am tired of hearing that they are \na sovereign nation.\n  By the way, I think we are going to be mighty shocked when we get \ninto just how we are backing up collateral for this loan. How much oil \ndoes the Mexican Government really have that they can make available to \nback up these loans? We have been told that the loan is going to be \nfully collateralized. On the other hand, I have gotten information that \nindicates to me that indeed there may be a significant shortfall \nbetween the amount of moneys the Mexican Government is drawing down and \nthe collateral value of the oil and the oil reserves that they have. \nThe two may not come close to matching.\n  So, Mr. President, for all of these reasons I want to commend the \nSenator from Colorado for proposing this amendment. At the appropriate \ntime I intend to ask that additional legislation be required or be \nconsidered which would require the reporting on the illegal drug \nactivities as it relates to Mexico and this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I know that in our course of discussion \nwe would go to the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island next. I do \nnot mean to delay that process. But I understand it has been cleared on \nboth sides.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/16/senate-section/article/S4046-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROVIDING FOR AN ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE FROM THURSDAY, MARCH 16, \n                    1995, TO TUESDAY, MARCH 21, 1995\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Madam President, I do not believe that this is the \nappropriate vehicle for offering this amendment today.\n  I am supportive, as I know we all are, of making sure that the Senate \nis kept appropriately informed on the administration's efforts to \nstabilize the Mexican peso. But I do not believe that the amendment as \ncurrently drafted properly balances the Senate's right to information \nwith the administration's requirements to carry out its \nresponsibilities to implement this program with another sovereign \ngovernment.\n  Madam President, I would also call to the attention of my colleagues \nthat this amendment in the form of a resolution is to be the subject of \na Foreign Relations Committee business meeting next week. I believe \nthat the committee markup is the more appropriate forum to work on some \nof the difficulties posed by this amendment.\n  I know that the Department of Treasury has some difficulties with the \namendment as it is currently drafted and has requested to meet with \nSenator Brown's staff and other interested staff to discuss changes in \nthe amendment. In fact, both sides have already agreed to meet tomorrow \nto try to work some of this out.\n  [[Page S4050]] I would urge the Senator to consider withdrawing this \namendment and sitting down with Treasury representatives to work out \nlanguage that meets the Senator's needs but also addresses some very \nlegitimate concerns of the Department.\n  Let me repeat, this is identical to legislation that has been \nscheduled for markup this coming Monday in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, on which the Senator from Colorado sits, and contributes a \ngreat deal.\n  While I understand the Senator's desire to have this legislation \nacted on quickly, I think it would be a very unfortunate precedent to \npreempt the Committee markup in this way.\n  We also have the point that this is, after all, authorizing \nlegislation being attached to an appropriations bill. So I hope that \nthis could be withdrawn with the understanding that it would be taken \nup again next week or the week after.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I appreciate the very thoughtful comments \nof the Senator from Rhode Island. He, as always, makes such a valuable \ncontribution in the Senate's deliberations. I think he makes a very \nvalid point with regard to the deliberations of the committee and \ncertainly that would be the normal process that I would want to follow. \nIndeed, my observation is correct that it is scheduled for markup in \ncommittee.\n  There are several factors that make me want to move ahead with the \nprocess right now. That is, first of all, the urgency of getting this \ninformation while billions of dollars of American taxpayers' money is \nbeing committed. My sense is it is very important in terms of timing to \nget this enacted as quickly as possible. But I want to pledge to the \nSenator that any adjustments that are made in markup, I will--along \nwith, I know, others and I hope many will be active in--be urging the \nconferees to adopt so that, first, the deliberations of the committee \nare not overlooked but are incorporated in this by the conferees; and \nsecond, that we move along quickly.\n  The second aspect I might note here is that we have been working with \nthe Treasury people. I want to pledge myself to work with them in terms \nof fine-tuning reporting requirements.\n  But most of all, I want to know also another factor. This obviously \ninvolves more than simply the Foreign Relations Committee. The bulk of \nthe bill is really the work of Senator D'Amato and his Banking \nCommittee. He has been a guiding light in the effort to get the facts \nout in this area.\n  So it is my sense that it is appropriate to move ahead with the \nlegislation at this time simply because it is so urgent to be getting \naccurate answers and accounting while literally billions of dollars are \nflowing out of U.S. coffers.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Gregg be added \nas a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                   Agreed Framework with North Korea\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, during the first hearing of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, which I chair, back on January 10 of this year, \nI expressed a concern about what was happening with the arrangements \nbetween the United States and North Korea on the deal where North Korea \nwould have a 5-year window without inspection of used fuel rods, which \nis the best way on an inspection line of determining what is happening \nwith respect to the potential for North Korea to build a nuclear \nweapon.\n  During the course of the next several weeks, and in discussions with \na number of my colleagues, it seemed to me preferable to have that so-\ncalled agreement, the United States-North Korea agreed framework for \nresolving the nuclear issue, submitted to the United States Senate for \nratification, because it really was, in effect, a treaty even though \nthe administration had denominated it as an agreed framework, not even, \naccording to the administration, rising to the level of an executive \nagreement which would activate certain congressional review.\n  On February 24, I prepared a letter, which was submitted under the \nsignatures of Senator Helms, in his capacity as chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee; Senator Murkowski, in his capacity as the chairman \nof the Energy and Natural Resources Committee; and myself, as chairman \nof the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, to Senator Dole setting \nforth our request that the Senate handle as a treaty under the \nconstitutional ratification process the United States-Democratic \nPeoples Republic of Korea Agreed Framework for Resolving the Nuclear \nIssue.\n  The letter set forth that the Clinton administration was seeking to \nproceed under this so-called agreed framework without submitting it as \na treaty, which it really was, for Senate ratification.\n  We submitted at that time to Senator Dole a legal memorandum prepared \nby the Congressional Research Service, the Library of Congress, dated \nFebruary 8, 1995, which set forth the criteria for considering whether \nan arrangement was a treaty.\n  In our letter, we noted that, while the memorandum specifies that \n``there are no `hard and fast rules,' we believe the underlying \nrationale suggests that the agreement should be handled as a treaty \nbecause it is a matter of great importance (involving North Korea's \npotential for developing nuclear weapons),'' that the document \n``constitutes a substantial commitment of funds extending beyond a \nfiscal year and is of substantial political significance,'' all of \nwhich were criteria for an evaluation as to whether the arrangement was \nin fact a treaty.\n  We concluded our letter to Senator Dole noting that ``The formal \ntreaty ratification process will enable us''--that is, the Senate--``to \nundertake a detailed factual analysis to determine whether this \nagreement is in the national interest.''\n   [[Page S4051]] Madam President, it is my view that, on both \nsubstantive grounds and constitutional grounds, this matter ought to be \nhandled as a treaty.\n  The Constitution of the United States provides for ratification by \nthe Senate on treaties. There are a whole series of criteria, some of \nwhich I have just referred to, which indicate, suggest, provide \nevidence for the conclusion that this agreed framework is in fact a \ntreaty.\n  If you take a look at some of the items which we have handled as \ntreaties in the Senate through the treaty ratification process, you \nwill note the great difference between the importance of this United \nStates-North Korean arrangement, contrasted with other matters which \nhave been submitted to the full Senate ratification process. For \nexample, Treaty 102-7, which is a Convention for the Prohibition of \nFishing with Long Drift Nets in the South Pacific; or Treaty Document \nExhibit EE 96-1, an International Convention on Standards of Training \nCertification and Watch Keeping for Seafarers; or Treaty Document 100-\n7, Agreement for Medium Frequency Broadcasting Service in Region Number \nII; or Treaty Document No. 101-15, Amendments to the 1928 Convention \nConcerning International Expositions, as Amended.\n  On some occasions, as is well known, in the Senate, we handle as many \nas six treaties at one time in a single vote, with notification being \ngiven to Senators that if they miss that one vote, it will be counted \nas a half dozen absences, because the treaties do not rise to the level \nof any individual identification or individual voting, but are very, \nvery much pro forma.\n  So that it is indeed surprising, when a matter comes before the \ninternational forum and is the subject of a document between North \nKorea and the United States, that it is denominated only as an agreed \nframework for resolving the nuclear issues.\n  Following receipt of our letter, Senator Dole, by letter dated March \n10, wrote to Secretary of State Christopher asking a series of specific \nquestions which set out the criteria for determining whether or not \nsuch a matter is or is not a treaty.\n  It had been my intention to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nearly on as soon as a legislative vehicle arose. I had notified the \nmanagers of this legislation that I would be offering that sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution at this time. But I have decided to defer doing \nthat because Senator Dole's letter, dated March 10, 1995, is now \noutstanding and, as of this date, March 16, there has not been an \nadequate opportunity for the Secretary of State to respond to the \nmajority leader's letter.\n  I make the statement at this time to put the administration on notice \nthat it is my intention--and there are a number of cosponsors who are \nprepared to join with me on this important matter, including the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas who is the Presiding Officer, was \nasked a series of questions in closed session before the Intelligence \nCommittee on this matter. I state for the Record because the camera may \nhave been on me rather than her, and might have missed her acquiescing \nnods.\n  There are a number of colleagues who agree with the seriousness of \nthis matter. In dealing with North Korea, while it is my hope that they \nwill abide by the international commitments, there is good reason for \nconcern as to whether they will abide by their commitments.\n  Nobody said it better than President Reagan when he made the comment \nabout trust but verify. There is a chronology on North Korea's \nactivities which raises very, very, considerable grounds for concern as \nto whether North Korea will, in fact, comply with their commitments \nunder this statement of agreed principles.\n  Madam President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the United States-North Korea Agreed Framework for Resolving the \nNuclear Issue be printed in the Record except as to a confidential part \nwhich cannot be disclosed publicly at this time; that a copy of the \nlegal memorandum from the Congressional Research Service, dated \nFebruary 8, 1995, be printed in the Record; that a copy of the joint \nletter submitted by Senators Helms, Murkowski, and myself, be printed \nin the Record; as well as an unclassified document prepared by the \nState Department on the North Korea nuclear timeline, showing many \nactions by the North Koreans which raise real issue as to whether there \nhas been compliance by North Korea, and raising real issues as to what \nmight be expected in the future.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       U.S.-DPRK Agreed Framework for Resolving the Nuclear Issue\n\n       The attached package includes: (1) the Agreed Framework \n     between the U.S. and the DPRK, signed October 21, 1994, in \n     Geneva; (2) a Confidential Minute, signed the same day, which \n     should be treated as confidential for classification \n     purposes; and (3) a letter of assurance from President \n     Clinton to the DPRK's Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-II, which was \n     delivered in Geneva in connection with the signing. These \n     documents create a framework of political decisions and \n     practical actions to be taken by each side in order to \n     resolve the nuclear issue in North Korea.\n                                                                    ____\n\n     Agreed Framework Between the United States of America and the \n    Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Geneva, October 21, 1995\n\n       Delegations of the Governments of the United States of \n     America (U.S.) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea \n     (DPRK) held talks in Geneva from September 23 to October 21, \n     1994, to negotiate an overall resolution of the nuclear issue \n     on the Korean Peninsula.\n       Both sides reaffirmed the importance of attaining the \n     objectives contained in the August 12, 1994 Agreed Statement \n     between the U.S. and the DPRK and upholding the principles of \n     the June 11, 1993 Joint Statement of the U.S. and the DPRK to \n     achieve peace and security on a nuclear-free Korean \n     peninsula. The U.S. and the DPRK decided to take the \n     following actions for the resolution of the nuclear issue:\n       I. Both sides will cooperate to replace the DPRK's \n     graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities with \n     light-water reactor (LWR) power plants.\n       (1) In accordance with the October 20, 1994 letter of \n     assurance from the U.S. President, the U.S. will undertake to \n     make arrangements for the provision to the DPRK of a LWR \n     project with a total generating capacity of approximately \n     2,000 MW(e) by a target date of 2003.\n       The U.S. will organize under its leadership an \n     international consortium to finance and supply the LWR \n     project to be provided to the DPRK. The U.S., representing \n     the international consortium, will serve as the principal \n     point of contact with the DPRK for the LWR project.\n       The U.S., representing the consortium, will make best \n     efforts to secure the conclusion of a supply contract with \n     the DPRK within six months of the date of this Document for \n     the provision of the LWR project. Contract talks will begin \n     as soon as possible after the date of this Document.\n       As necessary, the U.S. and the DPRK will conclude a \n     bilateral agreement for cooperation in the field of peaceful \n     uses of nuclear energy.\n       (2) In accordance with the October 20, 1994 letter of \n     assurance from the U.S. President, the U.S., representing the \n     consortium, will make arrangements to offset the energy \n     foregone due to the freeze of the DPRK's graphite-moderated \n     reactors and related facilities, pending completion of the \n     first LWR unit.\n       Alternative energy will be provided in the form of heavy \n     oil for heating and electricity production.\n       Deliveries of heavy oil will begin within three months of \n     the date of this Document and will reach a rate of 500,000 \n     tons annually, in accordance with an agreed schedule of \n     deliveries.\n       (3) Upon receipt of U.S. assurances for the provision of \n     LWR's and for arrangements for interim energy alternatives, \n     the DPRK will freeze its graphite-moderated reactors and \n     related facilities and will eventually dismantle these \n     reactors and related facilities.\n       The freeze on the DPRK's graphite-moderated reactors and \n     related facilities will be fully implemented within one month \n     of the date of this Document. During this one-month period, \n     and throughout the freeze, the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency (IAEA) will be allowed to monitor this freeze, and the \n     DPRK will provide full cooperation to the IAEA for this \n     purpose.\n       Dismantlement of the DPRK's graphite-moderated reactors and \n     related facilities will be completed when the LWR project is \n     completed.\n       The U.S. and the DPRK will cooperate in finding a method to \n     store safely the spend fuel from the 5 MW(e) experimental \n     reactor during the construction of the LWR project, and to \n     dispose of the fuel in a safe manner that does not involve \n     reprocessing in the DPRK.\n       (4) As soon as possible after the date of this document \n     U.S. and DPRK experts will hold two sets of experts talks.\n       At one set of talks, experts will discuss issues related to \n     alternative energy and the replacement of the graphite-\n     moderated reactor program with the LWR project.\n       At the other set of talks, experts will discuss specific \n     arrangements for spent fuel storage and ultimate disposition.\n       [[Page S4052]] II. The two sides will move toward full \n     normalization of political and economic relations.\n       (1) Within three months of the date of this Document, both \n     sides will reduce barriers to trade and investment, including \n     restrictions on telecommunications services and financial \n     transactions.\n       (2) Each side will open a liaison office in the other's \n     capital following resolution of consular and other technical \n     issues through expert level discussions.\n       (3) As progress is made on issues of concern to each side, \n     the U.S. and the DPRK will upgrade bilateral relations to the \n     Ambassadorial level.\n       III. Both sides will work together for peace and security \n     on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.\n       (1) The U.S. will provide formal assurances to the DPRK, \n     against the threat or use of nuclear weapons by the U.S.\n       (2) The DPRK will consistently take steps to implement the \n     North-South Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the \n     Korean Peninsula.\n       (3) The DPRK will engage in North-South dialogue, as this \n     Agreed Framework will help create an atmosphere that promotes \n     such dialogue.\n       IV. Both sides will work together to strengthen the \n     international nuclear non-proliferation regime.\n       (1) The DPRK will remain a party to the Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and will allow \n     implementation of its safeguards agreement under the Treaty.\n       (2) Upon conclusion of the supply contract for the \n     provision of the LWR project, ad hoc and routine inspections \n     will resume under the DPRK's safeguards agreement with the \n     IAEA with respect to the facilities not subject to the \n     freeze. Pending conclusion of the supply contract, \n     inspections required by the IAEA for the continuity of \n     safeguards will continue at the facilities not subject to the \n     freeze.\n       (3) When a significant portion of the LWR project is \n     completed, but before delivery of key nuclear components, the \n     DPRK will come into full compliance with its safeguards \n     agreement with the IAEA (INFCIRC/403), including taking all \n     steps that may be deemed necessary by the IAEA, following \n     consultations with the Agency with regard to verifying the \n     accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's initial report on all \n     nuclear material in the DPRK.\n     Robert L.

Among the issues: \n     (1) this agreement was entered into as a ``political \n     agreement'' rather than an ``executive agreement,'' which \n     would have to be reported to Congress under the Case Act; \n     what are the precedents for this type of political \n     agreement?; (2) should this agreement have been entered into \n     as a treaty rather than as a political agreement?; (3) what \n     is the legally binding effect of the economic commitments in \n     this agreement?; (4) does the current funding of this \n     commitment, especially through the reprogramming process, \n     encroach upon congressional prerogatives over the purse?; (5) \n     what are possible legislative responses by Congress to this \n     agreement?\n\n\n            executive reports to congress under the case act\n\n       Hearings by the Symington Subcommittee (of the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee) in 1969 and 1970 uncovered a \n     number of secret executive agreements that administrations \n     had made with South Korea, Thailand, Laos, Ethiopia, and \n     Spain, among others. In response, Congress passed legislation \n     in 1972 to keep itself informed about such agreements. The \n     statute, known as the Case Act, requires the Secretary of \n     State to transmit to Congress within sixty days the text of \n     ``any international agreement, other than a treaty,'' to \n     which the United States is a party. If the President decides \n     that publication of an agreement would be prejudicial to \n     national security, he may transmit it to the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee and the House International Relations \n     Committee under an injunction of secrecy removable only by \n     the President. 86 Stat. 619 (1972), 1 U.S.C. 112b (1988). \n     Although the Case Act was broadly written to capture all \n     international agreements, State Department regulations and \n     subsequent administration practices have created a number of \n     exceptions to the general requirement to report executive \n     agreements to Congress.\n                       exceptions to the case act\n\n       During consideration of the Case Act, executive officials \n     in the Nixon administration suggested that ``certain kinds of \n     agreements'' might not be transmitted under the Act. Senator \n     Clifford Case sought a written statement from the State \n     Department as to whether there were any categories of \n     agreements that might not be covered by the statute. The \n     State Department's Acting Legal Adviser, Charles N. Brower, \n     prepared a memo stating that the Case Act is intended to \n     include ``every international agreement, other than a treaty, \n     brought into force with respect to the United States after \n     August 22, 1972 [enactment date for Case Act], regardless of \n     its form, name or designation, or subject matter.''\\1\\\n       In subsequent years, however, certain types of \n     international agreements were not submitted to Congress under \n     the Case Act. In 1976, the Legal Adviser to the State \n     Department wrote to Senator John Sparkman, chairman of the \n     Foreign Relations Committee, recommending that only the \n     international agreements entered into by the Agency for \n     International Development at a level of at least $1 million \n     would be submitted under the Case Act. AID agreements less \n     than $1 million would be reported under the Case Act if they \n     were ``significant for reasons other than level of funding.'' \n     The dollar threshold was later raised to $25 million.\\2\\\n       Moreover, agreements concluded in a ``non-binding'' form \n     and determined by the executive branch to be legally non-\n     binding on the United States are not referred to Congress \n     under the Case Act, although the executive branch may \n     voluntarily provide information about them to Congress. Non-\n     binding international agreements are viewed as involving \n     political or moral obligations but not legal obligations. One \n     example is the 1975 Final Act of the Conference on Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), known as the Helsinki \n     Agreement.\\3\\\n       Regulations issued by the State Department to implement the \n     Case Act identify political agreements as outside the \n     reporting requirements of the statute. Parties to an \n     international agreement ``must intend their undertaking to be \n     legally binding, and not merely of political or personal \n     effect. Documents intended to have political or moral weight, \n     but not intended to be legally binding, are not international \n     agreements.'' 22 CFR Sec. 181.2 (1994). However,\n      these regulations also state that examples of arrangements \n     that ``may constitute international agreements'' are \n     agreements that:\n       (i) Are of political significance;\n       (ii) involve substantial grants of funds or loans by the \n     United States or credits payable to the United States;\n       (iii) constitute a substantial commitment of funds that \n     extends beyond a fiscal year or would be a basis for \n     requesting new appropriations;\n       (iv) involve continuing and/or substantial cooperation in \n     the conduct of a particular program or activity, such as \n     scientific, technical, or other cooperation, including the \n     exchange or receipt of information and its treatment, or the \n     pooling of data. 22 CFR Sec. 181.2(2).\n       Another group of international agreements not reported \n     under the Case Act are those that the State Department views \n     as contracts--usually commercial in nature and involving \n     sales or loans. As a result of the State Department's \n     interpretation of a provision in the Food, Agriculture, \n     Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, international agreements \n     entered into by the Secretary of Agriculture for financing \n     the sale and exportation of agricultural commodities are not \n     reported under the Case Act either.\\4\\\n\n\n          should this agreement have been submitted as treaty?\n\n       Although the State Department provides guidelines on what \n     should be transmitted to Congress as an executive agreement, \n     a bill, or a treaty, there are no hard and fast rules. This \n     issue arose last year with the GATT bill.\\5\\ Constitutional \n     scholars offered different views on whether that should have \n     been submitted as a bill or a treaty. On October 18, 1994, \n     hearings were held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and \n     [[Page S4053]] Transportation, with Professor Bruce Ackerman \n     testifying in favor of Congress acting on the bill through \n     the regular legislative process, and Professor Laurence Tribe \n     testifying in favor of the Senate acting through the treaty \n     process. Professor Tribe later wrote that he could not say \n     ``with certainty that my prior conclusions should necessarily \n     be adopted by others or are ones to which I will adhere in \n     the end after giving the matter the further thought that it \n     deserves.''\n       No clear guidelines are available from parliamentary \n     practice or federal court decisions on the issue of whether \n     to submit international matters in bill form or as a treaty. \n     The enclosed CRS report, ``GATT and Other Trade Agreements: \n     Congressional Action by Statute or by Treaty?, by Louis \n     Fisher, November 17, 1994, summarizes the basic issues. Also \n     included in this report are criteria offered by the State \n     Department to distinguish between what should be submitted as \n     a bill or as a treaty. The decision to submit a matter in \n     treaty form depends on the President's judgment. Congress can \n     apply political pressure and retaliate in other ways, but the \n     basic call remains presidential.\n       In his statement on December 1, 1994, to the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee, Ambassador Robert L. Gallucci said that \n     the administration did not submit the Agreed Framework as a \n     treaty because ``we would not have been able to bind \n     ourselves legally to the delivery of that $4 billion project \n     [for light water reactors].'' That is not a full answer. If \n     an administration decides that it cannot make a unilateral \n     commitment and must depend on Congress, there is no reason \n     why it cannot submit a treaty that makes clear that the \n     extent of the assistance promised depends on Congress through \n     its authorization and appropriation processes. That \n     understanding has been incorporated in previous treaties.\n\n\n              economic commitments in the agreed framework\n\n       The Agreed Framework, signed October 21, 1994, offers \n     assistance in replacing the DPRK's graphite-moderated \n     reactors and related facilities with light-water reactor \n     (LWR) power plants. The United States will organize an \n     international consortium to finance and supply the LWR \n     project and provide alternative energy in the form of heavy \n     oil for heating and electricity production. Delivery of heavy \n     oil is scheduled to begin within three months of the date of \n     the document and reach a rate of 500,000 tons annually. Upon \n     receipt of ``U.S. assurances'' (emphasis supplied) for the \n     provision of LWR's and for arrangement for interim energy \n     alternatives, the DPRK will freeze its graphite-moderated \n     reactors and related facilities and will eventually dismantle \n     these reactors and related facilities. The Framework also \n     provides that the United States and the DPRK will cooperate \n     in finding a method to store safely the spent fuel from the \n     graphite-moderated reactors. Although some of the financial \n     commitments depend on organizing an international consortium \n     and securing financial support from other governments, \n     several of the key commitments--including U.S. assurances to \n     provide for LWR's and for arranging interim energy \n     alternatives, as well as disposing of spent fuel--fall \n     exclusively on the United States. The United States expects \n     to fully bear the cost of storing and disposing of spent \n     fuel.\n       In his letter of October 20, 1994, to DPRK President Kim \n     Jong II, President Clinton confirmed that he would use ``the \n     full powers of my office'' to facilitate arrangements for the \n     financing and construction of a light-water nuclear power \n     reactor project within the DPRK and the funding and\n      implementation of interim energy alternatives pending \n     completion of the first reactor unit of the light-water \n     reactor project. In addition, if the reactor project was \n     not completed for reasons beyond the control of the DPRK, \n     President Clinton would use ``the full powers of my \n     office'' to provide, to the extent necessary, such a \n     project from the United States, ``subject to approval of \n     the U.S. Congress. Furthermore, in the event the interim \n     energy alternatives are not provided, for reasons beyond \n     the control of the DPRK, President Clinton promised to use \n     ``the full powers of my office'' to provide, to the extent \n     necessary, such interim energy alternatives from the \n     United States, ``subject to the approval of the U.S. \n     Congress.''\n       As explained in President Clinton's message, the effect of \n     the Agreed Framework is to make political and moral, not \n     legal, commitments. In his statement to the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee, Ambassador Gallucci explained that the \n     administration decided to call the agreement an ``Agreed \n     Framework'' because it ``did not want to take on the \n     obligation of providing a light water reactor or two light \n     water reactors, to be precise.'' To the extent that \n     completion of the light-water nuclear reactor project or \n     supplying interim energy alternatives depend on congressional \n     action, Congress must provide approval through its \n     authorization and appropriation processes. Absent statutory \n     authority, President Clinton has no independent \n     constitutional power to provide that assistance, although his \n     political and moral commitment puts pressure on Congress to \n     act in a supportive manner through the statutory process.\n\n\n      does the framework encroach upon congressional prerogatives?\n\n       According to the statement by Ambassador Gallucci to the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee, initial implementation of \n     the Agreed Framework resulted in the United States in the \n     first three months providing 50,000 tons of heavy oil at a \n     cost of between $5 million and $6 million, and there ``will \n     be heavy oil shipments, up to 100,000 tons, by the end of \n     October 21, 1995.'' Ambassador Gallucci testified that the \n     Defense Department can provide the initial assistance of $5 \n     million to $6 million ``under existing authorities.'' We do \n     not have the specific legal authorities referred to by \n     Ambassador Gallucci, but legislation governing DOD activities \n     and funding expenditures does not include restrictions \n     regarding North Korea. Section 127 of Title 10, however, \n     authorizes the Secretary of Defense, secretaries of a \n     military department, and the DOD Inspector General, to \n     ``provide for any emergency or extraordinary expense which \n     cannot be anticipated or classified.'' The amounts available \n     for expenditure are subject to limitations in appropriations \n     acts and must be reported to Congress quarterly. The Defense \n     Department Appropriation, 1995 (P.L. 103-335), includes the \n     following amounts out of operation and maintenance accounts \n     for such emergencies: Secretary of Defense, $23.768 million \n     Army, $14.437 million; Navy/Marines, $4.301 million; and Air \n     Force, $8.762 million.\n       With regard to the need to clarify the water in which spent \n     fuel is placed, Ambassador Gallucci testified that the \n     Department of Energy estimates the cost to be a ``couple of \n     hundred thousand dollars [and] is something they can do \n     before the end of this year and really ought to for safety \n     reasons.'' Again, we have no information regarding the legal \n     authorities available to the Energy Department to perform \n     this work. Ambassador Gallucci discussed other activities by \n     the Energy Department, including the recontainment or \n     recanning of the fuel, which ``could take some millions of \n     dollars, less than $10 million, maybe more than $5 million--\n     in that range. This would involve a reprogramming and they \n     would follow the normal practice of coming to the Congress \n     for confirmation of reprogramming authority. This would \n     happen after January 1.''\n       It is unclear from this statement whether the \n     administration would simply be notifying designated \n     committees about the reprogramming or seeking their prior \n     approval. Nor is it clear whether the administration's \n     initial funding commitments are authorized by law. At this \n     point we have no citations to examine that issue. There are \n     other questions about the statutory authorities that might be \n     invoked to fulfill the initial funding commitment. If the \n     administration tapped a general contingency fund to provide \n     this initial assistance to North Korea, there may be adequate \n     authority in allocating emergency funds to do so. But if it \n     is a case of Congress appropriating funds with the \n     expectation that they will be used for a specific purpose, as \n     justified in agency budget requests, there is a substantial \n     issue of the administration reallocating those funds to a \n     purpose never justified to Congress. Ambassador Gallucci \n     testified that the administration expects ``the $4 billion \n     burden [for light water reactors] to be borne centrally by \n     South Korea, and this we understand.''\n\n\n             Legislative responses to the agreed framework\n\n       The Senate could respond to the Agreed Framework by \n     insisting, either through political pressure or a Senate \n     resolution, that it be submitted as a treaty and made subject \n     to full legislative debate. Whether Senators want to be in a \n     position of having to approve, reject, or amend the \n     administration's agreement is a question they need to decide \n     individually. Some Senators may decide that it is better for \n     the President to make non-binding promises, with the \n     understanding by all nations that under our constitutional \n     system it is Congress, not the President, that has the power \n     of the purse. To the extent that the President has acted \n     unilaterally and finds himself politically isolated, that \n     presently is the administration's problem, not Congress's. In \n     any case, the decision to submit the matter by treaty is in \n     the hands of the President.\n       Because of the funding implications and the need to obtain \n     appropriations from both chambers, if legislative action is \n     required it may be more appropriate to act by bill or joint \n     resolution. If Congress decides that it does not want to act \n     at this time by treaty or by bill, it could adopt non-binding \n     simple or concurrent resolutions to enunciate the policy and \n     constitutional concerns at stake for Congress as an \n     institution, many of which have been identified above.\n       I trust that this memorandum is helpful to you.

Finally, Madam President, I would like to ask unanimous \nconsent to print in the Record the proposed amendment that I had \nintended to offer with a number of cosponsors, as I say, including the \ndistinguishing Senator from Texas who is presiding, so that all of that \nwill be part of the Record and available for review in anticipation of \nthe response by Secretary of State Christopher, to Senator Dole's \nleadership.\n  There being no objection, the amendment was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. --. TREATMENT OF AGREED FRAMEWORK WITH NORTH KOREA AS \n                   TREATY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Article II, Section 2, Clause 2, of the Constitution \n     requires that treaties may only be made by the President, by \n     and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n       (2) The Case Act (1 U.S.C. 112b) requires that the text of \n     international agreements other than treaties shall be \n     transmitted to Congress.\n       (3) The President does not consider the Agreed Framework \n     Between the United States of America and the Democratic \n     People's Republic of Korea to be a treaty, for purposes of \n     seeking the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, \n     or even to be any other type of international agreement, for \n     purposes of compliance with the Case Act (1 U.S.C. 112b).\n       (4) The Agreed Framework involves reciprocal binding \n     commitments by both the United States and North Korea on \n     resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and \n     is an international agreement.\n       (5) The commitments made by the United States under the \n     Agreed Framework, including undertakings that will involve \n     appropriations, are as substantial and ongoing as commitments \n     that customarily have been made by the United States through \n     treaties.\n       (6) Such commitments should be subject to Senate review and \n     approval.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the President should have submitted, and should now submit, \n     the Agreed Framework as a treaty to the Senate for its advice \n     and consent to ratification pursuant to Article II, Section \n     2, Clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States.\n       (c) Definition.--As used in this section, the term ``Agreed \n     Framework'' means the document entitled ``Agreed Framework \n     Between the United States of America and the Democratic \n     People's Republic of Korea'', signed October 21, 1994, at \n     Geneva, and the attached Confidential Minute.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, this is an issue of really enormous \nimportance, as we have reviewed the work of the Intelligence Committee.\n  It has been my conclusion that the problems of international \nterrorism and the problems of weapons of mass destruction are problems \nof overwhelming importance, posing a security threat to the United \nStates.\n  When we have a document which has as much practical importance as \nthis so-called agreed framework does, it is simply inappropriate to not \nhave it subjected to Senate scrutiny. It may well be that this Senate \nwill ratify this treaty, the document that I consider to be a treaty.\n  It is certainly necessary, in my judgment, that matters of this sort \nbe elevated to a level where there is very, very, considerable public \nscrutiny and scrutiny by the Senate under the constitutional doctrine \nof checks and balances.\n  So awaiting the reply by Secretary of State Christopher, it is my \nintention at the appropriate time to bring this matter to the Senate \nfor ratification because of its importance on the merits \n[[Page S4056]] and on the substance, and because of its importance in \ncompliance with the U.S. Constitution. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n                Amendments Nos. 342 through 346, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I am about to send to the desk several \namendments on behalf of several Senators on both sides of the aisle. I \nam pleased to advise you, Madam President, that these amendments have \nbeen reviewed and cleared by the managers of the measure before us and \nall of the appropriate Senators from committees of jurisdiction.\n  I send the amendments to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendments.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] proposes amendments \n     numbered 342 through 346.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 342\n\n  Mr. INOUYE offered amendment No. 342 for Mr. McConnell, for himself, \nMr. Leahy, Mr. Dole, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Specter, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, and \nMrs. Feinstein.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 16, between lines 18 and 19 insert the following:\n\n                               CHAPTER I\n\n       On page 25, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n                               CHAPTER II\n\n\n       foreign operations, export financing and related programs\n\n                     bilateral economic assistance\n\n                  funds appropriated to the president\n\n                           debt restructuring\n\n                         debt relief for jordan\n\n       For the cost, as defined in section 502 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974, of modifying direct loans \n     to Jordan issued by the Export-Import Bank or by the Agency \n     for International Development or by the Department of \n     Defense, or for the cost of modifying: (1) concessional loans \n     authorized under Title I of the Agricultural Trade \n     Development and Assistance Act of 1954, as amended, and (2) \n     credits owed by Jordan to the Commodity Credit Corporation, \n     as a result of the Corporation's status as a guarantor of \n     credits in connection with export sales to Jordan; as \n     authorized under subsection (a) under the heading, ``Debt \n     Relief for Jordan'', in Title VI of Public Law 103-306, \n     $275,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 1996: \n     Provided, That not more than $50,000,000 of the funds \n     appropriated by this paragraph may be obligated prior to \n     October 1, 1995.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, last July, Israel's Prime Minister \nRabin and Jordan's King Hussein appeared before a joint session of \nCongress to declare the end of a 46-year state of war.\n  Their remarks were inspiring, particularly Prime Minister Rabin's \nreminder that he served 27 years as a soldier, and in his words, ``sent \nregiments into fire and soldiers to their death * * * and today we are \nembarking on battle which has no dead and wounded, no blood no anguish. \nThis is the only battle which is a pleasure to wage, the battle for \npeace.''\n  In turn, King Hussein declared Jordan ``ready to open a new era in \nrelations with Israel'' calling upon each of us for help and \ncooperation in security a final peace settlement for the Middle East.\n  Later in the day at the White House the President affirmed the \nAmerican commitment to continue our role in securing a comprehensive \npeace. The next important step in that process followed in October with \na peace treaty between the two nations.\n  This agreement was not an easy decision for Jordan. Given the radical \nopponents to peace in the area, particularly terrorist groups \nthreatening retaliation against any country or leaders moving forward \nin normalizing relations with Israel, the King demonstrated remarkable \ncourage.\n  In direct response to this significant breakthrough, President \nClinton pledged our support in relieving Jordan of its crippling debt \nburden. In the foreign operations appropriations bill last year we \nprovided the first installment of that debt relief. Several weeks ago, \nthe President submitted a supplemental request and asked us to finish \nthe job.\n  That is the amendment before the Senate. At the President's request, \nwe are providing the balance of that debt relief. The funds will be \ndrawn from the foreign operations subcommittee allocation scheduled to \nbe released over fiscal year 1995 and fiscal year 1996 from existing \nforeign operations resources.\n  But not exceeding our subcommittee allocation, should not suggest \nthis bill is free of costs. There are very painful tradeoffs that we \nwill be forced to make in the upcoming foreign operations \nappropriations bill. By providing this relief for Jordan other programs \nwill have to be reduced. But, that is a choice that I am willing to \nmake and that is the clear choice of the Clinton administration.\n  Let me quote from the letter the President sent regarding this \nrequest. Dated March 8, he says failure to provide the debt relief \n``would threaten our ability to continue our leadership in the Middle \nEast Peace process. It undercuts those who are willing to take risks \nfor peace and it directly threatens the security of Israel and the \nIsrael-Jordan peace treaty.''\n  Those are the stakes. President Clinton's assessment is echoed by \nevery leader in the region committed to stability, security and peace. \nIn fact, the only critics of debt relief in the region seem to be those \nfew cynical opponents still consumed by the drive to destroy Israel.\n  Syria's President Assad already is challenging American credibility \nand our national commitment to our friends in the region. His purposes \nwould be served if he could point out that the Congress failed to live \nup to an American commitment to Jordan and other prospective the risk \ntakers.\n  It will be nothing less than a victory for Saddam Hussein if we \nrenege on the President's promise, if we abandon an obligation assumed \nby Secretary Christopher and the administration.\n  Madam President, it has not been an easy process to bring this \nlegislation to the floor. Even with Secretary Christopher and his \nnegotiating team in the region attempting to inch the process forward, \nthere has been some reluctance by Members on both sides of the aisles \nto support this legislation. I know my colleague Senator Leahy has some \nreservations about the outlay consequences of providing this support, \nbut there have also been concerns raised about the administration's \nmanagement of this request.\n  Last year, during conference on the fiscal year 1995 Foreign \nOperations bill, we received a late night request to add the first \ntranche of aid to our conference report. We did so with the clear \nunderstanding that the balance would be requested and provided in two \nadditional installments over the next fiscal years. Instead, once \nagain, we were presented with an emergency, last minute request.\n  The fact that Jordan and Israel signed a peace treaty factored into \nthe decision to consolidate the second and third installments and I \nbelieve was the reason why most of my colleagues have been prepared to \nrespond to the President's request, but I should point out that the \nadministration has not made it easy to vote for this commitment. In \nfact, there have been several points when administration officials have \nactually jeopardized prospects for providing the assistance.\n  When the House Appropriations Committee decided to provide part of \nthe funding while making the commitment to appropriate the balance in \nthe next fiscal year, the White House spokesman accused members of \ncontributing to the renewal of war between Israel and Jordan. Insult \nwas added to injury when other administration officials suggested \nRepublican isolationism would compromise our national commitment.\n  I think these charges are irresponsible, inaccurate and introduced a \nmean spirited, unnecessary partisan \n[[Page S4057]] element to an otherwise serious, important deliberation. \nFrankly, the remarks were costly in building support for this \nundertaking.\n  Nonetheless, many of us believe this is a commitment worth making and \nkeeping. My colleagues who joined in introducing this amendment share \nthe view that the cause of peace is at a critical point. Our partners \nin this process must know we will not retreat.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter I referenced from President \nClinton be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, March 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: A comprehensive and lasting peace \n     in the Middle East that ensures the security of Israel has \n     been a bipartisan goal which every administration and \n     Congress has endorsed and pursued for nearly fifty years. \n     This goal was significantly advanced through the bold \n     leadership and courage displayed by King Hussein of Jordan \n     and Israeli Prime Minister Rabin, which made possible the \n     signing last October of a treaty of peace between their \n     countries. The United States played a critical role in making \n     this possible, through our diplomacy and our commitment to \n     stand by those who worked for peace.\n       I told Prime Minister Rabin and King Hussein last July, as \n     they met at the White House and set out their vision for a \n     future of peace and cooperation, that the United States would \n     support Jordan--as we support Israel--to minimize the risks \n     it was taking for peace. The Congress expressed its own \n     support for the King's leadership in the peace process in the \n     extraordinary reception accorded the King and Prime Minister \n     when they appeared together before a Joint Session. This \n     expression of U.S. support was essential to King Hussein's \n     ability to move forward to conclude and implement a peace \n     with Israel which could serve as a model for regional \n     cooperation.\n       Accordingly, last year I proposed to Congress that we \n     forgive all of Jordan's official direct debt to the United \n     States. This was authorized by the Congress last August and \n     $99 million was appropriated as an initial tranche. I \n     proposed in the FY 1995 supplemental an appropriation of $275 \n     million to complete debt forgiveness. I want to encourage \n     Congress to take immediate action to fulfill this commitment.\n       Failure to do so would threaten our ability to continue our \n     leadership in the Middle East peace process. It undercuts \n     those who are willing to take risks for peace and it directly \n     threatens the security of Israel and the Israel-Jordan peace \n     treaty. Prime Minister Rabin called me to express personally \n     his grave concern regarding the negative consequences for \n     both Israel and Jordan, as well as the broader peace process, \n     of failure to fully implement the proposed debt forgiveness.\n       The cause of peace in the Middle East is at a critical \n     point. We must not withdraw the support we have pledged to \n     those who face very real threats from terror and violence. \n     The people of Jordan must see that the United States stands \n     by its commitments. Israel must know that our leadership in \n     the Middle East remains a constant of bipartisan policy. And \n     those in the region who have not yet made peace must \n     recognize that we will not retreat from engagement in the \n     quest for an enduring settlement.\n       The price the United States and our friends in the Middle \n     East will pay for failure is high. I need your support to \n     ensure that our commitment is fulfilled and the full $275 \n     million of debt forgiveness for Jordan is provided.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. PELL. Madam President, this is an extraordinarily delicate moment \nin the Middle East peace process. Israel's agreement with the \nPalestinians is hanging precariously in the balance between success and \nfailure, and one more act of terrorism against Israel could cause the \nagreement to unravel completely. At the same time, Israel's \nnegotiations with Syria are moving slowly, and could be eclipsed by the \npending Israeli electoral cycle.\n  While Secretary of State Christopher's recent trip to the Middle East \nappeared to yield some progress on the Palestinian and Syrian tracks, \nthe truth is that we cannot be assured of the establishment of a \ncomprehensive peace in the coming year. One element of the peace \nprocess, however, that has been an unqualified success is Jordan's \npeace treaty with Israel. By all accounts, the pace and scope of the \nagreement's implementation have exceeded expectations, and the accord \nshows real promise of bringing about a peaceful, normal relationship \nbetween Israel and Jordan. The Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty is a true \nmilestone in U.S. diplomatic efforts in the Middle East.\n  We cannot lose sight of how well the peace treaty serves our national \nsecurity and foreign policy concerns. Much like the Egypt-Israel peace \ntreaty that arose from the Camp David agreements, the Israel-Jordan \ntreaty resolves a major component of one of the most intractable \nconflicts in history. As a result, it should make a significant \ncontribution to advancing our interests in the Middle East, namely, \nensuring the safety and security of Israel, promoting regional \nstability, and preserving our access to--and the free flow of--oil.\n  That being the case, it is completely reasonable to provide full debt \nrelief to Jordan as compensation for implementing its peace treaty with \nIsrael. To me, a $275 million appropriation--when viewed in the context \nof this historic peace treaty--is a fair price to pay in support of \npeace. Moreover, if the United States leads by example in forgiving its \ndebt, then we might be able to use that as leverage over other donor \ncountries to enter into similar debt relief arrangements.\n  Madam President, I can think of many occasions in the past 30-some \nyears when I have stood in this very spot to commend King Hussein for \npromoting peace in the Middle East. Now that the King has taken the \nfinal step in signing and implementing a treaty--with, I might add, no \nsmall amount of prodding from the Congress and successive U.S. \nadministrations--I believe we should send a signal of our appreciation. \nThat is why I support full debt forgiveness for Jordan.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased to join Chairman McConnell \nin sponsoring the Jordan debt relief amendment. This amendment \nconcludes an effort that he and I began last summer when I was still \nchairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee and he was the ranking \nmember. My colleagues will recall the excitement that enveloped this \nbody at that time: Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and Jordanian King \nHussein paid a joint visit to Capitol Hill and confirmed that they were \nmaking peace. I will never forget the shivers that ran down my spine as \nI listened to them speak and realized that the day that we had so long \nwished for had finally arrived. It was with enormous pride that I \nworked late at night with Senator McConnell and Congressman Obey in a \nlast-minute drive to incorporate in our fiscal year 1995 appropriations \nbill a downpayment on debt relief for Jordan as a token of United \nStates support for this wonderful, historic development.\n  That was just the beginning, however. In the space of just 2 months, \nfar more quickly than anyone had predicted, the governments of Jordan \nand Israel completed negotiation of the formal peace agreement between \ntheir two countries. Come the end of October, I found myself with \nPresident Clinton witnessing the signing of that agreement on the \nJordan-Israel border north of the Gulf of Aqaba. Once again, I found \nmyself moved beyond words.\n  With the memories of that trip to the Middle East still fresh in my \nmind, I was pleased last month to see included in the administration's \nfiscal year 1996 budget request a proposal for a supplemental fiscal \nyear 1995 appropriation to fund the remainder of the Jordan debt \nrestructuring program that Congress authorized last summer. I was \nfurther pleased 10 days ago to receive a call from Secretary of State \nChristopher requesting my support for including $275 million for this \neffort in the defense supplemental appropriations bill now before the \nSenate. With the peace agreement signed and implementation proceeding \nvigorously, it is imperative that the United States move quickly to \nfulfill its promise and appropriate the funds required to complete the \ndebt relief effort. I told Secretary Christopher that I would support \nthis proposal enthusiastically.\n  Later that day, however, I received the details of the proposal and \nrealized that there was one serious drawback to it: it would require \nthat the bulk of the money--$225 million--for this effort come out of \nthe funds that will be available in fiscal year 1996 for our other \nforeign assistance activities. In other words, in order to pay for our \naid to Jordan, we would have to cut back significantly our aid to other \ncountries and organizations. Mr. President, I worked all last week \ntrying to find a \n[[Page S4058]] way to appropriate in full the $275 million for Jordan \ndebt relief that is essential at this critical stage in the Middle East \npeace process, and at the same time avoid threatening serious harm to \nthe rest of our foreign assistance programs. Unfortunately, the State \nDepartment advised me that any modification of the proposal would be \ninterpreted in the Middle East as a retreat by the United States from \nits commitment to Jordan and its support for the peace process.\n  They also told me, however, that the administration will work hard in \nthe coming months to find ways to mitigate the prospective harm to \nother programs. Given these assurances, and my strong commitment to \nsupporting the Middle East peace process, I am cosponsoring this \namendment with Chairman McConnell. Chairman McConnell has worked hard \non this amendment, and I have appreciated the chance to work with him \non it.\n  With this action, we make an important contribution to advancing the \npeace process and we demonstrate to King Hussein the appreciation of \nthe United States for the heroic steps he has taken in support of the \npeace process.\n  As we proceed through the fiscal year 1996 appropriations cycle, I \nwill work hard with the administration, Chairman McConnell, and my \nother fellow Senators to minimize cuts to other essential foreign \nassistance programs.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I am joining with other members of \nthe Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee in sponsoring the pending \namendment to relieve the remainder of Jordan's debt to the United \nStates. I do so because this initiative is integral to the ongoing \npeace process in the Middle East.\n  This action will make good on the promise President Clinton and the \nAmerican people made to King Hussein--that the United States would \nsupport Jordan as it took risks for peace.\n  In line with this commitment, last summer, President Clinton told \nKing Hussein that he would ask the Congress to relieve Jordan's debt to \nthe United States if Jordan took a bold step toward peace.\n  As the first step on the road to peace, Jordan and Israel signed the \nWashington Declaration and King Hussein and Prime Minister Rabin \nappeared for the first time together in public last July.\n  It was a historic moment. Many of us sat in the Capitol and marveled \nas King Hussein and Prime Minister Rabin--two former enemies--stood \ntogether before the Congress and spoke publicly about strengthening \nties between their nations, about moving toward a comprehensive peace \ntreaty.\n  We were inspired by their courage. We were moved that the two leaders \nwere taking concrete steps to bring their nations together. That they \nwere committing themselves publicly to waging a battle for peace.\n  In response, and consistent with the President's commitment, the \nCongress forgave a portion--$220 million--of Jordan's debt to the \nUnited States. to relieve all of the debt at that time would have been \npremature. It was, after all, important to measure progress and to give \nthe King an additional incentive to sign a formal peace treaty with \nIsrael.\n  Now, Mr. President, Jordan has signed a formal peace agreement with \nIsrael. Jordan did not wait for other countries in the region to reach \nan agreement with Israel. It boldly moved forward and signed a \ncomprehensive peace agreement with Israel on its own.\n  Now that Jordan has done its part, the United States needs to make \ngood on the President's commitment to relieve the remainder of its debt \nto our country. The Jordanian Government has exposed itself to those \nwho would choose war rather than peace with Israel.\n  The Government and the people of Jordan need to believe that they are \nbeing supported by the United States. They need to see that the fruits \nof peace are tangible.\n  Madam President, the administration supports this amendment. \nSecretary of State Christopher believes it is important to build the \nconfidence of promoters of peace in Jordan and throughout the Middle \nEast.\n  Last week, I spoke to Dennis Ross, the State Department's Middle East \nnegotiator, who was in the Middle East with Secretary Christopher. He \nconveyed to me his strong belief that approving the remainder of \nJordan's debt relief at this time was necessary to build momentum in \nthe peace process and continue to strengthen American credibility in \nthe region.\n  Admittedly, this is a less than ideal solution. Approving this \namendment will put additional pressure on our foreign aid spending \nbill. However, as we review spending cuts, we have to keep in mind \nlong-term American foreign policy and security interests, and reflect \non expenses that might be incurred, and lives that might be lost, if \nthe peace process does not move forward in the Middle East.\n  I hope this new commitment will be reflected in the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Subcommittee allocation for fiscal year 1996.\n  Relieving Jordan's debt is important for the peace process. A \nsuccessful conclusion to the peace process after decades of strife is \nimportant to U.S. security interests and, hopefully, will avoid the \nneed for large defense expenditures or military involvement down the \nroad. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n                            amendment no 343\n\n  Mr. INOUYE offered amendment No. 343 for Mr. McConnell.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 26, at the end of line 23 add the following:\n       Of the funds appropriated in Public Law 103-316, $3,000,000 \n     is hereby authorized for appropriation to the Corps of \n     Engineers to initiate and complete remedial measures to \n     prevent slope instability at Hickman Bluff, Kentucky.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I have proposed an amendment that is \nessential to the continued survival of Hickman, KY. This town sits on \nan eroding bluff on the bank of the Mississippi River. If the erosion \nof the bluff is not halted the city of Hickman risks losing two \n500,000-gallon water tanks, the police, fire, and ambulance stations, \nthe county health department, and the community library buildings. As \nrecently as 2 weeks ago the Fulton County School Board was evacuated \nafter engineers indicated that bluff erosion had made the building \nunsafe.\n  Over the last several years, I have worked to find a solution to this \nproblem. In 1992, I obtained funds to direct the Corps of Engineers to \nstudy the bluff's instability and determine the least costly \nalternative to address the erosion problem. Last year I was able to get \nadditional funds included in the Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations, subject to authorization. Unfortunately, the Water \nResources Development Act never passed the Senate, leaving the Corps of \nEngineers without the authorization to initiate their plan to stabilize \nthe bluff. This amendment merely authorizes the expenditure of already \nappropriated funds.\n  This year I am concerned that time may run out on the residents of \nHickman. Since the erosion does not conveniently conform to the \nSenate's schedule, I simply can not stand by and wait to see if the \nWater Resources Development Act will be passed this year. The city of \nHickman is counting on this funding to prevent any further loss of \ntheir community.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 344\n\n       (Purpose: To restore local rail freight assistance funds)\n\n  Mr. INOUYE offered amendment No. 344 for Mr. Pressler, for himself, \nMr. Harkin, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Daschle.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 30, line 8, strike the dollar figure \n     ``$120,000,000'' and insert in lieu thereof the dollar figure \n     ``$126,608,000''.\n       On page 30, strike line 14 through line 18.\n                           amendment no. 345\n\n  (Purpose: Sense of the Senate concerning the National Test Facility)\n\n  Mr. INOUYE offered amendment No. 345 for Mr. Brown.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``SEC.  . NATIONAL TEST FACILITY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the National Test \n     Facility provides important support to strategic and theater \n     missile defense in the following areas: (a) United States-\n     United Kingdom defense planning; (b) the PATRIOT and THAAD \n     programs; (c) computer support for the Advanced Research \n     [[Page S4059]] Center; and (d) technical assistance to \n     theater missile defense, and fiscal year 1995 funding should \n     be maintained to ensure retention of these priority \n     functions.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 346\n\n    (Purpose: To provide that the rescission from the environmental \n     restoration defense account shall not affect expenditures for \n  environmental restoration at installations proposed for closure or \n       realignment in the 1995 round of the base closure process)\n\n  Mr. INOUYE offered amendment No. 346 for Mrs. Feinstein.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following new \n     section:\n       Sec. 110. (a) In determining the amount of funds available \n     for obligation from the Environmental Restoration, Defense, \n     account in fiscal year 1995 for environmental restoration at \n     the military installations described in subsection (b), the \n     Secretary of Defense shall not take into account the \n     rescission from the account set forth in section 106.\n       (b) Subsection (a) applies to military installations that \n     the Secretary recommends for closure or realignment in 1995 \n     under section 2903(c) of the Defense Base Closure and \n     Realignment Act of 1990 (subtitle A of title XXIX of Public \n     Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note).\n                  amendment to protect military bases\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment \nthat would protect military bases recommended for closure or \nrealignment in 1995 from the proposed rescission in the Defense \nEnvironmental Restoration Account [DERA]. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important amendment.\n  As many of my colleagues know, DERA funds are used to clean up \nenvironmental contamination at open military bases. Because, the \nmilitary is subject to Federal and State environmental laws and \nregulations just like private parties, the Department of Defense has an \nobligation to clean up its military bases, whether the bases will \nremain open or will close due to the base realignment and closure \nprocess.\n  I strongly support DERA efforts and am concerned about the proposed \n$300 million rescission in this appropriation bill. But, I understand \nthat the supplemental funding is extremely important to ensure the \nreadiness of our Armed Forces and protect U.S. national security. \nBecause the Appropriations Committee has decided to fully offset the \nincrease in funding with spending cuts, difficult decisions need to be \nmade. I remain hopeful, however, that the severe cut in DERA funds can \nbe mitigated in conference.\n  I am particularly concerned about the impact of the DERA rescission \non bases that have been recommended for closure or realignment in the \ncurrent base closure round. Normally, cleanup at closing military bases \nis funded out of the base realignment and closure [BRAC] account. \nHowever, in the first year of a closure--before BRAC cleanup funds are \navailable--environmental cleanup at closing military bases is funded \nfrom DERA.\n  Military bases slated for closure must be closed within 6 years of \nthe closure decision, therefore, it is important that environmental \ncleanup not be delayed to ensure the timely and effective reuse of \nbases. Environmental cleanup is vital to assisting impacted communities \nwith economic redevelopment efforts.\n  This amendment would protect bases recommended for closure or \nrealignment in 1995 from any funding cuts in DERA. The rescission would \nstill take place, but at least for the first year until BRAC funding \nkicks in, closing bases would not be impacted. This amendment would \nsimply ensure that the timetable for cleaning up and closing a military \nbase is not adversely impacted.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendments be considered and agreed to, en bloc; that the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, en bloc; and that statements \nrelative to the amendments be printed in the Record as though read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendments (Nos. 342 through 346) were agreed to.\n\n\n                    dod mail order pharmacy program\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I would like to bring to Senator \nStevens' attention an issue regarding improved options for access to \nDOD health services.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I welcome my friend and colleague's input.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The fiscal year 1993 Defense Authorization and \nAppropriations Acts required the DOD to conduct mail service pharmacy \ndemonstration projects. The fiscal year 1994 Appropriations Act \nincluded language requiring DOD to expand the mail service benefit to \ninclude all base realignment and closure sites not supported by an at-\nrisk managed care support contract.\n  DOD has moved forward to implement at-risk managed care support \ncontracts; however, residents within the BRAC sites are still adversely \naffected because the managed care contracts will not be fully \nimplemented in some areas for up to 27 months. This denies these \nindividuals the access and convenience they previously had in going to \nmedical treatment facility pharmacies.\n  By acting to extend the mail service pharmacy program now rather than \nwaiting for full implementation of the managed care at-risk contracts, \nthe Government can achieve the following objectives.\n  First, during the interim period, eligible residents will have access \nand convenience to a benefit that is comparable to what they had before \nby being able to go to the pharmacy at the medical treatment facility \nbefore it closed.\n  Second, the existing mail service pharmacy benefit uses government \nacquired pharmaceuticals, where as currently, beneficiaries are \nreimbursed based on what they pay for medications on the commercial \nmarket, which are considerably higher.\n  Third, expansion of this benefit now is consistent with previous \ncongressional mandates to provide access and interim coverage to \nindividuals affected by BRAC.\n  For these and other reasons, it is my hope that you will lend your \nsupport to try to address this gap in coverage during the conference.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from New Mexico has my support for trying to \nassist him in addressing this issue during the conference.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. I very much appreciate his \nsupport.\n                    AIR FORCE SPACE PROGRAM FUNDING\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, in discussions with the Air Force early \nthis month, the Defense Subcommittee learned about a potentially \nserious problem with the financing mechanisms governing Air Force \nsupport of the Cassini mission to Saturn sponsored by the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration [NASA].\n  In addition, potential problems have been identified with the funding \nof on-orbit incentives for several Air Force satellite programs.\n  The Cassini-related issue centers on the question of how much of the \nfunds reimbursed to the service by NASA, can the Air Force use to \nfinance the Titan IV/Centaur heavy-lift expendable launch vehicle \nprograms. There is no problem with the amount of reimbursement, or with \nNASA's willingness to pay these funds. The problem apparently arises \ndue to legal interpretation of the statute governing interagency \nexchanges of goods and services.\n  The subcommittee has been informed that resolution of this problem \nshould occur early this year to avoid significant impacts on the Titan \nIV/Centaur space programs.\n  Similarly, early resolution may be needed for the on-orbit incentives \ndilemma the Air Force faces. In this case, a change in guidelines for \nbudgeting for on-orbit incentives may have caused financial shortfalls \nfor important satellite programs. The Air Force states that these \nfinancing changes may cause serious problems for the Defense Support \nProgram for early warning satellites, the Global Positioning System \nnavigation satellites, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, \nand the Defense Satellite Communications System.\n  The subcommittee understands that possible solutions to the Cassini \nand on-orbit incentives problems raise several legislative issues which \nmust be addressed. Because of these issues, I have asked the Secretary \nof the Air Force to provide the subcommittee with her views on these \nmatters, as well as the views of other organizations within the \nDepartment of Defense and NASA which may have an interest in solving \nthese problems expeditiously.\n  [[Page S4060]] I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record my \nletter to Air Force Secretary Sheila E. Widnall on these matters at the \nend of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my objective to be able to address these problems \nduring our joint conference with our House counterparts. I am hopeful \nthat the additional information we are seeking will assist us during \nthis conference.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 1995.\n     Hon. Sheila E. Widnall,\n     Secretary of the Air Force, The Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: In discussions with the Air Force, \n     the Defense Subcommittee has learned about a potentially \n     serious problem with the financing mechanisms governing Air \n     Force support for the Cassini mission to Saturn sponsored by \n     the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). In \n     addition, problems have been identified with the funding of \n     on-orbit incentives for several Air Force satellite programs. \n     The Subcommittee has been informed that resolution of these \n     problems would occur early this year to avoid significant \n     impacts on Air Force space programs.\n       The Subcommittee understands that possible solutions to \n     these problems raise several legislative issues which must be \n     addressed. Because of these issues, I would appreciate it \n     greatly if you would share with us your personal views on \n     these matters, as well as the views of other organizations \n     within the Department of Defense and NASA which may have an \n     interest in solving these problems expeditiously.\n       As I know you recognize, the Subcommittee stands ready to \n     assist the Air Force in meeting its national security \n     missions.\n       With best wishes,\n           Cordially,\n                                                      Ted Stevens,\n                                                         Chairman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I would like to review with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Defense Subcommittee the status of an Air \nForce program to investigate new air defense surveillance technologies. \nThis program, called HAVE GAZE, has been managed for many years by the \nAir Force's Phillips Laboratory in New Mexico. Last year, Congress \nappropriated $8 million for fiscal year 1995 efforts. The same amount \nwas appropriated for fiscal year 1994.\n  Phillips Laboratory has developed this promising new radar technology \nto the point where actual field experiments are necessary. These \nexperiments are designed to gather the hard data needed to determine \nHAVE GAZE's operational potential and to determine whether the next \ndevelopment steps are justified.\n  Unfortunately, the Office of the Secretary of Defense [OSD] has \nreleased only about $2.5 million of the fiscal year 1994 funds and has \nwithheld approval to spend the remaining $5.5 million for fiscal year \n1994 and all of the fiscal year 1995 funds. Despite Congress' support \nfor the program, OSD initially tried to terminate HAVE GAZE and now \nproposes more delays and more study before the Air Force can obligate \nfunds.\n  I would like to ask the distinguished Defense Subcommittee chairman \nwhether he shares my concerns about the Defense Department's latest \nactions regarding HAVE GAZE.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say to my colleague from New Mexico that I do, indeed, \nshare his concerns about HAVE GAZE. I am sorry to say the Department \nhas not acted expeditiously as we intended when we appropriated funds \nin fiscal years 1994 and 1995. It is important that these previously \nappropriated funds be released so that the technical data needed to \nfully evaluate HAVE GAZE's potential is available to the Pentagon and \nto the Congress.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is the chairman aware of the support from the military \nfor obtaining this HAVE GAZE data through the field experiments?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am well aware of the fact that these HAVE GAZE \nexperiments are supported by both the U.S. Space Command and the Air \nForce.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe there is still an opportunity for the \nappropriate and timely resolution of this difficulty. Does the \ndistinguished chairman agree?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree that there is need for the quick resolution of \nthe situation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the chairman be willing to continue to work with \nme during the joint conference with our House counterparts to encourage \nthe Defense Department to release the HAVE GAZE funds without further \ndelay?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me assure my colleague on the Defense Subcommittee \nthat, should these delays continue, we will need to consider this topic \nin our deliberations during conference with the House on this bill. I \nwill work closely with him on this important matter.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. I greatly appreciate the support \nof the distinguished chairman of the Defense Subcommittee in obtaining \nan expeditious resolution of this HAVE GAZE issue.\n                      military school maintenance\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise to engage the chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee in a colloquy on the issue \nof military school maintenance.\n  As the chairman may know, local education agencies [LEA's] which \nserve the dependents on active military personnel have a unique and \nvery difficult challenge in meeting the needs of these students. Not \nthe least of these challenges is maintaining a safe and productive \nlearning environment in those educational facilities which are owned by \nthe Federal Government and located on military installations.\n  This situation is particularly acute in several LEA's which were \nidentified in the joint Department of Defense/Department of Education \nreport, the Dole Commission report mandated by Public Law 99-661, as \nhaving the most severe problems while serving at least two major \nmilitary installations. In fact, some of these facilities would not \neven meet local fire and safety regulations were they not located on \nFederal property.\n  Congress has addressed this problem several times in the past. In \nfiscal year 1994 Congress appropriated $10 million to initiate repair \nproblems at the above mentioned installations. This allowed the \nDepartment to begin correcting the most severe building deficiencies in \nadvance of ownership transfer to the involved LEA's. In fiscal year \n1995 Congress appropriated an additional $20 million to continue and \nhopefully complete this work and transfer ownership.\n  Though the funds for fiscal year 1995 military school maintenance \nprograms were appropriated almost 6 months ago, I am advised that the \nDepartment of Defense has yet to disburse these funds to the \nappropriate schools.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I share the Senator's concern about DOD failing to \npromptly disburse these funds. As the Senator from Washington knows, \nthe Department was directed--in the Senate report accompanying last \nyear's Defense appropriations bill--to allocate these funds to school \ndistricts identified in the joint DOD/DOEd study as having the most \nsevere problems. As such, school districts in our two States are in \nline for receiving some of these funds. One of the reasons for the \nDepartment's delay, I am told, is that statutory language approved in \nthe 1995 Defense Appropriations Act does not allow funds for repairing \nfederally owned schools to be used to replace facilities. I believe \nthis problem faces both the Alaska and Washington schools. Is that the \nSenator's understanding as well?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I believe that to be the case. It is my hope that a \nremedy to this situation will be considered in the conference on this \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I look forward to working with the Senator from \nWashington on this issue and will ask my staff to work closely with \nyour office to craft an appropriate remedy. I can assure the Senator \nthat this issue will be dealt with promptly.\n                           apache helicopters\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, there is one issue I would like to bring \nto the attention of the chairman of our Defense Subcommittee--the \nproposed rescission of $77.6 million from the Apache A procurement \nprogram. Although this funding is no longer needed to prevent a gap in \nthe Apache production line, the Army claims that it is needed to \nprevent a delay in the Apache Longbow modernization program, which is \none of the U.S. Army's priority programs.\n  I have been informed that the Army currently faces a significant \nfunding shortfall for long lead procurement \n[[Page S4061]] items and for research and development in the Longbow \nprogram. These funding shortfalls may cause significant downsizing and \ndelay in both efforts. A delay in exercising the long lead contract \noptions and in providing the RDT funding, may result in key suppliers \nceasing work and may cause delays in production planning, tooling \nacquisition, and component production. Technical publications may be \nplaced at risk, and total program costs may increase.\n  I ask the chairman whether he would be willing to address this issue \nin conference and to work with me to find some kind of accommodation to \navoid shortfalls in this critical program.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I recognize the concerns of the Senator from Missouri in \nthis matter, and I can assure him that I will be happy to work with him \nwithin the fiscal limitations which constrain all of our decisions \nduring this time of austerity.\n  I want to extend to my colleague and fellow member of the Defense \nSubcommittee my personal commitment to support the Apache Longbow \nprogram as a centerpiece of the Army's aviation modernization plan. I \nalso recognize the significance of continuity in the Apache Longbow \nprocurement and development efforts to the consideration of Apache \nhelicopters for purchase by our NATO allies.\n  Let me add, for the benefit of my colleague, that I have directed the \nDefense Subcommittee staff to begin discussions immediately with the \nArmy to determine the supplemental funding requirements for fiscal year \n1995. The subcommittee is seeking this additional information so that \nit can assure that adequate resources are available for the program and \nthat fiscal year 1995 funds support the efficient execution of the \nfiscal year 1996 budget request for Apache Longbow.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the Senator from Hawaii be willing to \nengage in a short colloquy with the Senators from North Dakota?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I will be glad to engage in a colloquy with the Senators \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. According to my understanding, Congress appropriated $10 \nmillion in fiscal year 1994 and $10 million in fiscal year 1995 for the \nU.S. Army to upgrade and procure the M149A2 water trailer.\n  Would the Senator from Hawaii tell me if my understanding is correct?\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator is correct. The Senator from North Dakota is \naware that, as Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I \nstrongly supported procurement of the M149A2 because it provided the \nArmy with a modern water trailer which it sorely needed.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I recognize the key role the Senator has played in \nprocurement of the water trailer, and I am grateful for his support. As \nthe Senator from Hawaii is aware, the M149A2 is manufactured by the \nTurtle Mountain Manufacturing Co., located on the Turtle Mountain \nIndian Reservation in North Dakota.\n  Turtle Mountain Manufacturing Co. began manufacturing the water \ntrailer when the company was part of the Small Disadvantaged Business \n8(a) set-aside program, and the company continued manufacturing the \ntrailer after it graduated from the 8(a) program. Procurement of the \nM149A2 provided the Army with a vital piece of equipment. The \nprocurement also brought job opportunities to the Turtle Mountain \nIndian Reservation.\n  However, I have recently learned that the Army has procured enough of \nthe water trailers to meet its new inventory objective. Due to planned \nforce structure changes, the Army does not need as many water trailers \nas it previously anticipated.\n  Would the Senator tell me if I am correct?\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator is correct. The Army reports that it has \n9,926 M149A2 water trailers on hand, and no longer needs more of the \nwater trailers. As the Senator has indicated, the Army still has $15 \nmillion of the funds Congress appropriated for the water trailers in \nfiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995.\n  The Army does, however, need another trailer, the M105A3 cargo \ntrailer. The average age of the M105 cargo trailer is 16 years, while \nthe trailer's economic life is 20 years. Nearly one-quarter of the \nArmy's fleet of M105 cargo trailers is older than twenty years, and \nmany of these overage trailers are assigned to fight units. The overage \ntrailers can impair unit mobility and readiness.\n  Mr. CONRAD. As I understand it then, the Army has $15 million \nremaining from procurement of the M149A2 water trailer. Although the \nArmy does not need additional water trailers, it does need the M105A3 \ncargo trailer.\n  Would the Senator support the Army's using this remaining $15 million \nto procure the M105A3 cargo trailer?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I indeed support such action by the Army. The funds were \nappropriated for trailer procurement, and the Army needs the M105A3. I \nurge the Army to use the funds to procure the M105A3.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I echo the sentiments expressed by my colleague from \nNorth Dakota. I thank the Senator from Hawaii for his support of \nfunding for the M149A2 water trailer. The Senator's support has been \nvital to its inclusion in the defense appropriations bill.\n  Regarding the purchase of the M105A3 cargo trailer, I appreciate the \nSenator's confirmation that the Army needs the trailer. Since \nprocurement of the M105A3 would essentially replace procurement of the \nM149A2, which was originally procured under the small disadvantaged \n8(a) program, would the Senator from Hawaii indicate whether he thinks \nthe M105A3 should be procured under a set-aside program?\n  Specifically, does the Senator from Hawaii think it would be \nappropriate for the M105A3 contract to be set aside for small \ndisadvantaged businesses?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I do think it would be appropriate for the Army to set \naside the M105A3 contract for small disadvantaged businesses, and I \nurge the Army to do so.\n  Senator Stevens, the chairman of the subcommittee, is on the floor. \nWould the chairman of the subcommittee be willing to share his views on \nthis subject?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am pleased to tell the Senator from Hawaii that I \nshare his opinion. The Army needs the M105A3 and, since the Army has \nfunds which were appropriated for trailer procurement, the Army should \nuse the $15 million in unused funds from procurement of the M149A2 to \nprocure the M105A3 cargo trailer.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Hawaii and the Senator from \nAlaska.\n\n\n             funding for enterprise development in the nis\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I would like to express to the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, the chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, my \nconcern as to whether the rescission in this bill to the Agency for \nInternational Development [AID] budget might affect the fiscal year \n1995 funding level for the Enterprise Development Program. The projects \nfunded in this program are some of the most successful in the former \nSoviet Union. I have personal experience with the American Russian \nCenter [ARC] in Alaska, which receives its funding through this \nprogram. As you may be aware, during its exit briefing for their \nassessment of AID's programs in the Newly Independent States [NIS] the \nGeneral Accounting Office [GAO] stated that the ARC was one of the two \nbest programs in Russia. Mr. Tom Dine, the AID assistant administrator \nfor Eastern Europe and Russia, is quoted as saying ``I use it [ARC] as \nan example to other Universities of how to get involved in the whole \neconomic transition effort taking place in the former Soviet Union.'' \nARC is the only AID privatization program in the Russian Far East \nRegion, and in its first year provided training and technical \nassistance to over 1,000 Russians. Does the committee support the \nprivatization programs, such as the ARC, in the NIS?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, it does.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Enterprise Development Program in AID is funding the \ndevelopment of private enterprises in Russia, not the Russian \nGovernment. This is consistent with the goal of strengthening the \ndeveloping entrepreneur class in Russia. This entrepreneur class will \nbe the backbone of democracy in that country. Because of the \noutstanding performance of the ARC and other programs like it, and \n[[Page S4062]] their critical mission of supporting privatization in \nRussia, I believe this program merits continued full funding. Is it the \nintention of the chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee that \nno reduction be applied to the highly rated projects in the Enterprise \nDevelopment Program such as the ARC?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, that is correct. AID should maintain full funding \nfor these programs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the distinguished Senator support the original \nfiscal year 1995 funding level for the Enterprise Development Program.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I want to thank my colleague for \nclarifying that point.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise in my capacity as chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, to comment on H.R. 889, the defense supplemental \nappropriations and rescission bill for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 1995, as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  The bill provides for a net decrease in fiscal year 1995 budget \nauthority and outlays of $1.3 billion and $91 million, respectively. \nThese are real cuts to the deficit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that tables showing the relationship of the \npending bill to the Appropriations Committee 602 allocations and to the \noverall spending ceilings under the fiscal year 1995 budget resolution \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, and material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as

Madam President, I wonder is my friend from Alaska will \nallow me to respond to his final point about the necessity of having \nthis same language included in the rest of the 1996 appropriation \nbills.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I welcome the chairman's comment on this point.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I appreciate Senator Murkowski's willingness to modify \nthe language of the amendment to delete the reference to ``any other \nact.'' As the Senator knows, it is my policy as chairman to pass \nappropriation bills that do not contain amendments that attempt to \napply to other appropriation bills that have not yet come before us.\n  However, I want to give my assurances to the Senator from Alaska and \nto the majority leader that I support the intent of this amendment and \nwill work with you in your efforts to include it in the remainder of \nthe 1996 appropriation bills.\n  The Murkowski/Dole amendment brings much needed discipline to the \nadministration's tactics for diverting money to the projects associated \nwith the United States DPRK agreed framework. As the Senator mentioned \nin his remarks, in fiscal year 1995 the administration relied \nexclusively on emergency and reprogrammed funds for this purpose. As \nthe chairman of the Appropriation Committee, I strongly support \n[[Page S4063]] the Murkowski/Dole amendment for requiring the \nadministration to take an upfront approach from here on out. The \nadministration must specifically request that funds be set aside for \nuse in implementing the agreed framework. This will bring greater \naccountability to the process, and perhaps decrease the necessity for \nemergency supplementals such as the one we have before us today.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the chairman for his remarks, and also thank \nthe Senior Senator from Alaska for his support of this amendment. I \nwill look forward to working with you to see that the Murkowski/Dole \nlanguage is adopted in subsequent appropriation bills.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I had planned to offer an amendment \ntoday but I will withhold in order to explain an agreement I have \nreached with the Chairman and manager of this bill, Senator Hatfield. \nMy amendment would have prohibited the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment [HUD] from expending further Community Development Block \nGrant [CDBG] nonemergency monies until funds appropriated last August \nfor Tropical Storm Alberto were fully released.\n  Madam President, the State of Georgia this summer endured the worst \ndisaster in its history, Tropical Storm Alberto. Alberto has left in \nits wake flooding unparalleled in the Southeast and damage estimates \nnearing $1 billion. In the aftermath of this disaster, Georgia embarked \non a unified effort to build back its communities. This effort was \nappropriately called ``Operation Buildback.'' During these efforts, \nState officials with the assistance of their Federal representatives, \ncatalogued the damages and recommended priority projects for the \nFederal agencies for whom emergency appropriations were made during our \nappropriations process.\n  During the 1995 budget cycle, $180 million were made available for \nthis flood through the Housing and Urban Development [HUD] CDBG \nprogram. Let me remind my colleagues that this process took place last \nAugust. It has been a full 8 months since and HUD has not released over \none-third of the disaster aid. In addition, my three inquiries to \nOffice of Management and Budget [OMB] and HUD as to when the remaining \nfunds would be released were ignored until it was learned that I would \noffer this amendment. There is $57 million outstanding and I would like \nto know why. Eight months is entirely enough time to get these funds \nreleased. The State of Georgia has done their part in submitting \nproject requests in December that were well in excess of the $180 \nmillion that was appropriated for the entire disaster. It is high time \nfor the Federal Government to do their part.\n  I submit that this is not way to treat disaster victims and their \ncommunities. We have a responsibility to get that money back to those \nwho need it most instead of on a bureaucrat's desk in Washington. I \nwill not offer my amendment with the assurances of Committee Chairman \nHatfield that he will support my efforts to add such an amendment to \nthe second supplemental appropriations bill we consider if the \nadministration has not rectified this situation.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The Senator from Georgia is correct in regard to our \nagreement. If this situation has not been resolved by the time the \nSenate considers the next supplemental appropriations bill, I will \nsupport the amendment of the Senator of Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I commend the chairman for his willingness to assist \nme in this endeavor. It is of utmost importance to my State. I look \nforward to working with him in the coming weeks to rectify this matter \nand thank him for his leadership in this regard.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, before we vote on the supplemental \nappropriation bill before us, I want to thank Chairman Hatfield, \nSenator Byrd, Chairman Stevens, and Senator Inouye for their hard work \nin hammering out a bill which will restore $1.9 billion needed for \ntraining and readiness of our Armed Forces.\n  I am pleased that this bill is fully off-set in both budget authority \nand outlays. Additionally, in my view, the committee has done a good \njob in identifying the defense programs which should fund this \nsupplemental appropriation. However, I am concerned by the fact that \nthe operations and maintenance accounts of our Armed Forces are \ncontinually being raided to fund unbudgeted contingencies that have \nlittle if anything to do with our national security. The administration \nrequested this supplemental because it diverted 4th quarter O funding \nto pay for operations in Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, Kuwait, Korea, and \nBosnia. Now, let me be clear, I am not saying that all of these \noperations do not relate to U.S. interests. Certainly some, such as the \ndeployment to Kuwait and the increased operations in and around the \nKorean peninsula, were in line with our national security interests. \nThat is the way it is supposed to be. The deployment of U.S. troops \nshould only be considered when the vital interests of the United States \nare at stake. We simply cannot continue to raid our O accounts to pay \nfor every peace-keeping or peace-making operation dreamed up by the \nUnited Nations.\n  Even as the drawdown continues, our fighting men and women are asked \nto take on more missions in\n hostile environments. They face greater dangers with fewer numbers and \nless resources. In fact, since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the \nArmy has seen operational deployments increase by 300 percent. Last \nyear, the Army twice set a new record for soldiers operationally \ndeployed to other countries--with U.S. troops in more than 91 countries \naround the world. Despite all of the administration's rhetoric, they \nhave provided neither an adequate force structure nor an adequate \ndefense budget for the challenges that face us in this new era.\n\n  Now, we in the Congress find ourselves in the position of voting on a \nmeasure which essentially funds peace-keeping operations on which this \nChamber has not expressed its position. Certainly, the President should \nhave the flexibility to act in defense of our Nation and its interests. \nBut we have been put in a position where we are asked to reimburse the \nDepartment of Defense for these operations, and if we do not, the \nreadiness of our forces will be irreversibly harmed. Earlier, my \ncolleague, Senator Stevens, laid out for us what it would mean to not \nprovide these funds. No doubt about it, the readiness of our forces \nwould be downgraded from their current level, which in my view is \nprecarious at best.\n  So, let me be clear, because I am concerned about the readiness of \nour forces and because I support the men and women who put their lives \non the line whenever this Government asks them to, I will vote for this \nbill. But that should not be interpreted as a stamp of approval of all \nof the operations which made this supplemental necessary.\n  Mr. NUNN. Madam President, I want to start by commending the Senator \nfrom Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii for their hard work on this \nbill. I know there are no two members of the Senate more concerned \nabout our national security than Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye. \nThey have been given the difficult task of balancing our national \nsecurity needs with the need for deficit reduction, and I can certainly \nappreciate the pressures they are under.\n  The Appropriations Committee has moved quickly on this supplemental, \nwhich the administration says must be enacted by the end of this month. \nI think the Senate has improved on the House bill in some respects. I \nparticularly want to commend the managers for rejecting the reduction \nproposed by the House to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. That \nis a program the Secretary of Defense feels very strongly about, as do \nI.\n  I also think the managers were wise to reject the addition of $670 \nmillion in unrequested funds contained in the House bill. Some of those \nadditional funds do address must-pay bills, which I will come back to \nin a moment, but they are not programs that belong in an emergency \nsupplemental.\n  Madam President, the Defense Department needs a supplemental, and I \nthink the leadership of the Defense Department is doing what they feel \nthey need to do to get a supplemental enacted in a timely fashion to \navoid a repeat of the disruptions in training that caused readiness \nproblems in fiscal year 1994. However, I have several concerns with the \napproach the Senate is \n[[Page S4064]] being asked to take in this legislation. I question \nwhether this supplemental is a good deal for the Defense Department on \nbalance.\n  First, it does not provide the net increase in defense spending for \nreadiness that was requested by the administration, despite the \nconcerns many of my colleagues have expressed about readiness. The \ncosts of the contingencies are covered, but only by making cuts \nelsewhere in the defense budget. Unlike the administration request and \nthe House-passed bill, there is no net increase in funding for the \nDepartment of Defense in this supplemental.\n  Because this bill is not designated as an emergency, it requires all \nincreases to be fully offset in both budget authority and outlays--\notherwise enactment of a supplemental could cause a sequester. As this \nbill demonstrates, it is necessary to cut more budget authority than \nyou add in order to achieve that goal when the supplemental \nrequirements fall in the faster spending accounts, which is usually the \ncase. In the future, I fear that we will find that attempting to offset \nfast-spending operation and maintenance outlays on a one-for-one basis \nwill be extremely difficult and overly restrictive.\n  DOD is willing to make some of the cuts in this bill, such as \ntermination of the TSSAM Program, which was anticipated in the budget, \nbut they had planned to use these cuts to offset the cost of other \nmust-pay bills later on this year. I might add that I regret that the \nTSSAM Program was not able to overcome its problems, because it is a \ntechnology we very much need, in my view. I am not quarreling with the \nadministration's decision to terminate the program, although I am \nconcerned that the amount of money rescinded in this bill will not \nallow sufficient funds to pay the Government's termination costs. I \nappreciate the comments of the Senator from Alaska that he is aware of \nthat issue and plans to review it in conference.\n  According to Deputy Secretary Deutch, DOD already has $800 million in \nmust-pay bills unrelated to these specific contingencies which will \nrequire reprogrammings, which is a process by which funds are \ntransferred from one defense program to another during a fiscal year. \nBy taking the easier cuts for this bill, we are just making it harder \nto deal with those other must-pay bills later.\n  Yet this bill also reduces DOD's 1995 reprogramming authority, \nthereby reducing their flexibility later in the year if more problems \ncome up. There are other cuts in this bill that the Department of \nDefense does not agree with, such as the reductions to the Technology \nReinvestment Program.\n  In addition to the concerns I have regarding specific programs in \nthis supplemental, I am troubled by the impact on the defense budget \nand on defense management that the approach this bill takes of making \nDOD absorb the full cost of these contingencies could have if it is \nviewed as a precedent for funding future contingencies, which I hope it \nwill not be. It largely defeats the purpose of having a supplemental.\n  I am not sure we have really thought through the impact of what we \nmay be doing to the military with this 100 percent offset approach. \nLast week, Gen. Gordon Sullivan, the Chief of Staff of the Army, told \nthe Armed Services Committee that if the Congress adopts a policy of \nforcing the military to completely offset the costs of any contingency \noperation:\n\n       . . . it is just going to destroy our training programs, \n     our quality of life programs, and it is going to be difficult \n     to manage the readiness of the force . . . It is going to \n     come out of reducing real property maintenance. We may have \n     to furlough civilians, terminate temporary employees, curtail \n     supply requests, park vehicles, reduce environmental \n     compliance. It is going to have a major impact.\n\n  General Sullivan said that in the event the military is told to \nassist a large-scale evacuation of U.N. personnel from Croatia:\n\n       I just have to stop training, and I will have to move money \n     around from elsewhere to keep that operation going since \n     obviously what you expect me to do is to fight and win your \n     wars. So, I will have to get the money from people who are \n     not doing that to support it.\n\n  Now that may sound like an exaggeration to some, but if you \nunderstand the laws that govern the defense budget, you will see why \nGeneral Sullivan's comments are right on target. The cost of an \noperation, such as paying for the airlift to get there, the fuel, spare \nparts, and so on, must come out of the operating budget. The military \ndoes not have the authority to divert funds from the procurement of \nweapons, or from research or military construction or military \npersonnel accounts, even if they wanted to.\n  And even within the operating budget, there are further constraints. \nA large portion of the operating account is civilian pay, so you cannot \nsave money there without firing civilians. And you cannot cut really \ncut the money to operate the bases--you have to pay the light bill. So \nthe areas General Sullivan is talking about--training, maintenance and \nrepair of the buildings on our military bases--are the only areas where \nthe military has the flexibility to change its plans halfway through \nthe year. And in fact that is exactly what happened last year--money \nhad to be diverted from training.\n  In the past we have paid for contingencies and natural disasters such \nas the Midwest floods, the Los Angeles riots, the California \nearthquake, and the cost of the Somalia and Rwanda operations last \nyear, as emergencies under the agreement reached in 1990 as part of the \nBudget Enforcement Act that set up discretionary caps. What we have \ndone, at least in defense, was make a good faith effort to offset these \nsupplementals as best we could. About 70 percent of the cost of the \n1994 Somalia supplemental was offset by defense rescissions, for \nexample, while all of the costs of the Rwanda mission, which was about \n$125 million, were emergency funds. So in the past we have been \nconsistent about calling an emergency an emergency, but sometimes we \nhave fully or partially tried to offset those costs and sometimes we \nhave not.\n  That is basically the approach the House is taking. They provided \nemergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense and \nthen tried to offset those appropriations, in budget authority but not \nin outlays, using savings from both defense and domestic programs. It \nis my hope that the House position would prevail on this fundamental \npoint, that is, the question of whether we are going to treat the costs \nof contingency operations that cannot be anticipated in advance as \nemergencies for budget purposes.\n  If we start dropping the emergency designation, we could end up \ntieing our hands in responding to future emergencies while we wait to \nfind 100 percent offsets. Strong consideration must be given to \nbudgeting for unanticipated contingencies in advance in the DOD budget, \nbut this inevitably runs into the issue of implicit congressional \napproval for military operations and war powers considerations.\n  In addition to my concerns about the financial impact on the Defense \nDepartment if this bill is viewed as a precedent, I also share the \nconcerns expressed by the Senator from Hawaii about the long term \npolicy implications of telling the military any future contingency they \nare involved in is going to come out of their budget dollar for dollar. \nThis is going to have an impact on their ability and their willingness \nto respond to situations like Haiti or Cuba, or especially a much more \nexpensive operation like peace enforcement in Bosnia, in the future. It \ncould have the effect of dictating our policy on the use of force \nthrough the appropriations process.\n  I hope the policy of making the Defense Department absorb the costs \nof these operations is viewed as a one-shot proposition, not as a \nprecedent for future supplementals, because if we are telling the \nDepartment of Defense that any time there is an emergency that comes up \nand they come over and request supplemental funds that they are going \nto have to provide a 100-percent offset, then we are going to change \nthe nature of the responsiveness of the Department of Defense itself to \nthe missions that may, indeed, be crucial to our Nation's security.\n  If the Department of Defense is told that any unanticipated operation \nthey undertake, either unilaterally or with NATO or the United Nations, \nis going to have to be completely offset within the defense budget, \nwhich means they are going to have to basically kill or substantially \nalter crucial defense programs in order to absorb those costs, \n[[Page S4065]] then the result is going to be a very strong signal that \nthe United States is not going to be as involved as we have been in \nworld affairs, including commitments to our allies and commitments that \nwe have voted for at the U.N. Security Council.\n  This complete offset policy sounds good in speeches but it has very \nserious implications for the Department of Defense. Make no mistake \nabout it, this complete offset policy means the long-term capability of \nthe Department of Defense is going to go down. It does not mean that \nthe immediate readiness is going down because that can be protected.\n  But future readiness, future capability, requires\n   modernization and it requires research and development, and those \nare the programs being cut by this complete offset policy. So 5 or 10 \nyears from now, people will have a very serious problem with readiness \nif we continue to declare there is no emergency even when our forces \nare responding to the unanticipated events that we all know will take \nplace somewhere in the world from time to time.\n\n  Madam President, I also want to note that this bill contains domestic \nrescissions of about $1.5 billion. I understand that the defense \nportion of this supplemental is outlay neutral in 1995 without the \ndomestic rescissions, but that over the 5-year period the domestic \nrescissions are necessary to make the whole bill outlay neutral over \nthe long run.\n  Many of my colleagues do not support the idea of using domestic \nrescissions to offset the cost of a defense supplemental. My view is \neither we have firewalls or we do not. The Congress has cut defense to \npay for domestic supplementals in the past, so I do not see any reason \nwhy we should not look to domestic programs to offset the cost of \ndefense supplementals, especially if we are going to start adopting the \npolicy of offsetting both the budget authority and outlays of \nsupplementals.\n  I hope we decide to reinstate defense firewalls, Madam President. But \nuntil we do, I believe domestic programs should be on the table to fund \ndefense supplementals, just as defense programs have been put on the \ntable to fund domestic supplementals.\n  In 1990, for example, $2 billion in defense funds were rescinded to \nsubstantially offset the cost of a supplemental providing economic aid \nto the new democratic governments of Panama and Nicaragua as well as \nfunds for food stamps, fighting forest fires, veterans programs, and \nmany other programs.\n  That same fiscal year, discretionary spending was reduced across the \nboard to fund antidrug programs. So once again there was a net transfer \nof funds from the defense budget to the non-defense discretionary part \nof the budget.\n  I should also point out that previously the defense budget has been \nheld to a higher standard than the domestic budget. As I have already \npointed out, 70 percent of the defense funds provided in last year's \nemergency supplemental for Somalia were offset by defense rescissions. \nBut only about 25 percent of the non-defense funds provided in that \nsupplemental were offset by rescissions. If the Congress is \ncontemplating setting out a new policy for offsetting supplementals, or \nnot offsetting supplementals, I think that policy has to be fair in its \ntreatment of defense and domestic emergencies.\n\n\n                      Haiti Reporting Requirement\n\n  Madam President, I am also concerned that the requirement for a \nPresidential report on the cost and source of funds for military \nactivities in Haiti is linked to a cutoff of funds for those activities \nif the report is not submitted within 60 days after enactment of this \nact.\n  I generally oppose linking a cutoff of funds for any military \noperation to anything other than the accomplishment of the mission. If \nthe Senate opposes a military activity or operation, it should vote to \ncut off the funding. In the case of the Haiti operation, however, the \nSenate voted several times in the last session not to prohibit the \nPresident from ordering the deployment of United States forces to \nHaiti. I do not think that the Senate would be prepared to vote to \nterminate the funding for the Haiti mission now that it has been \ncarried out with such professionalism by United States forces and is in \nthe process of being turned over to a U.N. operation that will be \ncommanded by a United States general officer.\n  In this case, moreover, virtually all of the information that the \nPresident would have to provide in his report to Congress was mandated \nlast session by Public Law 103-423, a joint resolution regarding United \nStates policy toward Haiti, that was signed into law by the President \non October 25, 1994. President Clinton has now submitted four reports \npursuant to sections 2 and 3 of that legislation that call for monthly \nreports until the mission is over. Those reports were submitted to \nCongress on November 1, December 6, and December 31, 1994, and on \nFebruary 8, 1995.\n  If the President had refused to submit those reports, then perhaps it \nwould make sense to condition the continued availability of funding on \nthe submission of such reports in the future. But the President has \nbeen submitting those reports and there are no indications that he \nplans to stop submitting them.\n  I do not plan to offer an amendment to this bill to delete the cutoff \nof funding provision. I base my decision on the urgent need of the \nDepartment of Defense for this supplemental funding and my realization \nthat there will be a difficult conference with the House on this bill. \nI therefore want to avoid any action that could delay this legislation. \nThe fact that President Clinton will be able to submit the report \nrequired by this bill has minimized my concern over the funding cutoff \nprovision. But I did want to note my concern over this provision and to \nsignal my determination that this provision not serve as a precedent \nfor this type of action.\n                ef-111 system improvement program [sip]\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I would like to commend my good \nfriends, the distinguished chairman and ranking minority member of the \nDefense Subcommittee, for not including EF-111A System Improvement \nProgram [SIP] funds in the defense rescission package of the \nsupplemental funding measure now before the Senate.\n  I believe the House Committee on Appropriations acted prematurely by \nincluding EF-111A SIP funds in its version of the supplemental. As my \ncolleagues know, the EF-111A SIP has been under siege since fiscal year \n1993 when some in Congress suggested that the program duplicated the \nNavy's EA-6B Advanced Capability [ADVCAP] Program.\n  At the time, the Pentagon sharply challenged the notion that the EF-\n111 and EA-6B were duplicative. Then-Air Force Secretary Don Rice was \nquoted as saying: ``The F-111 does escort jamming as well as local area \njamming; it has the capability to keep up with the F-15E's and F-111F's \nand F-16's when they're doing interdiction missions. The EA-6B does \nnot.'' The Pentagon appeal to the fiscal year 1993 Defense \nAppropriations Conference was even more detailed:\n\n       The elimination of the EF-111 would significantly \n     compromise the U.S. ability to provide standoff jamming in \n     support of tactical air operations for two reasons. First, \n     the EF-111 and the EA-6B each have capabilities not possessed \n     by the other. Although the two jamming systems will be \n     roughly comparable following modernization, the EF-111 is, \n     and will continue to be, more capable than the EA-6B in \n     supporting deep strike missions. This is due to the EF-111's \n     significant advantage over the EA-6B in speed, range, and \n     time on station.\n       Second, even if the two platforms were comparable in all \n     respects, there is an insufficient number of EA-6B's in the \n     Navy inventory to support the mission requirements of both \n     Services. To procure additional EA-6B's to compensate for the \n     loss of the EF-111's would be much more expensive than to \n     retain and modernize the existing EF-111 inventory.\n\n  In the end, the Department of Defense was successful in reversing the \nproposed elimination of EF-111A funding. Soon thereafter, in February \n1993, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff report on the roles, \nmissions, and functions of the Armed Forces of the United States \nendorsed the retention and modernization of both the EA-6B and the EF-\n111A.\n  In retrospect, the roles and missions report was the high water mark \nof Pentagon support for the EF-111A. As my distinguished colleagues \nknow, the fiscal year 1996 defense budget request calls for the \ntermination of the EF-111A SIP program in fiscal year 1996 and \nretirement of the EF-111A fleet in fiscal year 1997. Navy EA-6B's, \naccording to the Air Force, will fill the gap \n[[Page S4066]] left by the retirement of the EF-111A fleet.\n  This plan is fatally flawed. The EA-6B ADVCAP program was canceled in \nFebruary, 1994, and the future of Navy electronic warfare has been in \nturmoil ever since. In the wake of this cancellation, the Pentagon \ncommissioned the Joint Tactical Air Electronic Warfare Study to examine \nthe relationship between the EA-6B and EF-111A and to review overall \nelectronic combat requirements.\n  I would like to ask the distinguished Defense Subcommittee chairman \nwhether the results of the joint tactical air electronic warfare study \nhave been delivered to the Congress.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will answer my colleague by saying that the results of \nthis study are long overdue and may not be available until June, 1995.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Will the distinguished chairman also agree that, until \nthe Congress has had a full opportunity to evaluate the results of this \nstudy, any proposal to eliminate EF-111 SIP funds and to retire the \nentire EF-111 fleet is extremely premature?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I certainly agree with my colleague from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. In my opinion, the bottom line is that we are being \nasked by the House to lay waste to the Air Force's support jammer \ncapability without sufficient analysis or debate. We know the Navy \noption is woefully inadequate.\n  We should ask ourselves several critical questions before we even \ndecide what to do about Air Force and Navy support jamming \nrequirements. First, what are the alternatives to the EF-111A SIP? \nSecond, if there are none, how will the termination of the SIP, and the \nretirement of the EF-111A's, affect the efficiency and survivability of \nour strike forces?\n  Does the distinguished Defense Subcommittee chairman agree that, \nuntil we can answer these questions, any suggestion of rescinding EF-\n111A SIP funds is fraught with too many risks for our national \nsecurity.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree with my colleague that terminating the EF-111 \nSIP program and planning for the retirement of the EF-111 fleet at this \ntime would be an unwise and risky course of action.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Is my colleague willing to work with me and do what he \ncan to prevail over the House in the upcoming joint conference on the \nsupplemental?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Recognizing that we have a difficult conference before \nus, and that funds are desperately short, let me assure the Senator \nfrom New York that we will do what we can in joint conference to hold \nthe Senate position and to protect his interests to the greatest extent \npossible.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I would like to raise my concerns related \nto the pending supplemental appropriations bill.\n  I certainly understand the difficulty under which the Appropriations \nCommittee must work, particularly when the budget deficit looms as \nlarge as it does.\n  But, I am concerned, Madam President, about the precedent set in this \nbill by requiring that emergency supplemental spending be fully offset.\n  In the past, Congress and the administration have agreed to allow for \nemergency spending without requiring offsets, but taking offsets in a \nmore benign manner, usually in cases where programs have been canceled \nor where contract funds were available because they could not be \nobligated during the fiscal year for which they were provided.\n  The supplemental before us takes a much different approach that bears \ndramatic consequences.\n  By requiring complete offsets from prior year funding, we really are \nnot cutting lower priority programs as a result of tight fiscal \nconstraints. We are victimizing programs basically because they are in \nslower spending accounts and their funds are still available to raid. I \nknow a number of my colleagues have expressed similar concerns and I am \nhopeful that we can craft a new method of funding future emergency \nspending.\n  I also note, Madam President, that this approach may be more easily \naccomplished in the earlier quarters of a fiscal year, but what happens \nlater in the year after we have exhausted the resources of these slower \nspending accounts?\n  Will we bring our normal planned operations, maintenance, and \ntraining to a screeching halt? Will we stop paying our troops? This is \nwhat will happen when we require the cost of contingency operations to \nbe paid from the current operating budget for operations in places like \nIraq, Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and Haiti. Shortfalls in training \nand maintenance are the very kinds of actions for which the \nadministration has been criticized and which the President's \nsupplemental request is intended to avoid.\n  I appreciate the committee's desire and attempt to impose fiscal \nresponsibility and I appreciate the committee's efforts to keep the \ntechnology reinvestment project, the so-called TRP, alive, but I don't \nbelieve we should fool ourselves that requiring complete offsets does \nnot have important implications for the overall readiness of our Armed \nForces.\n  The effect of this bill, Madam President, is to reduce current \ndefense spending by $1.9 billion. This is particularly curious, Madam \nPresident, at a time when the majority, in its Contract With America, \ncalls for additional spending to ensure readiness.\n  Today's supplemental eats our seed corn in a number of important \nareas. This bill will cut over $500 million from defense research and \ndevelopment programs. To me, research and development ensures the \nNation's future readiness. Make no mistake, yesterday's investment in \nR is what is winning today's battles. It is short sighted, in my \nview, to downplay or overlook the critical research and development \nplays in our overall readiness.\n  I would like to take a moment, to direct my comments to two programs \nthat have been embroiled in the debate over how to fund this \nsupplemental request. They are the TRP Program and the Department of \nCommerce's Advanced Technology Program. I am very much relieved that \nthe committee did not take the same kind of draconian cuts the House \nmade and I urge the committee to maintain its position on these \nprograms in conference with the House.\n  I, like virtually every other Member of this body, have been a strong \nsupporter of the technology reinvestment project [TRP]. When Congress \nfirst crafted this program in 1992, incorporating the recommendations \nof both the Democratic and the Republican task forces on defense \nconversion, the program received virtually universal support.\n  Several Members on both sides of the aisle came to the floor to \nexpress their support for the program and the amendment providing \nfunding for the program was adopted by a vote of 91 to 2. To suggest \nnow that TRP funding is not a high priority is to forget the level of \nsupport this program has enjoyed.\n  It is not surprising either because the TRP is an innovative, and I \nmight add a more cost effective, way for the Department of Defense to \nmeet its research and development requirements. The Defense Department \nhas always spent a portion of its R funds on dual-use technologies, \nnotwithstanding recent claims that funding for dual-use technologies is \nsome sort of a handout.\n  The truth of the matter is that DOD will continue to be involved in \ndeveloping dual-use technologies, because one of the uses in any given \ndual-use technology is its military use.\n  The operative question becomes how do we go about developing this \ndual-use technology that the military needs. The military can pay the \nfull freight and develop it on its own as it has in the past. Or, the \nmilitary can try to get the private sector to pay for half of it, since \nthe dual-use technology also will have a commercial application.\n  It seems simple to me. Do we want to pay full price or half price? I \nprefer to take advantage of the discount. TRP is not a subsidy or grant \nprogram for contractors. If anything, it is like a reverse subsidy for \nDOD, Mr. President.\n  Just one example bears this out. The uncooled infrared rifle sight \ntechnology under development through TRP funding will help soldiers \nlocate and engage the enemy in bad weather. In the private sector, it \ncan be used by industry to detect energy losses in houses and \nbuildings.\n  Under a TRP funded, dual use approach the military's goal is to \nreduce \n[[Page S4067]] the unit price from about $100,000 to less than $10,000 \nper unit, by tapping into the potential commercial market which is 10 \ntimes larger than the military requirement. Without TRP, the military \ncould pay 10 times more for the same technology.\n  TRP funding is a small investment, accounting for less than two-\ntenths of 1 percent of this year's Defense budget request. Yet, it \nleverages those defense dollars through industry cost-sharing and it \ncould yield significant benefits to long-term military readiness. To \nkill the technology reinvestment project, as the House bill would do, \nwould be like killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. It just does \nnot make sense.\n  Madam President, my concern about efforts to erode government-\nindustry joint efforts to develop next-generation technology extends to \nthe House-passed $107 million rescission of funds for the Advanced \nTechnology Program [ATP].\n  ATP is cost-shared, industry-led, competitively awarded R which \npursues cutting edge technologies with strong potential for later \ncommercial success but technology that presently is too risky or too \nlong term to be pursued by industry alone.\n  Like TRP, ATP was developed with strong bipartisan support in the \nCongress. ATP is intended to capitalize on America's strength in \nresearch and development to create jobs and economic growth, and \nincrease our competitiveness in the global economy. While I believe any \ncut in these critical technology programs is extraordinarily short-\nsighted, at least the Senate has reduced the amount of the rescission \nto $32 million; I urge my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to \ndo everything they can to maintain the Senate position in conference.\n  Finally, Madam President, I cannot yield the floor without expressing \nmy concern over the cuts taken in both the Defense Environmental \nRestoration Account and the Department of Energy's Environmental \nManagement Program. A number of my colleagues have identified \nenvironmental cleanup as lower priority spending that could be used for \nother programs. This is terribly wrong headed Mr. President. I hope \nthat the cuts taken in this supplemental do not signal the beginning of \na full scale assault on these important programs in the future.\n  Both DOD and DOE have legal obligations to clean up their facilities. \nWe already know that failure to meet cleanup milestones will result in \nfines and penalties. In addition, for DOE, the cost to cleanup will \nincrease substantially simply by virtue of the delay. I intend to \naddress this issue at greater length in a separate statement. Like the \nmechanic in the transmission commercial, you can either pay me now or \nyou can pay me later. But, it will cost more later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I want to comment on an important \naspect of the debates that took place to develop the legislation \napproved today, and which I believe is directly related to the kind of \nmilitary security, growing economy, and strong job base that Americans \nshould be able to count on.\n  I am referring to the work of the programs within the Department of \nCommerce, the Department of Defense, and other parts of the Federal \nGovernment that serve as partners with industry to spur advances in \ntechnology. My belief in these programs is very basic. Knowing what the \ninvestment in technology that our foreign competitors are making and \nthe role that technology plays in expanding industries and high-wage \njobs in our own country, I view these programs as an essential key to \nthe economic security that West Virginians and the rest of the American \npeople should expect Congress to work toward.\n  For awhile, it appeared that this appropriations package would be \nused to cripple some of the most important technology programs in our \npublic arsenal. But thanks to the efforts of many of my colleagues, and \nI am privileged to work closely with a group of them, we were fairly \nsuccessful in reminding the Senate that a retreat from technology \ninvestments is a dangerous course in military and economic terms.\n  In fact, I was pleased to see the Senate approve the Sense of the \nSenate resolution, offered by Senators Bingaman and Nunn and which I \ncosponsored, that expresses a continued commitment to the development \nof dual-use technologies to be used by both the military and the \nprivate sector.\n  These kinds of private-public partnerships, including the Technology \nReinvestment Project [TRP] and the Advanced Technology Program [ATP], \nchart the course we should be taking for a strong military and economic \nfuture. This concept is at the heart of the President's technology \npolicy, and is the most cost effective way to employ the ever-shrinking \nFederal dollar in a way that maximizes our Federal dollars to the \nbenefit of both the public and the private sector.\n  To understand these kinds of partnerships, and the value of the TRP \nand the ATP, we need to look first at the Advanced Research Projects \nAgency [ARPA], which was set up nearly 40 years ago by President \nEisenhower. I think we can all agree that ARPA is one of the big \nsuccess stories to come out of the military-industrial complex over the \nyears. Aside from technologies it helped develop that our armed \nservices rely on today, things like stealth, the Global Positioning \nSystem and smart weapons, it is also one of the parents to some of the \ntechnologies that the people of America take for granted in their daily \nlives, things as varied as a desktop computer is from the laser in a CD \nplayer.\n  I want to also remind my colleagues that the Internet, which is at \nthe heart of the information super highway America is discovering, was \noriginally known as ARPAnet. All of these technological breakthroughs \nwere developed for the military, but have now been spun off into our \ndaily lives. That is what the TRP, and the ATP, are about.\n  It is about something even greater. We do not spend taxpayers' hard-\nearned dollars on the TRP just because of what it does for the economy. \nIt is housed in the Department of Defense because of its direct role in \nmilitary readiness and the strength of our defense. Increasingly, \ncutting edge technology is not being developed in the military \nindustrial complex, it is coming out of the private sector. The TRP \nprogram, and other public-private partnership give the Federal \nGovernment, and in the case of the TRP, the Department of Defense, \naccess to the brain power and resources of our best civilian \ntechnologists. It is becoming less an issue of spin-offs and more an \nissue of spin-ons.\n  We all know that great advances in computing came as spin-offs from \nDOD programs, but today the leading minds, the human and material \nresources, are in the private sector. Programs like the TRP give the \nmilitary the chance to work with those minds and develop software and \napplications in conjunction with the private sector, where most of the \ninnovation is happening. Then we can spin those technologies invented \nin partnership with the private sector on to military applications.\n  And let me be clear, this is not about industrial policy; picking \nwinners and losers. The private sector, in conjunction with the \nDepartment of Defense, are picking the winners. Where a program only \nhas defense applications, such as a submarine, the private sector will \nnot be interested in participating in a joint R project with the DOD. \nBut when we are developing something that will have commercial and \nmilitary applications, then the TRP can and should play a part.\n  It is a ridiculous waste of our country's private and public capital \nto duplicate our investments in research and development where the \nmilitary needs something that the private sector may be developing on \ntheir own. Frankly, we cannot afford it on either end. If last month's \nbalanced budget debate illuminated anything for the American people, it\n is that we are going to have to squeeze every last dollar we can out \nof the Federal budget. I support the deficit reduction portion of this \nbill. I do not like every line-item in the rescissions package, but \noverall, it is something we simply have to do. Likewise, the government \ncannot afford to do all the research and development on leading edge \ntechnologies that they will need to maintain the kind of fighting force \nwe all envision. But if we pool our Federal resources with the private \nsector's, then we all benefit.\n  [[Page S4068]] I want to point out just one example that demonstrates \nthe usefulness of the TRP to both the armed services and America's \nconsumers. Right now, DOD, in conjunction with private industry is \ndeveloping something called multi-chip module [MCM] technology. This \nwill allow electronic systems to work faster and more reliably while \nusing less power. DOD needs MCM's for things like precision-guidance of \nadvanced weapons and real-time signaling for intelligence activities. \nLikewise, the private sector is itching to put MCM's to use in a \nvariety of consumer products, from cars to digital signals in audio and \nvideo telecommunications. Certainly we can fund this out of our defense \nbudget, but when there is a clear private sector interest in doing this \njointly, why go it alone?\n  And this should not be a political issue. Many of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle have supported technology programs such as \nthis in the past. As has been noted by others, the basis of this sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment is former Senator Rudman's task force report of \n1992, which was endorsed by many of my current distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Stevens, McCain, Warner, and Thurmond among them.\n  I should note, that the defense supplemental portion of this package \nis breaking new ground here. This bill was submitted to the Congress \nfor emergency consideration. That is because the costs that we are \ntrying to cover were unforseen. They were unplanned activities that \nwere undertaken in our national interest.\n  Madam President, we must be fiscally responsible. But we should \nresist the fool's game of trying to outfox or out-cut one another. We \nwere elected to set priorities, to deal with current national needs and \nplan for the future. Because of the size of the Federal deficit, that \nmust include an intense effort to get our books in order. But it should \nnot be a political contest or done blindly. If we abandon the programs \nand investments designed to maintain a military and economic foundation \nfor all Americans, we will see the pain from a crumbling manufacturing \nbase and defenses after it is too late.\n  We cannot compromise our future, be it in technology, education, or \nchild nutrition, for the sake of today's political brinkmanship. We \nmust fight for what we know must be national priorities, and I will \nfight for West Virginia's. The winners will be our soldiers in the \nfield, our children and their ability to learn, the workforce needed to \nkeep this country strong. And in the case of the technology programs \ndiscussed in this statement, we want to make sure the winners include \nour indusries--and our workers--who are on the frontline of the global \neconomic battlefield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, after much thought and analysis, I have \ndecided to oppose this bill. I have made this decision for one simple \nreason: on balance, I believe this bill is bad for California and bad \nfor the Nation.\n  I support the supplemental appropriations contained in this bill, \nwhich cover the costs of unbudgeted contingencies in Somalia, Bosnia, \nand Haiti. However, I believe that these unplanned operations should \nhave been treated by the committee as emergency requirements, as \nrequested by the Department of Defense.\n  Having elected to recommend supplemental funding without the \nemergency designation, the committee was obligated to find offsetting \nrescissions. Regrettably, the committee has recommended for rescission \nin this bill programs that are vital to the defense of our country and \nto the economic security of the State of California. The cuts made in \nenvironmental cleanup programs and in research and development programs \nlike the Technology Reinvestment Project, or TRP, are wrong for this \ncountry and wrong for California. I cannot support these reckless cuts, \nMadam President, and I will not.\n  This bill contains a $300 million rescission for DERA, the Defense \nEnvironmental Restoration Account--twice the cut passed by the House.\n  What would this rescission mean for the State of California?\n  At the Marine Corps Logistics Base in Barstow, efforts to clean \ncontaminated groundwater could be delayed. Soil contaminated with heavy \nmetals, petroleum hydrocarbons, pesticides, and herbicides may not be \nremoved.\n  At the Concord Naval Weapons Station in the bay area, cutting DERA \nmeans delaying cleanup on polluted tidal and inland areas. If this \nrescission is enacted, contaminated water and soil may sit idle so we \ncan say we did the responsible thing by ensuring that every dollar in \nthis bill was offset by a rescission somewhere else in the Pentagon \nbudget. But that's not really the responsible thing. The responsible \nthing to do is not create an environmental hazard in the first place, \nbut if you do, you clean it up, and you clean it up fast.\n  I want to make a final point on this DERA rescission. Earlier this \nmonth, the Department of Defense announced which military bases it \nwants to close in the 1995 BRAC round. California was hit again. One \nmajor base was recommended for closure and several other installations \nface realignment. I will fight hard for those bases and get their \npositive stories out. But if those\n installations stay on the list, I want the contaminated sites at those \nbases cleaned up as fast as possible so the communities can do \nsomething productive with that land.\n\n  In the 1995 base closure round, unlike previous rounds, environmental \ncleanup will be funded by the DERA account. That is the very same \naccount that this bill proposes cutting by $300 million.\n  So I would say to all Senators, if you have a base in your State that \nmay be scheduled for closure this year, think long and hard about \ncutting $300 million from the Department's primary environmental \ncleanup account. Believe me, you do not want to find yourself in a \nsituation where the military is moving out, but the community cannot \nmove in because of environmental contamination. California has been in \nthat situation too often, and it is very, very unpleasant.\n  The Senate considered an amendment last week offered by Senator \nMcCain to reduce the rescission in this bill for environmental cleanup \nfunding by increasing the cut for the Technology Reinvestment Project, \nor TRP. I opposed that amendment not because of the DERA increase--\nwhich I support--but because of the draconian TRP cut. That amendment \npresented the Senate with an impossible choice: allow deep rescissions \nin DERA or kill the Technology Reinvestment Project outright.\n  However, even without the McCain amendment, this bill rescinds $200 \nmillion from the Technology Reinvestment Project. To be sure, this is \nbetter than the House rescission of $500 million, which would kill the \nprogram, but the Senate rescission will badly damage this critically \nneeded program.\n  Research and development is the key to maintaining our military \nadvantage in the future. But the Department of Defense can no longer \nafford to maintain its own private research industrial base. We must \ngain access to the commercial technology sector, which in many ways out \nperforms the defense technology base. We must gain access to this \ncommercial technology in the most cost effective way possible--ensuring \nthe public the greatest value for its tax dollar.\n  The TRP achieves these goals. Let me cite just one example. The TRP \nhas funded a proposal led by the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit \nDistrict to develop an advanced automated train control system. Like \nall TRP projects, this grant is matched at least 50-50 by the private \nsector. For every dollar the government spends, the consortium led by \nBART spends at least one dollar.\n  This technology currently being developed by the BART will allow \nsystem operators to know exactly where there trains are--even \nunderground in tunnels. This allows trains to operate more safely and \nin closer proximity. Reducing separation distance between trains allows \nthe BART to have more cars in service at the same time, which doubles \npassenger carrying capacity.\n  Critics of the TRP complain vociferously about projects like the BART \ntrain control system. ``What has that got to do with national \nsecurity?'', they say.\n  The BART train control system has everything to do with national \nsecurity. This project is based on the Army's Enhanced Position \nLocation Reporting System, which is designed to enable commanders on \nthe battlefield \n[[Page S4069]] to collect vital information about the location of \ntroops in real time. The National Economic Council estimates that the \ntechnology developed by the BART's TRP project may improve the Enhanced \nPosition Locator and at the same time, reduce its cost by up to 40 \npercent.\n  So what does this TRP project do for our country? For private \nindustry, it provides a chance to break into a market dominated by \nforeign companies, perhaps creating thousands of American jobs and \nstrengthening our economy. For the Department of Defense, it offers a \nbetter and cheaper way to collect battlefield information in real \ntime--information that may save soldiers' lives. And for the people of \nSan Francisco, this project provides safer, faster, and more efficient \npublic transportation. This TRP grant creates a win-win-win situation--\none that is being duplicated with similar projects around the country.\n  The TRP is a model dual-use program. It should be expanded and \nemulated, not cut to the point that its very existence is jeopardized.\n  To offset the supplemental appropriations made in this bill, the \ncommittee has recommended rescinding environmental cleanup, the TRP and \nother high priority projects. I find it difficult to believe that less \nimportant offsets could not be found in the $260 billion Pentagon \nbudget. Consider this: the Congressional Budget Office estimates that \nat the end of fiscal year 1995, more than $19 billion will remain \nunobligated in the Pentagon's procurement accounts.\n  Surely, that $19 billion fund is large enough to offset the funds \nthis bill would cut from environmental cleanup and the TRP. Simply \ncutting unobligated procurement funds by 3 percent would generate more \nthan enough savings to offset the TRP and environmental cleanup \nrescission contained in this bill.\n  I hope that when this bill is considered in conference committee, the \nSenate managers will take a very close look at these unobligated \naccounts and try to find a way to minimize the damage done to the very \nimportant TRP and DERA accounts.\n  I also want to serve notice, Madam President, to those who would \neliminate all defense reinvestment and environmental cleanup in the \nPentagon budget. That must not happen.\n  Defense reinvestment must remain a national priority for the security \nof our country and our communities. Environmental cleanup is the moral, \nethical, and in many cases, legal responsibility of the Department of \nDefense, and its must continue.\n  When the Senate debates the budget in the spring and when it debates \nthe annual defense bills later in the year, these issues will certainly \nbe revisited. Rest assured that I and other concerned Senators will \ncontinue to voice their strong support for these vitally needed \nprograms.\n  Finally Madam President, I must express my profound disappointment \nthat the Senate accepted an amendment offered by Senator Hutchison to \nrescind funding needed to protect endangered species.\n  This amendment is an irresponsible approach to some very real \nproblems. It is clearly a first step in a piecemeal dismantling of the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  It is important to note that this amendment was offered while the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works was diligently working on a \nbill offered by the Senator from Texas that was substantially similar \nto her amendment. I believe that the wiser course would have been to \nwork cooperatively with the committee, under the able leadership of \nSenator Chafee, to find a mutually satisfactory solution to this \nimportant problem.\n  The rescission of $1.5 million from the Fish and Wildlife Service \nlisting budget for 1995, combined with the restriction on remaining \nfunds, effectively kills the Endangered Species Act listing process for \n1995. This could cause some species to become extinct and surely will \ndelay solving the very real problems that need attention. This is a \nirresponsible action, which I strongly oppose.\n  For all these reasons, I must oppose this bill.\n                              project elf\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, this bill marks a milestone for \nWisconsin by rescinding funds for Project ELF, a Navy communications \nsystem located in Clam Lake, WI, and Republic, MI. This is one cut that \nthe local congressional delegation will not oppose. In fact, I think \nmost of us welcome it.\n  In the last two Congresses. I have introduced legislation to \nterminate Project ELF. Senator Kohl has joined me in those efforts, as \nwell as in letters to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment \nCommission, the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of Defense, and \nthe relevant congressional committees urging ELF's termination. \nCongressman David Obey has been a consistent opponent of Project ELF \nthroughout his congressional tenure, and indeed is responsible for \nkeeping down the initial size of the program. Representatives from \nnearby areas have also been helpful in our quest. I am pleased that the \nSenate will take the first step, the first real action, toward finally \nterminating this outdated and effective program.\n  The concept of extremely low frequency communications emerged when \nsubmarines started going so far beneath the surface ordinary radios \ncould not reach them. In 1968, the Pentagon proposed the first version \nof ELF communications in Project Sanguine. It was to be 6,200 miles of \ncable buried underground, along with 100 ELF transmitter towers spread \nout over 40 percent of northern Wisconsin. It had to be built in \nWisconsin because of unique granite bedrock which would not interfere \nwith ELF signals. Project Sanguine was supposed to communicate with \nTrident submarines, and was designed to survive a nuclear attack. When \nresidents became aware of it, the project was scuttled.\n  In 1975, Project Sanguine came back as Project Seafarer. Seafarer was \nnot supposed to have nuclear survivability, but would have above-ground \ntransmitters with underground cables. As Project Seafarer, though, ELF \ncommunications lost their wartime efficacy. In fact, an ad hoc ELF \nreview group of the Secretary of Defense advised that a small ELF \nsystem would be of marginal utility and was not credible as an ultimate \nELF system. However, it recommended that building a small ELF was \nbetter than building no ELF at all because the modified version would \nprovide a basis for future system growth if ELF requirements later \nincreased. This was a typical bureaucratic foot in the door program.\n  Again, due to public concern and budget pressures, President Carter \nterminated Seafarer in 1978 and directed further studies on how to \nproceed with ELF. Congressman Obey was successful in fencing off funds \nin fiscal year 1979 until the President certified that ELF was in the \nnational interest and that it had found a place to be built.\n  There was yet another scaled-down ELF system called Austere ELF that \nhad been proposed in 1977. It would have been a single transmitter \nlocated at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base in Michigan. Once it began \ndevelopment, Austere ELF was again in trouble with resident resistance \nand budget constraints. After a few years of misguided attempts and \nfalse starts, the Secretary of the Navy, John Lehman, recommended to \nthe Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, that the ELF communication \nsystem be shelved.\n  Secretary Lehman was overruled, though, and the Reagan administration \nordered the development of a scaled down system called Project ELF in \n1981. In its present scaled down version, ELF consists of 28 miles of \ncable at Clam Lake and 56 miles of cable at Republic. ELF was initially \nordered operational in 1985, and was fully functional by 1987.\n  Scaled down Project ELF was supposed to cost $230 million for \ndevelopment and construction. However, in an October 1993 letter to \nSenator Nunn, the Pentagon said it had invested nearly $600 million in \nELF. In a January 1994 report on ELF, the Navy said that ELF costs \napproximately $15 to $16 million a year in operating costs.\n  If ELF served a strategic purpose, this would not be a significant \ninvestment. But Project ELF is ineffective and at best obsolete. For \nthat reason, it is millions of dollars which can find a better use. \nThroughout its history, ELF has never found a mission fit for its \ntimes.\n  The Navy officially states that ELF is simply a communications \nsystem \n[[Page S4070]] which tells a Trident to come to surface in order to \nreceive a message; in effect, ELF is a bell ringer. If this was ever \nthe true purpose, ELF is a faulty mechanism for that.\n  First, the bell ringer is supposed to protect the Tridents from \ndetection by permitting them to surface on the call of a signal that \nthey had a longer message awaiting them. Yet if they have to rise to \nthe surface to receive their message, then they are at risk of \ndetection before executing any order ELF would tell them to retrieve. \nELF itself cannot execute an order.\n  Second, ELF has no reliable second strike or counterforce \ncommunication capability in any instance. It also cannot be counted on \nto communicate with a submarine during a crisis since its large size \nmakes it extremely susceptible to conventional or nuclear attack. Thus, \nit is not dependable retaliatory action.\n  Further, if ELF were to be destroyed during attack, then subs would \nbe required to use their antennae at or near the surface, and receive \ntheir messages through LF/VLF. But in the case of a crisis, submarines \nshould be brought closer to the surface anyway, not only for better \ncommunications, but also because missiles cannot be launched from such \ndepths as ELF reaches.\n  Finally, ELF is one-way communications system, so submarines cannot \nsend messages back.\n  Thus, Project ELF's utility appears only to be in a pre-war \ndisposition, and only for one purpose: to serve only as a triggering \nsignal for a first-strike launch. This is a capability we are \ndismantling. So, ELF's mere presence is far more provocative than its \nutility warrants.\n  I should also mention that ELF's environmental impact may be quite \ndamaging. Though no studies have conclusively found that ELF radiowaves \nare dangerous to residents in outlying areas, the research that has \nbeen done does little to comfort those living near Project ELF. A 1992 \nSwedish study found that children living near relatively weak magnetic \nwaves such as those emanating from ELF are four times more likely to \ndevelop leukemia. I certainly understand any fears Wisconsin residents \nmust have. In fact, in 1984, a U.S. District court, ruling on State of \nWisconsin versus Weinberger, order Project ELF to be shut down because \nthe Navy paid inadequate attention to ELF's possible health effects and \nviolated the National Environmental Policy Act. An appeals court, \nthough, threw out the ruling arguing that the national security threat \nfrom the Soviets at the time was more important. Clearly, the premise \nof that ruling is no longer valid given the collapse of the U.S.S.R.\n  For all these reasons, I am pleased that after trying to justify \nELF's mission in the post-cold war world, the Navy is finally letting \nit go. Project ELF never made U.S. submarines invulnerable, and it \ndoesn't make them invulnerable today. ELF is not worth any money \nbecause it doesn't have a purpose.\n  If it is a first-strike weapon, then it is destabilizing and \nthreatening, which hardly increases our security. If it is merely a \ncommunication system, it is inadequate. A weapon or communications \ndevice designed to keep deeply submerged submarines submerged is no \nlonger necessary. ELF was built for war, not peace. It is not guarding \nagainst any capable enemy now, but is sucking up money that could be.\n  I am pleased that the committee has recognized this, and recommended \nits termination in this rescission bill. I hope we will hold the cut in \nconference, and that, finally, this weapon, which has long been in \nsearch of a mission, is terminated.\n                           amendment no. 336\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Madam President, I regret that I was unable to be \nrecorded on the vote on Senator Hutchison's amendment concerning the \nEndangered Species Act. I would like to declare for the Record that, \nhad I been present, I would have opposed--strongly opposed--the \nHutchison amendment.\n  This amendment amounts to major legislation. This is not some little \nadjustment. There is little subtlety here. And, there is little doubt \nthat this amendment has nothing to do with the task at hand, which is \nto provide supplemental appropriations to the Department of Defense and \nto cut Government spending.\n  I understand the call for reform of the Endangered Species Act. I \nhave heard many allegations of abuse and bureaucratic overreach. But \nthe Hutchison amendment is not reform. It solves no problems. It does \nnot belong on this bill and it does not reflect well on the Senate or \nthe majority to legislate in such a cavalier fashion.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I have been told that we are now ready \nfor final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF SENATE ON SOUTH KOREA TRADE BARRIERS TO \n                   UNITED STATES BEEF AND PORK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has approximately 37,000 military \n     personnel stationed in South Korea and spent over \n     $2,000,000,000 last year to preserve peace on the Korean \n     peninsula.\n       (2) The United States Trade Representative has initiated a \n     section 301 investigation against South Korea for its \n     nontariff trade barriers on United States beef and pork.\n       (3) The barriers cited in the section 301 petition include \n     government-mandated shelf-life requirements, lengthy \n     inspection and customs procedures, and arbitrary testing \n     requirements that effectively close the South Korean market \n     to such beef and pork.\n       (4) United States trade and agriculture officials are in \n     the process of negotiating with South Korea to open South \n     Korea's market to United States beef and pork.\n       (5) The United States meat industry estimates that South \n     Korea's nontariff trade barriers on United States beef and \n     pork cost United States businesses more than $240,000,000 in \n     lost revenue last year and could account for more than \n     $1,000,000,000 in lost revenue to such business by 1999 if \n     South Korea's trade practices on such beef and pork are left \n     unchanged.\n       (6) The United States beef and pork industries are a vital \n     part of the United States economy, with operations in each of \n     the 50 States.\n       (7) Per capita consumption of beef and pork in South Korea \n     is currently twice that of such consumption in Japan. Given \n     that the Japanese are currently the leading importers of \n     United States beef and pork, South Korea holds the potential \n     of becoming an unparalleled market for United States beef and \n     pork.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the security relationship between the United States and \n     South Korea is essential to the security of the United \n     States, South Korea, the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of \n     the world;\n       (2) the efforts of the United States Trade Representative \n     to open South Korea's market to United States beef and pork \n     deserve support and commendation; and\n       (3) The United States Trade Representative should continue \n     to insist upon the removal of South Korea's nontariff \n     barriers to United States beef and pork.\n       (7)Page 16 after line 12 insert:\n       Sec. 116. (a)(1) The Senate finds that the Treaty on the \n     Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, hereinafter referred to \n     as the NPT, is the cornerstone of the global nuclear \n     nonproliferation regime;\n       (2) That, with more than 170 parties, the NPT enjoys the \n     widest adherence of any arms control agreement in history;\n       (3) That the NPT sets the fundamental legal and political \n     framework for prohibiting all forms of nuclear \n     nonproliferation;\n       (4) That the NPT provides the fundamental legal and \n     political foundation for the efforts through which the \n     nuclear arms race was brought to an end and the world's \n     nuclear arsenals are being reduced as quickly, safely and \n     securely as possible;\n       (5) That the NPT spells out only three extension options: \n     indefinite extension, extension for a fixed period, or \n     extension for fixed periods;\n       (6) That any temporary or conditional extension of the NPT \n     would require a dangerously slow and unpredictable process of \n     re-ratification that would cripple the NPT;\n       (7) That it is the policy of the President of the United \n     States to seek indefinite and unconditional extension of the \n     NPT: Now, therefore;\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) indefinite and unconditional extension of the NPT would \n     strengthen the global nuclear nonproliferation regime;\n       (2) indefinite and unconditional extension of the NPT is in \n     the interest of the United States because it would enhance \n     international peace and security;\n       (3) the President of the United States has the full support \n     of the Senate in seeking the indefinite and unconditional \n     extension of the NPT;\n       (4) all parties to the NPT should vote to extend the NPT \n     unconditionally and indefinitely; and\n       (5) parties opposing indefinite and unconditional extension \n     of the NPT are acting against their own interest, the \n     interest of the United States and the interest of all the \n     peoples of the world by placing the nuclear nonproliferation \n     regime and global security at risk.\n       (8)Page 16 after line 12 insert:\n       Sec. 117. National Test Facility.--It is the sense of the \n     Senate that the National Test Facility provides important \n     support to strategic and theater missile defense in the \n     following areas--\n       (a) United States-United Kingdom defense planning;\n       (b) the PATRIOT and THAAD programs;\n       (c) computer support for the Advanced Research Center; and\n       (d) technical assistance to theater missile defense;\n     and fiscal year 1995 funding should be maintained to ensure \n     retention of these priority functions.\n       (9)Page 16 after line 12 insert:\n       Sec. 118. (a) In determining the amount of funds available \n     for obligation from the Environmental Restoration, Defense, \n     account in fiscal year 1995 for environmental restoration at \n     the military installations described in subsection (b), the \n     Secretary of Defense shall not take into account the \n     rescission from the account set forth in section 106.\n       (b) Subsection (a) applies to military installations that \n     the Secretary recommends for closure or realignment in 1995 \n     under section 2903(c) of the Defense Base Closure and \n     Realignment Act of 1990 (subtitle A of title XXIX of Public \n     Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note).\n       (10)Page 16 after line 12 insert:\n                               CHAPTER II\n\n       Foreign Operations,

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Mexico is an important neighbor and trading partner of \n     the United States;\n       (2) on January 31, 1995, the President approved a program \n     of assistance to Mexico, in the form of swap facilities and \n     securities guarantees in the amount of $20,000,000,000, using \n     the Exchange Stabilization Fund;\n       (3) the program of assistance involves the participation of \n     the Federal Reserve System, the International Monetary Fund, \n     the Bank of International Settlements, the World Bank, the \n     Inter-American Development Bank, the Bank of Canada, and \n     several Latin American countries;\n       (4) the involvement of the Exchange Stabilization Fund and \n     the Federal Reserve System means that United States taxpayer \n     funds will be used in the assistance effort to Mexico;\n       (5) assistance provided by the International Monetary Fund, \n     the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank may \n     require additional United States contributions of taxpayer \n     funds to those entities;\n       (6) the immediate use of taxpayer funds and the potential \n     requirement for additional future United States contributions \n     of taxpayer funds necessitates Congressional oversight of the \n     disbursement of funds; and\n       (7) the efficacy of the assistance to Mexico is contingent \n     on the pursuit of sound economic policy by the Government of \n     Mexico.\n\n     SEC. 403. REPORTS REQUIRED.\n\n       (a) Reports.--Not later than April 1, 1995, and every month \n     thereafter, the President shall transmit a report to the \n     appropriate congressional committees concerning all United \n     States Government loans, credits, and guarantees to, and \n     short-term and long-term currency swaps with, Mexico.\n       (b) Contents of Reports.--The report described in \n     subsection (a) shall include the following:\n       (1) A description of the current condition of the Mexican \n     economy.\n       (2) Information regarding the implementation and the extent \n     of wage, price, and credit controls in the Mexican economy.\n       (3) A complete documentation of Mexican taxation policy and \n     any proposed changes to such policy.\n       (4) A description of specific actions taken by the \n     Government of Mexico during the preceding month to further \n     privatize the economy of Mexico.\n       (5) A list of planned or pending Mexican Government \n     regulations affecting the Mexican private sector.\n       (6) A summary of consultations held between the Government \n     of Mexico and the Department of the Treasury, the \n     International Monetary Fund, or the Bank of International \n     Settlements.\n       (7) A full description of the activities of the Mexican \n     Central Bank, including the reserve positions of the Mexican \n     Central Bank and data relating to the functioning of Mexican \n     monetary policy.\n       (8) The amount of any funds disbursed from the Exchange \n     Stabilization Fund pursuant to the approval of the President \n     issued on January 31, 1995.\n       (9) A full disclosure of all financial transactions, both \n     inside and outside of Mexico, made during the preceding month \n     involving funds disbursed from the Exchange Stabilization \n     Fund and the International Monetary Fund, including \n     transactions between--\n       (A) individuals;\n       (B) partnerships;\n       (C) joint ventures; and\n       (D) corporations.\n     [[Page S4074]]   (10) An accounting of all outstanding United \n     States Government loans, credits, and guarantees provided to \n     the Government of Mexico, set forth by category of financing.\n       (11) A detailed list of all Federal Reserve currency swaps \n     designed to support indebtedness of the Government of Mexico, \n     and the cost or benefit to the United States Treasury from \n     each such transaction.\n       (12) A description of any payments made during the \n     preceding month by creditors of Mexican petroleum companies \n     into the petroleum finance facility established to ensure \n     repayment of United States loans or guarantees.\n       (13) A description of any disbursement during the preceding \n     month by the United States Government from the petroleum \n     finance facility.\n       (14) Once payments have been diverted from PEMEX to the \n     United States Treasury through the petroleum finance \n     facility, a description of the status of petroleum deliveries \n     to those customers whose payments were diverted.\n       (15) A description of the current risk factors used in \n     calculations concerning Mexican repayment of indebtedness.\n       (16) A statement of the progress the Government of Mexico \n     has made in reforming its currency and establishing an \n     independent central bank or currency board.\n\n     SEC. 404.

Mr. President, today President Clinton announced his \nproposal for reinventing environmental, food and drug regulations. I \ncertainly want to welcome President Clinton to the regulatory reform \ndebate. Easing the burdens of compliance is a welcome first step, but \nmisses the point that real reform means getting rid of unnecessary and \noverburdensome regulations.\n  President Clinton is trying to have it both ways. On the one hand, \nhis limited proposals are consistent with legislation I have introduced \non regulatory reform. On the other, he sent his administrator of EPA to \nCapitol Hill last week to denounce our common sense reform bill as \nrolling back 20 years of environmental protection and to reel off wild \nhorror stories that are an obvious misreading of what we are trying to \ndo.\n  On February 21, President Clinton specifically instructed the Federal \nregulators ``to go over every single regulation and cut those \nregulations which are obsolete.'' President Clinton's proposal does not \nmeet that test--his proposal is no substitute for eliminating \nunnecessary regulations that stifle productivity, innovation and \nindividual initiative. That is exactly the kind of reform the American \npeople are looking for, and the kind of reform our comprehensive \nregulatory reform act will provide.\n  What I am looking for is real common sense when regulations are \nneeded. Commonsense regulations that will not require fines for not \nchecking the right box, regulations that do not define all farm ponds \nas wetlands and regulations that will not create significant burdens \nfor small businesses and communities.\n  Americans are demanding that we get government off their backs by \neliminating unnecessary regulations and applying some common sense \nbefore enacting regulations that are necessary. President Clinton's \nproposal today, while welcome, does not address this fundamental \nproblem. I invite him to work with us to pass meaningful regulatory \nreform.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/16/senate-section/article/S4074-4", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4074-S4080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE LINE-ITEM VETO\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we begin discussion and debate on the \nline-item veto, I would like to express my appreciation to the majority \nleader for his assistance in gathering together people who have very \ndifferent views on this very volatile issue. The majority leader and \nhis staff assistant, Sheila Burke, have worked night and day to get a \nconsensus amongst Republicans. I believe that we on this side of the \naisle look forward to a unanimous vote--at least on cloture. I do not \nthink that, at least some time ago, that many observers believed that \nwas possible. I believe it is probable now.\n   [[Page S4075]] Mr. President, I would also like to express my \nappreciation to Senator Domenici, who has a very longstanding \ninvolvement in this issue. He has some very strongly held views. But \nmost importantly, Senator Domenici has been very important in shaping a \ncompromise. Most of all, I would like to thank my friend from Indiana, \nSenator Coats, who has been my partner for many, many years on this \nissue. He has worked very hard. He has done, I think, a magnificent \njob, and I am very proud that he and I have been able to engage in this \nkind of partnership, which I believe will fundamentally change the way \nthe Government does business and will fundamentally bring about changes \nand a restoration, frankly, of confidence on the part of the American \npeople as to how their tax dollars are spent.\n  Mr. President, there are many ways to interpret the election of \nNovember 8. There is no doubt in my mind, and in most observers' minds, \nthat an overwhelming message was sent that the American people do not \nhave confidence in their Government in Washington, and part and parcel \nof that lack of confidence is the way that we spend their tax dollars. \nFodder for talk shows across America today is the indiscriminate pork \nbarrel, wasteful spending practice that has become a way of life and \nindeed a disease which has consumed both bodies of Congress.\n  Everyone has their favorite anecdote as to how we spend millions or \nbillions or tens of billions of dollars on frivolous or unnecessary \nprojects, frivolous or unnecessary items, that have no bearing on the \npurpose for which they are stated--but perhaps more importantly, would \nnever, ever be authorized and appropriated under the normal procedures \nthat the Senate should adhere to. What I mean by that is a hearing \nauthorization and subsequent appropriation.\n  I do not know how this vote is going to turn out at the end of a week \nor so. I am grateful that the leader has said that we intend to move to \ncloture at a fairly early point. We do not intend to drag this issue \nout. This issue is well known to every Member of this body. It \ncertainly should be. On seven different occasions in the last 8 years, \neither Senator Coats or I have brought up this measure, although we \nhave always been stymied in the past because a budget point of order \nhas lain against the amendment. The reason for that is obvious. I was \nin the minority party.\n  Now that we are in the majority, we are able to bring this measure to \nthe attention of this body.\n  And it is possible that we will not achieve 60 votes in order to cut \noff debate in order to move to amending and serious final consideration \nof the bill. I believe that we will reach 60 votes. But if we do not, I \nwant to assure my colleagues again that I will continue to pursue this \neffort until I either succeed or leave this body.\n  I want to point out an added dimension to this issue, Mr. President, \nand that is the role of the President of the United States.\n  The President of the United States, in his booklet that he put out \nwhen he ran for President in 1992, ``Putting People First,'' said a \nline-item veto is a necessary item. Let me quote, Mr. President, from \n``Putting People First,'' Governor Bill Clinton on the line-item veto:\n\n       I strongly support the line-item veto because I think it is \n     one of the most powerful weapons we could use in our fight \n     against out-of-control deficit spending.\n\n  ``In our fight against out-of-control deficit spending.''\n  Mr. President, shortly after President Clinton took office, I had a \nmeeting with him. He said, ``I look forward to working with you on the \nline item veto.'' And, I must say, in the succeeding 2 years, I was \ndisappointed that the White House refused to take a position in support \nof the line-item veto.\n  I have heard public statements since the November election on the \npart of the President of the United States. I strongly urge his \ninvolvement in this issue if he believes in it, as he said he does, and \nI do believe that he is committed to it. I look forward to his active \nparticipation in this issue because it is clear that there will have to \nbe 6 votes from that side of the aisle in order to reach the number of \n60, which is what is required in order to invoke cloture.\n  Mr. President, we have a $4 trillion debt, approaching $5 billion. We \nhave a growing budget deficit. We have misplaced priorities and, as I \nmentioned, we have a loss of public confidence and cynicism.\n  Mr. President, we are going to hear a lot of history during this \ndebate. We are going to hear about the days of the Greeks, the Roman \nEmpire, Great Britain, our earliest days. But I want to talk about \nsomething that happened a little over 20 years ago.\n  In 1974, the Congress of the United States enacted the Budget and \nImpoundment Act. The Budget and Impoundment Act basically prevented the \nPresident of the United States from impounding funds which were \nauthorized and appropriated by the Congress of the United States.\n  I understand why that happened at that time. We had a weakened \nPresidency and that President had also abused that impoundment \nauthority to the point where billions of dollars, which Congress had \nappropriately authorized and appropriated, were being impounded and not \nspent.\n  President Nixon was not the first President to do this. The first \nPresident to do this, from the record that I can find, was President \nThomas Jefferson, who impounded $50,000 that the Congress had \nappropriated for the purchase of gunboats and he impounded that money.\n  From the earliest times in our history, when impoundment was \npracticed by the President of the United States, until 1974, the \nPresident of the United States, for all intents and purposes, had a \nline-item veto power. In other words, he had the authority to not spend \nmoneys and use so-called impoundment authority. In 1974, Mr. President, \nthe Budget Impoundment Act was enacted.\n  Mr. President, it is not a coincidence--it is not a coincidence--if \nwe look at this chart, that beginning around 1974-75, the deficit began \nto rise. There obviously are a couple of valleys in it, but the overall \ntrend is not only significant but it is clearly alarming.\n  What happened, Mr. President? I think it is clear the real restraint \non the appropriations process and the appropriations of funds, which \nreally had no real fiscal governing on it, took place, and we went from \nfundamentally a rather small deficit and accumulated debt to one which, \nas we know now, is approaching $5 trillion.\n  And the bad news is, as we know, Mr. President, that as a result of \nactions taken in the last few years by Congress, there will be a \ntemporary decline in the annual deficits, but never a decline to zero. \nAnd, tragically, because of a variety of reasons, the deficit will \nstart on a very steep upward climb, and there is no end in sight of \ndeficits. And this year, Mr. President, we are going to spend more \nmoney to pay interest on the national debt than we are on national \ndefense.\n  Now, if someone had said in 1974, when a much larger proportion of \nthe budget was devoted for national defense than it is today, that 20-\nsome years later we would be paying more in interest on the national \ndebt than we are on national defense, they would have thought that we \nwere actually inhaling wrong and incorrect substances. The fact is that \nit has happened. The fact is it is approaching $5 trillion, and we are \nbeginning to hear the confidence in the American economy translated in \nthe stock market, but, most of all, translated in the strength of the \nAmerican dollar which is being eroded because of the burgeoning debt \nthat has been accumulated. And, again, as I said, there is no end in \nsight.\n  Mr. President, later next week, probably on Tuesday, the majority \nleader will be offering a substitute which will contain a couple of \nadditional items to supplement S. 4, which is the result of the \nconsensus amongst those people who are interested in the bill. Let me \nbriefly explain the details of the measure that will be proposed by the \nmajority leader.\n  It will direct the enrolling clerk to enroll each item where money is \nallocated to be spent in an appropriations bill as a separate and \ndistinct bill. This would allow the President to sign or veto each \nitem.\n  Number two, it would also mandate that any language in a report to \naccompany an appropriations bill that specifies how money be spent must \nbe \n[[Page S4076]] included in the bill itself. Further, if the report \ncontains direction on how Federal funds are to be spent and the \nlegislation itself does not, a point of order would lie against the \nbill.\n  Mr. President, this legislation would enable the President to veto \npork-barrel spending and other nonpriority spending\n  without sacrificing appropriations for important and necessary \nfunctions of the Government.\n\n  This bill would allow the President to use his constitutional right \nto veto legislation in order to prevent wasteful, unnecessary spending. \nIt is a simple, but very necessary approach to help solve the problem \nof wasteful spending in this era of crippling Federal budget deficits.\n  Mr. President, pork-barrel politics is certainly not a new phenomenon \nin our Republic. However, given the systemic damage inflected on our \neconomy by Federal deficit spending, it is unacceptable that Congress \nshould still expect the taxpayer to continue underwriting our addiction \nto pork. The political appeal of pork-barrel spending has clearly lost \nits luster as the people have come to recognize the gravity of our \nfiscal dilemma. The failure of a Speaker of the House and the chairmen \nof powerful committees to be returned to office is stark testimony to \nthe people's determination that the cost of pork-barrel spending to the \nNation greatly exceeds its value to them individually.\n  As usual, Mr. President, the people have grasped the essence of this \nFaustian bargain well in advance of Congress' common understanding of \nthe conflict between immediate political gratification and the progress \nof our civilization. Parents sacrifice for the future well-being of \ntheir children. Certainly, parents are willing to dispense with \ntemporal pleasures if payment for those pleasures would require their \nchildren to live in greatly diminished circumstances from those into \nwhich they were born. That is, of course, the Faustian bargain that \nwasteful Federal spending represents. Why is it, Mr. President, that we \nexpect American parents to prove more selfish with regard to the \nsquandering of their children's national inheritance than they are when \nhusbanding the family's wealth?\n  I know that Senators opposed to this bill will declaim eloquently on \nthe indispensable contribution that public works projects have made to \nAmerica's development as a great nation. I will not argue the fact. But \nneither will I accept that all public works projects have been \nnecessary or even defensible expenditures of public resources. Today, \nthe near insolvency of the Federal Government requires that all Federal \nspending meet much stricter standards of need than have governed \ncongressional appropriations in the past.\n  Mr. President, let us review the facts regarding our Nation's fiscal \nhealth.\n  The Federal debt is approaching $5 trillion.\n  The cost of interest on that debt is now almost $200 billion a year. \nThat is more money than the Federal Government will spend on education, \nscience, law enforcement, transportation, food stamps, and welfare \ncombined.\n  The Federal budget deficit set a record of $290 billion in 1992.\n  By 2003, the deficit is expected to leap to a staggering $653 billion \nand will have reached its largest fraction of gross domestic product in \nmore than 50 years.\n  Mr. President, it is impossible to exaggerate the urgency with which \nwe must restrain the further, reckless descent of this Nation into \nbankruptcy. Nor can we take much comfort from our past attempts at \nrestraining spending. The simple and unavoidable fact is that following \neach of the last major budget deals, the deficit increased, spending \nincreased, and taxes increased.\n  No remedy to our escalating debt proposed by Congress or the \nExecutive has been adequate to the task. Neither, Mr. President, will \nthe line-item veto--even if exercised vigorously by the President--be \nsufficient means to secure the end of deficit spending. But of this I \nam confident: without the discipline imposed on Congress by a \nPresidential line-item-veto authority, we will forever spend more money \nthan the Treasury receives in revenues. Opponents of this measure will \nresent that charge, but the examples of Congress' inability to live \nwithin the Nation's means--even in the midst of fiscal crisis--are \nsimply too numerous for me to conclude that Congress will meet its \nresponsibilities without some measured restoration of the balance of \npower between the Congress and the executive branch.\n  Mr. President, I might point out that for the last 10 years, as I \nhave been a supporter of the line-item veto, some who are perhaps a bit \ncynical have said, ``You would probably not support the line-item veto \nif it was a member of the other party who was President of the United \nStates.'' I am here on this floor today to State unequivocally, I am as \nfervently in support of a line-item veto under this President or any \nother President no matter what that President's party affiliation might \nbe.\n  Mr. President, it will be very hard to measure the exact effects of a \nline-item veto, because when a line-item veto is threatened we will \nfind a dramatic reduction in the kinds of anecdotal appropriations \nwhich have plagued this body's reputation with the American people.\n  No longer, Mr. President, will we see $2.5 million appropriated to \nstudy the effect on the ozone layer of flatulence in cows. No longer \nwill we see billions of dollars appropriated out of the defense account \non items that have nothing to do with national defense.\n  The reason for that is because before that is tucked into an \nappropriations bill, Mr. President, there is the great fear that that \npiece of pork will be exposed to the light of day by the President of \nthe United States and there will be time for something to be done about \nit. One of the great tragedies and dilemmas I faced over the years is \nthat I always seem to find out most of the egregious aspects--most, not \nall, most--of the egregious aspects of pork in appropriations bills \nafter they are passed.\n  That has to do with the system in which we do business, and perhaps, \nwith the lack of efficiency on my part. Time after time after time, I \nhave seen appropriations bills, and much to my astonishment, seen items \nin there which are egregious.\n  If it is believed that there is a strong likelihood that the \nPresident of the United States would highlight that particular item, \nsend it to the Congress of the United States with all the attendant \npublicity and veto it, and then ask the Congress of the United States \nto examine it in the light of day\n\n and debate it, I do not think we will see those kinds of examples, Mr. \nPresident.\n\n  I do not think we will see that. Time after time, we have seen the \namendment that is accepted on both sides--not read, then accepted on \nboth sides--and then placed in as a line in an appropriations bill. I \nbelieve that, and I am convinced that nowhere will we be able to total \nup how much of those will be prevented from appearing in an \nappropriations bill.\n  Ending deficit spending is, of course, a monumental undertaking that \nwill involve asking all, including many powerful coalitions, to \nsacrifice immediate and parochial rewards for the greater good of the \nNation. The line-item veto--whether it is derived from enhanced \nrescission or separate enrollment--is a small, but indispensable part \nof real budgetary reform.\n  Mr. President, if we are to take control of the budget process we \nmust change the process. We must restore what has come to be an \nimbalance in the checks and balances between the executive and \nlegislative branches, and we must balance the power between the \ncongressional authorizing committees and the Appropriations Committee.\n  Now is the time to rise above jurisdictional rivalries and political \nturf wars. We must avoid letting institutional pride deprive the Nation \nof an effective response to the critical problems clouding our future. \nAnd most importantly, we must stop the microscopic focus on local wants \nand desires to the exclusion of national needs. Now, Mr. President, is \nthe time for statesmen who--for the sake of the Nation which our \nchildren will inherit--are prepared to relinquish some of the personal \npower they have accrued through their service to the Nation.\n  We must reinstitute budgetary restraint and take firm action to \ncontrol \n[[Page S4077]] spending. This will involve implementing specific \nstrategies and standing behind a commitment to decrease spending--no \nmatter what the political climate. This will involve accepting one set \nof budgetary goals and not allowing them to float or be adjusted.\n  Mr. President, one glaring example of our failure to resolutely \nadhere to spending discipline is the alteration-beyond-all-recognition \nof the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit targets. The Congress had sought \nwhen it passed the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act to impose mandatory \nspending caps on the Congress. During recent years, however, these \nfixed budget targets have become relaxed and are now meaningless.\n  Mr. President, when push came to shove, the Congress allowed these \nceilings to be altered. Due to the pressure of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings on \nthe Congress to curtail its deficit spending, the Congress curtailed \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings. As a result, the 1990 Budget Act was passed and \nnew higher targets were established.\n  Now, 4 years into that agreement, deficits and domestic spending are \nbeing allowed to increase without penalty, despite the massive cuts in \ndefense and huge tax increases. The problem of ending the deficit, \nalthough mentioned frequently and solemnly in our political discourse \nas the Nation's first priority, has yet to be addressed seriously by \nthis or any previous Congress.\n  The only solution to our budgetary problems and our profligate \nspending habits is substantial process reform. One key aspect of that \nprocess reform is the line-item veto. Mr. President, I implore those \nwho say there is no need for the line-item veto to listen to the \narguments in support of that authority made by Americans of varied \nexperiences and political persuasions who are united only in their \nconcern for the fiscal health of the nation.\n\n       Ross Perot on Good Morning America stated: ``There's every \n     reason to believe that if\n      you give the Congress more money, it's like giving a friend \n     who's trying to stop drinking a liquor store. The point is \n     they will spend it. They will not use it to pay down the \n     debt. If you don't get a balanced budget amendment, if you \n     don't get a line-item veto for the president, we might as \n     well take this money out to the edge town and burn it, \n     because it'll be thrown away.''\n\n  Then-Governor Clinton on Larry King Live: ``We ought to have a line-\nitem veto.''\n  Candidate Bill Clinton in Putting People First: ``Line-Item Veto. To \neliminate pork-barrel projects and cut government waste, I will ask \nCongress to give me the line-item veto.''\n  President Bill Clinton in his Inaugural Address:\n\n       Americans deserve better * * * so that power and privilege \n     no longer shout down the voice of the people. Let us put \n     aside personal advantage so that we can feel the pain and see \n     the promise of America. Let us give this Capitol back to the \n     people to whom it belongs.\n\n  According to the CATO Institute, December 9, 1992, Policy Analysis:\n\n       Ninety-two percent of the governors believe that a line-\n     item veto for the President would help restrain federal \n     spending. Eighty-eight percent of the Democratic respondents \n     believe the line-item veto would be useful.\n       America's governors and former governors have a unique \n     perspective on budget reform issues. Most of them have had \n     practical experience with the line-item veto and balanced \n     budget requirement in their states. The fact that most \n     governors have found those budget tools useful in restraining \n     deficits and unnecessary government spending suggests that \n     they may be worth instituting on the federal level.\n\n  Additionally from the CATO Institute Study:\n\n       Keith Miller (R), former Governor, AK: ``The line-item veto \n     is a useful tool that a governor can use on occasion to \n     eliminate blatantly ``pork barrel'' expenditures that can\n      strain a budget. At the same time he must answer to the \n     voters if he or she uses the veto irresponsibly. It is a \n     certain restraint on the legislative branch.''\n       Michael Dukakis (D), former Governor, MA: ``The line-item \n     veto is helpful in stopping efforts to add riders and other \n     extraneous amendments to the budget bill.''\n       L. Douglas Wilder (D), Governor, VA: ``To the detriment of \n     the federal process, the President is not held accountable \n     for a balanced budget. Congress takes control over budget \n     development with its budget resolution, after which, the \n     President may only approve or veto 13 appropriations bills. \n     Without the line-item veto the President has minimal \n     flexibility to manage the Federal budget after it is \n     passed.''\n       S. Ernest Vandiver (D), former Governor, GA: ``Tremendous \n     tool for saving money.''\n       Ronald Reagan (R): ``When I was governor in California, the \n     governor had the line-item veto, and so you could veto parts \n     of a bill. The President can't do that. I think, frankly--of \n     course, I'm prejudiced--government would be far better off if \n     the President had the right of line-item veto.''\n                     the greater threat of inaction\n\n  Mr. President, many have characterized this legislation as a \ndangerous ploy to centralize political power in the hands of the \nExecutive. Since the President has no authority to appropriate money \nfor projects he believes are important, he will always have abundant \nincentive to compromise with Congress. Such compromises will always be \nnecessary for the President to govern at all and will, of course, \nprevent the unlikely danger of a tyranny emerging at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue. Congress will still dispose of whatever the \nPresident proposes and thus the checks and balances which distinguish \nour Republic will remain secure.\n  What the opponents of this measure often ignore is the greater danger \npresented by our out-of-control budget process.\n  For instance, as my colleagues know, I believe one of the most \ndangerous consequences of pork-barrel spending is its weakening of the \nnational security of the United States. I do\n not make that charge lightly. As thousands of men and women who \nvolunteered to serve their country have to leave military service \ninvoluntarily because of declining defense budgets, money is still \nfound in defense bills to underwrite billions of dollars worth of \nnondefense spending in the defense bill. At a time when we need to \nrestructure our forces and manpower to meet our post-cold war military \nneeds, we have squandered billions to build projects on bases that are \nslated to be closed.\n\n  Mr. President, every Member of Congress has pursued projects for his \nor her district or State which may lack obvious merit. It is an \ninstitutional problem. There are no saints here of my acquaintance. \nCertainly, I am not one. I have been guilty in the past of pursuing \nprojects in my State. But the supporters of this measure are trying to \nchange this system that has so clearly failed the country. We are \ntrying to make a difference. I am not here to cast aspersions on other \nSenators who secured projects for their States. I am not here to start \na partisan fight.\n  But it serves no one--not the Members of this institution nor the \npeople we represent--to ignore or attempt to obscure our individual and \ncollective responsibility for the piling up of $3.7 trillion in debt. \nWe have done this. And while we have often done this in the name of the \npeople we serve, those very people believe we have done it to sustain \nourselves in power. And those people, Mr. President, are not buying it \nany longer.\n  Anyone who feels that the system doe not need reform need only \nexamine the trend in the level of our public debt. As I have stated in \nmy analysis of the most recent budget plans, the deficit has continued \nto grow and spending continues to increase. In 1960, the Federal debt \nheld by the public was $236.8 billion. In 1970, it was $283.2 billion. \nIn 1980, it was $709.3 billion. In 1990, it was $3.2 trillion, and it \nis expected to near $5 trillion this year.\n  With line-item veto authority, the President could play a more active \nrole in helping to prevent the further waste of taxpayers' resources \nfor purposes that do not really serve our national security needs, our \ninfrastructure needs, and other important purposes that merit public \nsupport.\n  According to a recent General Accounting Office [GAO] study, $70 \nbillion could have been saved between 1984 and 1989, if the President \nhad a line-item veto--$70 billion.\n  The line-item veto will, indeed, change the way Washington operates. \nI know that very admission will provide grounds for some Members to \noppose this measure. As I previously noted, I am completely confident \nthat the constitutional distortions which some opponents fear the line-\nitem veto will cause will not occur.\n But there will be change. Unnecessary parochial spending will decline. \nThus, this change that we should all welcome.\n\n\n    return to the views of the founding father and the constitution\n\n  Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues that a President empowered \nwith a veto was not considered a threat \n[[Page S4078]] to our Republican form of Government by the Framers of \nthe Constitution.\n  This bill in no way alters or violates any of the principles of the \nConstitution. It preserves wholly the right of the Congress to control \nour Nation's purse strings--a trust the Congress has sometimes abused. \nOn the contrary, this legislation helps sustain the sound checks and \nbalances which provide enduring protection from tyranny.\n  The veto was designed by the Founding Fathers to ensure that the \nPresident retains the authority to govern should Congress exceed the \nbounds of responsible stewardship of the Nation's wealth.\n  According to Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 73 the views of the \nFounding Fathers on Executive veto power are as follows:\n\n       It [the veto] not only serves as a shield to the executive, \n     but it furnishes an additional security against the inaction \n     of improper laws. It establishes a salutary check upon the \n     legislative body, calculated to guard the community against \n     the effect of faction, precipitancy, or any impulse \n     unfriendly to the public good, which may happen to influence \n     a majority of that body.\n\n  Given Congress' predilection for unauthorized and/or pork-barrel \nspending, omnibus spending bills, and continuing resolutions, it would \nseem only prudent and constitutional to provide the President with \nfunctional veto power.\n  The President must have more than the option of vetoing a spending \ncut bill and shutting down Government or simply submitting to \ncongressional coercion.\n  The authority provided him by this strictly defined and limited line-\nitem veto will not fundamentally upset the balance of power between the \nexecutive and legislative branches. It is consistent with the values \nexpressed in our Federal Constitution.\n  The President is given very limited power by this bill. It is limited \nto appropriation bills and it can only be exercised for a limited time \nafter the passage of an appropriations bill.\n Congress is guaranteed--by the Constitution--the opportunity to \nquickly overturn the President's veto. Opponents speak of their alarm \nover the prospect of Presidential coercion. But does any Member truly \nbelieve that Members--irrespective of their political affiliation--\nwould not unite in opposition to a President who was attempting to \nabuse his powers. When has any Congress failed to do so in the past? \nDid not a majority of Congress--including many members of the \nPresident's party, oppose President Roosevelt's attempt to pack the \nSupreme Court? Did not a majority of Congress, including most members \nof the President's party, join in opposition to President Nixon's abuse \nof his office? I have no doubt, whatsoever, that Congress would not \nsubmit to extortion from a President with line-item veto authority. \nThey would expose the President's coercion, and overturn any offensive \nrescission.\n\n  Charges that the President would abuse this power are also misleading \nand unfounded.\n  Again, I will rely upon Alexander Hamilton, who posed this question \nto his contemporaries in Federalist No. 73:\n\n       If a magistrate so powerful and so well fortified as a \n     British monarch would have scruples about the exercise of the \n     power under consideration, how much greater caution may be \n     reasonably expected in a President of the United States, \n     clothed for the short period of four years with the executive \n     authority of government wholly and purely republican?\n\n  Mr. President, the Constitution gives each House the power to set and \nestablish its own rules. Additionally, the Constitution does not define \nthe term ``bill.'' Therefore, what constitutes a bill, or a matter to \nbecome law that is presented to the President, may be defined by the \nCongress in any way that it sees fit. The Constitution did make clear \nthat any type of measure passed by both Houses must be presented to the \nPresident.\n  For example, if a bill were named an ordinance, it would still have \nto be presented to the President. As reinforced in the Chadha versus \nINS case, anything with legal standing adopted by Congress must be \npresented to the President. The form of the presentment is up to the \ndiscretion of the Congress as a function of its internal rulemaking \nability. Therefore, Mr. President, it is clear that division of a bill \ninto separate parts is an internal rule change, and not a presentment \nissue.\n  Some will claim incorrectly that this bill violates the delegation \nclause of the Constitution. The delegation clause is not applicable \nhere since the Congress is not delegating any power. It is merely \nadopting rules to change the manner in which it sends certain \nlegislation to the President.\n  Others will claim that the Presentment Clause mandates that \nlegislation be passed by both Houses in the same form before it is sent \nto the President, and that Separate Enrollment by a clerk after the \npassage of the legislation therefore changes the form of the \nlegislation and violates the Presentment Clause.\n  This charge is also untrue. Changes made to a bill strictly of a \ntechnical nature due to the mechanics of the process of enrolling a \nmeasure have never been considered a change to a bill. Further, such \ntechnical changes would never merit subsequent action by either House. \nLastly, let me point out that the Senate on the first day of session \ntraditionally, authorizes the Enrolling Clerk--as an employee of the \nbody--to make technical corrections as necessary to bills sent to the \nClerk.\n  Additionally--and very importantly--the precedence for separate \nenrollment has already been established by the House of \nRepresentatives. The House has rules that ``deem'' a measure or matter \nas passed. The Gephardt rule states that when the House passes the \nconcurrent budget resolution, the debt limit increase is deemed to have \nbeen passed by the entire body. The rule authorizes the Clerk to \nincorporate language into the concurrent resolution regarding the debt \nlimit. Note that the budget concurrent resolution is not even a bill, \nyet the House enrolling clerk enrolls in it the entirety of another, \nnever considered measure.\n  Another argument against this bill is that we cannot delegate \nlegislative powers to the Enrolling Clerk and separate enrollment would \ndo precisely that.\n  Once again the critics of this bill are incorrect. Separate \nenrollment gives no additional power or authority to the enrolling \nclerk. The Congress, within its ability to establish its own rules and \ninstruct its employees on their duties, is prescribing certain limited \nactivities to the clerk, not transferring any power to an unelected \nofficial.\n  To summarize, Mr. President, this legislation is constitutional and \nshould be allowed to move forward.\n\n\n         presidential power used to implement budgetary reform\n\n  Congress' infidelity to sound fiscal policy was aggravated in 1974 by \nthe Budget Control and Impoundment Act. If opponents of the line-item \nveto are seeking an example of a dangerous transfer of political power, \nthey can end their search with that power grab by Congress. \nSpecifically, the Budget Control and Impoundment Act of 1974 weakened \nexecutive power by allowing the Congress the legal option of ignoring \nthe spending cuts recommended by the President through simple inaction.\n  Since 1974, the Congress' attitude toward presidential rescission has \nbeen one of increasing neglect.\n  President Ford proposed 150 rescissions, and Congress ignored 97. \nPresident Carter proposed 132 rescissions, and Congress ignored 38. \nPresident Reagan proposed 601 rescissions, and Congress ignored 134. \nPresident Bush proposed 47 rescissions, and Congress ignored 45.\n  If the Congress had accepted the 564 presidential rescissions that it \nhas ignored since 1974, $40.4 billion would have been saved. This is \nnot a trivial sum to the taxpayer, even if it is to Washington \nveterans.\n  The practice of ignoring presidential rescissions is in contrast to \nthe practice prior to the 1974 act. Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, \nKennedy, Johnson, and Nixon all impounded funds that Congress had \nappropriated for line item projects.\n  These modern Presidents were not alone in their exercise of \nrescission power. In 1801, President Jefferson refused to spend $50,000 \non gunboats as appropriated by Congress. He, of course, had good \nreason. When the gunboats were appropriated, a war with Spain was \nconsidered imminent. The war never materialized, and the threat posed \nby Spain ended. As these circumstances changed, Jefferson thought it \nwas within his power to eliminate \n[[Page S4079]] what had become unnecessary spending.\n  The money for gunboats was not spent, and money was not appropriated \nin 1802 for the gunboats.\n  Clearly, the Union did not fall because the President refused to \nwaste the taxpayers' money.\n  Until 1974, our Presidents had the power to decide whether \nappropriated moneys should be spent or not. It is indeed true that \nPresident Nixon abused the power of impoundment. But the abuses of one \nman do not require us to permanently deny all Presidents the authority \nto restrict spending.\n  Again, let me quote Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 73 on the \nrole of executive veto power in our system of checks and balances:\n\n       When men, engaged in unjustifiable pursuits, are aware that \n     obstruction may come from a quarter which they cannot \n     control, they will often be restrained by the apprehension of \n     opposition from doing what they would with eagerness rush \n     into if no such external impediments were to be feared.\n\n  Those opposed to this legislation should consider that sound\n   observation when contemplating the importance of some of the \n``unjustifiable pursuits'' that find their way--irresistibly--into \nevery appropriations bill passed by Congress.\n\n  Let me return to the broader picture of process reform. Many \nopponents claim that a President with line-item veto authority would \nnot have any real ability to balance the budget or even significantly \nreduce the deficit. I will make no claims that this bill is the answer \nto all our budgetary problems.\n  As I earlier stated, the line-item veto is only one of many needed \ntools in our efforts to restore the Nation's financial health. With \nroughly $1 trillion of entitlement spending in a budget of $1.5 \ntrillion, it is clear that a line-item veto will not solve all of our \nfiscal difficulties. Only a Congress with a political will not \ncharacteristic of recent Congress' will be able to balance the budget.\n  A President dedicated to restraining Federal spending could use line-\nitem veto power as an effective tool to reduce Government spending and \nmove closer to a balanced budget than we are today.\n  The GAO study makes my point. A President with line-item veto \nauthority could have saved the American taxpayer $70 billion since \n1974.\n  A determined President may not be able to balance the budget--only \nthe voters can ultimately control Congress--but a determined President \ncould make substantial progress toward real spending reduction.\n  As we continue to confront enormous budget deficits and annually \nsearch for ways to reduce spending, it is obvious that there our \nefforts will require the service of a President whose line-item veto \nauthority has been restored. With our public debt expected to approach \n$3.9 trillion this year and a gross domestic product of roughly $5.7 \ntrillion, it seems quite probable that our debt may soon surpass our \noutput. Unless we decide to simply wait for the moment when this \ngrowing crisis begets a movement for stronger measures that really will \nthreaten constitutional principles, we ought not decry those reasonable \nand constitutionally sound measures that will help us control the \ngreatest threat facing our Republic.\n  With that in mind, I hope the Senate would consider the following \nquote by a figure in the Scottish Enlightenment, Alexander Tytler. He \nstated:\n\n       A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. \n     It can exist only until a majority of voters discover that \n     they can vote themselves largesse\n      out of the public treasury. From that moment on, the \n     majority always votes for the candidate who promises them \n     the most benefit from the public treasury, with the result \n     being that democracy always collapses over a loose fiscal \n     policy.\n\n  It is to prove Mr. Tytler wrong that I ask my colleagues to support \nthis bill. If our debt surpasses our output, I fear Mr. Tytler will be \nproved correct, and the recognition of his powers of prophecy will mean \nthat the noblest political experiment in human history will have ended \nin failure.\n  This bill is only a small step toward preventing the arrival of such \na dismal calamity for this country and mankind. But it is a necessary \nstep. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. President, we are going to have a lot of detailed debate on this \nissue. Some may appear to observers to be esoteric and somewhat minute. \nThere are significant questions about the constitutionality and the \nother aspects of this bill as far as its applicability ranging from how \nmuch money it would save to whether it directly violates the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I do not claim to be a Constitutional expert. I do \nclaim to have been involved in this issue now for 10 years. I do claim \nto have read and discussed with eminent Constitutional scholars this \nentire issue, and I am convinced that any argument on Constitutional \ngrounds can be easily rebutted.\n  The question, however, will be, is the Congress of the United States \nprepared to transfer significant power from the legislative branch of \nGovernment to the executive branch of Government for the sake of the \nfuture of our children? Is the Congress of the United States, \nespecially those Members who are in more powerful positions than \nothers, prepared to do what is necessary?\n  We cannot live with that deficit. Our children and our children's \nchildren will be called upon someday to pay that bill. And if we do not \nstart now to reduce that deficit, an exercise in fiscal sanity, we will \nnot only threaten our children's futures but we will continue to \nincrease the cynicism that exists in America today about the profligate \nway we spend the taxpayers' dollars. There is no confidence in America \ntoday that the Congress of the United States spends that money in a \nwise fashion.\n  Mr. President, that is not my personal opinion. Poll after poll after \npoll concerning this issue confirms that statement. When people lose \nconfidence in their government, then very bad things can happen because \nthen, over time, they search for other means of governing or they \nsearch for other people or parties that they think can govern better.\n  On this side of the aisle, as the Presiding Officer well knows since \nhe is a newly arrived Member of this body, having come from the other \nbody, I believe we made a promise to the American people. We made \nseveral promises. Those promises were embodied in the Contract With \nAmerica. The crown jewels of the Contract With America in my opinion--\nothers may differ--were a balanced budget amendment and a line-item \nveto. Unfortunately, recently the Senate failed to enact a balanced \nbudget amendment. The reasons for it have been well discussed and \ndissected in every periodical in America so I do not intend to go into \nthe reasons why. But the fact remains the American people, in \noverwhelming majorities, are deeply disappointed that we did not have \nthe courage, we could not muster 67 or two-thirds of the votes in this \nbody to make that happen and send that measure to the States for their \nratification.\n  Now we are confronted with a second duel and that is the line-item \nveto. It is going to be a close call. It is going to be very, very \nclose, as to whether we can obtain the 60 votes to get cloture or not. \nI do not know if we will be able to achieve that.\n  I know I am willing, and those of us who are supporters are willing \nto negotiate with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and try \nto satisfy concerns they have. Obviously, we will not negotiate the \nprinciple of two-thirds majority override but we certainly would be \nwilling to talk about ways in which we can protect Social Security, for \nexample, and make sure we do not do damage to those who are least \nfortunate in our society.\n  At the same time, when all this concern is voiced about those who are \nunfortunate in our society and cannot defend themselves--the elderly, \nthe children, the poor, the homeless, those who are ill--the fact is if \nwe do not do something about that, we cannot help any of them. If we do \nnot stop this deficit spending there is no way we can help the people \nwho need help in our society, because we will be spending all our money \non paying off a debt or we will debase the currency through inflation, \nreduce the national debt but at the same time destroy middle-income \nAmerica. We will be faced with those two choices.\n  Again I want to say, the line-item veto will not balance the budget. \nBut I hasten to add the budget will not be balanced without a line-item \nveto. That graph over there is a compelling \n[[Page S4080]] argument to validate my argument, my statement. Between \nthe years of this Nation's birth, which are not on that chart, up until \n1974, roughly, our deficit was either a slight one or nonexistent. \nBeginning in 1974 and 1975 it skyrocketed off the charts.\n  For 10 years, Senator Coats and I have been working on this issue. \nFor 10 years we have brought up this issue before this body, unable to \ndo anything but ventilate the argument, ventilate the issue, talk about \nit and debate it, knowing full well that the Senator from West Virginia \nor the Senator from Oregon were going to pose a budget point of order \nand we would not succeed in that effort and we would be doomed to try \nagain another day or another year.\n  I believe this is the defining moment for this issue. I believe we \nshould engage in extended and in-depth debate in a manner and \nenvironment of respect for one another's views. At the same time, I \nbelieve if we lose this battle we are sending a message that we are \nwilling to do away with our children's futures and any opportunity for \nfiscal sanity.\n  Before I yield the floor I again would express my appreciation to my \ndear, dear friend, Senator Coats, who has been, many times, the one who \nhas helped restore my spirits after we have suffered defeat after \ndefeat and encouraged me and himself. I hope I have encouraged him from \ntime to time to stay at this very critical battle even at the risk of \nbruising friendships and relationships we might have with others in \nthis body, and even at risk of appearing somewhat foolish from time to \ntime as we jousted with a windmill in the form of a majority on the \nother side in full recognition we could not succeed.\n  But I say to my friend from Indiana, I do not know if we would be \nhere today if we had not done all the things we did for the past 10 \nyears. Without his help and friendship I do not believe we would be \nhere.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, my understanding is that under the \nunanimous consent agreement time is managed by the Senator from \nArizona. The Senator from Alaska has asked for 5 minutes of time in \nwhich--or more if he wishes--to introduce some legislation. I think if \nthe Senator from Arizona will yield that time I think it would be \nappropriate at this time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Alaska \nwhatever time he needs to consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am grateful to the Senator from Indiana \nand the Senator from Arizona. I find myself in an a position this year \nof applauding the leadership they are giving to this subject of the \nline-item veto. I will be making a statement on that tomorrow.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens pertaining to the introduction of S. 575 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/16/senate-section/article/S4074-5", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4080-S4089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           THE NATIONAL DEBT\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, Calvin Coolidge may have been a man of few \nwords, but the thoughts he expressed when he chose to speak were very \nprecise. On the subject of government spending he once very accurately \nobserved that, ``Nothing is easier in the world than spending public \nmoney. It does not appear to belong to anyone.''\n  How true those words were because we have seen a Congress spend the \npublic's money in a way that has significantly reduced the respect and \ncredibility of this institution in a way that has taxpayers across \nAmerica not only scratching their heads in wonder but shaking their \nfists in rage, disturbed over the fact that while they are getting up \nin the morning and fighting traffic and getting to work and putting in \nan honest day's work for what they thought was an honest day's pay, \nthey receive their paycheck at the end of the week and bimonthly and \nnote the ever-increasing deduction for funds being sent to Washington \nto pay for programs and to pay for expenditures that they do not deem \nin the national interest.\n  They are becoming outraged, and they are frustrated. They expressed \nthat outrage and frustration this past November. They wanted a change \nin the way that this Congress does business. They have been calling for \nit for years, even decades. Politicians have been going back home and \npromising change. ``Elect me and we will do it differently.'' People \nask, ``Well, what can you do about it?\"\n  Many of us were proposing two basic structural changes in the way \nthat the Congress does business. One was the balanced budget amendment. \nDespite all of the fine rhetoric, all of the wonderful promises, all of \nthe budget bills, the budget deals, the budget reduction packages that \nwere debated, voted on, and promised by the Congress, despite all of \nthat, Americans continued to see an ever-escalating debt, hundreds of \nbillions of dollars annually of deficit spending, and a frightening \nexplosion in the national debt.\n  In 1980, when I was elected to Congress, one of the very first pieces \nof legislation that we had to vote on was whether or not we would raise \nthe national debt ceiling--that is, that level over which we could not \nborrow money--to raise that to $1 trillion. Many of us were deeply \nconcerned that we not break the trillion dollar threshold. We had \ncampaigned that year in 1980 on fiscal responsibility. We campaigned on \nbalancing the budget. We knew that, if we were going to balance the \nbudget, we had to stop the flow of red ink. That was our first \npriority. We knew, if we were going to reduce that debt, that we could \nnot have any more years of deficit spending.\n  So we were concerned about raising that debt limit. Yet, for a whole \nvariety of reasons--some of them valid and many of them invalid, but \nall because of a lack of discipline--we not only did not balance the \nbudget but we saw the national debt explode; explode from the $1 \ntrillion level to nearly $5 trillion today, a 500-percent increase. It \nalmost is beyond our ability to comprehend how we as a Nation could \nhave gone from a $1 trillion debt level to nearly a $5 trillion debt \nlevel.\n  Automatic spending as a way of meeting entitlement obligations \nclearly has played an enormous role in all of this, some necessary \ndefense increases, some less than projected revenue estimates, but \nprimarily a lack of will on the part of the Congress to curb its \nspending habits and its appetite for spending. I said then and I said \nin the debate a few weeks ago and I still believe that until we enact \ninto the Constitution of the United States a requirement that this body \nbalance its budget each and every year, we will not solve our debt \nproblem. We will not begin to solve our debt problem.\n  My greatest disappointment in my years in Congress has been our \nfailure by one vote to join the House of Representatives and pass on to \nthe States for their consideration and, hopefully, their ratification a \nbalanced budget amendment--one vote. We came that close. I think the \nAmerican people instinctively know that, unless the Constitution forces \nus to balance the budget, we will always find an excuse not to. As \nCalvin Coolidge said, how easy it is to spend what appears to be \nsomeone else's money because it does not appear to belong anywhere.\n  We have seen year after year after year Congress saying, ``Well, \nmaybe next year, too many pressing priorities this year, too big a \nproblem to address all at once, we will do it another time.'' Or, we \nhave seen Congress say ``Here is the legislation that will put us on \nthe path to a balanced budget, that will bring finally fiscal \ndiscipline to this body.'' Of course, we have seen every one of those \nefforts fail.\n  Now we are looking at the second tool to try to curb congressional \nspending, this appetite for spending, spending, spending, and paying \nfor it not by asking the taxpayer to ante up, although we have done \nthat, and it has I think had a negative effect on our ability to grow \nand provide opportunities for our young people and job opportunities \nfor Americans. But we found a convenient way to pass on the debt to a \ndifferent generation to a time when we are no longer here serving; pass \nit on by floating debt, by incurring debt which future generations will \nhave to pay. We are paying it now. We are paying $200-and-some billion \na year just in interest. It is rapidly approaching $300 billion a \nyear--$300 billion which could \n[[Page S4081]] be used either to impose a lesser tax burden on \nAmericans, to provide a child tax credit which would give American \nfamilies with children an opportunity to meet some of their financial \nobligations, to put aside money for college or savings, pay the rent, \npay the mortgage, buy the clothes, or meet their monthly obligations.\n Or it could be used for more appropriate needs that exist in our \nsociety. But, no, it goes simply to pay interest on the debt, and it \nmounts every year. It is the second largest expenditure in our budget. \nIf a few years, it will exceed the entire spending for national \nsecurity, for all our military men in uniform, for all that we provide \nfor national defense. Interest. Just paying obligations so that we can \nspend now and somebody can pay for it later.\n\n  So we come to the second tool. The Senate has rejected, \nunfortunately, by one vote, the right of the people, the right of the \nStates to determine whether or not they want this fiscal discipline \nimposed constitutionally on the Congress of the United States. We now \ncome to the second institutional change, the line-item veto. As my \ncolleague, Senator McCain, said, make no mistake about it, this will \nnot balance the budget. This is not enough of a tool to do the job. But \nit is an institutional change. It is a structural change in the way \nthat we do business, and it can make a difference and it can make a \nsubstantial difference.\n  Senator McCain and I, as he recently has said, have been fighting \nthis battle for a number of years. We have alternately introduced it. \nJohn McCain manages it one time, and I manage it another time--\nalternately introducing the line-item veto under different forms--\nenhanced rescission we called it. It is a statutory measure designed to \nsecure passage with 51 votes instead of two-thirds. It is not a \nconstitutional amendment. But we have been offering it in Congress \nafter Congress, year after year, always falling short of the necessary \nnumber of votes to break a filibuster, because those who oppose line-\nitem veto, those who believe Congress can exercise the will for fiscal \ndiscipline, those who feel that the power of making those decisions \nshould not rest anywhere except in this body have been able to block \nour efforts.\n  Senator McCain has been, as is his great talent, a man of \nextraordinary perseverance, extraordinary commitment, extraordinary \ndedication to this issue and many others that he has been involved \nwith. He paid me a nice compliment by saying I shored him up at times \nwhen he was discouraged and we were not making more progress. He has \npicked me up equally as much, and maybe more. Sometime we think, what \nis the use, we are never going to get there, we are never going to \nbreak the power and the hold on the spending process that currently \nexists with those who see spending, or the control of the process, as \nadvantageous, for whatever reason.\n  But I want to compliment him for continuing to persevere. He is a man \nof great perseverance. I want to compliment him for pushing through and \ninsisting that we go forward. Together we are doing that. And we know \nwe have the support of many colleagues and we have the support of a \nvast majority of the American people because they have lost confidence \nin Congress' promises, in Congress' ability to discipline itself. They \nknow that we need system changes. They know that we need structural \nchanges if we are going to get this accomplished.\n  It has become so easy to spend in this body that, every year, about \n$10 billion worth of appropriations are tacked onto an already loaded \nFederal budget for spending that meets no emergency request, is not \nformally authorized by Congress, and that means it has not been \ndiscussed and debated and examined by the authorizing committees and \nvoted on and put forward to our colleagues to examine. Nor has it been \nrequested by the President. On the contrary, it is $10 billion that \nserves only to appease or satisfy a particularly parochial special \ninterest. As a result, Congress has become so addicted to spending \nother peoples' money, that the last time the Federal budget was \nbalanced on a regular basis, Calvin Coolidge was still alive. Political \nscientist James Payne calls this a culture of spending. ``Members of \nCongress,'' says Payne, ``act as if Government money is somehow free.'' \nThey distribute it like philanthropists helping worthy supplicants--\nexcept that they are usually lobbyists or special interests, and the \nmoney goes to a very narrow, very parochial use. In a recent tabulation \nof witnesses who testified at congressional hearings, Mr. Payne found \nthat fully 95.7 percent of them came to urge more Government spending. \nOnly 0.7 percent spoke against it. I do not know what happened to the \nother 3 or 4 percent. They probably just came to see the monuments and \nwatch Congress in session.\n  This year, the President sent to Congress a budget that directs the \nGovernment to spend $1.6 trillion. Every month of that year, the \nGovernment will spend $134 billion; every week, $31 billion; every day, \n$4.4 billion; every hour, $184 million; $3 million a minute; every \nsecond of every day, the Federal Government will spend another $50,000 \nof someone else's money.\n  By the end of 1996, the Federal deficit will have increased by $200 \nbillion, a figure that will be repeated in 1997, 1998, 1999, and the \nyear 2000, after which it will rise even greater. That is a projection \non which we almost always come in under what the actual figure is. But \nthe sad fact is that even if the President could manage to send a \nbalanced budget proposal to Congress, it probably would not make any \ndifference. Congress would still choose to pad the bill with billions \nof extra dollars of parochial pork.\n  In some cases, these projects are tacked on--usually at the last \nminute--to legislation that is too important or too politically risky \nfor the President to veto, like Federal disaster assistance when \nCalifornia is devastated by floods, when hurricanes devastate south \nFlorida, or when the military needs a pay raise, or emergency spending \nis needed to cover deployments or costs that it has incurred, or \nbenefits for veterans. These huge bills pass often, literally, in the \ndark of the night. But almost always we find tucked away in the very \ndark recesses of complicated bills, sometimes weeks and months later, \nwe find items of appropriations that go for special interests, that go \nfor special spending, which causes all of us to ask, how in the world \ndid that become part of this bill? How in the world did the Congress \never pass something like that? In honesty, many of us say we did not \neven know we passed it. Well, it was part of the HUD-Independent \nAgencies appropriations bill. Well, that was a 1,300-page bill, and \nwhile we searched through it, we must have found tucked away in there--\nsometimes in very obscure language--spending that goes for something \nthat the taxpayer finds is absolutely outrageous.\n  And every year, this type of spending adds up to billions of dollars \nworth of unnecessary spending that would wilt in a white-hot minute if \nit were forced to weather the glare of public scrutiny. If that item \nwas brought to the floor of the Senate and debated solely on that item, \nand if Members were forced to vote yea or nay on that item, it would \nnever pass; it would never stand the scrutiny of the light of public \ndebate. Members would never risk a vote for an item that brings outrage \nto the American public when they hear about it.\n  The list goes on and on, and Senator McCain and I will have the \nopportunity to detail some of that list. It is not our purpose tonight \nto castigate other Members. In one sense, we are all guilty. There is \nprobably not a Member of Congress that has not gone to the \nAppropriations Committee and said, ``Do you think there is a way we can \nget this particular appropriated item in the bill? It is important to \nmy constituents and it is something that I think is important. Can we \nget it tucked on there? Has it been authorized?'' ``No. You know it is \ngoing to be tough to get that through the authorization process, and my \ncolleagues might not understand.\n But could we just add it to this bill? This bill is going through.''\n\n  There is probably not one of us that does not bear some \nresponsibility, some blame, for this.\n  What we are saying here is that the system is bad, and the system \nneeds to be changed. Some people make a career out of doing this. \nOthers do it on occasion. But whether it is a standard operating \nprocedure or whether it is just an occasional request, the system \nallows \n[[Page S4082]] it to happen and it is not right and it ought to stop.\n  If you happen to occupy an important position here, a position where \nyou are influential in terms of appropriating certain funds, it is \nquite easy to add some items. Every year in appropriations bills, we \nfind certain Members seem to do quite well, thank you. They happen to \noccupy positions that allow them that opportunity.\n  But we are not going to list the items. Americans read about them \nregularly in the newspapers, in the magazines. They hear about them on \nthe national news. In fact, one network outlined on a regular nightly \nbasis for several weeks--and perhaps it is still going on--how your \nmoney is spent. And each time they do that, our phones light up the \nnext morning, the mail pours in, people stop you back at home and say, \n``How in the world can you take my hard earned dollars and spend it on \nthat item?\"\n  Mr. President, we have a budget process that encourages delay, \nrewards subterfuge, and works to the detriment of the American people. \nBut any spending that must be attached or hidden is spending that \ncannot be justified on its merits.\n  It is time for us to change the system. It is time for us to shine a \nlight in the deep, dark corners of deficit spending. It is time to give \nthe President and to give the American people the line-item veto.\n  Just as a yellow highlight earmarks and highlights a text, the line-\nitem veto will give the President the power to highlight Government \npork by drawing bright lines through the billions of dollars of added \non Federal waste. No longer will unnecessary expenditures be able to \nhide in the dark details of necessary bills. The line-item veto will \nspotlight their existence and force legislators to defend their merits \nin open debate.\n  More importantly, the line-item veto means that pork finally stops at \nsomebody's desk. Even if the Congress persists in passing wasteful \nspending measures, the people can still demand that the President line \nout parochial pork barrel projects that increase their tax burden and \nthreatens their children's future. The line-item veto is a giant step \nforward in fiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. President, today objections raised by the Congress against the \nline-item veto seem to boil down to some fundamental questions. One of \nthe questions is: Is the line-item veto the best solution to the \nproblem?\n  As I said earlier, the best solution would have been a balanced \nbudget amendment. Congress failed by one vote in that effort.\n  But the next best structural change that can take place would be the \nline-item veto, in this Senator's opinion, because it is clear the \nCongress cannot muster the will to, on a regular basis or even on an \noccasional basis, balance the budget.\n  As I said, Calvin Coolidge was still alive the last time we did \nbalance the budget. Our record is pretty sorry, despite our promises, \ndespite our best efforts.\n  The other objection raised is: Is this constitutional? Let me address \nthe first one: Is it the best solution?\n  Obviously, the best solution would be for the Congress to put the \ninterest of the country before its own parochial interests, to follow \nthe basic principle, which we attempted to teach our children around \nthe kitchen table or sitting in the family room, that every corporation \nin America has to follow, that every home owner has to follow: If you \nkeep spending more money than you take in, you are going to get \nyourself in deep trouble.\n  How many times have I told my children, how many times have any of us \ntold our children, ``Look, you can't spend more than you have. Sure you \ncan get a plastic credit card, but the bill comes 30 days later and \nthere is interest attached. And the interest is not cheap. It keeps \nadding up. And if you keep mounting that up, you are going to get \nyourself in a real hole.''\n  And there are a lot of Americans that have done that.\n  Well, we each are given a credit card when we come here. It is called \nour ID. In the House, they actually use it to put it in a machine and \nthat records their vote. Here, we vote by voice vote. But this is the \nmost expensive credit card in America. It says ``United States \nSenator.'' It allows us to walk in this Chamber and, because we can \ncarry this card, we have license to the taxpayers' dollar.\n  What we are suggesting here is that that license has been abused. We \nhave racked up the points. We have reached the limit and it is time to \ncall each of us on that. And it is time to change the system, time to \nput some restrictions on the use of this card. Maybe I should say the \nabuse of this card.\n  We have demonstrated an institutional inability to restrain ourselves \nfrom unnecessary pork barrel spending. And perhaps the line-item veto \nis the only tool we have left.\n  Each year, Congress sends the White House massive bills, at most 13 \nappropriations bills. All of our spending is pretty much compressed \ninto 13 bills.\n  Sometimes we send the President one continuing resolution. That \ncombines all the bills that we have not passed separately into one bill \nand we have one vote, yes or no. We send this massive bill to the \nPresident--sometimes it is the entire spending for the entire Federal \nGovernment--and we say, ``Well, Mr. President, the fiscal year runs out \non September 30 at midnight. We are going to send you a bill up about \n10 p.m., September 30. That is going to allow you to continue \nGovernment running until we get around to passing the separate \nappropriations bills.''\n  Sometimes we never do. We just operate. In other words, we give him \nauthority to continue spending the money that he had last year.\n  Send it up there about 10 o'clock and say, ``Mr. President, you have \nabout 2 hours--I know the bill is several thousands of pages long--a \ncouple hours to look at it. Now you can veto it. You might find some \nthings in there you do not like. You can veto it. But, of course, the \nGovernment will shut down. Nobody will get paid. Everything stops. All \nthe checks stop.''\n  And the President is held almost in a position of blackmail because \nhis only choice is to either accept the whole bill or veto the whole \nbill.\n  So the ground rules offered by Congress are very clear. Tie the \nPresident's hands by leaving him with a take-it-or-leave-it decision \nand obscure in the process all the uncounted billions of dollars of \nunnecessary pork-barrel spending.\n  Now this maneuver is very commonplace in the Congress. Because it \nseems that our facility for outrage has been dulled by the repetition \nof the times that we have done this. But I would suggest it is also \ncontemptible, for when we hide those excesses behind the shield of \nvital legislation, we do it precisely to avoid making hard choices, to \nmask our actions and to confuse the American taxpayer.\n  In other words, we avoid public ridicule by consciously attempting to \nkeep citizens from knowing how their money is spent. We hope they do \nnot find out.\n  We criticize the press sometimes, but sometimes we have to give them \ncredit. Sometimes those people sit down and pore through those bills \nand say, ``Wait until you, American taxpayer, hear about this one.'' \nAnd we pick up the USA Today the next morning and there is the list of \nspending that just defies rationality, particularly at a time of \nburgeoning deficits.\n  In his 1985 State of the Union Address, President Reagan very \neffectively demonstrated this point; that is, the point of Congress \ndumping massive legislation on his desk in a take-it-or-leave-it \nproposition. The President slammed down 43 pounds and 3,296 pages of \nCongress' latest omnibus spending bill. He slammed it down on the desk \nof Tip O'Neill. It was the bill that represented $1 trillion worth of \nspending--one bill.\n Not one penny of which he had the power to veto unless he rejected the \nentire bill.\n\n  As my colleague, Senator McCain, has pointed out, Congress' addiction \nto pork barrel politics has reached the point where it is threatening \neven our national security and consuming resources that could be better \nspent on returning it to the taxpayers in the form of tax cuts, on \ndeficit reduction, or any one of a legitimate number of worthwhile \nprograms that would benefit all Americans--not just the few who happen \nto live in one particular State or one particular district.\n  The seriousness of this problem demands a serious response. I \nsuggest, as \n[[Page S4083]] Senator McCain suggested, the line-item veto is a \nserious response because it will force this Congress to get serious \nabout spending and end business as usual because ``business as usual'' \nis something that this country can no longer afford.\n  Mr. President, before the Budget Impoundment and Control Act of 1974, \nPresidents could eliminate or impound political pork by simply refusing \nto spend the appropriated funds. Using this tactic, President Johnson \nin 1967 eliminated 6.7 percent of total Federal spending, which in \ntoday's terms would amount to about $99 billion.\n  A few years later, President Nixon provoked Congress' wrath by \nimpounding the money for more than 100 different programs. Typically, \nCongress was outraged, in 1974, it retaliated. Grab the power of \nunlimited political pork by passing legislation that would ``ensure \ncongressional budget control.''\n  Now, I do not know if that is an oxymoron or not. I guess an oxymoron \nis just 2 years. Maybe this is an oxy-oxymoron. ``Congressional budget \ncontrol,'' it is like airline food and the Postal Service--they just do \nnot seem to ring quite right. Congressional budget control. Dare we use \nthe term ``ensure\" congressional budget control when we have seen the \nnational debt increase from $1 to $5 trillion in less than 15 years?\n  Under the new law passed in 1974, the President can still propose \ncuts. The Congress said, ``Well, listen, we will not take this power \naway from you completely. You can still propose cuts, but those cuts \nwill not take effect,'' Congress said, ``unless both the House and the \nSenate vote to approve those cuts in 45 days.''\n  Well, as we can guess, this proved just a little too convenient for \nCongress. In order to kill a Presidential cut, Congress quickly learned \nit does not have to do anything, a skill at which we are very adept at, \nas history will testify.\n  So in the years that followed, only 7 percent of the proposed cuts \nthat President Ford sent to the Congress were approved. From 1983 to \n1989 we only approved 2 percent of President Reagan's proposed cuts. \nPresident Bush proposed 47 recisions. We approved one of them. Congress \ngot its way.\n  But the result was not only more congressional control but more \ncongressional spending. From 1969 to 1974, President Nixon kept \ndomestic discretionary spending to an annual growth rate of 7.3 \npercent. In 1975, the first year the new recision provision went into \nplace, that is, if Congress does nothing, the President cannot stop the \nspending, Federal spending, and nondefense discretionary programs grew \nby an unprecedented 26.4 percent. Let me make that point again: When he \nhad the power to check congressional spending, congressional spending \nonly grew, discretionary spending only grew at 7.3 percent a year.\n  The year after Congress took it away, took the President's power away \nto do this, it jumped to 26.4 percent. The wild growth in Federal \nspending can often be traced to a number of causes. One of the reasons \nis crystal clear: The President has had limited authority left to \nprioritize how funds are spent. Congress can no longer be checked by \nthe prospects of Presidential impoundment.\n  Today what we have is a President with no reliable means to check the \nexcesses of Congress, because by simple inaction Congress can \nperpetuate projects that we can no longer afford. Inertia is rewarded \nwith scarce funds. Pet projects are shielded by our indecision. \nPredictably, the effect on the deficit has been dramatic.\n  Mr. President, I expect that the majority leader will introduce a \nsubstitute to the bill that Senator McCain and I are introducing. We \nhave been working very, very closely with the majority leader in \ncrafting a measure which we believe is even more effective than the one \nwhich we proposed and which, hopefully, can secure additional support.\n  I want to commend the majority leader for his efforts in moving \nforward, in designating line-item veto as a top five priority for this \nCongress. Mr. President, S. 4 is the bill that was introduced by the \nmajority leader. The one that Senator McCain and I have been working on \nfor a number of years, trying to refine the differences, pick up \nadditional support.\n  We have been working now with the majority leader, the Chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, and others in this Congress to write an even \nstronger bill, write an even better bill. We expect that the majority \nleader will be introducing that in a relatively short time--not \ntonight--but early next week.\n  Under that legislation, each item in an appropriations bill will be \nenrolled separately. That means it will be defined separately as a bill \nand presented to the President for his signature. In this way, the \nPresident will be able to pick and choose among funding, supporting \nthose he considers worthy, and vetoing others.\n  Under this process, Congress will no longer be able to protect its \nexcesses by simply wrapping egregious spending in one omnibus bill or \ntacking it in, hoping to hide it from public scrutiny. On the contrary, \nCongress will be forced to put itself on the record, and any conflict \nbetween the Congress and the President will be publicly aired before \nthe American people.\n  The reform embodied in this amendment is not radical. It would simply \nrestore a balance between the executive and legislative branches to \nwhat was regular practice for 185 years of American history.\n  As I said, since 1989 Senator McCain and I have fought for the line-\nitem veto as a tool to rein in out-of-control spending. I believe there \nis no surer sign of our commitment to real change than our willingness \nto have this Republican Congress, in one of its first defining acts, to \ngive this tool to a Democrat President.\n  If President Clinton had the line-item veto, the savings would not be \nmiraculous, but they could be substantial. For years, Senator McCain \nand I heard the charges from the opposition. ``Well, you would not do \nthis if it were a Democrat sitting in the White House. You would not \ngive up that power.'' We said, ``yes, we would.'' We are not giving it \nto a particular person. We are giving it to the office, to the office \nof the Presidency, because we so firmly believe that Congress has \nabused its privilege of deciding and solely determining the power of \nthe purse that we believe that the President needs a check, a balance, \nthat the President had prior to 1974.\n  It is not like we are giving him something new. We are restoring \nsomething that he already had. We want to give him that authority. \nWhether it is a Republican President or a Democrat President, there \nneeds to be a check on the excessive spending habits of Congress.\n  Senator McCain has mentioned that the GAO report that says that in \nthe mid-1980's we could have saved $70 billion if the President had \nline-item veto. Some will dispute that amount. No one can dispute--no \none can dispute--that we would have saved money. No one can dispute \nthat we would have prevented a great deal of excess wasteful pork-\nbarrel spending, whatever the amount.\n  If it were $70 billion, think what that could have done. We can have \ndoubled the personal exemption for families struggling to raise their \nchildren, to pay the bills. We could have paid for the entire student \nloan program for 5 years. We could have cut the national debt, and \ncould have substantially reduced our interest obligations.\n  If the President gets this line-item veto authority, we will never \nknow the full extent of the savings because what it will do is it will \nsend a message to every Member of Congress that the days of pork-barrel \nspending are over.\n  The slick little habit that is exercised time and time again of \nattaching an item of spending that everybody knows deep down in their \nheart would never, never withstand the glare of public scrutiny, would \nnever withstand the openness of public debate, would never achieve a \nmajority of Senators voting for their particular item, that will never \neven get attached to a bill. But they know that the President has line-\nitem veto authority and their spending item, their special interest \nparochial spending item is lined out and sent back to the Congress and \nthat the only way it can be restored is to bring it to the floor and \noverride the President's veto. We will never know how much money we \nwill save in this process. We will never know how many \n[[Page S4084]] projects, how much special interest parochial spending \nwould have been attached and hidden in the appropriations bills or a \ntax bill if the process is changed.\n  Mr. President, as I said, one of the other objections to this are the \nconstitutional concerns. The majority leader's substitute will restore \na healthy tension between the legislative and executive branches \nnecessary for fiscal discipline. President Truman wrote:\n\n       One important lack in the Presidential veto power, I \n     believe, is authority to veto individual items in \n     appropriations bills. The President must approve the bill in \n     its entirety or refuse to approve it. . . it is a form of \n     legislative blackmail.\n\n  Some will argue that the veto is too high a standard; that it is \ndifficult to muster the numbers to override it. To those, I would say, \nthat the greater challenge today is to reduce our Nation's debt and \nbalance our Nation's books. In this day, it should be a formidable \nchallenge to continue to spend our children's and grandchildren's \nmoney. It is time for a higher standard.\n  Others will say that the separate enrollment is inconvenient; the \nPresident will be forced to examine and sign hundreds of bills instead \nof one; how is the House going to process all this?\n  I find it interesting that every President since Ulysses Grant, with \na couple of exceptions, has asked for a line-item veto. Not one of them \nhas complained about the inconvenience of a line-item veto.\n  I also will say to my colleagues that modern technology, the \ninformation age, is upon us, the computer age is here. What used to be \na tedious task, what used to be a complex process, what used to be a \nquestion as to the decisionmaking power of an enrollment clerk--that is \nsomeone who writes up the bills and presents them for final approval to \nthe executive branch--what used to be a complex process is now a very \nsimple process. Software has been written for computers that can \nprocess this in a matter of moments. And so to separately line item and \nenroll a large appropriations bill is no longer a difficult process. So \nthe objection to the nightmare of the mechanical difficulty has been \nmet through the miracle of modern technology.\n  As I said, some question the constitutional standard. Article I, \nsection 5, says that each House of Congress has unilateral authority to \nmake and amend rules governing its procedures. Separate enrollment \nspeaks to the question of what constitutes a bill, it does nothing to \nerode the prerogatives of the President as that bill is presented. The \nConstitution grants the Congress sole authority for defining our rules. \nOur procedures for defining and enrolling a bill are ours to determine \nalone.\n  There is precedent provided in House rule XLIX, the Gephardt rule. \nUnder this rule, the House Clerk is instructed to prepare a joint \nresolution raising the debt ceiling when Congress adopts a concurrent \nbudget resolution which exceeds the statutory debt limit. The House is \ndeemed to have voted on and passed the resolution on the debt ceiling \nwhen the vote occurs on the concurrent resolution. Despite the fact \nthat a vote is never taken, the House is deemed to have passed it.\n  The American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service has \nanalyzed separate enrollment legislation and found it constitutional. \nLet me quote from Johnny Killian of the CRS:\n\n       Evident it would appear to be that simply to authorize the \n     President to pick and choose among provisions of the same \n     bill would be to contravene this procedure. In [separate \n     enrollment], however, a different tack is chosen. Separate \n     bills drawn out of a single original bill are forwarded to \n     the President. In this fashion, he may pick and choose. The \n     formal provisions of the presentation clause would seem to be \n     observed by this device.\n\n  Prof. Laurence Tribe, a constitutional scholar, has also observed \nthat the measure is constitutional. He recently wrote, and I quote:\n\n       The most promising line-item veto idea by far is . . . that \n     Congress itself begin to treat each appropriation and each \n     tax measure as an individual ``bill'' to be presented \n     separately to the President for his signature or veto. Such a \n     change could be effected simply, and with no real \n     constitutional difficulty, by a temporary alteration in \n     congressional rules regarding the enrolling and presentment \n     of bills.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Courts construing the rules clause of article I, section 5, \n     have interpreted it in expansive terms, and I have little \n     doubt that the sort of individual presentment envisioned by \n     such a rules change would fall within Congress' broad \n     authority.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden, during his \ntenure as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote extensive \nadditional views in a committee report on the constitutional line-item \nveto. He wrote about a separate enrollment substitute he offered, and I \nquote:\n\n       Each House of Congress has the power to make and amend the \n     rules governing its internal procedures. And, of course, \n     Congress has complete control over the content of the \n     legislation it passes. Thus, the decisions to initiate the \n     process of separate enrollment, to terminate the process \n     through passage of a subsequent statute, to pass a given \n     appropriations bill, and to establish the sections and \n     paragraphs of that bill, are all fully within Congress' \n     discretion and control.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       A requirement that Congress again pass each separately \n     enrolled item would be only a formal refinement--not a \n     substantive one. It would not prevent power from being \n     shifted from Congress to the President, because under the \n     statutory line-item veto, Congress will retain the full \n     extent of its legislative power. Nor would it serve to shield \n     Congress from the process of separate enrollment, because \n     Congress will retain the discretion to terminate that \n     process.\n\n  Mr. President, the line-item veto will discourage budget waste \nbecause it will encourage the kind of openness and conflict that \nenforces restraint. The goal is not to hand the Executive dominance in \nthe budget process. It is not a return to impoundment. It is a gentle \nand necessary nudge toward an equilibrium of budgetary influence, a \nstrengthening of vital checks on the excesses of this Congress.\n  The President's veto or ``revisionary'' power, as the Constitution \ndefines it, was intended to serve two functions: To protect the \nPresidency from the encroachment of the legislative branch, and to \nprevent the enactment of harmful laws.\n  Certainly, any attempt by a President today to line out unnecessary \nspending would meet the second of the Framers' objectives, that of \npreventing the enactment of harmful laws.\n  In 1916, a Texas Congressman, who shall go unnamed but will be \nquoted, had this to say:\n\n       There are a half a dozen places in my district where \n     Federal buildings are being erected or have recently been \n     constructed at a cost to the Federal Government far in excess \n     of the actual needs of the communities where they are \n     located. This is mighty bad business for Uncle Sam, and I'll \n     admit it; but the other fellows in Congress have been doing \n     it for a long time and I can't make them quit.\n       Now we Democrats are in charge of the House and I'll tell \n     you right now, every time one of those Yankees gets a ham, \n     I'm going to get myself a hog.\n\n  Mr. President, that was colorful language. We do not use that kind of \nlanguage too much around here in 1995. But the principle is the same. \nEverybody else is getting it for their district, so I better get it for \nmine. If that fellow over there can get a ham, I am going to see that I \nget a hog.\n  That is not spending in the national interest. That is not \nappropriate spending even if our budget is balanced, but I guarantee \nyou it is not appropriate spending when you have an unbalanced budget, \nwhen needs are being unmet, when the taxpayer is paying a higher burden \nthan he should, when the debt is running out of control, when we are \nsaddling future generations with a debt obligation which will bury them \nand bury their opportunity to enjoy the same standard of living \navailable to each one of us.\n  The line-item veto is a measure whose time has come. The American \npeople voted for it. The House has passed it. The President wants it. \nAnd now only the Senate, only the Senate, stands in the way of the \nline-item veto. Let us make sure that the Senate is viewed as the \nworld's greatest deliberative body and not the world's greatest \ndeliberative obstacle to the line-item veto.\n  Mr. President, I contend it is time to pass the line-item veto.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n   [[Page S4085]] Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Citizens Against Government Waste have \nsent a letter that says:\n                                              Council for Citizens\n\n\n                                     Against Government Waste,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The 600,000 members of the Council for \n     Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW) strongly endorse S. \n     4, the enhanced rescissions bill. S. 4 was introduced by \n     Senator Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) and Senators John \n     McCain (R-AZ) and Dan Coats (R-IN). This line-item veto truly \n     provides the president with a veto of congressional spending, \n     by requiring a \\2/3\\ vote to override.\n       The House of Representatives heeded the President's call \n     for fiscal soundness and overwhelmingly supported enhanced \n     rescission legislation over ``expedited rescissions.'' Most \n     Americans agree with the House and President Clinton on this \n     issue--give the president the authority to weed out wasteful \n     spending. In addition, CCAGW calls on the Senate to further \n     strengthen S. 4 by extending the line-item veto power over \n     tax and contract authority legislation, also havens for pork.\n       The inside-the-beltway crowd says the line-item veto will \n     die in the Senate. It's time to prove them wrong. The defeat \n     of the Balanced Budget Amendment made it painfully obvious \n     that some members of Congress are not ready to give up their \n     ``pork perk.'' However, their victory should be short-lived. \n     Passing S. 4 will strike a blow against wasteful spending and \n     begin the long journey back to sound fiscal policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Tom Schatz,\n                                                        President.\n\n  I would like to respond to my friends from Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste. We do intend in the Dole substitute, which will be \nbrought up sometime early next week, to provide some power over taxing, \nin the respect that we are attempting to craft language that would \neliminate the targeted tax benefits in the so-called transition rules \nwhich have really been egregious violations of the intentions of the \nlaw. They, like pork-barrel spending, are very anecdotal. An example is \nthe person who owned a house on the ninth tee of the Augusta Golf \nCourse in Augusta during the Masters tournament who rented it out for a \nweek and got some huge tax writeoff.\n  The so-called transition rules that are hidden in tax bills, which \ngive enormous tax breaks which the American taxpayer really never is \naware of--certainly not sufficiently aware of--we are going to try to \naddress that, I say to my friends at Citizens Against Government Waste. \nWe have yet to figure out a way to address the contract authority \nsituation, but I suggest, if we had the line-item veto that prevented \nthe expansion of entitlements, that took care of targeted tax \nincentives, that took care of the appropriations aspect, we would go a \nvery, very long way.\n  The National Taxpayers Union writes:\n                                     National Taxpayers Union,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 1995.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of our 300,000 members, \n     National Taxpayers Union (NTU) strongly endorses S. 4, the \n     ``Legislative Line-Item Veto Act,'' which is clearly the best \n     line-item veto bill before the Congress.\n       The need for a line-item veto has become more pressing in \n     recent years as Congress has tended to aggregate legislation \n     into mammoth continuing resolutions and omnibus bills. Such a \n     practice greatly reduces the likelihood that the president \n     will use his veto power because of his objections to a \n     relatively small provision in the legislation.\n       The all-too-common congressional tactic is to attach \n     parochial, pork-barrel appropriations to must-pass \n     legislation that the president has little choice but to sign. \n     Since many of these provisions are neither the subject of \n     debate nor a separate vote, many Members of Congress do not \n     realize they exist. The legislative line-item veto would \n     allow the president to draw attention to pork-barrel \n     provisions and force their proponents to justify them. \n     Meritorious provisions would be repassed by Congress, while \n     the rest would be eliminated.\n       Additionally, the line-item veto would make the president \n     more accountable on the issue of wasteful spending. Many \n     presidents have repeatedly criticized Congress on spending. \n     With line-item-veto authority, the president could no longer \n     blame Congress for loading up spending bills with non-\n     essential spending and would have to work actively, rather \n     than rhetorically, to trim wasteful spending.\n       Some people warn that the line-item veto will affect the \n     balance of power between the Executive Branch and the \n     Legislative Branch. Our much greater concern, and I believe \n     that of most Americans, is the risk inherent in a record \n     amount of peace-time debt, which endangers our country's \n     financial future. It is far beyond the point where we ought \n     to quibble about whether this is going to slightly enhance \n     the power of the president or Congress. We should recognize, \n     as most people have, that the process has broken down and \n     that our general interest as a nation lies in bringing our \n     financial house to order.\n       The president is the only official elected by the nation \n     who exerts direct control over legislation. It is entirely \n     appropriate that the president be given an opportunity to \n     veto items of spending that are not in the national interest. \n     Again, National Taxpayers Union strongly endorses S. 4 and \n     urges your colleagues to support it on the floor of the \n     Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David Keating,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mr. President, these two organizations, the Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste and the National Taxpayers Union, along with the \nCitizens for a Sound Economy, who also strongly support this \nlegislation, are three organizations on whom I have relied over the \nyears to educate the American people. They have performed a signal \nservice. These three organizations have fought against Government waste \nand pork barreling in a dedicated and effective fashion. I believe \nwithout their help we would not be here today on the floor of the \nSenate, considering this legislation.\n  I am grateful for their participation. I am grateful for their \nsupport. Occasionally it is a bit amusing when we go to the annual \npublication of the ``Pig Book,'' which is published by the Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste. There are these cute little pigs there, and \nevery year they issue a Citizens Against Government Waste--this is the \n``Congressional Pig Book,'' and a State-by-State breakdown of projects.\n  It is partially entertaining but sometimes it is also very saddening. \nIt is entertaining to see the uses and creativity of some Members and \ntheir staffs in appropriating funds to certain projects. Again I will \nrelate my all time favorite of a couple of years ago, the $2.5 million \nwhich was spent on studying the effect on the ozone layer of flatulence \nin cows. But there are many others. At the same time, when we view tens \nof millions and sometimes billions of dollars that are wasted in such a \nprofligate fashion, then it is no longer amusing. It is very, very \ndisturbing.\n  I want to emphasize what Mr. Keating said in his letter from the \nNational Taxpayers Union, that there will be dire warnings, the tocsin \nwill be sounded: You are transferring all this power over to the \nexecutive branch. You cannot do it. If you do it we are upsetting the \nbalance of powers and our Founding Fathers will be spinning in their \ngraves, et cetera, et cetera.\n  First of all, I do not believe it is true. Second, I have quoted \nextensively from the Federalist Papers as to the intent of our Founding \nFathers. I think it is appropriate to mention that Thomas Jefferson \nsaid, in retrospect, long after the Constitution was written, that if \nhe had it to do over again he would put in some mechanism that would \nforce the Congress and the Nation to balance revenues with \nexpenditures.\n  There is no doubt whatsoever that the President in most respects had \nthe authority from the time that Thomas Jefferson refused to spend \n$50,000 in 1801 to build some gunships, to 1974 when the President, \nPresident Nixon, unfortunately in my view, in a weakened Presidency, \nused the impoundment powers in such an abusive fashion that the \nCongress rose up and passed the 1974 Budget Impoundment Act.\n  From that point on--not since 1787, not since 1802, not since 1905--\nsince 1974 has been when the deficit has sprung out of control and the \ndebt has accumulated at a rate never seen before in the history of this \ncountry.\n  So, as the debate wears on, I ask my colleagues to keep in mind that \nall of the talk about the Greek civilization, the Roman Empire, the \nprecedents set in the British parliament, are all very interesting if \nnot entertaining expositions of history.\n But I must say, Mr. President, what we are really talking about is \nwhat has happened with the Federal deficit since 1974.\n\n  Mr. President, I had a chart up here earlier that showed for most of \nthis century how both the expenditures and revenues had basically \nmatched each \n[[Page S4086]] other with certain changes. With the exception of \nwartime, basically it had been a priority of this Nation to keep our \nfinancial house in order as every family in America is required to do. \nSomething happened. Maybe in the view of some there was just some huge \nchange in attitude. Maybe in the view of some it was a coincidence that \nthe Budget and Impoundment Act was passed in 1974. I do not believe it \nwas a coincidence. I know it is not a coincidence. I know what \nhappened--that expenditures began to exceed revenues at an alarming \nrate.\n  This habit of tucking projects into appropriations bills became more \nand more rampant. The situation grew out of control because \nfundamentally the executive branch had no choice but to do two things: \nOne, veto a bill which would then for all intents and purposes shut \ndown the Government, or certain branches of Government, and deprive our \ncitizens of much needed benefits and services provided by the \nGovernment and sort of have a showdown with the Congress. The other \nchoice was to send forth a package of rescissions and hope that the \nCongress would act. Two things have happened since the Congress was not \nrequired to act. One is that Congress has simply not acted. That has \nbeen more and more the case since President Ford's administration, and \nthe other is to take a rescission request on the part of the President \nand then change it all around so that it bears no recognition to the \noriginal rescission request made by the President.\n  So what we have really done is removed a check and balance that was \nfundamentally in place for nearly 200 years. Now what we are seeking to \ndo is restore that balance and restore that check so that some fiscal \nsanity is restored.\n  Mr. President, I can thumb through this book and find most anything \nin here. Some of them I say are amusing. Electric vehicles--$15 million \nfor electric vehicles. That is out of the Defense appropriations bill; \n$15 million. That was last year. I know that electric vehicles are \nprobably something of the future. I hope that we will be able to \ndevelop them. I believe that they are probably important. But I am not \nsure where they fit into our defense requirements when we have 20,000 \nmen and women in the military on food stamps, when we have not enough \nsteaming hours or flying hours or training hours or pay raises for our \nmilitary. But we want to spend $15 million on electric car development \nout of the Defense appropriations bill.\n  I can pick out from any page of that several hundred pages of these \nprojects. My point is that for many of these projects, if the sponsors \nof these particular lines knew that a President of the United States \nwould say, ``Here is the electric car. I do not know if they are needed \nor not, but we sure don't need to take it out of defense because we are \nhaving to cancel every modernization program and weapons system that we \nhave and we do not have enough money to maintain readiness. We are \nhaving trouble recruiting, and we need to have more money for that. And \nelectric cars just is not my priority. So I am line-item vetoing it,'' \nI would suggest to you that the person who put that particular \nappropriation in with the best of intentions would certainly think \ntwice before putting it in, especially if it was not deemed a priority \nby the Department of Defense.\n  Let me also point out that there are other projects which are worthy \nprojects.\n  By the way, one just jumps out at me: The shrimp aquaculture, $3.54 \nmillion for shrimp aquaculture. And I am astounded to see that one of \nthe States that is getting part of this $3 million is my home State of \nArizona. We have a lot of wonderful things in Arizona but water is not \nin abundance. I am intensely curious--and I will find out, and put a \nstatement for the Record--where the shrimp aquaculture project is in my \nState and how much money we have gotten for it. By the way, this shrimp \naquaculture $3 million is divided up amongst five different States.\n  Again, shrimp aquaculture might be a very vital project for my \nState's economy. I would be surprised to know that. But there are a lot \nof things that I do not know about my State. But if shrimp aquaculture \nis an important part of my State's economy, at least I think I would \nhave known about it or been told about it before I had to read it in \nthe congressional ``Pig Book.'' So this is the kind of thing that in my \nview would never be inserted in an appropriations bill because it would \nbe open to ridicule.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, being on the floor of the Senate and if \nsomebody said, ``You know. We are spending $3 million or part of $3 \nmillion in your State for shrimp aquaculture, what do you think about \nthat?''--I would have to say in all candor I think it may be nice but I \nhave not known in my 12 years of representing the State of Arizona, 4 \nyears in the House and 8 years in U.S. Senate that it was an important \nitem. In fact, in all seriousness I would have a great deal of \ndifficulty defending it on the floor of the Senate if it were line-item \nvetoed by the President.\n  As I say, these items are sometimes amusing. But the reality is I do \nnot think those items would creep in. So when we say how much money \nwould be saved if we had the line-item veto, frankly we will never \nknow. We will never know that. But when I see people like the former \nGovernor, now our colleague, John Ashcroft, who was a very well-\nrespected and regarded Governor of his State, say that he does not \nbelieve that there would have been fiscal sanity in his State during \nhis two terms as Governor had he not had the ability to exercise the \nline-item veto, then I think we should notice that.\n  Mr. President, before this debate is over, we will have letters from \nnearly every one of those 43 out of 50 Governors in America that have a \nline-item veto telling us how important a tool it is for them.\n  Let me just quote from several we have received already.\n\n       Besides providing greater authority to veto . . . the \n     threat of a veto allows great flexibility in negotiating with \n     the legislature or Congress. The key to a good budget is \n     negotiations between both sides. This device is a mechanism \n     for negotiation.\n\n  That is from a Utah Republican, Governor of the State of Utah.\n\n       I support the line-item veto because it is an executive \n     function to identify budget plans and successful items.\n\n  That is from Hugh Carey, a New York Democratic Governor from 1975 to \n1983.\n\n       Congress' practice of passing enormous spending bills means \n     funding for everything from a Lawrence Welk museum to a study \n     of bovine flatulence.\n\n  I am glad Governor Wilson also found that would be one of his \nfavorite slips through Congress.\n\n       The President may be unable to veto a major bill that \n     includes such spending abuses because the majority of the \n     bill is desperately needed. A line-item veto would let the \n     President control the irresponsible spending that Congress \n     cannot. A line-item veto already works at the State level. It \n     not only allows a Governor to veto wasteful spending but it \n     works as a deterrent to wasteful-spending legislators who \n     know it will be vetoed.\n\n  Pete Wilson, Governor of California.\n  I find Pete Wilson's statements most interesting because Pete Wilson, \nas opposed to most, has gone from being a Senator to Governor, rather, \nas many in our body, have been former Governors.\n  But I think it is also important to point out, whether I happen to \nlike it or not, the State of California is by far the largest State in \nAmerica with a population of some 30 million people. If we were looking \nfrom purely a gross national product standpoint, it would be the fifth-\nlargest nation in the world--from a gross national product standpoint. \nAnd the Governor of that State is unequivocally committed to a line-\nitem veto.\n  So I suggest that this Governor of California, Pete Wilson, has also \nhad to struggle with a severe recession in his State and has had to \nmake some very difficult budgetary decisions. I know for a fact because \nhe told me that a line-item veto was a critical arrow in his quiver in \nhis ability to be able to bring his State out of a terrible, terrible \nfinancial recession.\n  ``Legislators love to be loved, so they love to spend money. Line-\nitem veto is essential to enable the executive to hold down spending.'' \nThat was William F. Weld, Governor of Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I happen to remember the days in the late 1980's when \nthe Massachusetts miracle, as they called it, crumbled. I remember when \nthe State of Massachusetts was in terrible shape, and I also know that \nGovernor Weld has gotten well-deserved credit \n[[Page S4087]] for bringing the State of Massachusetts into a situation \nwhere, again, it has a very healthy economy.\n  I think his description is probably a little more blunt than some use \naround here. ``Legislators love to be loved, so they love to spend \nmoney.'' But, at the same time, I am not going to argue with that \nlanguage, even if I might not use it myself.\n  Of course, my favorite of all, obviously, is that of Ronald Reagan \nwho said:\n\n       When I was Governor in California, the Governor had the \n     line-item veto, so you could veto parts of a bill, or even \n     part of the spending in a bill. The President can't do that. \n     I think, frankly--of course, I am prejudice--Government would \n     be far better off if the President had the right of line-item \n     veto.\n\n  Speaking of the President, in December 1992, after President Clinton \nwas elected, an article appeared in the Wall Street Journal and it was \ntitled, ``Where We Agree: Clinton and I on Line-Item Veto,'' by Ronald \nReagan.\n\n       When Bill Clinton called on me the other day, it didn't \n     take us long to find several things we agreed about, such as \n     the line-item veto and trimming the size of Government in \n     some areas. We also agreed on the importance of public-\n     private sector dialog and cooperation in the planning of many \n     Government programs.\n       Soon after the election, President Bush and President-elect \n     Clinton named the leaders of their transition teams, the \n     teams were formed and the process is moving forward in an \n     orderly and completely civil manner.\n       * * * In the course of our meeting, Governor Clinton spoke \n     of his plan to trim the Federal work force through attrition. \n     He wants to begin by downsizing the administrative staff at \n     the White House. And he has invited Congress to do the same \n     with its staff.\n       * * * Both Mr. Clinton and I have had experience with the \n     line-item veto as Governors. Our States, along with 41 \n     others, allow their Governors to delete individual spending \n     items from the annual budget without having to veto the \n     entire thing. At the Federal level, it could become an \n     important part of the system of checks and balances, as well \n     as a significant tool in the deficit reduction process.\n       As President, Bill Clinton may have only a short time in \n     which to get Congress to do his bidding before the new \n     Members are overwhelmed by the impulse to spend more and to \n     dish out pork to please the special interest groups. He \n     should use the ``honeymoon'' period to get the line-item veto \n     from Congress first.\n\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that President Clinton did not take \nPresident Reagan's advice. I am doubly disappointed because I remember, \nwith great clarity, when President Clinton came to have lunch with the \nRepublican Senators shortly after his inauguration, which is the custom \nfor in-coming Presidents--to go to lunch with both Republican and \nDemocrat Senators at their respective luncheons. I remember with great \nclarity, as President Clinton was speaking--and I still remember what a \nfine job he did that day--he said, ``I am looking forward to working \nwith Senator McCain on the line-item veto.'' I must say that I was \nbuoyed by that remark of President Clinton's.\n  Unfortunately, there never was any followup. Unfortunately, when \nSenator Coats and I took up the line-item veto again some 8 or 9 months \nlater and sought to propose it as an amendment, since we were in a \nminority and unable to bring it up as a freestanding bill as we are \nnow, I wrote a letter to the President asking for his support for \nSenator Coats' and my effort. The response I got back was disingenuous \nat best. It said that the President would support a line-item veto only \nwhen it came up as a free-standing bill. He could not provide his \nsupport if it were proposed as an amendment. Obviously, at that time, \nthat was a catch-22 answer because the leadership on that side of the \naisle, which was the majority, was not about to let the line-item veto \nbe brought up. So we were stymied and did not receive the commitment I \nthought I had from the President that day at lunch.\n  Now, Mr. President, we are in a different situation. I do not want to \nconfuse my remarks to ``Mr. President,'' who is presiding in the \nChamber--who perhaps should be President some day--with the President \nof the United States. Mr. President, I am speaking of the President of \nthe United States when I say now is the opportunity of the President of \nthe United States to do what he said in ``putting people first''; but \nhe said ``putting people first,'' which was his campaign commitment to \nthe American people, which was sent around to every library in America. \nIt stated:\n\n       I strongly support the line-item veto because I think it is \n     one of the most powerful weapons we can use in our fight \n     against out of control deficit spending.\n\n  What the President said to me and what the President has said \npublicly and stated on several occasions after the 1994 elections, has \nusually been in the context that ``I want to work with the Congress on \nsome issues,'' and he almost invariably states the line-item veto.\n  Mr. President, we know what the reality is around here. We know we \nwill probably have 54 Republican votes for cloture. The question is, \nWill we have six Democrats? I believe that, at last count, after the \nlast crossover, there are now 46 Members on the opposite side of the \naisle. I am asking the President of the United States to persuade 6 of \nthem--not 46, but 6; not 26, not 36, not even 16, but 6.\n  So the responsibility, to a large degree, will rest on the President \nof the United States. Governor Clinton, on ``Larry King Live,'' said, \n``we ought to have a line-item veto.'' Candidate Clinton emphasized \n``putting people first'' and line-item veto to eliminate pork barrel \nprojects and cut Government waste. He said, ``I will ask Congress to \ngive me the line-item veto.''\n  Mr. President, I hope that the President of the United States will \nweigh in on this issue not only because of the fact that it would make \nhis job a lot easier, because I am convinced that it would, but because \nwe must show some sanity and return ourselves to fiscal sanity. And \nthere is no way of doing that, in my view, without a line-item veto.\n  Let me repeat, Mr. President--and I will say this on many occasions \nin the next few days--we will not balance the budget of the United \nStates with a line-item veto alone. You cannot believe that. But the \nbudget of the United States cannot be balanced without a line-item \nveto. The Chamber of Commerce sent me a letter, Mr. President, which \nsaid:\n\n       Dear Senator McCain:\n       In the next few days, the Senate will consider legislation \n     granting line-item veto authority to the President. The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce--the world's largest business federation, \n     representing 215,000 businesses, 3,000 State and local \n     Chambers of Commerce, 1,200 trade and professional \n     associations, and 72 American Chambers of Commerce abroad--\n     strongly urges you to vote YES on S. 4, the legislative line-\n     item veto.\n       The American business community believes that meaningful \n     long-term deficit reduction can come about only through \n     spending restraint. While a primary weapon in the fight \n     against the deficit is a balanced budget amendment, our \n     arsenal must also include a line-item veto or enhanced \n     rescission authority. Such authority would provide the \n     surgical strike capability necessary to take out specific \n     spending targets.\n       S. 4, true enhanced rescission or legislative line-item \n     veto, would provide the President with the ability to reduce \n     or eliminate specific spending proposals. These cuts would \n     become law unless Congress votes to disapprove the \n     rescissions within a limited period. The President may then \n     veto the disapproval, which Congress can subsequently \n     override with a two-thirds majority vote. With such a \n     framework, S. 4 appropriately restores the impoundment \n     prerogative of every President from Jefferson to Nixon.\n       The American people have placed fiscal responsibility high \n     on the agenda for the 104th Congress. We now urge you to act \n     accordingly by voting YES on S. 4.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Mr. President, while my colleague from Indiana was talking on the \nfloor, I must confess that I did not remain on the floor for all of his \nremarks, which I knew were illuminating and important. I did go in the \nCloakroom, because previously today, a talk show in my State had asked \nto talk to me about the line-item veto. And the talk show host had \nadvertised that I was coming on the show. In the Cloakroom, I spoke on \nthe talk show back in the State of Arizona on KFYI. The talk show \nhost--an individual I have gotten to know very well--named Bob Mohan, \ninformed me that all of the lines had been full since he had mentioned \nthe line-item veto, and that his listeners were overwhelmingly in \nsupport of the line-item veto.\n  Mr. President, he also said something else that I thought was \ninteresting and should be interesting to at least the Members on my \nside of the aisle.\n  He said, ``You know, I am getting a lot of calls and they are saying \nthat \n[[Page S4088]] the Senate is dragging their feet and they are not \nreally doing anything, and that Republicans are not staying together \nand that Republicans are really not committed to the Contract With \nAmerica. Can you allay some of those fears and concerns that we are \nhearing more and more of in our calls from our listeners?''\n  I said to Mr. Mohan, ``Well, I can allay most of those fears. I would \nremind you that it was only one on this side of the aisle, one person \nthat voted against the balanced budget amendment. And we decided in our \nRepublican caucus that a vote of conscience on the part of any Senator \nwas something that we not only would allow but we would respect.''\n  But I did agree with him, to the extent that we are perhaps not \npushing our agenda as hard as we could and as far as we could. At the \nsame time, I attempted to explain that the rules of the Senate are far \ndifferent than from that of the other body.\n  I guess what I am saying, Mr. President, is that we have a lot at \nstake here, not just those of us who reside on this side of the aisle, \nbut I think that Congress has a lot at stake as far as our credibility \nwith the American people.\n  I believe that most Americans believed, after the November 8 \nelections, starting and beginning on November 9, that the Congress of \nthe United States would really fulfill the Contract With America. It is \nthe first time in this century that I know of where a campaign was run \non a national basis where there was commitments to do certain things. \nIt was called a contract.\n  The American people's definition of a contract is an agreement \nbetween two parties which is binding. And some American citizens today \nare wondering if they, as a result of their votes, fulfilled their end \nof the contract and whether we are fulfilling our end of it.\n  Now, I believe we are making great efforts to do so on this side. But \nI would suggest that, after the defeat of the balanced budget \namendment, it would be very, very important for all of us to recognize \nhow serious the line-item veto is. I believe we will revisit the \nbalanced budget amendment, Mr. President. I believe we will revisit it \nand I believe we will pass it because I have to believe that, when the \noverwhelming majority of American public opinion favors such a thing, a \nrepresentative body--even one that plays the role of the saucer where \nthe coffee is cooled--is going to, sooner or later, respond to the \npopular will.\n  Now, the balanced budget amendment is not some mania that swept \nacross the country and everyone said, ``Oh, gee, we need a balanced \nbudget amendment,'' woke up in the morning and decided that.\n  Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment and the line-item veto, \nwhich I consider the crown jewels of the Contract With America, have \nlongstanding, deeply-held support on the part of the American people. \nAnd as they hear more and more and more excerpts from the ``Pig Book,'' \nthey hear more and more times on April 15 that their taxes have gone up \nand up and up, they are now sending more and more of their money to the \nFederal Government in Washington and, in their view, getting less and \nless in return.\n  Mr. President, in 1950, a family of four of median income sent $1 out \nof every $20 they earned to Washington, DC, in the form of Federal \ntaxes. This April 15, that same median-income family of four will send \n$1 out of every $4 that they earn to the Federal Government in \nWashington. And if nothing changes, if nothing changes and we do not \nenact a single new entitlement program, we do not enact a single \nincrease in expenditure, by the turn of the century, that will be $1 \nout of every $3 that they are sending to Washington in the form of \ntaxes.\n  Mr. President, that is an enormous burden on median-income families. \nThen when you add in the State and local taxes, depending on which \nState they reside in, this jumps up to somewhere around 40 to 43 \npercent of their earnings go in the form of taxes. And then, bearing \nthat heavy burden, they turn around and see their money spent on things \nwhich really do not bear the scrutiny of anyone. They see that and they \nrebel and they lose confidence in their elected representatives as a \nbody.\n  And, strangely enough, they even lose confidence and faith in their \nelected representatives as individuals. We saw a strange phenomena in \n1994. It used to always be, how do you feel about Congress? It was very \nlow approval ratings, 10, 30 percent, whatever it was. But we saw a \nvery great phenomena. Even the approval rating of their own elected \nrepresentatives, Congressmen and Senators, also dropped dramatically.\n  And again I want to return though this situation of confidence in \nGovernment.\n  It is fascinating because every nation in the world that has emerged \nfrom oppression and repression, especially those that emerged from \nbehind the Iron Curtain since the Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet \nUnion collapsed, look to the United States as a model for how \ngovernment should be run and how people should be represented and what \nreally liberty and freedom are all about.\n  The students at Tiananmen Square erected a statue of liberty as their \nsymbol of resistance to Communist oppression.\n  One of the most interesting experiences of my life was traveling to \nAlbania and seeing the empty pedestals that once held the statues of \ntheir dictator Hoxha, who was one of the most incredible dictators in \nhistory in Albania, and the words ``Long live Bush'' on the pedestals. \n``Long live Bush.''\n  Everywhere I travel in the world, it is the United States that is the \nrole model--freedom, democracy, all of the things that have to do with \nthe rights of men and women. And yet, here in the United States in \n1994, the place that they all admire, there was a dramatic upheaval. \nAnd that upheaval was largely bred by dissatisfaction with Government; \nnot satisfaction, dissatisfaction and outright anger.\n  Now, Mr. President, a lot of that anger was understandably focused on \nthe fact that their money was not being well spent. And not only not \nbeing well spent, it was wasted.\n  American families, many of them, over the last 10 to 15 years, \nexperienced a real decrease in income. And that has been the case with \nmany middle-American families. They have received increases in salary, \nbut it has not kept up with inflation, it has not kept up with the \ntaxes, it has not kept up with other things, and they find themselves \nrunning in place. And when that happens to American families, two bad \nthings happen. One is, they lose confidence in their children's futures \nand they lose confidence in their Government.\n  The most astounding and alarming exit polling data of the 1994 \nelection was this: for the first time since we have been taking polls, \na majority of the American people believe that their children will not \nbe better off than they are.\n  Mr. President, the essence of the American dream was that someone \ncomes here from someplace else, they may come to Ellis Island, live in \na ghetto in New York or Chicago, or some other place, and live under \nthe most terrible conditions. But they work and save and they improve \nthemselves and their own lives and most importantly provide an \nopportunity for their children. That is what America is all about. \nStory after story after story of poor people who come here penniless \nand they work and sacrifice and their dreams are fulfilled in their \nchildren. And now, most Americans believe that their children are not \ngoing to be as well off as they are.\n  How does all of this diatribe come back to the line-item veto? It \nmeans that unless we restore confidence in the American people in their \nGovernment, we are not going to restore the American dream.\n  Is a line-item veto all of that? No, clearly. But if we continue to \nfail to make the reforms that are necessary that will restore that \nconfidence, then there will not be a restoration of the American dream.\n  Mr. President, I mean it. I mean it.\n   I run into my fellow Arizonans every weekend when I am home, and \nthey say, ``Why are you doing this? I didn't send you there to do \nthat.'' Maybe I, individually, had not done that, but we as a Congress \nhave.\n\n  Maybe it is only a few million here. Maybe it is only $15 million for \nthe electric car; maybe only $3 million for the aquaculture shrimp \ncenter, whatever it is; maybe it is only a small \n[[Page S4089]] amount of money when we are talking about a $1.5 \ntrillion budget.\n  To the average citizen, $3 million is a lot of money. To the average \ncitizen, $15 million for electric cars is a lot of money. One of the \nthings that I find most jading about our experiences here is how we \nthrow around big numbers, $100 million here, $1 billion there, $2 \nbillion there, this for that program. After a while, it kind of loses \nits meaning. It is sort of like being at a crap table in a casino and \nplaying only with chips, until you lose all the chips and then figure \nout that it was real money. I must say I have done that, too, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The fact is that the American people expect Congress to exercise \nfiscal sanity. There is a lot at stake here in this debate. There is a \nlot at stake--not because Senator Coats and I have worked for 10 years \non this issue and obviously we feel very strongly and subjective about \nthis issue--but it is important and critical, this issue is, because it \nis important and critical to the American people.\n  I hope that we can continue to conduct this debate, when the debate \nbegins, on a very high plane. We can go a couple ways in this debate. I \nam not going to impugn anybody's integrity. I am not going to impugn \nanyone's motives. But I will make it perfectly clear what we have done \nsince 1974. And what we have done is not a great service to the \nAmerican people. In fact, it is a great disservice.\n  I hope that working with the people of the United States, working \nwith some like-minded individuals such as Senator Feinstein from \nCalifornia who is a cosponsor of this bill, and working together, we \ncan persuade a sufficient number of our colleagues to cut off debate, \nin the form of invocation of cloture, and move forward with passage of \nthe bill.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have talked with the majority leader, who \nobviously controls our activities here on the floor. The majority \nleader does not intend, and I agree with him, to drag out this debate \nfor weeks as we did the balanced budget amendment.\n  This issue is very well known, Mr. President. It is not really a very \ncomplex issue. It is not nearly as complex as a number of issues that \nwe address in a much shorter period of time on the floor of the Senate. \nThe majority leader wants Members to put in long hours and put in a \nvery few number of days and get this issue passed and behind us, \nbecause we do have a very large agenda. We do have a lot of issues that \nthe American people expect the Senate to address.\n  I hope that we will maintain a high level of debate. I hope that we \nwill put in long evenings, if it is necessary to do so. I hope in a \nvery relatively short period of time we will be able to resolve this \nissue.\n  If we cannot resolve this issue favorably and enact a line-item veto, \nthen, obviously, Senator Coats and I will not give up our quest for \nthis very, very, very crucial measure. At the same time, it would be \nrather pleasant for both Senator Coats and I to move on to other issues \nwhich also would command our attention.\n  I would like to say I appreciate the patience of the President in the \nchair. I know the hour is late. I want to thank him for that.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/16/senate-section/article/S4080-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4089-S4091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               A CHECKLIST APPROACH TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER.

Mr. President, on occasion, like other Members of this \nbody, I am pleased to take the opportunity to recognize residents of my \nhome State who have made significant contributions to their community. \nThese comment are then included in the Congressional Record where they \nbecome a permanent part of our Nation's history.\n  Today, I am proud to recognize a native Nevadan, and a good friend, \nJohn Byrne, on the occasion of his retirement. Throughout his career as \nan electrician and labor official, John has exemplified the traits of \nexcellence and leadership.\n  John grew up in the historic mining town of Virginia City, NV, \ngraduating from Storey County High School in 1943. After completing his \nelectrical apprenticeship in Medford, OR, he returned to Reno where he \nwas employed by Landa Electric as general foreman. In 1951, he \ntransferred his union membership to IBEW Local 401 in Reno.\n  During the next 6 years, John earned the respect and admiration of \nhis fellow electrical workers and, in 1957, as elected financial \nsecretary and business manager of the local. He held this position \nuntil 1966 when he accepted the appointment as secretary and business \nrepresentative of the Northern Nevada Building Trades Council, a \nposition he held until 1971. Following an interim appointment as \nsecretary/business representative of the Honolulu Building Trades \nCouncil, he returned to Reno and was reelected financial secretary and \nbusiness manager of IBEW Local 401.\n  In addition to these professional achievements, John has also been \nactive in civic and community affairs. He has served on the Washoe \nCounty Building Code Appeal Board, the Reno Electrical Board of \nExaminers, the Nevada Employment Security Board of Review, the Nevada \nState Apprenticeship Council, as chairman of the Nevada OSHA Review \nBoard, and as president of the California State Electrical Association.\n  As a member of the Governor's Committee for the Restoration of \nVirginia City, he played an active role in the preservation of the \nhistoric Fourth Ward School and other projects that preserved our \nState's early history. He has also served as a member of the Virginia \nCity Volunteer Fire Department and has been named to the Virginia High \nSchool Hall of Fame for outstanding achievement.\n  John Byrne's reputation in the State is reflected in an award \nbestowed upon him by the Associated General Contractors for Skill, \nIntegrity, and Responsibility. John is the only labor representative in \nNevada history to be recognized with the S.I.R. award.\n  On March 30, 1995, John will be honored by his friends and coworkers \nat a luncheon in Reno, NV. It is a privilege for me to recognize his \nachievements, and his dedication and commitment to the State and his \nprofession. On behalf of all Nevadans, I wish him the best for his \nfuture goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/16/senate-section/article/S4091-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of South \nDakota's dedicated educators, Max Hawk of Yankton. For the past 38 \nyears, Hawk has been a teacher and a coach, serving in Scotland for 8 \nyears and Yankton for the remaining 30. While admired and respected as \na committed teacher, he is best known in South Dakota for his exemplary \nskill as a football coach. Hawk earned 284 career gridiron victories, \nmaking him second on South Dakota's all-time list. His teams have \nearned eight State titles, including the Class 11AA title this past \nfall, and 20 conference titles. In all those years, his teams only had \none losing season.\n  Hawk is not only respected by his students and players, but also by \nhis peers nationwide. He has been awarded many honors, including being \ninducted into the South Dakota High School Coaches Association Hall of \nFame in 1979 and being named National High School Football Coach of the \nYear in 1986.\n  When Max Hawk retires this spring, South Dakota will be losing a \ngreat asset. However, his legacy of excellence will live on for years \nto come. I join with the citizens and students of Yankton and South \nDakota who honor Max Hawk for his devotion to his profession, his \ncommunity, and his State.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place an article about Mr. \nHawk from the Sioux Falls Argus Leader in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4092]]\n\n                 [From the Argus Leader, Oct. 26, 1994]\n\n                          Hawk's Final Flight\n\n                           (By Brian Kollars)\n\n       The final bell at Yankton High School has sounded. Class is \n     out, and Max Hawk is putting on his game face.\n       It's time for football practice, and the Bucks' legendary \n     coach is suddenly rejuvenated. Hawk is 61, but he briskly \n     exits his office and leaves behind the walls covered with \n     portraits of past YHS stars.\n       His first stop: the locker room.\n       ``Come on Bucks,'' he snaps. ``You guys are getting slower \n     every day.''\n       Hawk, with longtime assistant Jim Miner flanking him, \n     breezes past the sign that reads ``Your Mother Doesn't Work \n     Here, Clean Up After Yourself,'' and finds the stairway that \n     takes him out of the basement classroom into the soothing \n     sunlight.\n       Time for some philosophy.\n       ``You can always tell a freshman or sophomore--they'll have \n     their shirt out and they'll be walking to practice,'' Hawk \n     laments, ``Varsity guys run.''\n       So do coaches, so Hawk and Miner are off. They dodge cars \n     in the student parking lot and quickly reach the place where \n     they are most at ease: the football field.\n       Max Hawk is in his 38th and final season as a high school \n     football coach. His two-syllable name says a lot about him: \n     no nonsense and to the point. It's also synonymous with \n     football in Yankton, a town that has responded favorably to \n     its coach's stern style.\n       ``The kids here all want to play football,'' Hawk said. \n     ``The town and school expect them to play, and they expect a \n     winner.''\n       The Bucks, who host Lincoln Thursday in a Class IIAA \n     playoff opener, have won 228 games during Hawk's 30-year run. \n     Add five mythical state championships and two playoff titles \n     and you have a resume as powerful as Yankton's running game.\n       Hawk's 271 career victories put him second on South \n     Dakota's all-time list. Only Howard Wood, whose career at \n     Washington High began in 1908 and ended in '47, has more wins \n     (286).\n       The Bucks' boss says he hasn't lost his enthusiasm for the \n     game, but will make a clean break when the playoffs conclude.\n       ``I'm tired of the long days and the routine of teaching \n     and coaching,'' he said. ``A lot of people get burned out and \n     bitter. I don't want to do that.''\n       What Hawk does yearn for is a return trip to the DakotaDome \n     and a shot at his eighth state title. He'll try to get there \n     using the same old plays and formations.\n       ``I'm still winning games with the same stuff I used 35 \n     years ago,'' Hawk said. ``If that's old-fashioned, yeah, I'm \n     old-fashioned.''\n       The same playbook?\n       ``We try to convince people of that, so when we put in a \n     new play they're not ready for it,'' Miner says.\n       Hawk quickly points to the continuity of his coaching staff \n     when talking about Yankton's success. There's Milner, his \n     defensive coordinator for 29 years. Sophomore/freshman coach \n     Ray Kooistra, who also is retiring, has been with Hawk 28 \n     years.\n       Longtime assistant Gary Satter died of cancer last winter. \n     It was one reason Hawk announced his retirement before this \n     season started.\n       ``When Gary Satter died, we had to replace him,'' Hawk \n     said. ``If everyone knew I would stay for just one year, we'd \n     get good applicants.''\n       The new man on the staff is Arlin Likness, who guided \n     Hamlin to three Class 11B titles before joining the Bucks.\n\n\n                             close to home\n\n       Hawk, who grew up in Wessington Springs and was a standout \n     center and linebacker at Northern State, began his career at \n     Scotland in 1957.\n       He wasn't your normal raw recruit. In addition to a \n     football background, Hawk had military experience, logging \n     two years with a helicopter crew during the Korean War.\n       ``My claim to fame was we took part in the atomic and \n     nuclear tests,'' Hawk said. ``I got to witness three atomic \n     bombs go off.''\n       Scotland got to witness Hawk in his formative coaching \n     years.\n       Joe Foss was residing in the governor's mansion, Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower was dealing with integration problems in Little \n     Rock and Hawk was winning 13 of his first 15 games.\n       Hawk turned down more money from Faith to coach in Scotland \n     because he wanted to mold an 11-man program. He also had an \n     offer to coach in Lovell, Wyo., but opted to stay in South \n     Dakota.\n       ``You know, one time me and my wife drove out there to see \n     what we missed and it was beautiful, right by Yellowstone \n     Park,'' Hawk said of Lovell, located in northwest Wyoming.\n       The view wasn't as spectacular in the South Eastern South \n     Dakota Conference, but Hawk was too busy to notice. When it \n     wasn't football season, Hawk was helping his mentor, Pete \n     Baker, coach basketball. The two split track and field duties \n     down the middle.\n       Hawk and his wife, Jane, also began a family, and had all \n     three of their children by the time Yankton came calling in \n     1965.\n\n\n                               buck power\n\n       Hawk lost seven games in his first two seasons at Yankton, \n     but in 1970 the Bucks went 9-0 and were mythical state \n     champions. Hawk's reputation had solidified. He was tough, \n     but fair. His teams were fundamentally sound, and big.\n       That combination has worked wonders in Yankton, which has \n     come to expect victories at Crane-Youngworth Field like water \n     running down the Missouri River. Hawk dishes out the \n     discipline--freshmen are ``dumb freshmen,'' no matter how \n     brilliant they were in middle school--and his teams grind out \n     the wins.\n       Yankton enjoyed back-to-back 9-0 seasons in 1975-76. In \n     seven autumns from '79 to '85, the Bucks went 67-8. Yankton \n     won state playoff titles in '82 and '84.\n       Hawk, the national coach of the year in 1986, can be a very \n     intimidating hurdle for a wide-eyed 14-year-old who has heard \n     all the stories about the high school drill sergeant, but he \n     stands by his successful philosophy.\n       ``I know this,'' he said, ``I expect more out of kids than \n     they expect out of themselves.''\n       Hawk is at his best when motivating. He said he got \n     physical with a student in anger just once, at Scotland.\n       ``I had a kid one time and I tore his shirt off,'' Hawk \n     said. ``I didn't mean to, and he and I had some fierce words. \n     I thought I might've made an enemy for life.''\n       That football player went on to serve in Vietnam and was \n     wounded, Hawk said. When he got home, his first order of \n     business was to seek out his ex-coach. He came in peace.\n       ``He said things he learned in football might have saved \n     his life,'' Hawk said.\n\n\n                             halftime talks\n\n       When any of Hawk's players get together and talk about the \n     glory days, it doesn't take long for them to focus on that \n     brief break between the second and third quarters.\n       If Yankton is behind at halftime, get ready for the volcano \n     to erupt.\n       ``I always measure his halftime talks on a 1-to-10 basis,'' \n     said Duane Reaney, who signed on as Yankton's team doctor in \n     1980. ``When he has a 10, the roof almost comes off.\n       ``I've seen sophomores and juniors wide-eyed at halftime, \n     while the seniors may be twiddling their thumbs because \n     they've heard it before.''\n       Miner, one of Hawk's possible successors, says the Bucks \n     don't mind the turned-up volume.\n       ``Our kids like to have Max give his halftime talks when he \n     gets fired up,'' Miner said.\n       Mike Kujak, an All-State fullback in '82, always seemed to \n     be in Hawk's line of fire and heard more than a few ``that's \n     terrible'' lines.\n       ``He coached everybody different,'' Kujak said. ``Some \n     people he'd yell at, like me. Other guys he'd pat on the \n     back. He made you want to work harder.\n       ``Everybody took a piece of Max Hawk with them.''\n       Says Hawk: ``They say I'm tough on kids. I bite 'em in the \n     butt, but 30 seconds later I'm on to something else.\n       ``Kids know if they screw up they might as well come and \n     talk to me, because I'll find them on the sidelines.''\n       Hawk has been known to haul off and kick anything in sight \n     during his speeches. Twenty-five years ago in Watertown, he \n     met his match when he picked out a bench that was bolted to \n     the floor. Hawk kicked, and broke a toe.\n       ``He kicked it and it never moved,'' said Doug Nelson, a \n     1970 All-State halfback and father of current Bucks star \n     Jason Nelson. ``He never said anything and walked out. We \n     made a big comeback and won, and on the way home nobody said \n     anything.''\n       The road trip is still vivid in Hawk's memory.\n       ``The damn bench was attached,'' he said. ``I remember how \n     much it hurt, but I didn't flinch.''\n       Hawk can do more than talk a good game. He's been known to \n     give his players first-hand demonstrations on the practice \n     field.\n       ``If there's a certain play I want done, I'll run the \n     quarterback on the scout team,'' he said. ``I've got a \n     terrible arm, but I can run the option play.''\n       He can also punt. Well, sort of.\n       Pat Lynch, an All-State defensive end, recalled one rainy \n     day in '72 when Hawk took matters into his own hands.\n       ``He was trying to find someone who could punt the football \n     35 yards,'' Lynch said. ``He said `Hell, hike me the ball.' \n     He kicked it and it went sailing. His feet went out from \n     under him and he landed on his butt in the mud.\n       ``Everybody wanted to laugh, but you could've heard a pin \n     drop. He got up and kicked it again, about 45 yards, and said \n     `That's how you do it.'''\n       There weren't a whole lot of laughs that year. Yankton went \n     4-5, Hawk's only losing season. Lynch, who lives in Sioux \n     Falls, got an earful.\n       ``I got hell at halftime several times,'' he said. ``He \n     pointed right at me, looking for a little leadership.''\n       The Lynch family provided plenty of help for Hawk. Pat was \n     one of four Lynch brothers who were All-State performers. \n     Dan, who played at Nebraska, was a high school All-American.\n\n\n                              grandpa max\n\n       By all accounts, Hawk has mellowed somewhat. But he can \n     still get his point across with that trademark glare, \n     complemented by the craggy nose and gray hair.\n       Yes, gray hair. Hawk, you see, is a grandpa. His daughter, \n     Jenny Heirigs, has two sons: Colter, 3, and Stetson, 1 \n     month. \n     [[Page S4093]] Two years ago at a game in Brookings, Hawk \n     stunned those close to him with a tender act.\n       ``In the middle of the fourth quarter, in the middle of the \n     game, he turned around and found his grandson and waved,'' \n     recalls Hawk's daughter, Lynne Tramp. ``Everybody's mouth \n     dropped.''\n       Hawk adores his grandsons, who have been regulars at Buck \n     games.\n       ``In his first three weeks, (Stetson) has been to two Bucks \n     football games, which, as a grandmother I thought was a \n     little insane,'' Jane said last week.\n       Lynne, who teaches at Whittier Middle School, knows all \n     about her father's tough reputation.\n       ``I dated different guys, but I'm sure a lot of guys were \n     scared to death to talk to me,'' she said. ``And God forbid \n     they call the house.''\n       ``She seemed to have enough dates,'' Hawk said.\n       Hawk's days as Yankton's coach are numbered, and everyone \n     is asking what retirement holds for a guy who's so \n     emotionally tied to teaching football.\n       The old coach isn't too concerned.\n       ``Everybody's worried about what I'm going to do except \n     me,'' Hawk chuckles. ``I can become a full-time sports fan \n     and get along just fine.''\n       But first, there's one last playoff run. And the weather \n     makes no difference to Hawk.\n       ``One thing that amazes me is (Hawk's) enthusiasm under \n     adversity, those nights it's snowing and sleeting out,'' \n     Miner said. ``Max goes up to another level and has a good \n     time, and the kids have a good time.\n       ``He keeps hoping for ugly weather in the playoffs. He \n     thinks the Bucks get tougher then.''\n\n\n                               milestones\n\n       Some out-of-season highlights in Max Hawk's professional \n     career:\n       1968: Named executive secretary of the South Dakota High \n     School Coaches Association.

Mr. President, access to quality health care for all \nshould be a central goal of the American health care system. But for \ntoo often, we fail to achieve it. Lack of access is an especially \nserious problem for people in underserved rural and urban areas.\n  Health insurance coverage for all is an essential part of making good \nhealth care widely available, but it is only a part of the solution. \nThe success of health reform also depends heavily on our ability to \ntrain an adequate number of more health professionals. No health care \nsystem can function effectively without an adequate supply of well-\ntrained and capable physicians and other providers.\n  The past two decades have seen impressive increases in the total \nnumber of health care professionals. The quality of training in \nAmerican medicine is generally superb. Despite these successes, \nhowever, some types of health professionals--particularly those in \nprimary care--remain in short supply, and the distribution of health \nmanpower leaves many parts of the country underserved, or barely served \nat all. The task of maintaining an adequate supply of professionals \nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds, who typically have a strong interest in \nserving underserved communities, remains a major challenge. Millions of \nAmericans, especially the very young and the elderly in underserved \ncommunities, have little or no access to primary and clinical \npreventive health care services.\n  The dual purpose of our current health professions programs is to \ntrain more health professionals in occupations where the supply is too \nlow, and to encourage them to locate and remain in underserved areas.\n  An important subsidiary goal is to assist disadvantaged students and \ninstitutions training these students, in order to expand the \nopportunities of those from disadvantaged backgrounds to enter the \nhealth professionals and to help meet the needs of underserved areas. \nThese are programs that work. As studies have shown again and again, \nhealth providers from disadvantaged backgrounds are far more likely to \npractice their professions in underserved communities. That needed \nresult is enhanced by community-based training, which also encourages \nhealth professionals to stay on in underserved and shortage areas.\n  Training programs under titles VII and VIII of the Public Health \nService Act are the key mechanisms by which the Federal Government \nprovides assistance to medical students and encourages the training of \nhealth professionals to meet national priorities. These programs are \noverdue for consolidation and better targeting, and I commend Senator \nKassebaum on the constructive role she has played in analyzing these \nprograms and proposing meaningful, practical reforms. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with Senator Kassebaum and with the Clinton \nadministration to achieve these goals responsibly and maintain adequate \nlevels of resources. We must advance, rather than undercut, the central \ngoal of these two titles of the Public Health Service Act--to train a \nhealth work force that can meet the needs of the American people.\n  This important legislation will enhance the quality of the Nation's \nhealth professions work force and, by doing so, it will drastically \nimprove the health and well-being of our people. I look forward to its \nenactment.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/16/senate-section/article/S4093-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:56 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to provide a tax credit for families, to provide \ncertain tax incentives to encourage investment and increase savings, \nand to place limitations on the growth of spending; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n     THE FAMILY INVESTMENT RETIREMENT SAVINGS AND TAX FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this morning we rise to introduce \nlegislation to put the American family first. Mr. President, I send to \nthe desk legislation which will do just that and will explain its \ncontent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  Mr. COATS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol already have begun to \ntake action on many of the reforms that I have laid out in this \nlegislation. But now it is time for the Senate to deliver on a promise \nand give family tax relief to hard-working, overtaxed middle Americans.\n  Over that past few years Americans have heard a lot of talk about tax \nrelief \n[[Page S4095]] but they have yet to see Washington act on their \npromises. Today, Mr. President, we signal our intent to not just talk \nabout, but to act upon tax relief for our citizens, especially our \nfamilies.\n  This legislation is a blueprint that shows that deficit reduction and \ntax relief can go hand-in-hand. These goals are not mutually exclusive \nif Congress is willing to make the hard choices necessary to put our \nfiscal house in order. We clearly need to restore fiscal integrity and \neconomic soundness to the budget process. We need the kind of change \nthat will force Congress to act differently by rewriting the ground \nrules of the game. For too long we have chosen to take the easy road by \nputting off or ignoring the frugal spending path that over and over we \nhave laid out but failed to adhere to.\n  This legislation we introduce today includes a real sequester \nprovision so that if Congress once again cannot make the hard spending \nchoices they will be made anyway. The Family, Investment, Retirement, \nSavings and Tax Fairness Act--families first--charts a different course \nand reorders our spending priorities.\n  Last year's election proves that the American people are fed up with \nthe status quo--they want action. Action taken to eliminate the deficit \nand the ever growing debt that we are burdening our children with and \naction to relieve them of the taxes that are stifling their quality of \nlife and leaving them with less and less in every pay check.\n  Families first recognizes three central principles.\n  First, American families are overtaxed. High taxes rob families of \nthe resources needed to care for children.\n  Second, the private sector, not government creates jobs. We must \nreduce the cost of capital and encourage productive investment by \nreducing the tax on growth. We will find new jobs in a growing economy, \nnot in a growing government.\n  Third, the American people want deficit reduction upfront--obviously \nthe President did not hear that message. His fiscal year 1996 budget \njust keeps reinventing the same spending cuts that will take place some \ntime in the future. Is this any kind of leadership when the Nation's \ndebt now stands at over $4.7 trillion? That is over $18,500 for every \nman, woman, and child in this Nation. This is a carefully planned, \nmeticulously documented theft from our children.\n  Specifically, the families first bill does the following:\n  First, it provides relief to American families with children through \na tax credit of $500 per child;\n  Second, it provides incentives for businesses to create jobs, \nincluding a reduced capital gains tax rate, a neutral cost recovery \nplan for capital investments, and expanded IRA's;\n  Third, it repeals the retirement earnings test on older Americans;\n  Fourth, it places a 2 percent cap on the growth of Federal spending;\n  Fifth, it creates a commission, modeled after the Base Closure \nCommission, to identify the legislative changes needed to meet the cap. \nIf Congress fails to approve the commission's plan by a date certain, \nthe cap would be enforced by sequester, holding Social Security \nharmless.\n  The bill is not only entirely paid for by the spending cap--our plan \ncuts the deficit by half in 5-years, eliminating it altogether in less \nthan 10 years.\n  I would like to take a moment to discuss the family tax credit \ncomponent of this plan which addresses an inequity that has been \ndeveloping for decades.\n  Families are finding it more and more difficult to bear the financial \ncosts of raising children. According to Family Economics Review, the \naverage American family it faces costs of between $4,000 and $5,000 per \nyear, per child.\n  This is because, over the last several decades, tax burdens have been \nradically redistributed, not from poor to rich or rich to poor, but \ndirectly on families with children.\n  The facts are these. Adjusting for inflation, single people and \nmarried couples with no children pay about the same percentage of their \nincome in taxes as they did at the end of World War II. In 1948, the \ntypical family of four paid just 3 percent of its income to the Federal \nGovernment in direct taxes. In 1992, the equivalent family paid nearly \n24.5 percent of its income to the Federal Government. This is an \nincrease of over 717 percent. It is time to restore fairness in the Tax \nCode.\n  The reason is simple. The personal exemption--the way the Tax Code \nadjusts for family size--has been eroded by inflation and neglect. The \nexemption that once protected families with children has fallen \nsignificantly in the last six decades. Currently, the personal \nexemption is $2,450 if this had kept pace with inflation the personal \nexemption would be over $7,000.\n  Many households now have two working parents who spend greater \namounts of time away from their children out of simple necessity. \nRising healthcare and education costs in particular place the family \nunder great financial pressure.\n  This tax burden translates into less time that families can spend \ntogether. Families have 40 percent less time to spend together today \nthan they did 25 years ago. Families are clearly working harder, \nlonger, for less.\n  A $500-per-child tax credit would give a family of four over $80 a \nmonth extra for groceries, school clothes for the kids, or savings for \neducation, et cetera. Our bill will reduce the tax burden, allowing \nfamilies to keep more of their hard earned dollars. It will empower \nfamilies to make their own choices and rely less on government; 50 \nmillion children are eligible for this credit. In my own State of \nIndiana, 1.1 million children are eligible, enabling Hoosier families \nto keep $555 million of their hard earned money each year.\n  Advocating family tax relief, President Clinton said, ``$400, people \nsay it's not very much money. I think it is a lot of money. It is \nenough for a mortgage payment. It is enough for clothes for the kids, \nand enough to have a big, short-term impact on the economy.''\n  No change is more urgent for average families than tax reform. \nIncreased taxation on families with children is a tool of the bully, \npicking on the weak. For larger families it has meant a recession in \nboth good times and bad, a recession that\n never seems to end. But for decades families have suffered quietly.\n\n  There are many programs like the earned income tax credit designed \nspecifically to help impoverished families--as there should be. This \ncommitment is constant and important. But we must not forget that it is \nmiddle income families who have not only been forgotten, but given \nextra financial burdens. It is time to target this group for relief--as \nwe have done in the past for others. Over 85 percent of the family tax \nrelief provided by this credit goes to Americans with family incomes of \nless than $75,000. This relief is not a handout. It is a matter of \nsimple justice. It is a return to tax fairness.\n  This plan tackles the two great threats to the American family--the \nbudget deficit and the ever growing tax burden. In addition, it \nrecognizes that only a growing economy will provide jobs. It recognizes \nthat high taxes bleed an economy of its productive power. They strip \nindividuals of incentive and devalue their work.\n  For too long we have dismissed their needs to answer the calls of \nother interests. I hope my colleagues will join us in this fight for \nthe American family. We must give them the tax relief they deserve.\n\n\n                        key facts on tax credit\n\n  Fifty million children eligible for the credit.\n  It eliminates the total tax burden for families making less than \n$23,000.\n  Some 4.7 million families would have their tax liability eliminated.\n  Mr. President, over the past few years Americans have heard a lot of \ncampaign promises and a lot of talk about tax relief, but they have yet \nto see Washington act on these promises.\n  Today, Mr. President, in sending this legislation to the desk for \nconsideration, we signal our intent to not just talk about tax relief \nbut to act upon it for our citizens, and especially for our families.\n  I am pleased that this morning my new Senate colleague, Senator Grams \nfrom Minnesota, who joined with me in the last Congress as a Member of \nthe House of Representatives in sponsoring this legislation, has joined \nus and will be joining me in advancing this legislation before this \nbody.\n  Already our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol have begun to \ntake \n[[Page S4096]] action on many of the reforms that are laid out in this \nlegislation. Now it is time for the Senate to deliver on a promise made \nby so many to give family tax relief to the hard-working, overtaxed, \nmiddle-income Americans.\n  This legislation is a blueprint that shows that deficit reduction, \nwhich surely we must engage in, and tax relief can go hand in hand. \nThese goals are not mutually exclusive, if we are willing to make the \nhard choices necessary to put our fiscal house in order but in doing so \nrecognizing the impact on the average American family today and their \nneed for substantive relief and deal with the burdens and expenses of \nraising children in today's society.\n  Our efforts are incorporated in legislation with the acronym FIRST. \nFIRST stands for family, investment, retirement savings, and tax \nfairness. It combines efforts to address a glaring deficiency in our \nTax Code, a deficiency that robs middle-income Americans of hard-earned \ndollars to spend as they see fit and as they see the need to raise \ntheir children, to pay the mortgage, to rent the apartment, to make the \ncar payments, to buy the clothes, to save for the education, to meet \nthe needs, the ever-growing needs, of their ever-growing children.\n  It combines that relief with real, meaningful incentives for the \nbusiness enterprises of America, to expand, to accumulate capital and \nto create the jobs which those children will be seeking as soon as they \nfinish their education. And it adds to that relief for our senior \ncitizens who are able and want to keep working beyond retirement age \nbut whose income is severely eroded by the offsets that are required \nunder the current law. We lift the earnings requirement so that those \nseniors that are willing and are able to continue working beyond \nretirement can do so without penalty.\n  There are incentives for contributions to an IRA, an IRA designed to \nhelp with those burdens and those expenses of providing for education \nand providing for the purchase of a home and other needs.\n  It does so with the recognition that we have to pay real attention to \nthe ever-growing debt burden which is saddling this generation, and \nparticularly future generations, with a debt and an interest cost that \nthey may be unable to pay and that will surely limit their \nopportunities in the future.\n  Deficit reduction is a serious effort that must be undertaken by this \nCongress and not future Congresses. So we are trying to reconcile two \nvery important goals, and we think we have done that in this first \nlegislation, because combined with these incentives for family relief \nand for business growth and for help for our seniors, combined with \nthis is an effort to rein in the costs--excessive costs--of the \nspending of this Congress and of this Government, by placing a cap on \nthe overall rate of growth.\n  I want to stress that phrase ``rate of growth.'' Those who say that \nwe need to drastically slash this and that, and take money away from \nthis program or that program, are not recognizing the reality that if \nwe simply limit the rate of growth of Government spending, we can free \nup money to provide significant deficit reduction, put us on a path to \na balanced budget and, at the same time, reorder our priorities and \ndirect funds into areas where they are needed the most.\n  Our job as elected representatives is to wisely, efficiently, and \neffectively spend the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars and make sure that \nthose dollars spent at the Federal level are spent in a way that gives \nus the best results. We have been pointing to a whole number of \nprograms that are marginal at best and, clearly, as we look at limiting \nthe rate of growth of the Federal Government, we will need to look at \nour priorities.\n  There are some programs that probably are not performing the service \nthat was intended and they ought to be flat out eliminated. They no \nlonger are needed or are not doing the job. Other programs have \nmarginal benefit but do not rank high in the priority list. I suggest \nthat those programs need to be reduced in the amount of expenditures \nand amount of budget they are given each year. Some may be 1 or 2 \nyears, some may be 5, 10, some 30--who knows. We need to look at the \neffectiveness of those programs and reduce that spending. Others ought \nto be frozen. They are providing an effective service, but we cannot \nafford to continue increasing them at the past rate, so let us freeze \nat the current level.\n  Yes, Mr. President, there are probably some programs that ought to be \nincreased because they are meeting necessary needs for Americans. They \ngo to important programs and they deserve an increase. With the first \nbill, we are saying let us put an overall cap on the rate of growth at \nabout 2 percent, and in doing so let us back it up with a spending \ncommission that will recommend cuts and provide the mechanism, as we \nhave done in base closing, to ensure that Congress lives up to its \npromise. If we do that, as I said, we can balance the budget over a \nnumber of outyears--roughly 8 years--we can balance the budget. We can \nalso reprioritize our spending in the areas that I have talked about--\nfamily relief, investment in new jobs, help for our seniors, and some \nother important programs.\n  The core of this program is the family relief. Families today are \nstruggling to meet ever-rising tax demands. American families are \novertaxed, and they rob our families of the resources needed to care \nfor children.\n  In 1948, a typical family of four paid just 3 percent of its income \nto the Federal Government in direct taxes. In 1992, the equivalent \nfamily paid nearly 24\\1/2\\ percent of its income to the Federal \nGovernment--an increase of over 717 percent. At times, special-interest \ndeductions have been granted to all types of special interests in our \ncountry under our Tax Code. But the most special of all special \ninterests--the family--has been shorted. These other deductions have \nbeen at the families' expense. They are struggling to keep up.\n  Personal exemption has not kept pace. Today, it is $2,450 per \ndependent. If it had kept pace with inflation, it would be well over \n$7,000. Today, families have 40 percent less time to spend with their \nchildren, partly because they are out working trying to make ends meet. \nThey are clearly working harder, longer, for less.\n  The $500 per child tax credit for children under 18 will provide real \nrelief for families struggling to meet the needs of their family and to \npay the bills. It is the central part of the package that we are \nintroducing. Over 85 percent of this family tax relief provided by this \ncredit will go to American families with incomes of less than $75,000. \nThe relief is not a handout. It is a matter of simple fairness and \nsimple justice. It is a return to tax fairness under the code.\n  Surely, Mr. President, as we look at how we spend the taxpayers' \ndollars, as we look at how we reprioritize our spending--and that is \nthe exercise we are going through here in this Congress--surely there \nwill be room, or there should be room, for families. Surely, we can \nfind a way to direct our expenditure of Federal dollars to help \nstruggling families. And we are not giving them the money back. We are \nsaying we are going to allow you to keep more of your hard-earned \ndollars; you are going to be able to send less of your paycheck to \nWashington, and you are going to be able to make the decisions which \nare in the best interests of your children and your family. Surely, in \nall of our debate as to where we spend the taxpayers' dollars and how \nwe spend the taxpayers' dollars, we can make room for the family.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that Senator Grams and I are joined by a \nnumber of our colleagues as original cosponsors. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senators Grams, Craig, Lott, Brown, McCain, Kyl, and \nInhofe be added as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. I also note, Mr. President, that last year, as part of the \nRepublican alternative budget, every Republican Senator voted for that \nRepublican alternative budget which, unfortunately, failed. We did not \nhave enough votes to gain a majority. But the core of that alternative \nRepublican budget was this first bill and the family tax relief, which \nis the heart of that.\n  So I anticipate that most of our colleagues, if not all, will join \nSenator Grams and I. I am so pleased to have him join us in the U.S. \nSenate. He will \n[[Page S4097]] be carrying the ball with all of us, advancing what I \nthink is an extraordinarily important concept and idea.\n  We have terrific support in the House of Representatives. Just 2 days \nago, the Ways and Means Committee reported out a bill with many of \nthese features, the central part of that bill. So it is now time for \nthe Senate, Mr. President, to act on its promises, to fulfill its \ncommitment, and to put families at the centerpiece of the actions that \nwe take this year.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield my time and yield whatever time the \nSenator from Minnesota wishes to consume.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have 20 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nSenators from Indiana and Idaho this morning, and a number of the other \nSenators who will be joining us later this morning, to talk about this \nvery important issue--tax cuts--and to help continue the leadership on \nthis most important issue.\n  I am proud to be a coauthor of this very important legislation, \nfamilies first.\n  Mr. President, today we begin a debate that has been too long in \ncoming. The American people are in desperate need of relief from their \nown Government, a Government that thinks it can spend our money better \nthan we can spend our money. It has spent the last four decades just \ntrying to prove that point.\n  In 1947, Americans paid just 22 percent of their personal income in \nthe form of taxes--all taxes--to Federal, State, and local governments, \nincluding property taxes and the like.\n  Today, 40 years and hundreds of tax increases later, nearly 50 cents \nof every dollar earned by middle-class Americans goes to the Government \nto feed Government priorities. ``We will solve all of our problems,'' \nsays Washington, ``if you will just send us more of your money.'' So we \ndo, year after year. We have reached the point now where most families \npay more tax dollars to the Federal Government than they spend for \nfood, clothing, transportation, insurance, and recreation combined.\n  The 1993 Clinton tax bill did not help, either. As the largest tax \nincrease in American history, it hit middle-class Americans right where \nit hurts the most--in their wallets.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is taxes are just too high. The tax \nburden falls too heavily on the middle class. And, Mr. President, the \nresult is that more and more Americans are being forced out of the \nworking class and being forced into the welfare class.\n  But with their ballots last November, Americans called for tax \nrelief. With the change in leadership in Washington, Congress is now \nfinally in a position to deliver on that request.\n  Mr. President, we are taking the first step today with the \nintroduction of the families first act--legislation calling for a $500 \nper child tax credit.\n  The $500 per child tax credit is relief for middle-class America.\n  And I would just like to show one of the few charts that we have out \nhere this morning and talk about what this means.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, families first, if enacted, would \nprovide nearly $500 million every year in tax relief to families across \nthe State of Minnesota--$500 million into the pockets of families and \nindividuals who will decide best on how to spend on those important \nneeds such as food, clothing, shelter, education, or health care. They \nwill make those decisions rather than some bureaucrat 1,100 miles away \nfrom Minnesota in Washington.\n  If you look at the home State of Senator Dan Coats in Indiana and \nwhat this would mean, it would mean for Indiana residents over $550 \nmillion a year in tax relief--$550 million every year. You add this \ntotal, and for all States it would be a $25 billion-a-year tax cut that \nwould go into the pockets of families to decide how to spend. It would \ntake that decisionmaking process out of Washington and put it down \nwhere it really belongs, and that is with the individuals who know best \nhow to handle the problems that their families are facing.\n  As this chart clearly shows, our plan would return, as I said, $25 \nbillion every year to families nationwide. And that includes from $418 \nmillion in Alabama every year to $61 million for the State of Wyoming \nresidents. Again, $500 million a year would be dedicated to families in \nmy home State of Minnesota.\n  Fully more than 90 percent of the tax relief would go to working \nAmericans making annual salaries of $60,000 or less. So this is a plan \nthat is targeted. More than 90 percent of the tax relief goes right to \nthe individuals that have felt the burden the most over the last 30 \nyears, and that is families making $60,000 or less.\n  Most importantly, our $500 per child tax credit would let 53 million \nworking families keep more of their own hard-earned tax dollars. And \n$500 per child adds up to a lot more than just some pocket change.\n  I think, if you pick up the phone and ask many of the constituents in \nyour districts if $500 or $1,000 for two children or $1,500 for three \nchildren would not make a big difference in their finances every year, \nfor middle-income taxpayers, it may mean health insurance for their \nfamilies where there was not any before, or maybe a better education \nfor their children when before there were no other options. To lower \nincome Americans, it may mean not having to pay any taxes at all.\n  Mr. President, there is widespread support also for the $500 per \nchild tax credit among Americans in every income range, in every age \nbracket, among those with children and those without. These are the \npeople who feel the pain every April 15 when they pay their taxes and \nwho think it is time for the Government to feel a little bit of that \npain instead.\n  But how can a government grappling with a $4.8 trillion national debt \nafford tax relief of any kind?\n  Well, the families first bill, which became the centerpiece of the \nbudget plans offered last year by both Senate and House Republicans, \npays for the tax credit by cutting Government spending. Every single \ndollar in tax relief is offset by another dollar in spending cuts.\n  I just want to refer again to the charts for the support that we have \nnationwide for a tax cut proposal. If you look at this one chart and \nyou look at the different age groups, 18 to 25, 76 percent would \napprove of a tax cut. In the age group 26 to 40, 77 percent said, yes, \nlet us have a tax cut. From 41 to 55, over 56 percent, and so on; 62 \npercent for 55 to 65; and, 65 and older, 58 percent said, yes, they \nwould favor tax relief.\n  And if you look at income levels, people below $20,000, said, yes, \nthey would like to have some more tax relief. And in all income groups \nit is either in the 60 or 70 percent range that say yes. So this is \noverwhelming support nationwide by every age group, every income group \nthat really believes we are being taxed too much.\n  And by putting the Federal Government on a strict diet by capping the \ngrowth of Federal spending at 2 percent, we can balance the budget by \nthe year 2002, including the tax cuts. Our bill proves that we can \nafford tax relief at the same time that we begin to restore some fiscal \nsanity to Washington.\n  During the debate ahead, we will hear calls to water down the $500 \nper child tax credit. We will be asked to means test it or to even \nlower the dollar amount. Some will want to limit the ages of the \nchildren eligible, or duck out on real relief by substituting an \nincrease in the personal deduction. Some may oppose tax relief \ncompletely.\n  But that is not what the Americans were promised last year, or what \nthe voters mandated in November. If we backtrack now, we will have to \nface an American public that is tired of being led on by politicians \nwho promise one thing and then never deliver.\n  We have to hold firm on behalf of every American taxpayer and deliver \nthe tax relief that we promised.\n  I want to commend our colleagues on the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, who this week kept the covenant they made with the voters in \nthe Contract With America and passed the $500 per-child tax credit. \nThis was a victory for the taxpayers and a clear signal to the American \npeople that they have not been forgotten by this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I am proud that Senator Coats and our Senate \ncolleagues-- \n[[Page S4098]] what we call the 500 club--will be following up on the \nHouse's good work and fighting for the promises made in November: the \npromises of lower taxes, smaller government, stronger families.\n  Those are the principles embodied by the $500 tax credit--the \nprinciples that will once again put families first.\n  I would like to now yield some time to my good friend and colleague \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of \nthe families first legislation that our colleague, Senator Rod Grams, \nis introducing today. This important legislation would provide badly \nneeded tax relief for American families. It would repeal the Social \nSecurity earnings limitation. It would cut capital gains taxes and \nprovide other pro-growth economic incentives, while still putting the \nbudget on track to balance by the year 2002. It does so by cutting \nspending.\n  Balancing the budget does not mean that taxes have to be increased. \nNor does it preclude consideration of tax cuts. The problem is not that \nthe Federal Government is collecting too little in tax revenue. The \nGovernment is simply spending too much.\n  As a result of the tax increase Congress approved in 1990, Americans \npaid over $20 billion in new taxes. They paid another $35 billion as a \nresult of President Clinton's tax increase in 1993. Taxes increased, \nbut so did Federal spending. It climbed from $1.2 trillion in 1990 to \nabout $1.5 trillion this year, and it will rise to $1.6 trillion next \nyear. That is a 33 percent increase in spending in just 6 years. \nTaxes--which are already too high--will never be high enough to satisfy \nCongress' appetite for spending.\n  Since 1948, the average American family with children has seen its \nFederal tax bill rise from about 3 percent of income to about 24.5 \npercent today. Combined with State and local taxes, that burden rises \nto a staggering 37.6 percent.\n  Senior citizens have been hit hard by tax increases as well. The \nearnings limitation is bad enough, but combined with the 1993 Clinton \ntax increase on Social Security benefits, the marginal rate now \nexperienced by some seniors amounts to 88 percent, twice the rate paid \nby millionaires. That is not taxation. It is confiscation.\n  Mr. President, the American people know what it means to balance a \nbudget--to struggle to make ends meet--and they know better than the \nGovernment how to provide for themselves and their children. Parents \njust want a chance to keep more of what they earn to put food on the \ntable, a roof over their heads, and their kids through school. The $500 \nper child tax credit in the families first bill is no panacea, but it \nis an important step in the right direction.\n  In fact, about 35 million families across the nation would be \neligible for the bill's $500 per child tax credit. Among those who \nwould benefit the most are 4.7 million low-income families who would \nsee their entire Federal tax burden eliminated--4.7 million families.\n  As pointed out in a Heritage Foundation report last year, ``a $500 \nper child tax credit would give a family of four earning $18,000 per \nyear a 33-percent tax cut, and a family earning $40,000 per year a 10-\npercent tax cut, while giving a family earning $200,000 per year a cut \nof only 1.5 percent.''\n  So the families first credit is fair. It targets relief to those who \nneed it most--low- and middle-income families across the Nation. The \nbill also repeals the Social Security earnings limitation which is \ninherently unfair to people who need and deserve their full Social \nSecurity benefits and who also want to work. Not only should the \nearnings test be repealed, the Clinton tax increase on Social Security \nshould be repealed as well.\n  I know there are those who will say that deficit reduction is more \nimportant than tax relief, and they may oppose the bill. I disagree. I \nhave never understood how taking more money out of the pockets of the \nAmerican people can make them better off. Taxing people too much makes \nthem worse off, and it slows down the economy. If the goal is to \nmaximize tax revenues, as opposed to tax rates, then tax relief is not \ninconsistent with the goal of deficit reduction. It is integral to the \ngoal of reducing the deficit.\n  As my colleagues have heard me point out on a number of occasions, \nrevenues to the Treasury have fluctuated around a relatively narrow \nband of 18 to 20 percent of gross national product for the last 40 \nyears. That is despite tax increases and tax cuts, recessions and \nexpansions, and economic policies pursued by Presidents of both \nparties.\n  Since revenue as a share of the gross domestic product is virtually \nconstant, the only way to raise revenue is to enact policies that \nfoster economic growth and opportunity. In other words, 18 to 20 \npercent of a larger GDP represents more revenue to the Treasury than 18 \nto 20 percent of a smaller GDP.\n  That is the basis for these Federal spending limits that I proposed \nin other legislation. It is the reason the tax cuts in the families \nfirst bill make good economic sense. Empower American families and they \ncan do more for themselves and depend less on Government. Cut taxes and \nstimulate the economy and more people can go to work. There will \nactually be more economic activity to tax, more revenue to the \nTreasury, despite the lower tax rates.\n  Last fall, the American people sent a loud and clear message to \nCongress: It is time to end business as usual. They want less \nGovernment, not more. They want tax relief and lower Government \nspending. Let Congress help President Clinton keep the promise he made \nin putting people first, to grant additional tax relief to families and \nchildren. Let Congress pass the families first bill.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas and reserve \nthe last minute for the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank my \ncolleague, Senator Coats, who sponsored this bill last year. I was a \nwilling and hopefully helpful cosponsor. Now we have Senator Grams, a \nnew freshman, who did sponsor it on the House side last year and has \ncome in to cosponsor it this year.\n  This is a very important step that we must take. In 1930, we saw the \nbeginning of the change in course in our country, the beginning of more \nGovernment, bigger Government, more spending, which also brought more \nencroachment on everyone's lives.\n  I think in 1994, the people of America said, ``No, stop. Stop the big \nGovernment growth. Stop the encroachment on our lives. Stop the \narrogance in Washington, DC. Enough is enough.'' They said, ``We want \nto go back to self-help and self-reliance. We want to go back to the \nbasics, and we want the American family to be the strength that it has \nbeen, the fabric of society that it has been, that has brought us to \nthis strong and great America that we have.''\n  We have dissipated so much of the strength of our family through the \ndependence of Government. I remember the story of a woman who was in \nthe grocery store line who said, ``I saw someone using food stamps, \nbuying items of food that I had passed up because I was trying to save \nto buy something for my children, that I had to do as a little bit of \nan extra.''\n  It was that frustration that I think people felt when they went to \nthe polls in 1994 and said, ``We do not think that's right.'' The \npeople who are pulling the wagon, the people who are saying, ``We are \nsaving our money to raise our families, and we are having a hard time \ndoing it,'' wanted a change.\n  The families first legislation will bring about that change, and I \nhave to say that I do admire the Ways and Means Committee and the \nchairman, Bill Archer, who did report a bill out that has many of the \nthings in the families first bill that we are introducing today. \nPerhaps they will pass those in the House first.\n  I will be proud, then, to come in and take some of those items from \nour families first legislation that we are reintroducing today. The \n$500 per child tax credit is something that will help those families \nmake ends meet, the ones who are having a hard time. After \n[[Page S4099]] all, it is their money. It is their money that they have \nworked so hard to earn. Why should they not be able to keep it? Why \nshould they not decide what is best for them, rather than having \nsomeone from Big Brother Government deciding what is best for them.\n  I think if the American people believe that they can manage their own \nresources better than the Federal Government, that we should humor them \nand let them keep their money. That is what the families first \nlegislation will do.\n  I have been a proponent of increasing IRA's, because I think if we \nhelp people retire with security that that will be good for our \ncountry. It is self-help. It is allowing people to have that security \nin their old-age years by encouraging savings, which encourages \ninvestments, which encourages new jobs in this country, too.\n  I have introduced a bill to give homemakers IRA's, and if we can get \nthis families first bill to the floor, I know that Senator Coats and \nSenator Grams are going to support my amendment to have homemakers \nadded to IRA's because that is a very important issue. It is important \nto say that the work done inside the home is every bit as important, if \nnot more important, than the work done outside the home, because that \nis what keeps this country strong--the families, where the families are \ntogether. If the homemaker is staying home and raising children, I \nthink we should reward her efforts, just as much as anyone who is \nworking outside the home.\n  I have seen my colleague, Senator Coverdell, come in, and I want to \nmake sure everyone has a chance to weigh in on this legislation. I will \njust say, Mr. President, that this is families first.\n  It is time to go back to basics, to appreciate how important the \nfamily unit is, that balancing the budget is for the future of our \nchildren and grandchildren. That is a commitment that I have, and all \nwho are cosponsoring this legislation will work to try to make sure \nthat we give to our children and grandchildren the same kind of strong \nAmerica that we were able to grow up in and love. Thank you.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nHutchison as an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to Senator \nGrams.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record copies of the tables we have presented here.\n  There being no objection, the tables were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n                               [Chart 1]\n\n         $500 PER-CHILD TAX CREDIT RETURNS MONEY TO THE TAXPAYER

Mr. President, these charts show strong support from every \nage and income group across the country, their support for a tax cut, \nand also for some information, how much it would mean to each.\n  I say to the good Senator from Texas who just spoke, for families in \nTexas alone, it would be over $1.8 billion a year in tax relief.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished Senators from \nIndiana and Idaho, who I thank for their early and continued leadership \non this most important issue.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from Indiana, and I am proud to be \na coauthor of this important legislation to put families first.\n  Mr. President, today we begin a debate that has been too long in \ncoming.\n  The American people are in desperate need of relief from their own \nGovernment--a Government that thinks it can spend our money better than \nwe can, and has spent the last four decades trying to prove it.\n  In 1947, Americans paid just 22 percent of their personal income in \nthe form of taxes.\n  Today, 40 years and hundreds of tax increases later, nearly 50 cents \nof every dollar earned by middle-class Americans goes to the \nGovernment, to feed the Government's priorities.\n  ``We'll solve all your problems,'' says Washington, ``if you'll just \nsend us more money.''\n  So we do; year after year.\n  We've now reached the point where most families pay more tax dollars \nto the Federal Government than they spend for food, clothing, \ntransportation, insurance, and recreation combined.\n  The 1993 Clinton tax bill didn't help, either. As the largest tax \nincrease in American history, it hit middle-class Americans right where \nit hurt the most--their wallets.\n  Mr. President, taxes are too high.\n  The tax burden falls too heavily on the middle class.\n  And, Mr. President, the result is that more and more Americans are \nbeing forced out of the working class and into the welfare class.\n  But with their ballots in November, Americans called for tax relief. \nWith \n[[Page S4100]] the change in leadership in Washington, Congress is \nfinally in a position to deliver.\n  Mr. President, we are taking the first step today with the \nintroduction of the families first act--legislation calling for a $500 \nper-child tax credit.\n  The $500 per-child tax credit is relief for middle-class America.\n  As this chart clearly shows, our plan would return $25 billion every \nyear to families nationwide, from $418 million in Alabama to $61 \nmillion in Wyoming.\n  $500 million would be dedicated to families in my home State of \nMinnesota.\n  Fully 90 percent of the tax relief goes to working Americans making \nannual salaries of $60,000 or less.\n  Most importantly, our $500 per-child tax credit would let 53 million \nworking families keep more of their own hard-earned tax dollars. And \n$500 per child adds up to a lot more than just pocket change.\n  For middle-income taxpayers, it may mean health insurance for their \nfamilies, where there wasn't any before, or a better education for \ntheir children, when before there were no options.\n  For lower income Americans, it may mean not having to pay any taxes \nat all.\n  Mr. President, there is widespread support for the $500 per-child tax \ncredit among Americans in every income range and every age bracket--\namong those with children and those without.\n  These are the people who feel the pain every April 15 when they pay \ntheir taxes and who think it's time for the government to feel a little \nof the pain instead.\n  But how can a government grappling with a $4.8 trillion national debt \nafford tax relief of any kind?\n  The families first bill, which became the centerpiece of the budget \nplans offered last year by both Senate and House Republicans, pays for \nthe tax credit by cutting government spending.\n  Every single dollar in tax relief is offset by another dollar in \nspending cuts.\n  And by putting the Federal Government on a strict diet by capping the \ngrowth of Federal spending at 2 percent, we'll balance the budget by \nthe year 2002.\n  Our bill proves that we can afford tax relief at the same time we're \nrestoring fiscal sanity in Washington.\n  During the debate ahead, we'll hear calls to water down the $500 per-\nchild tax credit.\n  We'll be asked to means test it or lower the dollar amount.\n  Some will want to limit the ages of the children eligible or duck out \non real relief by substituting an increase in the personal deduction.\n  Some may oppose tax relief completely.\n  That's not what Americans were promised last year, or what the voters \nmandated in November.\n  If we backtrack now, we'll have to face an American public that is \ntired of being led on by politicians who promise one thing and never \ndeliver.\n  We have to hold firm on behalf of every American taxpayer and deliver \nthe tax relief we promised.\n  I want to commend our colleagues on the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, who this week kept the covenant they made with the voters in \nthe Contract With America and passed the $500 per-child tax credit.\n  This was a victory for the taxpayers and a clear signal to the \nAmerican people that they have not been forgotten by this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I'm proud that Senator Coats and our Senate \ncolleagues--what we call the 500 Club--will be following up on the \nHouse's good work and fighting for the promises made in November: the \npromises of lower taxes, smaller government, stronger families.\n  Those are the principles embodied by the $500 tax credit, the \nprinciples that will once again put families first.\n  I would like to close by saying how important I feel about tax cuts \nfor Americans, and American families specifically. We promised, we \ncampaigned, we talked about tax relief for American families across the \ncountry during the 1994 elections, and the Americans spoke loud and \nclear at the polls in November that they agreed, because they know how \nhard it hits them in the wallet every year.\n  My good friend from Wisconsin, the Senator from Wisconsin, is among \nthose leading the charge on the Senate floor every day, talking about \nhow we do not need tax cuts, how Government in Washington should \ncontinue to expect to receive these tax dollars, and that these \nChambers can better make the decision on how to spend your money than \nyou can spend it yourself.\n  In Wisconsin, that means about $590 million a year in tax relief, \nsomething the Senator from Wisconsin does not think is important to the \nresidents of Wisconsin. I ask him to call some of his residents to see \nhow important they feel any form of tax relief would be in 1995 for \nthem.\n  I just wanted to wrap up again by thanking the Senator from Indiana \nand the other Senators who have spoken this morning on behalf of \nAmerican taxpayers. I hope that we can rely on their support and the \npublic support in making their calls and rallying behind this very, \nvery, important issue of tax cuts and tax relief.\n  We are to a point now where we assume that every dollar that \nAmericans make belongs to Government in some form and that we will \ndecide through tax cuts or tax credits or tax breaks how much they are \ngoing to keep and how much Washington is going to get. I think, as the \nSenator from Indiana pointed out very succinctly, it is their money and \nthis will allow them to keep more of their hard-earned tax money in \ntheir pockets.\n  So I wanted to thank the other Senators for helping this morning. I \nyield back my time.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 569. A bill to amend the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \nControl Act of 1985 to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare \nProgram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Budget and the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of \nAugust 4, 1977, with instructions that if one committee reports, the \nother committee have 30 days to report or be discharged.\n\n\n                  the medicare protection act of 1995\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \nthe Medicare Protection Act of 1995, which would save taxpayers and \nsenior citizens over $16 billion by the end of the decade by curbing \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare Program. I hope that the Senate \nwill consider this important legislation as we work to reduce the \nFederal budget deficit and to improve Medicare.\n  For 6 years, as chairman and now ranking Democrat of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation, I have targeted fraud, waste, and abuse in the programs \nunder our jurisdiction. I have given particular attention to exposing \nand eliminating waste and abuse in Medicare. In hearing after hearing, \nour subcommittee has uncovered examples of lost Medicare funds due to \nfraud and poor program oversight. While some of the problems we have \nuncovered are due to weaknesses in Medicare law, billions of dollars \nare lost every year due to inadequate audits and other program \nsafeguard activities. At least $2 billion of unallowable and sometimes \nfraudulent medical charges will be improperly paid by Medicare this \nyear alone.\n  The General Accounting Office [GAO], Office of Inspector General of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services [HHSIG], and the Health \nCare Financing Administration [HCFA] have each documented the savings \nto the Medicare Program achieved through investments in program \nsafeguard activities. They have testified that for every dollar spent \non program safeguards, $13 to $16 are saved by stopping inappropriate \nMedicare payments. This is not some pie-in-the-sky-hoped-for return on \ninvestment, it is documented, and proven that this saves us significant \nsums. For the coming fiscal year, the administration estimates that the \nprojected program safeguard investment will result in $6.16 billion in \nMedicare savings, a return on investment of 16 to 1.\n  Yet funding for these cost saving activities is inadequate. While \nMedicare is an uncapped entitlement program, the funds to effectively \nadminister Medicare are funded through discretionary outlays. They must \ncompete with other important programs like Head Start, job training, \nchildhood immunizations, and college loans. Because we have a cap on \noverall discretionary spending, at a time when the number and size of \nMedicare claims is \n[[Page S4101]] growing steadily, funding for audits and claims review \nhave not kept up. This despite the fact that we know that for every \ndollar invested, Medicare saves from $13 to $16.\n  For several years now I have been working to correct this \nshortsighted budget policy. Based on recommendations by the GAO, I have \npushed legislation like that I am introducing today. The Medicare \nProtection Act would allow us to adequately fund critical Medicare \nantifraud and abuse activities without cutting other critical programs. \nThis legislation allows for a 10-percent increase in support for these \nactivities annually through fiscal year 2000 without violating the \ndiscretionary spending ceilings. The 10-percent increase is pegged to \nthe rate of growth in Medicare claims in recent years.\n  Mr. President, even assuming the most conservative estimates of \nsavings--a 13-to-1 return on investment--the Medicare Protection Act \nwould save taxpayers and Medicare beneficiaries $2 billion this year \nand over $16 billion through the end of the decade. At a time when some \nin Congress are proposing major reductions in Medicare that could \ndirectly impact senior citizens and critical health providers, this \nlegislation is just common sense. I am certain that my colleagues would \nagree that we need to cut the fat before the bone. Let's make war on \nwaste, not our senior citizens.\n  Mr. President, I will work with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to try to gain approval of this common sense deficit reducing \nproposal. It is one change that we should be able--for which we should \nbe able to achieve strong bipartisan support. So I commend this bill to \nmy colleagues and urge that it be included in any package we consider \nto further reduce the Federal deficit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 569\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Energy to enter into \nprivatization arrangements for activities carried out in connection \nwith defense nuclear facilities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n\n\n           the department of energy privatization act of 1995\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that \ndramatically changes how we clean nuclear waste sites across the \nNation. Clearly we have a window to address these profound national \nproblems. My bill does just that.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is designed to change how DOE manages \nthe cleanup of its defense nuclear sites. This bill applies to all DOE \nnuclear defense sites, because the cleanup problems we are addressing \nare national concerns--not parochial.\n  The bill's strengths rest in addressing how DOE compensates \nperformance. Today we are cornered into agreements based on cost plus \nscenarios. The taxpayer reimburses the contractor for all costs related \nto overhead, salaries and other out-of-pocket expenses. On top of that \nsum comes a bonus which is a percentage of those direct costs. That \nmeans that higher overheads mean bigger bonuses. My bill dictates the \nopposite: You don't do the job, you don't get paid. Period.\n  Mr. President, this bill makes good sense. I know that the American \npeople are anxious for cleanup to happen at our nuclear defense sites. \nThe people of Washington State are anxious too. This bill takes the DOE \nout of the managerial role and puts it into the role of client and \nconsumer. It puts the burden of capital risk on investors eager to join \nthe cleanup process, yet does not hold them responsible for a mess that \nis not theirs.\n  Under this bill, the Secretary of Energy will have the authority to \nenter into long-term contracting arrangements--30 years plus two 10-\nyear renewals--for the treatment, management and disposition of nuclear \nwaste and nuclear waste by-products.\n  The contractor's facility must be within a 25-mile radius of the DOE \nsite. Community development and site-worker preference are key to this \nbill. The Secretary is instructed to give preference to those \ncontractors who intend to reinvest in the communities where their work \nis conducted. The Secretary must also give preference to contractors \nwhose bids include employment for local workers, or workers with \nprevious site experience.\n  Indemnification and other legal protection is included to inoculate \ncontractors from preexisting conditions that were not caused by the \ncontractor. This bill places strict limits on contractor liability \nduring cleanup, except in cases of negligence. This ensures that a \ncontractor is not responsible for waste not created on their watch.\n  Through commercialization, the bill will encourage innovation in \ncleanup. By permitting the contractor to use technologies developed at \nthe site for commercial use and resale even while cleanup is taking \nplace, the legislation rewards\n success instead of stifling it. In the past, DOE has frowned on \nsimilar allowances, primarily because of the Government's desire to \nkeep new technology ``in house.'' Instead, the bill grants contractors \nimmediate patent rights to new technologies developed in the cleanup \nprocess.\n\n  Another important provision protects the contractor from subsequent \nrule changes by the Department of Energy or Congress that directly \naffect cleanup efforts. Language states that if the Department of \nEnergy mandates new environmental regulations or laws which will \nadversely affect the cleanup schedule and performance, the contractor \nis entitled to renegotiate the contract without penalty. Likewise, if \nregulations are eased, the contractor is given the option of abiding by \nthe rules in place, or opening discussions again to adjust for the less \nstringent requirements.\n  This legislation also allows the Secretary to lease federally owned \nland to contractors at a negotiable rate. By leasing the land, the \nGovernment permits the contractor to undertake non-DOE site related \nactivities. For example, a contractor may retain a non-DOE client who \nwants to vitrify waste at the DOE site. With this legislation the \ncontractor could open its facility to such an endeavor.\n  I urge that all of my colleagues, particularly those with similar \ninterests in their States, support this bill and join as cosponsors.\n  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  [[Page S4102]] There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n                                 S. 570\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to terminate \nentitlement of pay and allowances for members of the Armed Forces who \nare sentenced to confinement and a punitive discharge or dismissal, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                     violent criminals legislation\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill put an end to an outrageous waste of tax dollars and immediately \nstop a taxpayer-funded cash reward for violent criminals.\n  Believe it or not, each month, the Pentagon pays the salaries of \nmilitary personnel convicted of the most heinous crimes while their \ncases are appealed through the military court system--a process than \noften takes years. During that time, these violent criminals sit back \nin prison, read the Wall Street Journal, invest the money they get from \nthe military, and watch their taxpayer-funded nest eggs grow.\n  According to data provided by the Defense Finance Accounting Service \nand first published in the Dayton Daily News, the Department of Defense \nspent more than $1 million on the salaries of 680 convicts in the month \nof June 1994, alone. In that month, the Pentagon paid the salaries of \n58 rapists, 164 child molesters, and 7 murderers, among others.\n  Just this morning, the Pentagon confirmed to me that at least 633 \nmilitary convicts remained on the payroll in December 1994, costing the \nGovernment more than $900,000.\n  I can't think of a more reprehensible way to spend taxpayer dollars. \nNo explanation could ever make me understand how the military could \nreward rapists, murderers, and child molesters--the lowest of the low--\nwith the hard earned tax dollars of law-abiding citizens. This policy \nthumbs its nose at taxpayers, slaps the faces of crime victims, and is \none of the worst examples of Government waste I have seen in my 20 \nyears of public service.\n  Congress must act now to end this practice.\n  The individual stories of military criminals receiving full pay are \nshocking. In California, a marine lance corporal who beat his 13-month-\nold daughter to death almost 2 years ago still receives $1,105 each \nmonth--about $25,000 since his conviction. He spends his days in the \nbrig at Camp Pendleton and does not pay a dime of child support. This \ncriminal has been paid $25,000 since his conviction.\n  I spoke with the murdered child's grandmother who now has custody of \na surviving 4-year-old grandson. She is a resident of northern \nCalifornia. She was outraged to learn that the murderer of her \ngrandchild still receives full pay. She was understandably outraged to \nlearn that the murderer of her daughter still receives a Government \npaycheck.\n  Another Air Force sergeant who tried to kill his wife with a kitchen \nknife continues to receive full pay while serving time at Fort \nLeavenworth. He told the Dayton Daily News, ``I follow the stock market \n* * * I buy Double E bonds.''\n  And believe it or not, Francisco Duran, who was arrested last October \nafter firing 27 shots at the White House was paid by the military while \nin prison. According to DOD records, Duran was paid $17,537 after his \nconviction for deliberately driving his car into a crowd of people \noutside a Hawaii bowling alley in 1990. Some of that money may well \nhave paid for the weapon he used to shoot at the White House.\n  Since I began working on this issue, I have received letters of \nsupport from concerned citizens around the country. Recently, a woman \nfrom North Carolina wrote me. This woman's sister was murdered by her \nhusband, a Navy chief stationed in South Carolina. He is now serving a \n24-year sentence at Fort Leavenworth. He receives full pay.\n  This courageous woman is now raising her sisters' three children. The \nchildren's father, who murdered this woman's sister, agreed to send \nback his paychecks for child support, but he kept threatening to stop. \nDesperate, she asked the staff at Fort Leavenworth how she could ensure \nthat his paychecks would continue to be sent to her. Finally, when she \nasked the staff of the Fort Leavenworth military prison for guidance, \nshe was told that the only way she could receive guaranteed child \nsupport payments was to, ``kiss his butt'' and hope for the best.\n  Imagine that. The only way to ensure that she will have the means to \nsupport her murdered sister's children is to ``kiss the butt'' of her \nmurderer.\n  This policy is crazy, and it has got to stop.\n  In January, I introduced legislation, S. 205, which would terminate \npay to members of the Armed Forces under confinement pending \ndishonorable discharge. This bill generated significant bipartisan \nsupport and was cosponsored by 10 Senators.\n  Following the introduction of S. 205, several Senators, the DOD's \nOffice of Legal Counsel, and the Undersecretary for Personnel and \nReadiness, offered suggestions for improvements. Many of these \nsuggestions have been incorporated into the bill I am introducing \ntoday.\n  I am very proud that this bill has 15 cosponsors. It has the support \nof Democrats and Republicans; liberals and conservatives. This is truly \nan issue that transcends political and ideological boundaries.\n  In summary, this bill would terminate pay to any member of the Armed \nForces sentenced by a court martial to confinement and dishonorable \ndischarge, bad-conduct discharge, or dismissal. Pay would terminate \nimmediately upon sentencing. If at any point in the appeals process the \nconviction were reversed or the sentence were otherwise set aside, full \nback pay would be awarded.\n  This bill also authorizes the Secretary of Defense to establish a \nprogram to pay transitional compensation to the spouses and dependents \nof military personnel who lose their pay as a result of this pay \ntermination. This compensation could be paid for a maximum of 1 year at \na level not to exceed the amount that the member of the Armed Forces \nwould have received had he been in pay status.\n  The Department of Defense strongly supports changing the current \npolicy. Shortly after I first wrote Secretary Perry about this issue \nlate last year, a working group was established to study the issue and \nreport to the Secretary no later than February 28. That date has \npassed, but we have still received no word from the Department.\n  It has now been nearly 3 months since I first brought this issue to \nlight. I believe strongly that we must act immediately to fix this \nproblem. Each month that goes by, about $1 million is wasted. That \nmoney could be used to improve the quality of life for our military \npersonnel. It could be used to enhance the readiness of our forces. It \ncould even be used to reduce the budget deficit. But instead, the \nPentagon is paying $1 million each month to vile, violent criminals.\n  We do not have a moment to waste. Let us pass this important \nlegislation quickly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 571\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of this bill to take violent criminals off the Pentagon's \npayroll. I was an original cosponsor of S. 205, the first bill to \naddress this problem. I congratulate Senator Boxer on introducing this \nimproved version that introduces an element of compassion for the \nfamilies of those taken off the payroll.\n  I was shocked to learn that our Government spends more than $1 \nmillion per month on salaries and benefits for military personnel who \nhave been convicted of violent crimes. This is morally wrong. This is \nan insult to the brave men and women of our Armed Forces. And this is \nbad fiscal policy.\n  Mr. President, it is morally wrong to pay salaries to murderers, \nrapists, child molesters, and other violent criminals. Imagine, the \nfamilies of victims and, indeed, even victims themselves pay tax \ndollars that end up in the pockets and savings accounts of the very \npeople who victimized them. In some cases, these violent criminals even \ncontinue to receive pay after they are released from prison.\n  This situation is also an insult to the brave men and women who serve \nin our Armed Forces. They work hard and make many sacrifices to give us \nthe best military in the world. Their efforts are degraded when we pay \nthe same salaries to convicted felons that we pay to them.\n  Finally, it is bad fiscal policy to waste taxpayer money in this way. \nHow can we justify paying $1 million a month to convicted criminals \nwhen we are at the same time cutting back on payments to needy \nchildren? We just spent 5 weeks trying to one-up each other on our \ncommitment to balance the Federal budget. How can we ever hope to do so \nif we squander millions of dollars not on incarcerating criminals, but \nrewarding them?\n  As the Dallas Morning News stated in a February 5, 1995, editorial, \n``this change is a no-brainer. Congress should act quickly to end this \ntravesty.'' I could not agree more.\n                                 ______\n\n           By Mr. COATS:\n  S. 572. A bill to expand the authority for the export of devices, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n               the medical device exportation act of 1995\n\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Medical \nDevice Exportation Act of 1995. This bill will allow American companies \nto export \n[[Page S4105]] approved medical devices without forcing those companies \nto endure costly and unnecessary delays in the FDA approval process.\n  Under current law, a company that seeks to export its drug overseas \nto Japan or Europe where that drug is already approved for marketing, \nmust get the approval of the FDA before it may be exported. Approval is \ngranted only after the FDA determines that exportation would not \njeopardize public health and safety and that the country has approved \nthe drug.\n  Unfortunately, the FDA takes several weeks or even months to approve \nthe exportation of devices that Japan or other advanced nations in \nEurope have already approved for marketing.\n  This delay in approving the exportation of a device that is already \napproved for marketing by some of the most sophisticated device-\napproval systems in the world can cost Americans millions in lost \nrevenue and thousands of jobs. A recent survey of device company CEO's \nconfirms the cost of this unnecessary delay. Forty percent of CEO's \nsaid that their companies had reduced the size of their work force as a \nresult of regulatory delays. Twenty-two percent had already moved jobs \noffshore due to the delays.\n  This bill is narrowly targeted to the problem. It simply eliminates \none bureaucratic step that serves no public health function in light of \nother extensive controls. This bill changes the current law that \nrequires the FDA to make an independent determination of safety and \napproval and simply directs that the FDA rely on approval by the \nsophisticated device approval systems in Japan or the European \nCommunity.\n  Of course, any device that is banned in the United States would \nremain prohibited for export. And any country that would prohibit \nimportation of the device retains that sovereign right.\n  I am confident that this legislation is not controversial. In the \nHouse, Congressman Kim has introduced a virtually identical measure, \nH.R. 485, with 17 cosponsors. Moreover, the Department of Commerce has \nproposed a similar administrative fix.\n  I urge all my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation that \nwill help keep America competitive, retain American jobs and revenues, \nand serve the public health needs of nations worldwide.\n    \n                                 ______\n\n           By Mr. PRYOR:\n  S. 573. A bill to reduce spending in fiscal year 1996, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, \nwith instructions, that if one Committee reports the other Committee \nhave 30 days to report or be discharged.\n\n\n                  THE SPENDING REDUCTIONS ACT OF 1995\n\n  MR. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate on the \nquestion of where to cut Government spending and to offer some \nsuggestions, if I might, on where we might cut spending due to the very \nintensive debate we have had over the last several weeks in this body.\n  This issue has risen again and again during the debate over the \nbalanced budget amendment. As we argue now over how to reach the \ndesired goal of reducing the deficit to zero, I thought it might be a \ngood time to come forward with a specific list, not major, but a \nspecific list of spending cuts that I hope all of my colleagues will \nsupport and consider. In fact, if the speeches that have been made in \nthe Chamber of the Senate are any indication or to be believed, then I \nthink these proposals should receive widespread support. These spending \nreductions are contained in the Spending Reductions Act of 1995. This \nbill which I am introducing at this time will contain five sections \nthat consist of areas I think can either be reduced or eliminated to \nprovide the taxpayers with some long overdue relief. Mr. President, \n$5.6 billion in total savings would result from this bill for 1 year \nalone. If we continued basically down this track, we could save \napproximately $30 billion over the next 5 years.\n  The first section of my bill involves a very modest reduction in \nGovernment spending for private contractors who do the work for the \nFederal Government. We have seen since 1980 alone the cost of \nGovernment contractors rise from $47.6 billion to 1994's high of $105 \nbillion.\n  Today, I am not proposing to address all of the problems involved in \nthe Federal Government's extensive reliance on outside workers. I \nsimply want to address the concern expressed by the taxpayers and the \nvoters in both the 1992 and 1994 elections giving us the mandate to \nshrink the size of Government.\n  Congress has already partially responded to this mandate by voting to \ncut the number of civil servants by nearly 12 percent. However, the \nCongress has failed to order a corresponding reduction in the Federal \nGovernment's exploding contractor work force. If we cut civil servants \nand do nothing about the tremendous rise in the cost of outside \ncontractors that the Government then employs, we are going to see \nbasically no savings whatsoever.\n   Mr. President, my proposal is so simple I am almost embarrassed to \nintroduce it. It would reduce by $5 billion the 1996 budget the amount \nspent to hire Federal contractors. It is simple, it is clean, it is $5 \nbillion in savings.\n  This modest reduction will still permit agencies to get their work \ndone, but it will also reduce some of the waste that results when too \nmuch money is spent without adequate oversight.\n  At my request, the Inspector General at the Pentagon has been looking \nat some of these contracts awarded by the Star Wars program. Listen to \nthe problems that the IG said existed.\n  First, cost overruns on the contracts totaled several million \ndollars.\n  Second, the contractor awarded prohibited subcontracts worth several \nmillion dollars. These are contracts awarded to subcontractors in \nviolation of Federal regulations but still cost millions of dollars of \ntaxpayers' money. The contractor charged the Government for 588 hours \nof work that it actually did not perform. Again, this is from the \nreport of the Inspector General at DOD to me.\n  I hope a reduction in the spending on service contracts will force \nagencies to spend their money more wisely, and to eliminate some of the \nwaste which has resulted.\n  The second section of my bill will reduce the spending on federally \nfunded research and development centers. These are called FFRDC's at \nthe Department of Defense. That is pretty bureaucratic sounding. But \nthese FFRDC's like Mitre, Rand, the Center for Naval Analysis, are \nactually private contractors who work solely for the Federal \nGovernment. They receive all of their contracts on a sole-source basis. \nThere is no bidding procedure. The contractor simply states what they \nwill charge to perform a particular service and then they find \nthemselves being written a check. There is no competition whatsoever.\n  These entities may provide a valuable service to the Federal \nGovernment, but again, in this time of concern over reducing the budget \ndeficit, I think it is appropriate to question every item of spending. \nSince I am proposing a reduction in spending on outside workers, I say \nthat we should also cut back a reasonable amount on these in-house \nconsulting companies which have no competition for the taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  Our taxpayers should not continue being billed at the very high \nsalaries and overhead being charged by these Government-run consulting \nfirms. For example, the head of Aerospace Corp., a FFRDC, or federally \nfunded research and development center--was paid in 1991 $230,000 in \nsalaries and who knows what else in expenses. We paid him, in 1992, \n$265,000 as a salary and no one knows how much for expenses. And, in \nboth of these years this person, who is president of the Aerospace \nCorp., funded by the American taxpayer, made more money than the \nPresident of the United States.\n  My proposal would reduce the spending on FFRDC's by $250 million in \n1996. This would leave over $10 billion to be spent on these \norganizations and I think that would be more than sufficient.\n  The third item where I would cut spending is an issue I have worked \non for a number of years with many of my colleagues. This is the \nexporting of arms to countries all over the world. I am not very proud \nof the fact that the United States is the leading exporter of arms in \nthe world today. However, this proposal is not targeted, once again, at \nreforming this arms trade. That is a battle for another day. My \nproposal is \n[[Page S4106]] simply aimed at reducing the budget deficit. We are \nspending, today, $3.2 billion on financing arms sales to foreign \ngovernments. I think, as we contemplate reduction in Medicare and \nschool lunches, we should also look at this area as well. I propose we \nreduce this spending by $200 million in 1996. It is a modest cut. It is \na cut that makes common sense.\n  I have a fourth proposal. That fourth proposal to cut spending would \ncut the United States funding to the International Development \nAssociation and the International Finance Corporation, two of the \ninstitutions which make up the World Bank Group, by approximately 15 \npercent in cuts. This would save the American taxpayer some $200 \nmillion. As my colleagues know, the World Bank has come under serious \nCongressional scrutiny in the past few years, due to administrative \nwaste and flawed development policies.\n  For example, salaries at the World Bank average today $123,000 -- all \ntax free. In recent years the Bank has spent approximately $30 million \non first-class travel for its executives. As for the operational record \nof the World Bank, internal audits have estimated that nearly 40 \npercent of the bank's loans and projects are failures.\n  Unfortunately, although the World Bank admits to these problems, \nreform has been slow or nonexistent. In 1993 I called for the \nestablishment of an inspector general function at the World Bank. \nDespite receiving support from both the Clinton administration and our \ncolleagues in the Senate, the World Bank has, today, failed to \nestablish an adequate internal oversight function.\n  It is time once again for the Senate to address the issue of World \nBank mismanagement. The funding cut which I propose is, once again, \nmodest. But I think it will send a signal to the executives of the \nWorld Bank while at the same time saving taxpayers' dollars from \nfurther misuse.\n  The final cut I am proposing, while it may be the smallest, in many \nways provides the clearest example of our overall spending problem. In \n1995 we gave the Department of Defense $65 million for humanitarian \nassistance programs. That sounds reasonable enough until one stops to \nquestion the rationale of the Department of Defense's having a \nhumanitarian assistance budget in the first place.\n  Humanitarian programs are not the primary part of DOD's mission. The \nUnited States already has an agency solely dedicated to humanitarian \nand development programs, the Agency for International Development. In \naddition, we appropriate millions of dollars to multilateral \ninstitutions for humanitarian purposes.\n  I believe the Department of Defense neither wants nor needs a growing \nhumanitarian mission. I base this statement on the careless way in \nwhich humanitarian programs are run by the Department of Defense. In \n1993, the General Accounting Office took a close look at DOD's \nhumanitarian and civic assistance projects, and GAO concluded that \nthese projects--and I quote from the GAO report--``. . . were not \ndesigned to contribute to U.S. foreign policy objectives, did not \nappear to enhance U.S. military training, and either lacked the support \nof the host country or were not being used.''\n  Let me highlight one example provided by the General Accounting \nOffice on this program. A few years ago, some very well-meaning U.S. \nNational Guard soldiers were asked to build a school in Honduras. \nUnfortunately, once completed this three-building complex was never \nused. That is because the Honduran Government had already built and was \noperating a school of this nature only a few hundred yards away.\n  Unfortunately, it is probable that poorly coordinated projects like \nthe Honduran school are continuing today. In a recent meeting with our \nstaff, GAO analysts reported that the Department of Defense had done \nlittle or nothing to address the defects in its humanitarian programs. \nBy cutting this program by 50 percent, saving $25 million in 1996, the \nCongress will force the agency to define its mission and concentrate \nwhere the military can play a useful role in overseas humanitarian \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting these very reasonable, very modest cuts that will save us \n$5.6 billion this year. Each spending reduction is designed to promote \neconomy and efficiency in the operation of the Federal Government, and \nwill save an enormous amount in dollars.\n  I believe that this is what the American people certainly want, and \nthat my constituents and our constituents are not as concerned with the \nContract With America as they are concerned with our priorities. With \nor without a balanced budget amendment, Senators on both sides of the \naisle were sent here with the mandate to make tough decisions. It is \nwith that mandate in mind that I bring this legislation before the \nSenate today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Simpson):\n  S. 574. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the founding of the \nSmithsonian Institution; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n           THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I introduce the Smithsonian \nInstitution Commemorative Coin Act of 1996. I introduce this \nlegislation on behalf of my distinguished colleagues, Senators Cochran \nand Simpson, with whom I have the privilege to serve on the Smithsonian \nInstitution's Board of Regents.\n  August 10, 1996, will mark the 150th anniversary of the founding of \nthe Smithsonian Institution, one of the Nation's finest examples of \nsuccessful public-private partnership. This legislation provides for \nthe minting of coins to commemorate this momentous occasion.\n  Created as a Federal trusteeship by Congress in 1846, the Smithsonian \nInstitution is today the largest research and museum complex on Earth. \nIts various museums were visited more than 26 million times last year, \nand unlike so many other museums, the Smithsonian remains free of \ncharge to the public. In addition, thousands of Americans and foreign \nscholars have used the Institution's vast repository of knowledge and \nartifacts to assist in a variety of research activities.\n  The Smithsonian's sesquicentennial commemoration provides us the \nopportunity to celebrate both the Institution's great accomplishments \nand its future role and mission. The central goal of the commemoration, \nhowever, will be to increase the sense of ownership of, and \nparticipation in, the Smithsonian by the American people.\n  Throughout its 150th year, the Smithsonian will undertake a series of \nprograms and stage a number of events to commemorate its founding and \nto explore new ways in which it can serve the public. These activities, \nwhile extensions of the existing framework of Smithsonian programs, \nwill require significant financial resources.\n  In light of the existing budget constraints under which the Federal \nGovernment must operate, the Smithsonian's Board of Regents concluded \nit would not seek any additional appropriated funds to support \nsesquicentennial programming. Rather, the Smithsonian will concentrate \nits efforts to raise support for the anniversary programming from non-\nFederal sources. The commemorative coins would be one such effort.\n  The coins would be issued on August 10, 1996, exactly 150 years from \nthe actual date of the act of Congress which established the \nSmithsonian Institution. The issuance of Smithsonian sesquicentennial \ncommemorative coins will provide an opportunity for the American public \nto obtain a valued memento and support the Institution's mandate to \npreserve our Nation's cultural and historical heritage. In addition, \nthe fund derived from the sale of these commemorative coins will not \nonly enable the Smithsonian to showcase its 150-year service to the \nNation, but will also transfer the financial responsibility for the \nsesquicentennial activities from the American taxpayer to voluntary \ncontributions.\n  Further, the legislation provides that 15 percent of the total \nproceeds remitted to the Institution would be designated to support the \nnumismatic collection at the National Museum of American History. This \ncomponent of the legislation is strongly supported by the numismatic \ncommunity and in a very tangible way demonstrates our appreciation for \ntheir support of all \n[[Page S4107]] congressionally authorized commemorative coin programs.\n  Without exception, every Senator has constituents who visit, \ncommunicate with, and otherwise benefit from the Smithsonian. From \neager first-graders to learned scholars and researchers, the public is \nconsistently served by the vast resources and expertise of the \nSmithsonian and its staff. Enactment of this legislation will give the \nAmerican people the opportunity to celebrate the Smithsonian's unique \ncontributions to American culture and learning over the last 150 years.\n  Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this \nbill to celebrate and honor the 150th anniversary of the Smithsonian \nInstitution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 574\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide Outer Continental Shelf Impact Assistance \nto State and local governments, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          ocs impact assistance to state and local governments\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator Murkowski and I are introducing a \nbill today which we believe to be of importance to the Nation's \ndomestic energy supply and our precious coastal resources. We are \npleased to have Senators Johnston and Breaux as cosponsors.\n  The Outer Continental Shelf [OCS] impact assistance legislation is \nsimilar to legislation we introduced in the 102d Congress and have \nworked on for the past two decades. It is intended to stimulate oil and \ngas exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf and provide funds from \nrevenues generated by oil and gas production on the OCS to coastal \nStates and communities which share the burdens of exploration and \nproduction off their coastlines.\n  OCS impact assistance is an avenue for States and communities to be \nin full partnership with the Federal Government in the development of \nOCS energy by investing a small portion of new OCS revenue back into \nthe coastal States.\n  This legislation establishes a fund for impact assistance from leased \ntracts for distribution to coastal States within 200 miles of such \ntracts. The funds will benefit States and local governments directly \nand indirectly impacted by OCS leasing activities. The bill would \nallocate 27 percent of new revenues generated from oil and natural gas \ndevelopment into the trust. These funds would be shared on a 50-50 \nbasis among States and the eligible counties and coastal jurisdictions.\n  The impact assistance provided under this legislation will be \ndistributed to counties, and in Alaska, borough governments, located no \nmore than 60 miles from a State's coastline. The premise of sharing \nrevenues derived from the development of resources in a specific locale \nwith those that are primarily affected is a wise objective.\n  [[Page S4108]] The funds would be used to assist coastal regions in \nprojects and activities that OCS activities may impact, such as air and \nwater quality, fish and wildlife, wetlands, or other coastal resources. \nIn addition, the receiving governments could use their funds for much-\nneeded public health and safety services, infrastructure construction, \ncultural activities, and other government services.\n  The Commerce Department recently reported that our national security \nis at risk because we now import more than 50 percent of our domestic \npetroleum requirements. OCS development has played an important role in \noffsetting even greater dependence on foreign energy. The OCS accounts \nfor 23 percent of our Nation's natural gas production and 14 percent of \nits oil production. We need to ensure that the OCS plays an important \nrole in meeting our future domestic energy needs.\n  The States and communities that bear the responsibilities should now \nshare the benefits of the program.\n  The Senate in the past has passed my legislation to provide OCS \nimpact assistance but we have not been successful in getting this \nenacted into law. I hope the administration will support this bill, \nwhich shows a State and Federal cooperation and partnership consistent \nwith some past programs that exist in mineral, grazing, and forest \nresource revenue sharing. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto provide our coastal States and communities the funds they need and \ndeserve.\n  I want to thank Mike Poling and Greg Renkes of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, who were invaluable in drafting this legislation. \nAnd I am also grateful to my assistant, Anne McInerney, for her work on \nthis legislation.\n  I state again that the revenue sharing will be only from new \nproduction under this bill.\n  I also want to express my gratitude to my colleague from Alaska, \nSenator Murkowski, for his leadership as chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee and for his personal efforts on this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 575\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act only, the term--\n       (1) ``coastline'' has the same meaning that it has in the \n     Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301 et seq.);\n       (2) ``county'' means a unit of general government \n     constituting the local jurisdiction immediately below the \n     level of State government. This term includes, but is not \n     limited to, counties, parishes, villages and tribal \n     governments which function in lieu of and are not within a \n     county, and in Alaska, borough governments.

IMPACT ASSISTANCE FORMULA AND PAYMENTS.\n\n       (a) There is established a fund in the Treasury of the \n     United States, which shall be known as the ``Outer \n     Continental Shelf Impact Assistance Fund'' (hereinafter \n     referred to in this Act as ``the Fund''). Allocable new \n     revenues determined under subsection (c) shall be deposited \n     in the Fund.\n       (b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest excess \n     monies in the Fund, at the written request of the Secretary, \n     in public debt securities with maturities suitable to the \n     needs of the Fund, as determined by the Secretary, and \n     bearing interest at rates determined by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, taking into consideration current market yields on \n     outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of \n     comparable maturity.\n       (c) Notwithstanding section 9 of the Outer Continental \n     Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1338), amounts in the Fund, \n     together with interest earned from investment thereof, shall \n     be paid at the direction of the Secretary as follows:\n       (1) The Secretary shall determine the new revenues from any \n     leased tract or portion of a leased tract lying seaward of \n     the zone defined and governed by section 8(g) of the Outer \n     Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(g)), or lying \n     within such zone but to which section 8(g) does not apply, \n     the geographic center of which lies within a distance of 200 \n     miles from any part of the coastline of any coastal State \n     (hereinafter referred to as an ``eligible coastal State'').\n       (2) The Secretary shall determine the allocable share of \n     new revenues determined under paragraph (1) by multiplying \n     such revenues by 27 percent.\n       (3) The Secretary shall determine the portion of the \n     allocable share of new revenues attributable to each eligible \n     coastal State (hereinafter referred to as the ``eligible \n     coastal State's attributable share'') based on a fraction \n     which is inversely proportional to the distance between the \n     nearest point on the coastline of the eligible coastal State \n     and the geographic center of the leased tract or portion of \n     the leased tract (to the nearest whole mile). Further, the \n     ratio of an eligible State's attributable share to any other \n     eligible State's attributable share shall be equal to the \n     inverse of the ratio of the distances between the geographic \n     center of the leased tract or portion of the leased tract and \n     the coastlines of the respective eligible coastal States. The \n     sum of the eligible coastal States' attributable shares shall \n     be equal to the allocable share of new revenues determined \n     under paragraph (2).\n       (4) The Secretary shall pay from the Fund 50 percent of \n     each eligible coastal State's attributable share, together \n     with the portion of interest earned from investment of the \n     funds which corresponds to that amount, to that State.\n       (5) Within 60 days of enactment of this Act, the governor \n     of each eligible coastal State shall provide the Secretary \n     with a list of all counties, as defined herein, that are to \n     be considered for eligibility to receive impact assistance \n     payments. This list must include all counties with borders \n     along the State's coastline and may also include counties \n     which are at the closest point no more than 60 miles from the \n     State's coastline and which are certified by the Governor to \n     have significant impacts from Outer Continental Shelf-related \n     activities. For any such county that does not have a border \n     along the coastline, the Governor shall designate the \n     coastline of the nearest county that does have a border along \n     the coastline to serve as the former county's coastline for \n     the purposes of this section. The governor of any eligible \n     coastal State may modify this list whenever significant \n     changes in Outer Continental Shelf activities require a \n     change, but no more frequently than once each year.\n       (6) The Secretary shall determine, for each county within \n     the eligible coastal State identified by the Governor \n     according to paragraph (5) for which any part of the county's \n     coastline lies within a distance of 200 miles of the \n     geographic center of the leased tract or portion of the \n     leased tract (hereinafter referred to as in ``eligible \n     county'') 50 percent of the eligible coastal State's \n     attributable share which is attributable to such county \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``eligible county's \n     attributable share'') based on a fraction which is inversely \n     proportional to the distance between the nearest point on the \n     coastline of the eligible county and the geographic center of \n     the leased tract or portion of the leased tract (to the \n     nearest whole mile). Further, the ratio of any eligible \n     county's attributable share to any other eligible county's \n     attributable share shall be equal to the inverse of the ratio \n     of the distance between the geographic center of the leased \n     tract or portion of the leased tract and the coastlines of \n     the respective eligible counties. The sum of the eligible \n     counties' attributable shares for all eligible counties \n     within each State shall be equal to 50 percent of the \n     eligible coastal State's attributable share determined under \n     paragraph (3).\n       (7) The Secretary shall pay from the Fund the eligible \n     county's attributable share, together with the portion of \n     interest earned from investment of the Fund which corresponds \n     to that mount, to that county.\n       (8) Payments to eligible coastal States and eligible \n     counties under this section shall be made not later than \n     December 31 of each year from new revenues received and \n     interest earned thereon during the immediately preceding \n     fiscal year, but not earlier than one year following the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n       (9) The remainder of new revenues and interest earned in \n     the Fund not paid to an eligible State or an eligible county \n     under this \n     [[Page S4109]] section shall be disposed of according to\n      the law otherwise applicable to receipts from leases on the \n     Outer Continental Shelf.\n\n     SEC. 3. USES OF FUNDS.\n\n       Funds receive pursuant to this Act shall be used by the \n     eligible coastal States and eligible counties for--\n       (a) projects and activities related to all impacts of Outer \n     Continental Shelf-related activities including but not \n     limited to--\n       (1) air quality, water quality, fish and wildlife, \n     wetlands, or other coastal resources;\n       (2) other activities of such State or county, authorized by \n     the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 et \n     seq.), the provisions of subtitle B of title IV of the Oil \n     Pollution Act of 1990 (104 Stat. 523), or the Federal Water \n     Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.); and\n       (3) administrative costs of complying with the provisions \n     of this subtitle.\n\n     SEC. 4. OBLIGATIONS OF ELIGIBLE COUNTIES AND STATES.\n\n       (a) Project Submission.--Prior to the receipt of funds \n     pursuant to this Act for any fiscal year, an eligible county \n     must submit to the Governor of the State in which it is \n     located a plan setting forth the projects and activities for \n     which the eligible county proposes to expend such funds. Such \n     plan shall state the amounts proposed to be expended for each \n     project or activity during the upcoming fiscal year.\n       (b) Project Approval.--Prior to the payment of funds \n     pursuant to this Act to any eligible county for any fiscal \n     year, the Governor must approve the plan submitted by the \n     eligible county pursuant to subsection (a) and notify the \n     Secretary of such approval. State approval of any such plan \n     shall be consistent with all applicable State and federal \n     law. In the event the Governor disapproves any such plan, the \n     funds that would otherwise be paid to the eligible county \n     shall be placed in escrow by the Secretary pending \n     modification and approval of such plan, at which time such \n     funds together with interest thereon shall be paid to the \n     eligible county.\n       (c) Certification.--No later than 60 days after the end of \n     the fiscal year, any eligible county receiving funds under \n     this Act must certify to the Governor: (1) the amount of such \n     funds expended by the county during the previous fiscal year; \n     (2) the amounts expended on each project or activity; and (3) \n     the status of each project or activity.\n\n     SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT, REFUNDS.\n\n       (a) On June 15 of each fiscal year, the Governor of each \n     State receiving monies from the Fund shall account for all \n     monies so received for the previous fiscal year in a written \n     report to Congress.\n       (b) In those instances where through judicial decision, \n     administrative review, arbitration or other means there are \n     royalty refunds owed to entities generating new revenues \n     under this Act, repayment of such refunds in the same \n     proportion as monies were received under section 2 shall be \n     the responsibility of the governmental entities receiving \n     distributions under the Fund.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor legislation \nto provide Outer Continental Shelf [OCS] impact assistance to State and \nlocal governments. I am pleased to be joining my colleague from Alaska, \nSenator Stevens, the ranking minority member of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, Senator Johnston, and Senator Breaux in the \nintroduction of this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, there are two important aspects of the legislation we \noffer today. First, it is intended to stimulate oil and gas exploration \nand production on the Outer Continental Shelf, create jobs, protect our \nnational energy security, and reduce our trade deficit. Second, it is \nintended to provide funds from revenues generated by oil and gas \nproduction on the OCS to States and eligible counties who shoulder the \nresponsibility for energy development activity off their coastlines.\n  A recent report by the Commerce Department suggests that our national \nsecurity is at risk because we now import more than 50 percent of our \ndomestic petroleum requirements. The Clinton administration's response \nto that report seems to be to not respond. I am aware of no specific \nproposals offered by the Clinton Administration to increase domestic \nproduction and reduce foreign imports of crude oil. As chairman of the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources and a member of the Finance \nCommittee, I intend to hold hearings on this legislation and other \nmeasures to stimulate oil and gas production, create jobs in the energy \nand support industries, and generate badly needed revenues. Over the \nlast 10 years there have been 500,000 jobs lost in the oil and gas \nindustry, and billions of dollars in investment capital are fleeing the \ncountry because domestic energy companies are not being given access to \npublic lands to drill for new oil and gas reserves, are being \nfrustrated by government rules and regulations, and are being hounded \nby activists who do not want the public lands utilized for natural \nresource development.\n  I don't think that is right, and I intend to do something about it. \nThe bill we are introducing today is a small step, but a step in the \nright direction. Over the coming months I will hold hearings and \nintroduce legislation to provide additional stimulus to our energy \nindustry and our economy.\n  On the matter of impact assistance, Mr. President, our bill \nrecognizes that there are burdens associated with offshore oil and gas \nactivities--from environmental planning and analysis, to public safety \nand health considerations, to new infrastructure requirements. This \nlegislation would, for the first time, share the\n benefits of economic revenues generated by OCS oil and gas activities \nwith those governmental entities who assume those burdens.\n\n  Under this legislation, Mr. President, counties, parishes and \nboroughs--the local governmental entities most directly affected--and \nState governments will share in revenues derived from OCS oil and gas \nproduction. A total of 27 percent of all new revenues resulting from \nproduction royalties from leases lying seaward of the so-called 8(g) \nzone, the area 3 to 6 miles offshore and extending out to 200 miles, \nwould be shared on a 50-50 basis by States and counties. In other \nwords, States would get half of the 27 percent share and the coastal \ncounties would get the other half.\n  The impact assistance provided under this legislation would be \ndistributed to counties located no more than 60 miles from a State's \ncoastline, based on a fraction that is inversely proportional to the \ndistance between the nearest point on the eligible county's coastline \nand the geographic center of a leased tract. The legislation provides a \nformula for sharing with affected States as well.\n  Recognizing that local governmental entities differ from State to \nState, the legislation defines county as including parishes, villages, \nand, in Alaska, borough governments.\n  Impact assistance payments must be used for mitigation of effects \nrelating to OCS-related activities, such as air and water quality, fish \nand wildlife, wetlands, or other coastal resources. In addition, such \nfunds could be used for public safety and health activities, zoning, \ninfrastructure construction, or other similar measures. To ensure that \nimpact assistance monies are properly used, the bill requires counties \nto submit a description of the purposes for which such funds will be \ndisbursed, and governors to submit an annual report accounting for the \nuse of impact monies during the prior year.\n  To ensure that the funds are used for the purposes intended by this \nlegislation, coastal counties are required to submit a list of proposed \nprojects for approval of the Governor of the State in which the county \nis located. Counties must certify each year the amount of funds spent \non particular projects or activities and the status of each. The bill \nalso requires the Governor of each State receiving funds to account for \nmonies received each year in a report to Congress.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the legislation allows for refunds where, \nbecause of litigation, an arbitration award, or administrative review, \nthere has been an overpayment. In such cases, the responsible State and \ncounty governments would be required to refund monies overpaid in \ndirect proportion to the amount that they shared such funds.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is long overdue. It has been passed \ntwice on previous occasions only to be opposed by the Executive Branch. \nThis legislation is needed to ensure that State and local governments \nhave the funds necessary to address onshore activities and effects \nrelating to production occurring off their shorelines, activities which \ngenerate jobs and taxes, as well as the very funds from which OCS \nimpact assistance will be paid.\n  Historically, oil and gas leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf has \ngenerated more than $100 billion in Federal revenues. The OCS accounts \nfor 23 percent of our Nation's natural gas and 14 percent of the \ncountry's oil production. We need to assure that the OCS continues to \nplay an important role in contributing to our domestic energy needs, \nand to take steps to facilitate exploration and production activities \n[[Page S4110]] on the OCS. It also is time to spread the benefits of \nthe program among those who share the burdens. I urge my colleagues to \nmove swiftly in enacting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 576. A bill to prohibit the provision of certain trade assistance \nto United States subsidiaries of foreign corporations that lack \neffective prohibitions on bribery.\n\n\n                        antibribery legislation\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as we in Congress continue to \ndefine our role in helping promote United States exports in this \nfiercely competitive international environment, I rise today to \nintroduce two measures dealing with a more surreptitious aspect of \nforeign trade which is hurting U.S. companies: bribery and corruption \nby our foreign competitors.\n  This is a subject I became interested in last session when I learned \nof a rather outrageous practice in the world of offsets which involved \na kickback from one U.S. company to another to facilitate the purchase \nof foreign goods. In that case, a U.S. defense corporation offered an \nAmerican civilian contractor a sizable amount of money if that company \nwould choose a foreign bidder over an American bidder so that the \ndefense contractor could earn credit against its offset agreement for a \nweapons sale a few years earlier. After researching the law on this, I \nlearned that cash payments between domestic concerns--or what many \ncalled outright bribes--were not outlawed in offset deals. I authored \nlegislation, which was enacted in Public Law 103-236, to close the \nloophole in the law, and to outlaw kickback payments in the conduct of \noffsets.\n  My legislation today picks up on the same theme. As we seek to expand \nand develop markets for U.S. exports; as we work to protect every \nopportunity for fair competition for our companies; as we try to \nstrengthen our small and medium-sized companies, we must address the \nrampant, global problem of corruption and bribery--both as a good \ngovernance issue in our development strategies, and as a competitive \nissue with industrialized nations who permit bribery of foreign \nofficials.\n  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I expect to \nwork on this problem as we look at foreign aid reform and our trade \nexport promotion programs. As ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nAfrican Affairs, I want to work with our African partners to begin to \nclean up corruption, and remove this barrier to sound development. In \nthe State of Wisconsin, I have already raised the issue with a State \ntrade promotion commission, the Lucey Commission, as a barrier to free \nand fair trade for our companies. The commission released its report in \nJanuary 1995. Indeed, this is an unfair trading practice that must be \naddressed as U.S.\n companies gear up for more fervent international export activity.\n  Bribery and corruption in the international arena are subjects which \nwe have not focused on recently, but they have seriously skewed \ninternational markets and destabilized the trading environment \nthroughout the world. It is a multifaceted problem, found at many \nlayers of government, throughout the international corporate hierarchy, \nand in many components of an international business transaction. It \ninfects and distorts the global business environment by inflating costs \nwhich must factor in payoffs, and offers prices which, in reflecting \nthe bribe, are in excess of value. It also undermines structural \ndevelopment in transitioning countries, and when it comes to foreign \nassistance, it can diminish the amount of actual aid delivered as \nbribes are siphoned off from aid packages.\n  Bribery allows the dishonest to prosper, while the honest pay the \nprice. What's more, it only feeds on itself because a bribed person \nnever stays bribed; he or she will always sell themself to the highest \nbidder. Most importantly, though, it is an inappropriate way to do \nbusiness--not only because it is unethical and morally unacceptable, \nbut also because it is inefficient.\n  This was in large part why Congress passed the Foreign Corrupt \nPractices Act of 1977, which, I am proud to say, was sponsored by one \nof Wisconsin's most respected elected officials, Senator William \nProxmire. The FCPA was introduced when policymakers became concerned by \ndiscoveries that some American businesses maintained secret slush funds \nfor making questionable or illegal payments to foreign government \nofficials for enhanced business opportunities that would adversely \naffect U.S. foreign policy, harm the image of American democracy \nabroad, and undermine public confidence in the integrity of U.S. \nbusinesses.\n  By establishing extensive bookkeeping requirements to ensure \ntransparency, and by criminalizing the bribery of foreign officials to \nobtain or retain business, the FCPA has succeeded at curbing corporate \nbribery by U.S. firms. These two very important principles do not \nsimply define an American sense of morality in business. They also \nstrengthen America's trade policy, foster faith in American democracy, \nand protect our interests in requiring an open environment for U.S. \ninvestment.\n  Certainly, these are principles and guidelines in everyone's best \ninterest, and as such, are worth promoting worldwide.\n  Though at the time of passage, there was some criticism of the FCPA, \nit is generally welcomed by the business community today for exactly \nthose reasons. The biggest objection to it is that in some instances it \ndoes disadvantage our businesses. Our trade competitors, the other \nindustrialized countries, are allowed--and are usually willing--to pay \nbribes, and thus have been able to gain an unfair and harmful edge over \nU.S. businesses. In some countries, like Germany, a bribe in a foreign \ncountry is even eligible for a tax write-off. As the international \ntrade market continues to expand, it is time to get this problem under \ncontrol.\n  Although some talk of amending or repealing the FCPA to help American \nbusiness in their competitive race, it makes far better business sense \nto raise the international standards against bribery, and work for \nuniversal acceptance of the principles of the FCPA. This would help \nlevel the playing field for U.S. businesses and exports, and it is a \nsound economic move.\n  One of the most effective ways to do that is to work with other \ngovernments to implement the same strict regulations and penalties \nagainst bribery in international business by which U.S. entities have \nto live.\n  The Clinton administration has done a laudable job in advancing this \nagenda as part of its aggressive export strategy. They have \nconsistently raised this issue with other governments, both in public \nand private. They have pursued it in places such as the Organization on \nEconomic Cooperation and Development, and President Clinton raised it \nat the Summit of the Americas in Miami last year. I know the Ambassador \nto India, Ambassador Frank Wisner, has identified it as a major issue, \nand, as India develops its codes for international investment, he has \npledged to help ensure a level playing field for United States \ncompanies. The administration has also dedicated itself to promoting \nanticorruption as a basic principle of ``good governance'' within our \nassistance programs.\n  We took a good first step when the Organization on Economic \nCooperation and Development passed a strong resolution in May 1994 \nrecommending that member countries, which includes most of Europe, \nAustralia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand, ``take effective measures to \ndeter, prevent, and combat bribery of foreign public officials.'' This \nwas a very helpful measure in that all the OECD countries recognized \nbribery as a destabilizing factor in international trade, and pledged \nto cooperate on revisions of domestic laws and creation of \ninternational agreements. This recommendation has served as a launching \npad for international efforts against bribery, and has inspired some \nother successes in the first year since it was passed.\n  For example, in Ecuador, where the Government has tendered a contract \nfor a $170 million refinery project, bidders are required to sign a no-\nbribery pledge, and agreed that all third-party commissions would be \ndisclosed in the final contract. In Ukraine, top officials in the \nMinistry of International Economic Affairs are going to trial for \naccepting bribes from foreign and Ukranian corporations in exchange for \nassistance in export licenses.\n  [[Page S4111]] Domestically, several Governments have been rocked by \ncorruption scandals in recent months that have put the issue of bribery \non the front pages in France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. NATO is \ninvestigating its Secretary General for possibly accepting a kickback \npayment on a helicopter sale when he was Belgium's Economics Minister. \nIn Taiwan, there is an elaborate investigation into a murder of a \nmilitary officer who may have known of payoff in an arms deal. Even \nChina recently passed a law to restrict undue influence on judges, \nprosecutors, and police.\n  Bribery and corruption are finally emerging as a topic for public \ndiscussion, and, I\n  believe, that as more sunshine is cast on such practices, governments \nwill be under domestic pressure to pass anti-corruption legislation and \nreform. I am also confident that these movements will lead to scrutiny \nof how business is conducted overseas. In the meantime, we need to do \nall we can to ensure that American companies are playing on a level \nfield.\n\n  Today many small and medium-sized companies depend upon the \nassistance of our trade promotion agencies. These agencies offer \ndifferent kinds of financing, but all serve to promote American \nproducts for export, and balance out government subsidized programs \noffered by our trade competitors for their companies.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would guarantee that U.S. \nexport financing would benefit only those companies which do not have \nthe unfair advantage of bribery by prohibiting the Trade and \nDevelopment Agency, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, Export-\nImport Bank, and the Agency for International Development from \nproviding support for U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations which \nhave not adopted and enforced an anti-bribery code.\n  While U.S. subsidiaries are subject to the FCPA, their foreign parent \ncompanies are not, which may offer them an unfair advantage over wholly \nU.S.-owned firms. I do not think that U.S. taxpayer funds should be \nused to support further a corporation which may have the benefit of \nbribery--particularly if it hurts a wholly-owned American company. My \nlegislation is also intended to give a further incentive to foreign \ncorporations to adopt, on their own, restrictions against bribery. My \nbill is intended to support the work of both U.S. exporters and U.S. \ntrade promotion agencies in combating this terrible inequity.\n  I am also introducing a resolution that would express the sense of \nthe Senate that bribery is indeed a morally unacceptable business \npractice, and has destabilizing consequences for the international \ntrade environment. It commends the Clinton administration for their \nsolid efforts; encourages the administration to work toward universal \nacceptance of the principles set forth in the FCPA; and says the U.S. \nGovernment should enter into negotiations in order to establish \nregulations for international financial institutions and international \norganizations that prohibit bribery of foreign public officials and \nimpose sanctions for such bribery.\n  By no means can we resolve this issue in 1 year, or simply with a \ncouple of laws. Rather, we need to promote meaningful change in the \nbusiness culture worldwide, and we need to do that on a multilateral, \nif not global, basis. Large companies can afford to wait as the problem \nbegins to improve, but our small and medium-sized businesses--the \nbackbone of the U.S. economy--are, in some cases, being fatally wounded \nnow by competitors' bribery.\n  Bribery is nobody's preferred way to do business, yet it is standard \nplay in many parts of the world. We need to begin to address it \nseriously as a global problem. As recent events have shown, citizens of \nmany other countries--in both the industrialized and developing \nworlds--feel the same way. I hope my proposals will contribute to the \ndebate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 576\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1. PROHIBITION ON TRADE ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, an agency referred to in subsection (b) may not provide \n     economic support (including export assistance, subsidization, \n     financing, financial assistance, or trade advocacy) to or for \n     any foreign corporation or any United States subsidiary of a \n     foreign corporation unless the head of such agency certifies \n     to Congress that the foreign corporation has adopted and \n     enforces a corporate-wide policy that prohibits the bribery \n     of foreign public officials in connection with international \n     business transactions of the corporations and its \n     subsidiaries.\n       (b) Covered Agencies.--Subsection (a) applies to

Res. 89\n\n       Whereas a stable and predictable international business \n     environment is necessary to advance economic development \n     worldwide;\n       Whereas corrupt practices such as bribery and illicit \n     payments distort the international business environment and \n     sabotage fairness and competitiveness in international export \n     markets, particularly for small- and medium-sized businesses;\n       Whereas corrupt practices weaken foreign assistance \n     programs and other transactions for the benefit of the \n     general population by increasing the risk of the improper use \n     of funds from such assistance and increasing the cost of \n     providing such assistance;\n       Whereas bribery in international business, investment, and \n     trade is ethically and politically unacceptable;\n       Whereas United States nationals and companies, and their \n     foreign subsidiaries, are prohibited from bribing foreign \n     officials under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 \n     (Public Law 95-213);\n       Whereas United States trade competitors and nationals of \n     other industrialized countries are not prohibited by law from \n     utilizing bribes in retaining or obtaining foreign \n     procurement contracts;\n       Whereas some countries permit a deduction for income tax \n     purposes for bribes paid to secure foreign business;\n       Whereas ineffective enforcement or absence of anti-bribery \n     laws in many countries serves to discriminate against United \n     States nationals and businesses in competition for \n     procurement contracts abroad since the payment of bribes by \n     foreign companies is often the decisive factor in the award \n     of such contracts;\n       Whereas nations that engage in international trade have the \n     responsibility of combating bribery and corruption, even if \n     their own citizens may be subject to penalties therefor;\n       Whereas the failure of any nation to punish bribery \n     undermines efforts in the international market to combat \n     corrupt practices;\n       Whereas effective anticorruption statutes include criminal, \n     commercial, civil, and administrative laws prohibiting \n     bribery of foreign public officials, tax laws which make \n     bribery unprofitable, transparent business accounting \n     requirements that ensure proper recording of relevant \n     payments and appropriate inspection of such records, \n     prohibitions on licenses, government procurement contracts, \n     and public subsidies, and substantial monetary fines for \n     bribery;\n       Whereas an improvement in international activities to \n     combat bribery would result from cooperation between \n     countries in investigations into bribery, including the \n     sharing of information, the expediting of requests for \n     extradition, and the entry into mutual agreements and \n     arrangements to combat bribery;\n       Whereas the implementation of regulations to combat bribery \n     and corruption by international organizations and \n     international financial institutions would enhance efforts to \n     combat bribery;\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission of Transnational \n     Corporations concluded in 1991 that international action is \n     needed to combat the problem of bribes and other illicit \n     payments in international business transactions;\n       Whereas the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development passed a resolution on May 27, 1994, recommending \n     that OECD Member states ``deter, prevent, and combat the \n     bribery of foreign public officials in connection with \n     international business transactions'';\n       Whereas the Clinton administration has actively pursued \n     antibribery initiatives in the interest of free and fair \n     international trade;

and\n       (3) the United States Government should enter into \n     negotiations in order to establish regulations for \n     international financial institutions and international \n     organizations that prohibit bribery of foreign public \n     officials and impose sanctions for such bribery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/16/senate-section/article/S4112-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 90--AUTHORIZING THE TESTIMONY OF A SENATE EMPLOYEE\n\n  Mr. DOLE (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution;

SENSE OF SENATE ON SOUTH KOREA TRADE BARRIERS TO \n                   UNITED STATES BEEF AND PORK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has approximately 37,000 military \n     personnel stationed in South Korea and spent over \n     $2,000,000,000 last year to preserve peace on the Korean \n     peninsula.\n       (2) The United States Trade Representative has initiated a \n     section 301 investigation against South Korea for its \n     nontariff trade barriers on United States beef and pork.\n       (3) The barriers cited in the section 301 petition include \n     government-mandated shelf-life requirements, lengthy \n     inspection and customs procedures, and arbitrary testing \n     requirements that effectively close the South Korean market \n     to such beef and pork.\n       (4) United States trade and agriculture officials are in \n     the process of negotiating with South Korea to open South \n     Korea's market to United States beef and pork.\n       (5) The United States meat industry estimates that South \n     Korea's nontariff trade barriers on United States beef and \n     pork cost United States businesses more than $240,000,000 in \n     lost revenue last year and could account for more than \n     $1,000,000,000 in lost revenue to such business by 1999 if \n     South Korea's trade practices on such beef and pork are left \n     unchanged.\n       (6) The United States beef and pork industries are a vital \n     part of the United States economy, with operations in each of \n     the 50 States.\n       (7) Per capita consumption of beef and pork in South Korea \n     is currently twice that of such consumption in Japan. Given \n     that the Japanese are currently the leading importers of \n     United States beef and pork, South Korea holds the potential \n     of becoming an unparalleled market for United States beef and \n     pork.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the security relationship between the United States and \n     South Korea is essential to the security of the United \n     States, South Korea, the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of \n     the world;\n       (2) the efforts of the United States Trade Representative \n     to open South Korea's market to United States beef and pork \n     deserve support and commendation; and\n       (3) the United States Trade Representative should continue \n     to insist upon the removal of South Korea's nontariff \n     barriers to United States beef and pork.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  BROWN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 340\n\n  Mr. BROWN (and Mr. Gregg, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Mack, and Mr. Nickles) \nproposed an amendment to the bill, H.R. 889, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new title:\n            TITLE ____--MEXICAN DEBT DISCLOSURE ACT OF 1995\n\n     SEC. ____01.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a topic of \ngreat concern to this country, as well as the world: Iran.\n  In January, I introduced a bill, entitled ``The Comprehensive Iran \nSanctions Act of 1995.'' The recent press regarding the aborted Conoco \ndeal with the national Iranian oil company, has further brought the \nproblem of the purchase of Iranian oil by overseas subsidiaries of \nAmerican companies to light. These purchases help Iran fund their \nterrorism and keep their economy afloat. We can no longer subsidize \nIran's violence and terrorism.\n  For this reason, it is of paramount important that this bill becomes \nlaw. In regard to this, I ask that the following answers to a series of \nquestions on Iran's economic status that I posed to Manouchehr Ganji, \nSecretary General of the Organization for Human Rights and Fundamental \nFreedoms for Iran, who is based in Paris, be printed in the Record. His \nanswers are enlightening and provide the view of someone who knows with \nintimate detail, the threat that Iran poses to the world.\n  The material follows:\n\n         Organization for Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms \n           for Iran,\n                                    Paris, France, March 14, 1995.\n     Senator Alfonse D'Amato,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing and \n         Urban Affairs.\n       Dear Senator D'Amato, In response to your letter of March \n     9, 1995, I herewith enclose my reflections to the questions \n     posed. As you will note I have added a sixth question and \n     provided my responses to it as well. I will be available for \n     any further questions or clarifications.\n       Please accept Sir, the assurances of my highest \n     considerations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Manouchehr Ganji,\n     Secretary-General.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       Under today's deteriorating economic, social and political \n     conditions in Iran, a total U.S. trade embargo on Iran is the \n     single most important policy initiative that needs to be \n     taken if the overwhelming majority of Iranians, inside and \n     outside the country, are to be given the incentive to play \n     their full part in bringing about a change of government--to \n     allow power to be transferred to civilized, progressive and \n     democratic forces; an outcome which would, among other \n     things, remove the threat to the region and the world that \n     the present regime in Iran represents. It is my considered \n     opinion that a total U.S. trade embargo will ultimately be \n     effective, if (a) it is part of a coordinated strategy which \n     enjoys the actual as well as the declared support of other \n     governments and their agencies; and if (b) U.S. and other \n     policy-makers and their agencies are fully coordinated with \n     those civilized, progressive and democratic Iranian forces on \n     the ground, inside and outside Iran, which will take the lead \n     in bringing about a change of power. However, if such a \n     policy is not coordinated and well organized, it will not \n     necessarily bring about the desired results, and could even \n     be counter-productive. It is also my view that your list of \n     five questions should be extended to include one more. I am \n     therefore responding hereunder to six questions.\n       Question 1. We are aware of the severe problems that the \n     Iranian economy is facing. The government cannot serve all of \n     its short and long term debts, and basically is teetering on \n     total collapse. What benefits does Iran derive from its trade \n     with the United States, and how much importance does Iran \n     place on this trade?\n       Answer. The deterioration of the economic and financial \n     situation of Iran has been accelerating during the past \n     several months at an unprecedented rate. The situation can be \n     summarized as follows:\n       (1) The incapability of the country to service its short \n     and long term debts. This is in spite of the regime's efforts \n     to reschedule its debts of around $37 billion dollars, which \n     does not even include the debts to former communist \n     countries.\n      Presently, the debt service and foreign exchange policies \n     are out of control and the regime is incapable of taking \n     concrete steps to redress the situation.\\1\\\n     Footnotes at end of report.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       (2) From 1979 to 1995, the value of the Rial to the Dollar \n     had lost 30 times its value in the free market, whereas \n     during the last two months the value of the Rial has fallen \n     by an additional 50%,\\2\\ and no end is seen to the collapse \n     of the Rial. Most banks in the world are presently refusing \n     letters of credit from Iran.\n       (3) The shortage of foreign exchange has limited the import \n     of even essential goods such as pharmaceutical products, raw \n     materials, and spare parts. Domestic production is falling \n     rapidly--industrial production is running at 17%-20% of its \n     capacity.\\3\\ Agricultural production is also in trouble due \n     to the shortage of seeds, fertilizers and pesticides.\n       (4) To a large extent, Iran has also become ``a Dollar \n     economy'', in the sense that local prices are related to the \n     Dollar exchange rate. Consequently, the fall in the value of \n     the Rial, and the decreasing supply of goods (due to \n     shrinking imports and falling production) have been causing \n     price increases during the last two months of between 50% and \n     100%. This inflation is taking place in a country that is not \n     used to--contrary to some other countries--the psychology of \n     inflation, and lacks the experience and the mechanisms to \n     adapt to daily price increases.\n       It is in such exceptional context that we have to evaluate \n     the importance of trade between the United States and Iran. \n     Since the 1979 revolution, more than anytime before, oil \n     revenues play the central role in Iran's economy. In 1994 \n     Iran's oil revenues amounted to $11.9 billion.\\4\\ In 1994, \n     oil purchases of U.S. oil companies from Iran amounted to \n     $2.567 billion, or 25% of total oil revenues.\\5\\ The direct \n     U.S. exports to Iran were around $800 million in 1994. Not \n     only are these imports essential and substantial for the \n     regime, but, in addition, they allow it to cover certain \n     technological needs as well as other goods that Iran must \n     purchase from the U.S. due to its close economic and \n     industrial ties prior to the 1979 revolution.\n       Consequently, an embargo by the U.S. under the present \n     circumstances would substantially affect a crucial factor for \n     the regime which is its foreign exchange earnings from oil. \n     Even if one argues that the regime will find other buyers and \n     suppliers, this substitution shall take some time, whereas \n     the various effects of the embargo would be felt much \n     quicker. More importantly, the psychological impact of such \n     an embargo by the U.S. would be greater than the effect on \n     the actual flow of revenues and goods.\n       Question 2. Owing to its severe economic condition, what \n     effect (socially, politically and perhaps even \n     psychologically) would a total U.S. trade embargo have on \n     Iran?\n       Answer. Generally speaking, the ruling mullahs have been \n     talking about the U.S. trade embargo on Iran since the \n     seizure of the U.S. Embassy in 1979, and they have told so \n     many lies and boasted on their ability to survive the embargo \n     that the term ``embargo'' does not carry much weight unless \n     the U.S. clearly indicates that it means business and that \n     the ``embargo'' is much more than mere political rhetoric. \n     Thus, the embargo must be effective and must be seen as \n     effective; which means it must affect the regime's finances, \n     deprive the regime from buying the goods it needs-- including \n     instruments needed for its security forces--and finally, \n     financially pressure the regime to scale down its budget, \n     especially the allocation to its radical constituency and \n     forces of repression.\n       The most important effect of a total U.S. trade embargo \n     would actually be the psychological one--from two quite \n     different points of view. In so far as the present regime can \n     be said to have any confidence in its ability to survive, \n     that confidence is based on its ability to demonstrate that \n     it is continuing to enjoy at least a measure of U.S. support. \n     A critical factor in this light is the fact that U.S. \n     companies, oil companies in particular, are being allowed to \n     continue to purchase large amounts of oil from Iran. The \n     present regime is thus able to say to itself ``Powerful U.S. \n     vested interests need us as much as we need them. We're okay. \n     We can ride this storm out.'' In effect, the U.S. oil \n     companies, in order to protect their own short-term vested \n     interests as they see them, are sending the signal that gives \n     the present regime its hope for survival. A total U.S. trade \n     embargo would therefore undermine and probably destroy \n     whatever remaining confidence the present regime has of its \n     survival chance.\n       On the other hand, the psychological impact on the \n     overwhelming majority of the Iranian people--who will pay any \n     price necessary to rid themselves of the present regime, \n     provided only they believe that further hardship, suffering \n     and sacrifice will lead to the removal of the present \n     regime--will be in my opinion enormous and positive. For most \n     of the past sixteen years the main cause of despair in the \n     hearts of the largely silent, frightened and anti-regime \n     majority in Iran has been the perception that, to one degree \n     or another, the U.S. and other major powers were supportive \n     of the regime. The peoples of nations are no fools? They have \n     learned that when the U.S. in particular, and other major \n     powers in general, are supporting repressive regimes, there \n     is little or no point in those being repressed risking \n     everything in an effort to remove the source of repression.\n       Orinary Iranians do not believe that the ruling mullahs \n     have stayed in power simply on the strength of their own \n     resources and wits. They truly believe that the mullahs have \n     the hidden support of the big powers, including the oil \n     companies and international\n      financial institutions, and that is why they have survived \n     despite their obvious inefficiency and ignorance of the \n     ways of the modern world.\n       The psychology of the Iranian society, which for historical \n     reasons at times overestimates the role and influence of \n     foreign powers, particularly the United States, would view a \n     total U.S. trade embargo as a clear signal that the United \n     States has finally taken a definitive position against the \n     ruling mullahs. At the same time, the regime's supporters \n     will also lose confidence and morale for the same reason. \n     Furthermore taking into account the general state \n     [[Page S4117]] of dissatisfaction and opposition to the \n     regime which prevails in Iran today\\6\\, the positive \n     interpretation of a total U.S. trade embargo would be \n     manifold greater than the immediate adverse financial effects \n     of it. It can be assumed that large economic interests mainly \n     in the bazaar and close to the regime would then be more \n     inclined to distance themselves from the regime, and \n     establish contacts with the dissatisfied middle classes and \n     lower income classes whose living standard have been \n     completely disrupted by inflation and unemployment.\n       A total U.S. trade embargo would therefore be the signal \n     for which the overwhelming majority of Iranians have been \n     waiting for. Meaning that the U.S. does no longer support, in \n     any shape or form, the present regime and that the commitment \n     to the final struggle to remove it is for Iranians to make. \n     In effect, the positive psychological impact on the \n     overwhelming majority of Iranians will lead, by definition, \n     to a positive political impact. One may ask, what of the \n     social impact? It can be said that the hardship and suffering \n     of most Iranians could hardly be worse than it already is. \n     But as indicated above, most Iranians are willing to make the \n     further sacrifices required of them provided they feel that \n     it could result in the collapse of the present regime and the \n     opening of the door to a worthwhile and democratic future. \n     This indirect support of the opposition forces at this \n     crucial stage when a power struggle within the regime is also \n     taking new dimensions would be well received inside and \n     outside of Iran.\n       Therefore, an embargo in the case of the Islamic Republic \n     is not only a trade issue and should not be looked upon only \n     as a balance sheet of what U.S. companies will be losing and \n     what will be the financial loss to the regime. Such a policy \n     will be suffocating to the ruling mullahs and will be taken \n     as a signal of support for those struggling for the freedom \n     of Iran. It will also act as a very strong signal to other \n     countries that the time for ``the party to which terrorists \n     are invited'' is over!\n       However, the sine qua non for the success of the \n     administration's policy to isolate the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran internationally is for the U.S. to do as it preaches and \n     to effectively take the lead in this regard thus making \n     itself a model by strictly adhering to such a policy. How can \n     the U.S. persuade other countries to restrain from relations \n     with the Islamic Republic when the U.S. is in fact itself a \n     major trading partner of that renegade regime? There is no \n     doubt that a total U.S. trade embargo would strengthen the \n     U.S. position in its efforts to isolate the Tehran regime. \n     Terrorism and extremism are like drugs, they have to be \n     fought internationally. Oil money in the hand of the Tehran \n     mullahs--the symbol of state terrorism and dark ages in \n     today's world--is like cleaned drug money in the hands of \n     drug smugglers. It is oil money combined with foreign aid and \n     assistance that has prolonged the life of the extremist \n     regime in Iran, enabling it to continue to disregard all \n     rights and freedoms of the Iranian people to carry out acts \n     of terrorism abroad, and to destabilize the moderate pro-\n     western Moslem countries.\n       Question 3. In its present form, does the Clinton \n     Administration's policy of ``dual containment'' of Iran and \n     Iraq work?\n       Answer. An evaluation of this policy has to be made \n     separately with regard to each country.\n       Iraq: After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait a radical change of \n     U.S. policy towards Iraq took place. The former policy of \n     support for Iraq against the regime in Tehran turned into a \n     policy of isolation. Destruction of Iraq's war power and of \n     its chemical and nuclear facilities became paramount. Since \n     the war between Iran and Iraq had ended, there was no longer \n     the need for military support of Iraq against the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran. Although Saddam Hussein is still in power \n     in Baghdad and continues his repressive policies. Iraq's \n     aggressive designs have been checked and neutralized. The \n     integrity of Iraq has been preserved, which is most \n     important, taking into account the possibility of a \n     fundamentalist Shiite state in the south and the possibility \n     of the Kurdish secession in the north. Although some volume \n     of trade has been going on between Iran and Iraq, taking into \n     account the historical issues and quarrels between the two \n     countries, no united front against the U.S. has been formed. \n     One can safely say that on the whole the policy of \n     containment has been successful concerning Iraq.\n       Iran: Taking into account the nature of the Islamic \n     Republic, the implication of this policy must be viewed \n     separately. Today, the Islamic Republic is the center of \n     support for the extremist fundamentalist movements such as \n     the Hamas, Jihad and Hizballah in their efforts to fight and \n     derail the Middle East peace process. The ruling mullahs in \n     Iran believe that if these extremist movements success in \n     destroying the peace process, they would also succeed in \n     destabilizing the moderate pro-western countries in the \n     region with Tehran's help and leadership. In spite of the \n     dual containment policy declaration and the U.S. government's \n     efforts to isolate the Islamic Republic, trade relations \n     between the two countries have remained the same or have even \n     risen. Oil purchases by U.S. oil companies and direct or \n     indirect trade between the two countries have continued at \n     even a higher level than before. The Tehran regime still \n     continues to pursue arms and weapons of mass destruction, \n     support international terrorism, subvert the Arab-Israeli \n     peace process, abuse human rights at home, assassinate \n     political opponents abroad and promote militant Islamic \n     fundamentalist movements in other Muslim countries in the \n     Middle East and in North Africa.\n       Under these circumstances, the regime in Tehran has \n     concluded that the United States is not serious and has no \n     real policy against it. In fact, they may be right as they \n     compare the U.S. policy towards themselves with the U.S. \n     policy toward Iraq, both of\n      which are within the context of the dual containment policy. \n     Therefore, the dual containment policy would be more \n     successful if tougher criteria would also be applied vis-\n     a-vis the regime in Tehran. The embargo is certainly a \n     first and a right step in that direction. It is imperative \n     however, that the stated target and aim of the sanctions \n     be the regime and not the people of Iran.\n       Question 4. What response would you have to the charge by \n     U.S. companies (oil companies in particular) that an embargo \n     only hurts U.S. companies and will not hurt Iran?\n       Answer. By definition a total U.S. embargo will result in \n     short term losses for U.S. companies, oil companies in \n     particular. In their position I would insist that my \n     government does everything in its power to see that the \n     embargo is global. In their position I would also have good \n     cause for grievance if other governments allowed their \n     companies to make short term gains at my expense. In other \n     words, there is a case for saying that a total U.S. trade \n     embargo could hurt U.S. companies more than it would hurt the \n     regime in Iran if the U.S. was unable to persuade all other \n     major powers to make common cause with it.\n       But there is another more important argument which U.S. \n     companies (oil companies in particular) would be well advised \n     to consider even if other governments did allow their \n     companies to go on trading with the Islamic Republic of the \n     Iran. If U.S. companies continue to be seen by a growing \n     number of Iranians as the agencies which are doing most to \n     prop up the present discredited and despised regime in Iran, \n     there will come a time when the present regime is replaced, \n     when U.S. companies will have much and perhaps everything to \n     lose. What U.S. companies would be well advised to weigh \n     carefully is what they might gain in the short term against \n     what they could lose in the longer term. If they give the \n     matter the consideration it deserves, U.S. companies should \n     not have that much difficulty in concluding that it is in \n     their best longer term interest to support a total embargo, \n     particularly under the current intense economic and political \n     conditions in Iran.\n       If other governments did then allow their companies to make \n     short term gains at the expense of their American \n     counterparts, U.S. companies would end up being the longer \n     term beneficiaries--because they would be seen by the \n     overwhelming majority of Iranians in a new Iran to have \n     played a part in bringing an end to the present discredited \n     and despised regime.\n       Question 5. If the United States were to impose an embargo \n     cited in Senator D'Amato's bill, in your opinion, would the \n     industrialized countries follow?\n       Answer. Since the Iranian regime is a real threat to \n     international peace and stability, and in view of the fact \n     that its declared policy is to harm U.S. interests, it seems \n     that the United States has a perfect moral and legal case in \n     seeking to internationalize its embargo in the same way it \n     mobilized the international community against the Iraqi \n     regime.\n       The argument that isolating the Iranian regime would only \n     make it more intransigent is wrong. So is the argument that \n     by bringing the mullahs into the international fold one can \n     tame them. Today, this argument is presumably put forward by \n     the Germans and the Japanese more than others. The fact is \n     that the Iranian mullahs, being extremely cynical, receive \n     the wrong signal from appeasement and accommodation. They \n     interpret such overtures as a sign of weakness which \n     indicates that the West is not serious about their unruly \n     behavior and lacks resolve and political will to confront \n     them. However, experience has shown that the ruling mullahs, \n     being bullies, lose their morale quickly as soon as they are \n     convinced that their adversary is strong, determined and \n     means business.\n       My guess is that some major powers would be mightily \n     tempted to seek to make short term gain at America's \n     expense--it least until it is clear that the present regime \n     in Iran is close to being toppled. Then they would try to \n     change horses. I am therefore of the opinion that U.S. \n     policy-makers would be well advised to every effort to bring \n     other major power on board. Much could depend on the extent \n     to which other major powers are consulted by the U.S. before \n     any announcement, (if there is to be one) of a total trade \n     embargo. If the British, French, Germans and others are able \n     to say, ``we were not consulted'', they consider that they \n     have enough scope to play games. If the United States clearly \n     indicates that it means business and that the embargo is more \n     than more political rhetoric, other industrialized nations \n     will think twice about doing business with the present regime \n     in Iran under the prevailing economic and political \n     conditions.\n       Question 6. If the United States were to impose an embargo \n     cited in Senator D'Amato's bill, what in your opinion would \n     be the likelihood of the present regime in Iran, or elements \n     within it, deciding to mount a terror campaign against U.S. \n     interests for the purpose of weakening American resolve and, \n     by \n     [[Page S4118]] intimidation, driving a wedge between the U.S. \n     and other major powers, the Europeans especially? And if you \n     think the present regime in Iran (or elements within it) \n     might consider such a strategy, how do you assess the ability \n     to perform?\n       Answer. The clerical regime has been in power in Iran for \n     sixteen years and it still claims it does not condone, much \n     less support, terrorism. By now, however, so much evidence to \n     the contrary has accumulated in so many countries that Tehran \n     clerics professions of innocence are seen as little more than \n     self-serving lies. There are no signs that the clerical \n     regime has any intention to mending its way. Reports from \n     throughout the Middle East and North Africa reflect the \n     Tehran regime's determination to use terrorist violence to \n     achieve its expansionist aims. One of the regime's latest \n     weapons in its war on the world is Hamas, a radical \n     fundamentalist Palestinian group on which the Islamic \n     Republic has lavished millions of Dollars as well as weapons \n     and guerrilla training.\n       As I know to my cost, the present regime has the ability to \n     carry out single-hit assassinations in virtually any place of \n     its choice. But the evidence of Lockerbie would seem to \n     suggest that for more complex terror operations the Tehran \n     regime requires (or prefers) the organizational assistance of \n     international extremist forces such as the\n      Hizballah, Jihad and Hamas. If the need to contain the \n     possibility of terror strikes by the present regime in \n     Iran arises due to the imposition of trade sanctions, \n     history dictates that the proper course of action is the \n     policy of combating terrorism at its source, and making it \n     clear to the proponents of terrorism that they have much \n     to lose as a consequence of their actions.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       A relatively effective trade embargo on Iran will place \n     noticeable constraints on the regime's finances. This will \n     deprive the regime from access to funds which it can use to \n     finance oppressive operations at home and mischievous \n     activities abroad. However, in order to maximize the effects \n     of a total trade embargo, there must be a coordinated and \n     well organized political action to further isolate the Tehran \n     regime at home and abroad. Such a political action should \n     embody measures to deny the regime the prestige and \n     respectability associated with a government in charge of a \n     State on the one hand, while it strengthens popular \n     opposition to the regime both at home and abroad on the other \n     hand. Most importantly, it is imperative that the stated \n     target and aim of the sanctions be the regime in Tehran as \n     opposed to the Iranian people. This distinction is extremely \n     crucial.\n       Action by the United States alone in imposing a total trade \n     embargo on the Islamic Republic will be effective \n     economically, politically and psychologically. However, there \n     is no reason why the U.S. should not seek to enlarge the \n     embargo by trying to internationalize it, particularly since \n     a coordinated strategy which enjoys the declared support of \n     other governments would unquestionably yield a much greater \n     success in isolating the Tehran regime. The policies of the \n     present regime in Iran are no less repulsive than those of \n     the apartheid regime in South Africa. It would be worth \n     reviewing the type of actions which were undertaken against \n     the apartheid regime of South Africa in the 1970's and 1980's \n     which were ultimately successful in promoting freedom and \n     democracy.\n       The United States Senate can initiate a campaign of moral \n     opposition to the regime in Iran by giving international \n     dimensions to its opposition to the clerical regime's \n     renegade behavior and inhuman policies. Unlike the ambiguous \n     policies of the past, a total U.S. trade embargo as proposed \n     by Senator D'Amato would not only send the right signal to \n     the ruling mullahs, but it would also solidify the leadership \n     position of the U.S. and enable it to successfully convince \n     its allies to comply and adhere to such a policy, and thereby \n     enhance the probability of success.\n\n\n                               Footnotes\n\n     \\1\\In the Fiscal Year April 1994-1995, 56 billion have been \n     rescheduled up to now and will ultimately need to be repaid. \n     this amount would represent about 60% of expected oil \n     revenues for that Fiscal Year.\n     \\2\\In 1979, 1 Dollar was equivalent to 78 Rials; in January \n     1995, 1 Dollar was equivalent to 2000-2200 Rials, and in \n     March 1995, 1 Dollar was equivalent to 4000-4500 Rials.\n     \\3\\Imports of $2.5 billion are required if the industry works \n     at 25% of its capacity.

ALBRIGHT'S ELOQUENT REMARKS\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my \ncolleagues an eloquent speech given by United Nations Ambassador \nMadeline K. Albright at the annual dinner of the national Democratic \nInstitute for International Affairs [NDI] on March 1.\n  At this dinner, Ambassador Albright and South African First Deputy \nPresident Thabo Mbeki received W. Averall Harriman Democracy Awards for \ntheir work promoting democracy and freedom.\n  Ambassador Albright spoke persuasively about the need for the United \nStates to remain engaged in world affairs. She warned against again \nlistening to the ``siren song of isolationism,'' which fooled us during \nthe 1920's and 1930's into believing that we could retreat from the \nworld around us. As World War II demonstrated, a doctrine that promised \nto put ``America First'' in reality did great damage to our national \ninterests.\n  I hope my colleagues will find Ambassador Albright's words as \ninsightful as I did, and I ask that they be printed in the Record.\n  The speech follows:\n\n       Thank you, Senator Dodd. And thank you, Mr. Vice-President, \n     Mr. Deputy President, members of the diplomatic corps, \n     friends and supporters of NDI. This is a great honor, coming \n     as it does from an institution whose birth I witnessed and of \n     which I am very, very proud.\n       As Vice Chair of the board in years past, I helped to \n     choose candidates, select recipients and recruit presenters \n     for this award. Last year, I presented it, myself. So I've \n     seen this event from every side, and I can tell you: it may \n     be more blessed to give; but it is definitely more fun to \n     receive.\n       The accomplishments of NDI continue to expand. Wherever I \n     have traveled the last two years, it has seemed that NDI \n     either had been there, was there, or was due on the next \n     plane. I have seen its representatives at work in Europe, \n     Africa and Latin America. They have a well-earned reputation \n     for competence, honesty and pragmatism.\n       Thanks should go to the leadership and staff here in \n     Washington, from Ken Wollack and Jean Dunn on down, and to \n     the presence of people in the field who are flat out terrific \n     at what they do.\n       I am grateful to all of you, and I am doubly pleased to \n     share this night with Deputy President Mbeki. Last year, he \n     became the first representative of a democratic South Africa \n     to address the Security Council. After he spoke, I sat there, \n     as Ambassadors are wont to do, applauding silently.\n       What I would like to have done is stand on my chair and \n     shout ``Hallelujah''. For decades at the UN, the very name \n     ``South Africa'' had summoned forth only sanctions and shame. \n     Mr. Mbeki's statement marked its transformation into a symbol \n     of inspiration and hope.\n       The new South Africa gives freedom fighters everywhere \n     cause to persist; it reminds all of us that international \n     solidarity does matter: and it provides fresh evidence that \n     human beings, when imbued with courage and sustained by \n     faith, can achieve almost anything.\n       We know from history, however, that few victories are \n     permanent. The last day of one struggle is the first day of \n     the next.\n       That is true for those from Central America to Central Asia \n     who are trying to make new democracies succeed.\n       And it is true for those who believe, as do I, that \n     although the Cold War has ended, America's commitment to \n     freedom around the world must live on.\n       Unfortunately, as after other great struggles in our \n     nation's history, some feel that our security has been \n     assured, and urge that we move now from the center stage of \n     international life to a seat somwehere in the mezzanine.\n       The new isolationists find their echo in the narrow-\n     visioned naysayers of the 1920's and 30's, who rejected the \n     League of Nations, embraced protectionism, downplayed the \n     rise of Hitler, opposed help to the victims of aggression and \n     ultimately endangered our own security--claiming all the \n     while that all they were doing was ``putting America first.''\n       Today their battle cry is ``Retreat.'' Their bumper sticker \n     is ``Kill the UN.'' And their philosophy is--``Let the people \n     of the Balkans and other troubled lands slaughter each other, \n     for their anguish is God's problem, not our own.''\n       The isolationists were wrong in the 1930's; they are wrong \n     now. They prevailed then; they must fail now. Their view of \n     our national interest is too narrow; their view of history \n     too short; and their sense of public opinion just plain \n     wrong.\n       Most Americans understand that what happens in the world \n     affects almost every aspect of our lives. We live in a nation \n     that is democratic, trade-oriented, respectful of the law and \n     possessed of a powerful military whose men and women are \n     precious to us. We will do better and feel safer in an \n     environment where our values are widely shared, markets are \n     open, military clashes are constrained and those who run \n     roughshod over the rights of others are brought to heel.\n       Isolationism will do nothing to create such an environment; \n     helping new and emerging democracies will.\n       There is no question that the National Endowment for \n     Democracy was one of Ronald Reagan's better ideas. But it was \n     conceived primarily to counter a single virulent ideology. \n     Today, that is no longer sufficient. We build now, not out of \n     fear, but on hope. It is our responsibility, and our \n     opportunity, to lock in the gains yielded by past sacrifice.\n       [[Page S4119]] As NDI recognizes, building democracy \n     requires more than distributing copies of the Constitution, \n     or even the entire reading list of the Speaker of the House. \n     Elections are but one vote in the democratic symphony. \n     Democracy requires legal structures that works; political \n     parties that offer a choice; markets that are free; police \n     that serve the people, instead of terrorizing them; and--the \n     O.J. Simpson trial notwithstanding--a press makes its own \n     choices about what is news.\n       The leaders of new democracies face challenges that \n     dictators often do not. First, they are accountable; they \n     must respond to public expectations. They must transform \n     economies distorted by decades of centralized planning or \n     graft. They must practice austerity in a setting where long-\n     suppressed hopes have been unleashed. They may face \n     overwhelming social, environmental and criminal challenges.\n       And they must teach factions that have for years killed \n     each year the satisfaction of out-thinking, out-debating and \n     out-polling each other.\n       NDI is part of a global network that is working to help \n     these new leaders succeed. I know from my own experience that \n     this can be exhilarating, but humbling work. For on every \n     continent, there are individuals who know better than most of \n     us the price of repression; those who have risked not job \n     titles and office space by standing up for what they believe, \n     but prison sentences, brutal beatings, torture and death.\n       NDI's efforts in support of democracy are reinforced by \n     those of other NGO's, human rights monitors, church groups, \n     regional organizations and increasingly, I am pleased to say, \n     by the United Nations.\n       But America belongs at the head of this movement. For \n     freedom is perhaps the clearest expression of national \n     purpose and policy ever adopted--and it is our purpose. Like \n     other profound human aspirations, it can never fully be \n     achieved. It is not a possession; it is a pursuit. It is the \n     star by which America has navigated since before we were a \n     country, and still an idea.\n       So, I am proud that this Administration had the guts, the \n     wisdom and the conviction to restore to the people of Haiti \n     the democracy that had been stolen from them; and I am \n     waiting for the day when those who nitpicked and bellyached \n     about that decision will admit they were wrong and the \n     President was right.\n       I am proud, also, of our steadfast support for reform and \n     reformers in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. \n     There, the success or failure of the democratic experiment \n     will do much to determine the kind of world in which our \n     children will live.\n       I am committed, as I think all who believe in democracy \n     should be, to the survival in Bosnia of a viable, multi-\n     ethnic state.\n       And I want the War Crimes Tribunals for Rwanda and former \n     Yugoslavia to establish the truth before the perpetrators of \n     genocide obscure it. These tribunals serve the cause not only \n     of justice, but of peace. For true reconciliation will not be \n     possible in these societies until the perception of \n     collective guilt has been erased, and individual culpability \n     assigned.\n       Democratic principles are the best answer there is to the \n     ethnic clashes that have arisen so often and so tragically in \n     recent years.\n       As our own history attests, and as the presence of \n     Representative John Lewis here tonight reminds us, a \n     government that allocates the privileges of citizenship \n     according to ethnicity or race invites weakness and risks \n     civil war.\n       Nationhood alone is no grounds for pride; nations must be \n     instruments of law, justice, liberty and tolerance. They must \n     be inclusionary, not exclusionary. That is what democracy is: \n     and that is the difference between a true nation, such as \n     South Africa today; and the pariah South Africa of decades \n     past.\n       This is a year of anniversaries. The era in which most of \n     us have lived most of our lives began 50 years ago. In recent \n     months, we have been reminded of how much we owe the ``guys \n     named Joe'' who landed on the beaches of Normandy, won the \n     Battle of the Bulge and raised the flag at Iwo Jima.\n       Let us never forget the lesson behind those memories. Let \n     us never forget why that war began, how that war was won or \n     what that war was about.\n       Aggressors must be resisted. Fascism must never again \n     arise. Intolerance can never again be allowed to hide behind \n     the mask of nationalist pride. And the siren song of \n     isolationism must never again distract us from the \n     responsibilities of leadership.\n       History did not end when the Nazis surrendered, or when the \n     Berlin Wall fell or when Boris Yeltsin climbed onto that tank \n     or when Arafat and Rabin shook hands or when Nelson Mandela \n     took the oath of office.\n       Each generation is tested. Each must choose: engagement or \n     indifference; tolerance or intolerance; the rule of law or no \n     law at all.\n       We have a responsibility in our time, as others have had in \n     theirs, not to be prisoners of history, but to shape it; to \n     build a world not without conflict, but in which conflict is \n     effectively contained; a world, not without repression, but \n     in which the sway of freedom is enlarged; a world not without \n     lawless behavior, but in which the law-abiding are \n     progressively more secure.\n       That is our shared task in this new era.\n       Thank you very much.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/16/senate-section/article/S4118-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO THE MEXICO BULLDOGS\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMissouri's 3A State High School basketball champions, the Mexico \nBulldogs.\n  The team members, Aaron Angel, Chris Azdell, Cookie Belcher, Jason \nBrookins, Joey Dubbert, Jay Frazer, Kyle Henage, Doug Hoer, Tony \nMiller, Lance Parker, Scott Pitts, Matt Qualls, Jerrod Thompson, Dimos \nTzavaris, and Brennen VanMatre; Head Coach Keith Miller and Assistant \nCoach Todd Berck; the student body; and the community of Mexico are all \nto be commended on their teamwork and commitment to do their best. Last \nyear, the Mexico ball club finished second; this year they were \ndetermined to go all the way. That determination paid off, as they \ndisplayed teamwork and commitment in reaching their goal--that had \nnever before been reached in the school's history.\n  Teamwork in basketball is essential; individual effort is also \nessential. The Mexico Bulldogs were lead by team members such as Cookie \nBelcher, who hit a jump shot to tie the score at 68-68 with only 4 \nminutes left in the game; Jerrod Thompson who matched Belcher's 30-\npoint contribution; reserve player Brennan Van Matre who hit the \nrebound basket that put the Bulldog team ahead to stay; Jason Brookins \nwho delivered the final points with a fantastic alley-oop dunk with \nonly 86 seconds left to play. Individual contributions by all the team \nmembers helped to make the game one for the history books.\n  Individual and team efforts on behalf of the Mexico fans also played \nan important part in the Bulldogs' win. Mexico has long been a \ncommunity dedicated to improving its way of life. Families, business \nowners, and employees strive to enhance opportunities for all and are \nto be commended on their efforts. This dedication truly came to light \nwhen the Bulldogs were fighting their way to the top to achieve their \ngoal.\n  The Mexico Bulldogs, Missouri's State 3A Basketball Champs deserve to \nbe recognized for their work, and I am proud to be a fellow \nMexicoan.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/16/senate-section/article/S4119-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n Mr. McCAIN.
