We know that you have no need of us, \nthat you are in no way dependent on our actions, that Your existence \nawaits no vote of this Chamber, nor our own personal assent.\n  We praise You that, being the One whom You are, out of Your love You \nhave made us in Your image, as creatures who, like Yourself, want to \nknow and be known.\n  Thank You for the way we see that in our personal lives and in our \nsociety. Thank You for those who have gone before who have taught us \nsomething of what it means to live together as one nation. We pray that \nYou would today help this body in its deliberations. You know, Lord, \nthe pressures of time and public expectation, the good motives, on both \nsides of the aisle, to help the people of this land.\n  We ask that in this Chamber of debate, You would help each one who \nspeaks remember the account that she or he will give not only to their \ncolleagues here and the voters, but to their own consciences and most \nof all, to You, Lord.\n  We know that the secrets of our hearts are entirely discovered to \nYou, and we praise You that You do not allow us to hide ourselves \ncompletely from You.\n  We ask that You would give a measure of Your wisdom to these gathered \nhere today. Help them to pass laws that ennoble rather than enervate \nthe people. Give them wisdom to speak today with the liberty of knowing \nthat they are about purposes, that are not only great, but that are \nalso good.\n  For those who are discouraged, finding only emptiness amid all the \nsuccess which the world tells them they have, show them Yourself.\n  For those who are swollen with pride, in Your love, break them that \nYou might bind them up; wound them, that You might heal them again.\n  Thank You for the freedom of speech which we enjoy in this land. Help \nthese Senators today to use that freedom realizing the privilege that \nit is, for our good and for Your glory.\n  In Christ's name we ask it. Amen.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/17/senate-section/article/S957-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n             USDA REPORT ON THE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the USDA issued a report analyzing \nthe effects of the House Republican Personal Responsibility Act (H.R. \n4), which is part of the Contract With America. All States including \nVermont are big losers. I suggest that all Senators read this report \nwhich I am inserting into the Record.\n  My home State of Vermont alone will lose $10 million in Federal \nnutrition aid in 1996 according to the USDA report.\n  H.R. 4 will increase malnutrition among children and the elderly. \nThis Contract With America bill is antichild, antifamily, and it is \nfalse advertising. It promises block grants, but delivers not even a \npenny.\n  The report also concludes that this bill could reduce retail food \nsales by as much as $10 billion, reduce gross farm income by as much as \n$4 billion, and cost the economy as many as 138,000 jobs.\n  It could reduce the income of the average dairy farmer in Vermont by \nas much as $2,000 per year and could also double the cost of the dairy \nprogram nationwide.\n  This is a double whammy--it will force dairy farmers to apply for \nfood assistance just when that assistance is slashed.\n  Nutrition funding nationwide will be cut by almost $31 billion over \nthe next 5 years.\n  It eliminates the Meals on Wheels Program which provides food to the \nhomebound elderly.\n  Seventy-five percent of the school children in Vermont will be thrown \noff the School Lunch Program. Nutrition standards for healthy school \nlunches are eliminated. And the cuts in child nutrition in Vermont \nexceed the total size of our School Breakfast Program and the Summer \nFood Service Program.\n  As bad as this is, I am worried that the USDA report issued today \ngreatly understates the harm that will be caused by the Contract With \nAmerica. The report in many respects assumes that the block grants will \nbe fully funded. I believe that in a couple years, they will be only \nfunded at a fraction of the full amount authorized.\n  America's Governors will be stunned when they read the fine print and \nrealize they have to come to Washington each year and plead for money.\n  States will be forced to reduce the number of people served, cut \nbenefits or somehow make up for the loss with State funds.\n  The effect would be even worse during a recession. Under current law, \nprograms such as school lunch, food stamps, and the Child Care Food \nProgram, automatically give States more money to respond to increased \nneeds during periods of higher unemployment.\n  This Contract With America bill changes all that and says to the \nStates, ``tough luck, next time don't have a recession.''\n  According to the USDA report, if that bill had been in effect over \nthe last 5 years, the block grant in 1994 would have been over $12 \nbillion less than the food assistance actually provided--a reduction of \nabout one-third.\n  They are proposing a massive Federal experiment on America's \nchildren. If it works, I admit that Federal costs will be reduced.\n  If it doesn't, and funding is not provided, millions of children, the \nelderly, and pregnant women will go hungry. Medical costs will \nskyrocket as more and more children are born disabled, and more and \nmore children become handicapped in their efforts to learn.\n  Before we have a wholesale dismantling of every major nutrition \nprogram under the guise of welfare reform, we ought to take a look at \nhow this will affect hungry children.\n  This is not welfare reform. Do not be fooled by this bill. It implies \nthat States will get block grants to fund food assistance programs. But \nas I said earlier, not one penny is provided to states or communities \nby the bill--separate legislation would have to pass each year to \nprovide funding.\n  Let us not forget what happened in early 1981--hasty cuts were made \nin child nutrition programs. Those programs were cut by 28 percent. The \ncuts resulted in 3 million fewer children receiving school lunches.\n  I stand ready to work with responsible Members of both parties to \nencourage work, to cut costs, to punish abuse, but I will not sacrifice \nthe nutrition of America's children for legislation by bumper sticker.\n  I ask unanamous consent that the USDA report be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n        [From the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Jan. 17, 1995]\n\n The Nutrition, Health, and Economic Consequences of Block Grants for \n          Federal Food Assistance Programs--Executive Summary\n\n        The proposed Personal Responsibility Act, a key component \n     of the Contract with America, would make sweeping changes \n     that alter the very character of the existing food assistance \n     programs. Specifically, the Personal Responsibility Act, if \n     enacted, would:\n       Combine all USDA food and nutrition assistance programs \n     into a single discretionary block grant to States;\n       Authorize an appropriation of $35.6 billion in fiscal year \n     1996 for food and nutrition assistance;\n       Eliminate all uniform national standards;\n       Give States broad discretion to design food and nutrition \n     assistance programs, provided only that no more than 5 \n     percent of the grant support administration, at least 12 \n     percent support food assistance and nutrition education for \n     women, infants, and young children, and at least 20 percent \n     support school-based and child-care meal programs; and\n       Eliminate USDA's authority to donate commodities; USDA \n     could only sell bonus commodities to States.\n       The consequences of these changes on the safety net of food \n     assistance programs, the nutrition and health of low-income \n     Americans, the food and agriculture economies, and the level \n     and distribution of Federal support to States for food \n     assistance are significant.\n       The Personal Responsibility Act would significantly reduce \n     federal support for food and nutrition assistance.\n       Federal funding for food and nutrition assistance would \n     fall by more than $5 billion in fiscal year 1996 and nearly \n     $31 billion over 5 years (Table 1).\n       All food and nutrition assistance would be forced to \n     compete for limited discretionary funds. States' ability to \n     deliver nutrition benefits would be subject to changing \n     annual appropriation priorities.\n       Programs would be unable to respond to changing economic \n     circumstances. During economic downturns, funding would not \n     keep up with rising poverty and unemployment. The demand for \n     assistance to help the poor would be greatest at precisely \n     the time when state economies are in recession and tax bases \n     are shrinking.\n       For example, if the Personal Responsibility Act had been in \n     place over the last five years--a period marked by both \n     economic recession and recovery--the block grant in 1994 \n     would have been over $12 billion less than the food \n     assistance actually provided, a reduction of about one-third \n     (Table 2).\n       States would be forced to reduce the number of people \n     served, the benefits provided, or some combination of both. \n     The bill could lead to the termination of benefits for 6 \n     million food stamp recipients in fiscal year 1996.\n       The reduced investment in food and nutrition assistance \n     programs and elimination of the authority to establish \n     nutrition standards will adversely affect the nutrition and \n     health of low-income families and individuals.\n       The scientific link between diet and health is clear. About \n     300,000 deaths each year are linked to diet and activity \n     patterns.\n       Low-income households are at greater risk of nutrition-\n     related disorders and chronic disease than the general U.S. \n     population. Since the nationwide expansion of the Food Stamp \n     Program and the introduction of WIC, the gap between the \n     diets of low-income and other families has narrowed.\n       The incidence of stunting among pre-school children has \n     decreased by nearly 65 percent; the incidence of low \n     birthweight has fallen from 8.3 percent to 7.0 percent.\n       The prevalence of anemia among low-income pre-school \n     children has dropped by 5 percent or more for most age and \n     racial/ethnic groups.\n       The Personal Responsibility Act would eliminate all federal \n     nutrition standards, including those in place to ensure that \n     America's children have access to healthy meals at school. \n     Even small improvements in average dietary intakes can have \n     great value. The modest reductions in fat, saturated fat, and \n     cholesterol intake due to the recent food labeling changes \n     were valued by the Food and Drug Administration at $4.4 \n     billion to $26.5 billion over 20 years among the U.S. adult \n     population.\n       [[Page S959]] The Act would also threaten the key \n     components of WIC--a tightly prescribed combination of a \n     targeted food package, nutrition counseling, and direct links \n     to health care. Rigorous studies have shown that WIC reduces \n     infant deaths, low birthweight, premature births, and other \n     problems. Every dollar spent on WIC results in between $1.77 \n     and $3.13 in Medicaid savings for newborns and their mothers.\n       By reducing federal support for food assistance and \n     converting all remaining food assistance to a block grant, \n     the Personal Responsibility Act would lower retail food \n     sales, reduce farm income, and increase unemployment.\n       Under the proposed block grant, States could immediately \n     cash-out any and all food assistance programs in spite of \n     evidence that an in-kind benefit is more effective in \n     stimulating food purchases than a similar benefit provided in \n     cash.\n       In the short-run, the bill could reduce retail food sales \n     by as much as $10 billion, reduce gross farm income by as \n     much as $4 billion, increase farm program costs, and cost the \n     economy as many as 138,000 jobs.\n       In the long run, the bill could reduce employment in farm \n     production by more than 15,000 jobs and output by more than \n     $1 billion. The food processing and distribution sectors \n     could lose as many as 83,000 jobs and $9 billion in output.\n       The economic effects would be felt most heavily in rural \n     America. In both the short- and long-run, rural areas would \n     suffer disproportionate job losses.\n       Every $1 billion in added food assistance generates about \n     25,000 jobs, providing an automatic stabilizer in hard times.\n       The proposed basis for distributing grant funds would \n     result in substantial losses for most States.\n       If Congress appropriates the full amount authorized, all \n     but 8 States would lose federal funding in fiscal year 1996. \n     California could gain about $650 million; Texas could lose \n     more than $1 billion (Table 3).\n       Although some States initially gain funding, all States \n     would eventually fare worse than under current law. Over \n     time, the initial gains will erode because the block grant \n     eliminates the automatic funding adjustments built into the \n     existing Food Stamp and Child Nutrition programs.\n\n            TABLE 1.--EFFECT OF THE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT ON USDA FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM COSTS           \n                                            [In millions of dollars]                                            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       Fiscal year--                            \n                                                    --------------------------------------------------   Total  \n                                                       1996      1997      1998      1999      2000             \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent law:                                                                                                    \n    Food stamps/NAP................................   $27,777   $29,179    30,463   $31,758   $33,112   $152,290\n    Child nutrition................................     8,681     9,269     9,903    10,556    11,283     49,692\n    WIC............................................     3,924     4,231     4,245     4,379     4,513     21,291\n    All other......................................       382       351       351       351       351      1,784\n                                                    ------------------------------------------------------------\n        Total......................................    40,764    43,029    44,962    47,042    49,260    225,057\n                                                    ============================================================\nProposed law.......................................    35,600    37,138    38,756    40,457    42,214    194,166\n    Difference.....................................    -5,164    -5,891    -6,206    -6,585    -7,046    -30,892\n    Percent difference.............................     -12.7     -13.8     -13.8     -14.0     -14.3      -13.7\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNotes.--Based on current service program level for USDA food assistance programs in Department estimates of     \n  September 1994 (excluding projected costs of Food Program Administration but including anticipated mandatory  \n  spending for WIC, consistent with the Presidential policy).

This year's theme, ``America Now and \nInto the 21st Century: Generations Aging Together With Independence, \nOpportunity, and Dignity,'' focuses not only on the current aging \npopulation, but future generations as well. The issues to be discussed \nimpact all Americans. They include comprehensive health care, including \nlong-term care, economic security, housing, and quality of life.\n  Throughout her career, Margaret Fleming has earned the greatest \nrespect and admiration. But her activities in retired life are just as \ncommendable. She has been president of the Montana chapter of the \nNational Association of Retired Federal Employees, and before was \npresident of Butte's local chapter. Currently, Margaret is president of \nthe Legacy Legislature, a congress of seniors that meets annually in \nHelena. And as if that isn't enough, she is president of the Lady of \nthe Rockies, a group responsible for youth group tours and the \nconstruction of a chapter near the Lady on the Hill in Butte. Last \nyear, the Montana Soroptimist Club honored her with the Women of \nDistinction Award. Of course, Margaret's toughest job of all is baby-\nsitting her grandchildren on the weekends.\n  In a recent letter to me, Margaret remarked:\n\n       The needs of our Nation are so great. I'm sure you know \n     that I believe a health care plan like your Health Montana is \n     so important. However, the problems with poverty, educational \n     opportunities and a myriad of other issues are equally \n     important. I only hope the participants unite, and think of \n     America's future, as well as our immediate needs.\n\n  The honor of representing Montana could not go to a more dedicated, \ndeserving, and accomplished person. I congratulate Margaret Fleming and \nwish her well at the White House conference on Aging.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/17/senate-section/article/S960-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

THE VOTERS SAID ``YES''\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the incredibly enormous Federal debt is \nlike the weather--everybody talks about it but up to now hardly anybody \nhas undertaken the responsibility of doing anything about it. The \nCongress now had better get cracking--time's a-wasting and the debt is \nmushrooming.\n  In the past, a lot of politicians talked a good game--when they were \nback home--about bringing Federal deficits and the Federal debt under \ncontrol. But many of these same politicians regularly voted in support \nof bloated spending bills that rolled through the Senate. The American \npeople took note of that on November 8.\n  As of Friday, January 13, at the close of business, the Federal debt \nstood--down to the penny--at exactly \n[[Page S961]] $4,808,661,268,393.04. This debt, remember, was run up by \nthe Congress of the United States.\n  The Founding Fathers decreed that the big-spending bureaucrats in the \nexecutive branch of the U.S. Government should never be able to spend \neven a dime unless and until the spending had been authorized and \nappropriated by the U.S. Congress.\n  The U.S. Constitution is quite specific about that, as every \nschoolboy is supposed to know.\n  And do not be misled by declarations by politicians that the Federal \ndebt was run up by some previous President or another, depending on \nparty affiliation. Sometimes you hear false claims that Ronald Reagan \nran it up; sometimes they play hit and run with George Bush.\n  These buckpassing declarations are false, as I said earlier, because \nthe Congress of the United States is the culprit. The Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives are the big spenders.\n  Mr. President, most citizens cannot conceive of a billion of \nanything, let alone a trillion. It may provide a bit of perspective to \nbear in mind that a billion seconds ago, Mr. President, the Cuban \nmissile crisis was in progress. A billion minutes ago, the crucifixion \nof Jesus Christ had occurred not long before.\n  Which sort of puts it in perspective, does it not, that Congress has \nrun up this incredible Federal debt totaling 4,808 of those billions--\nof dollars. In other words, the Federal debt, as I said earlier, stood \nthis morning at 4 trillion, 808 billion, 661 million, 268 thousand, 393 \ndollars and 04 cents. It will be even greater at closing time today.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/17/senate-section/article/S960-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO AVIATION PIONEER BEN R. RICH\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to note with \ndeep sadness, the passing of a legend in the aviation industry. I was \njust recently informed that Ben R. Rich, former president of the \nLockheed Skunk Works passed away after a long illness. Best known as \nthe Father of the F-117 Stealth fighter aircraft, his passing is a sad \nmoment for several Senators and the many staffers that Ben has had \ncontact with in the Senate over the years.\n  Perhaps his finest hour came during Operation Desert Storm, with the \ndeployment of the F-117 to the gulf. As many will recall, the F-117 \ndestroyed 40 percent of all strategic targets, yet represented only 2 \npercent of the allied forces tactical aircraft, and it was the only \naircraft to attack the heavily defended Baghdad area. This aircraft \nuniquely reduced the cost of war by enabling strike missions to be \naccomplished with fewer attack and supporting aircraft, thereby putting \nfewer combat pilots at risk. Utilizing this aircraft further minimized \ncollateral damage and civilian casualties. Indeed, Ben's vision and \ngenius throughout the design and development of the F-117 have \nrevolutionized air warfare as we know it.\n  Ben Rich's many achievements have been recognized throughout the \naerospace industry. Just last May, Secretary of Defense William J. \nPerry honored Ben by presenting him with the Distinguished Public \nService Award. At the time, some in the media had proclaimed Perry to \nbe the Father of Stealth. However, at the presentation ceremony, \nSecretary Perry said it was Rich who provided the intellectual and \nspiritual leadership and that the title of ``Father of Stealth really \nbelongs to Ben Rich.''\n  Mr. President, this was only one in a long line of accomplishments in \nBen's 40 years of distinguished service in the aviation industry. He \nplayed a leadership role in the design and development of the F-104, U-\n2, A-12, and the famous SR-71 Blackbird--the latter still holds the \nworld's flight records for speed and altitude. In addition, he also led \nthe development and production of the YF-22A advanced tactical fighter \nprogram until his retirement in January 1991.\n  For his accomplishments, Ben was a Corecipient of the Collier Trophy \npresented by the National Aeronautic Association; selected as a Wright \nBrothers lecturer by the American Institute for the Advancement of \nEngineering; an elected member of the National Academy of Engineering \nand a nominee for the 1994 Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy.\n  To the many who knew him, he will be remembered as a colorful \ncharacter--for his sparkling wit and enthusiasm. To some, he was a \ngifted teacher who could explain in the clearest terms some of the more \ncomplicated technical aspects of aviation. To others, he was a forceful \nadvocate for innovative ideas and futuristic solutions to problems in \naviation design. To all, he was a patriot.\n  To Ben's wife, Hilda, to his family and his many friends and \ncoworkers, we send our deepest condolences. And from this Nation, a \nheartfelt debt of gratitude to Ben Rich.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/17/senate-section/article/S961-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            WALTER SHERIDAN\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about Walter \nSheridan, a long-time Senate investigator and friend who passed away \nlast Friday morning.\n  Walter--he hated for anyone to call him ``Mr.'' Sheridan--first made \nhis mark on the national scene in the mid-1950's. when he went to work \non the Senate Permanent Investigations Subcommittee as an investigator \nfor Chief Counsel Robert Kennedy in the subcommittee's probe of \norganized crime and labor racketeering. As Attorney General, Robert \nKennedy took Walter with him to the Justice Department, where Walter \nheaded the unit that successfully prosecuted Teamsters Union President \nJames Hoffa. During those days, Walter attained a well-deserved \nreputation as a resourceful and tenacious investigator.\n  I came to know and admire Walter Sheridan later in his career, when \nhe came back to the Hill in the 1970's to work as chief investigator \nfor my friend Senator Edward Kennedy, first on the Judiciary Committee \nand later on the Labor and Human Resources Committee. In these roles, \nWalter was the chief staffer on hearings that led to significant \nimprovements in the operation of the Food and Drug Administration, the \nMine Health and Safety Agency, and other Federal offices.\n  When we were on opposite sides of issues, as our philosophies and \npolitics often dictated, I found Walter to be a tough but honorable \nadversary. When our interests coincided, as they did on a number of \noversight issues, I found him to be a strong and dependable ally. He \nwas a man of integrity, foresight, and, always, good humor.\n  My warmest sympathies go out to Mrs. Sheridan and the family. Walter \nSheridan was a man, operating mostly behind the scenes, who made a \ndifference in the performance of Government. His work will be carried \non by a whole generation of investigators, on both sides of the aisle, \nwho benefited from their association with Walter Sheridan.

Under the previous order, the hour of 9:30 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1) to curb the practice of imposing unfunded \n     Federal mandates on States and local governments; to \n     strengthen the partnership between the Federal Government and \n     State, local and tribal governments; to end the imposition, \n     in the absence of full consideration by Congress, of Federal \n     mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without \n     adequate funding, in a manner that may displace other \n     essential governmental priorities; and to ensure that the \n     Federal Government pays the costs incurred by those \n     governments in complying with certain requirements under \n     Federal statutes and regulations, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Committee amendment number 9, beginning on page 15, line 6, \n     to modify language relating to reports on Federal mandates.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume debate on \nSenate bill No. 1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995. We began \ndebate on this issue last week. I believe \n[[Page S962]] we had thoughtful discussion about this bill. We also \nmade progress on the consideration of several committee amendments and \ntwo amendments to those committee amendments.\n  We have stated continually, and I will do so again, that we will take \nwhat time is necessary for us to complete the thoughtful and thorough \ndiscussion of Senate bill No. 1 and any amendments that may be offered \nby any Members of this body. My hope is that we will complete work on \nthis bill this week.\n  There have been a number of encouraging developments, also, Mr. \nPresident, that have occurred since the bill came on the Senate floor. \nI would like to reference a few letters that I have received. This one \nI received from the American Farm Bureau Federation, which represents \n4.4 million families.\n  They say:\n\n       We believe that Federal mandates to State and local \n     governments must provide complete and continuous funding. It \n     is our hope that information on the costs to the private and \n     public sectors of proposed regulations and legislation will \n     lead Congress to stop imposing burdens it is unwilling to \n     fund.\n       S. 1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995, will require \n     the Congressional Budget Office to estimate and report the \n     public and private sector cost, and any Federal effort to \n     ameliorate that cost of proposed legislation.\n\n  That is from Dean Kleckner, the president of the American Farm Bureau \nFederation.\n  He says:\n\n       The provision requiring this information is important if \n     lawmakers and the voters they represent are to make judgments \n     regarding the cost and benefits of proposed legislation.\n       Farm Bureau supports the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of \n     1995 and will work to ensure its passage.\n\n  I received a letter from the Public Securities Association.\n  They state:\n\n       PSA supports legislation to provide relief from unfunded \n     Federal mandates imposed on State and local governments. PSA \n     is the association of banks and brokerage firms that \n     underwrite, trade and sell municipal securities, U.S. \n     Government and Federal agency securities, mortgage-backed \n     securities and money market instruments. PSA's members \n     account for over 95 percent of municipal securities market \n     activity.\n       We support S. 1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995, \n     and congratulate the swift action taken by the jurisdictional \n     committees.\n\n  That is from John Vogt, vice president, external affairs.\n  Then I received a letter from the city of El Monte.\n  The letter states:\n\n       On behalf of the El Monte City Council, we wholeheartedly \n     support your aggressive efforts in sponsoring legislation to \n     stop unfunded Federal mandates. This noble effort is \n     especially appreciated by cities in California, who are \n     facing the negative impacts of the recession along with the \n     State's revenue raids on local government.\n       The City of El Monte has raised new revenues and has cut \n     back on spending for the past 3 years to be reliant on other \n     levels of government. However, with the continuation of \n     Federal mandates on cities, it has become very difficult to \n     fund even the most essential services to our residents and \n     businesses.\n\n  That is from Patricia A. Wallach, the mayor of El Monte.\n  Then there is a letter from the Petroleum Marketers Association of \nAmerica.\n       On behalf of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America \n     (PMAA), I would like to express our strong support for the \n     passage of S. 1, legislation which would curtail the passage \n     of legislation implementing unfunded mandates. The PMAA \n     represents over 10,000 marketers of petroleum products \n     nationwide. Collectively, these marketers sell nearly half \n     the gasoline, over 60 percent of the diesel fuel and \n     approximately 85 percent of the home hearing oil consumed in \n     the U.S. annually.\n       PMAA favors passage of the ``unfunded mandates'' \n     legislation as a necessary step to help stem the increasing \n     cost of federal regulations to state and local government, as \n     well as to provide industry.* * *\n       The financial burden of federal regulations in reaching \n     critical levels with estimates nearing $581 billion \n     annually.* * *\n       Please vote in favor of S. 1 and oppose any efforts to \n     weaken the legislation by removing the private sector \n     language. Thank you for your consideration.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     American Farm\n\n\n                                            Bureau Federation,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: On behalf of the 4.4 million \n     families represented by the American Farm Bureau Federation, \n     I want to thank you for your leadership in addressing the \n     serious problem of unfunded federal mandates. We believe that \n     federal mandates to state and local governments must provide \n     complete and continuous funding. It is our hope that \n     information on the costs to the private and public sectors of \n     proposed regulations and legislation will lead Congress to \n     stop imposing burdens it is unwilling to fund.\n       S. 1, The Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995, will require \n     the Congressional Budget Office to estimate and report the \n     public and private and private sector cost, and any federal \n     effort to ameliorate that cost of proposed legislation. It \n     will further require the Congress to vote for a waiver of its \n     rules before passing any legislation that has not been \n     subject to this analysis, or if the cost of implementation of \n     any proposed unfunded obligations exceeds $50 million.\n       In addition, federal departments will be required to \n     analyze the impact of proposed regulations on the economy, \n     and to report those findings through the normal rulemaking \n     process by publication in the Federal Register.\n       The provision requiring this information is important if \n     lawmakers and the voters they represent are to make judgments \n     regarding the cost and benefits of proposed legislation. We \n     at the Farm Bureau look forward to building on this \n     legislation to help reform the rulemaking and legislative \n     processes.\n       Farm Bureau supports the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of \n     1995 and will work to ensure its passage.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Dean R. Kleckner,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                Public Securities Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: We applaud your leadership on the \n     issue of unfunded federal mandates. PSA supports legislation \n     to provide relief from unfunded federal mandates imposed on \n     state and local governments. PSA is the association of banks \n     and brokerage firms that underwrite, trade and sell municipal \n     securities, U.S. government and federal agency securities, \n     mortgage-backed securities and money market instruments. \n     PSA's members account for over 95 percent of municipal \n     securities market activity.\n       We support S. 1, The Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995, \n     and congratulate the swift action taken by the jurisdictional \n     committees. However, S. 1 is applicable only to prospective \n     laws and regulations. PSA believe that municipal bonds could \n     play a significant role in the battle against existing \n     unfunded mandates by providing leveraged financing for \n     currently mandated requirements and developing creative ways \n     to deal with unfunded mandates in a responsible manner. The \n     federal government provides substantial assistance to state \n     and local governments to support their borrowing in the form \n     of the federal tax-exemption on municipal bond interest. \n     Because interest earned by investors on municipal bonds is \n     exempt from federal taxation, states and localities pay much \n     lower costs of capital than they would otherwise face.\n       PSA proposes creation of Mandatory Infrastructure Facility \n     (MIF) Bonds to assist state and local governments in \n     financing current federally mandated infrastructure \n     improvements. MIF bonds would be used for the construction, \n     acquisition, rehabilitation or renovation of infrastructure \n     facilities that are mandated by the federal government or \n     required in order to comply with a federal mandate. The MIF \n     bonds would be categorized as public purpose rather than \n     private activity bonds, regardless of the level of private \n     participation in the financed project and would be exempt \n     from some other restrictions on municipal securities. While \n     it would be inappropriate to attempt to add MIFs to S. 1, we \n     hope to pursue this issue in the context of future \n     legislation such as budget reconciliation.\n       We have enclosed for you review the report of the PSA \n     Economic Advisory Committee and draw to your attention the \n     concerns expressed in the report where it notes that \n     ``economic gains from reducing the federal deficit could \n     prove illusory if federal programs are cut, but replaced by \n     unfunded mandates upon state and local governments.''\n       We welcome the opportunity to work with you on issues \n     concerning unfunded mandates. Please do not hesitate to call \n     if there is any further information we can provide.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John R. Vogt,\n     Vice President, External Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                             City of El Monte,\n\n                                    El Monte, CA, January 4, 1995.\n     Re unfunded Federal mandates.\n\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: On behalf of the El Monte City \n     Council, we wholeheartedly support your aggressive efforts in \n     sponsoring legislation to stop unfunded federal mandates. \n     This noble effort is especially appreciated by cities in \n     California, who are facing the negative impacts of the \n     recession \n     [[Page S963]] along with the State's revenue raids on local \n     government. Also, your leadership in providing legislation to \n     stop unfunded mandates will have an impact at the State \n     level, whereby State mandates have also created economic \n     problems for cities.\n       The City of El Monte has raised new revenues and has cut \n     back on spending for the past three years to be less reliant \n     on other levels of government. However, with the continuation \n     of federal mandates on cities, it has become very difficult \n     to fund even the most essential services to our residents and \n     businesses.\n       We are fortunate to have your support in sponsoring this \n     legislation and our appreciation and gratitude for your fine \n     efforts in understanding the needs of cities.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     El Monte City\n       Council,\n     Patricia A. Wallach,\n       Mayor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Petroleum Marketers\n\n\n                                       Association of America,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, January 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: On behalf of the Petroleum \n     Marketers Association of America (PMAA), I would like to \n     express our strong support for the passage of S. 1, \n     legislation which would curtail the passage of legislation \n     implementing unfunded mandates. The PMAA represents over \n     10,000 marketers of petroleum products nationwide. \n     Collectively, these marketers sell nearly half the gasoline, \n     over 60 percent of the diesel fuel and approximately 85% of \n     the home heating oil consumed in the U.S. annually.\n       PMAA favors passage of the ``unfunded mandates'' \n     legislation as a necessary step to help stem the increasing \n     cost of federal regulations to state and local government, as \n     well as to private industry.\n       As you know, S. 1 would require the Congressional Budget \n     Office to conduct a cost impact analysis (or be ruled out of \n     order) whenever Congress wants to impose an unfunded mandate \n     of more than $200 million on the private sector. Federal \n     agencies would have to analyze and report the effects that \n     proposed regulations would have on the nation's economy, \n     productivity and international competitiveness.\n       Petroleum marketers have been especially hard hit by the \n     financial burdens placed upon them by federal and state \n     regulations. The financial burden of federal regulations is \n     reaching critical levels with estimates nearing $581 billion \n     annually. Providing relief from federal unfunded mandates is \n     crucial to the future livelihood of the business community \n     and the economy in general.\n       Please vote in favor of S. 1 and oppose any efforts to \n     weaken the legislation by removing the private sector \n     coverage language. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Phillip R. Chisholm,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I believe this demonstrates again, \nwhether we are talking to farm families about the act, whether we are \ntalking to local governments such as El Monte City Council, or whether \nwe are talking to the private sector as represented by the Petroleum \nMarketers Association of America, all of them strongly support this \nlegislation. And this week, again, we hope to be able to move forward \non this legislation so that we can enact what our partners in both the \npublic and private sectors have been asking for.\n  Mr. President, with that being said, and in the spirit of trying to \nmove forward now on the progress of dealing with the issues before us, \nI ask unanimous consent that the remaining committee amendments be \nconsidered en bloc, agreed to en bloc, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with the following exceptions: The amendment on \npage 25, the amendment on page 27, and the amendment on page 33; I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that all adopted committee amendments be \nconsidered as original text for the purpose of further amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Is there objection?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nobject, not for myself, but I believe we do have another Senator who \nwants to come to the floor and speak on this. So I would object until \nhe can be here and express his views on this. I think he wanted to \nobject to the unanimous-consent agreement, so, on his behalf, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder, while we are waiting for the Senator to come to the floor to \nexpress his views on this, that I be given permission to speak with \nregard to the bill until he arrives on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the Washington Post this morning has an \neditorial titled ``More on the Mandates Issue.'' The Washington Post \nhas editorialized on this before, and they very properly, in this lead \neditorial this morning, point out the difference between the House bill \nand the Senate bill.\n  I want to make sure that some of our colleagues who are trying to \nmake up their minds on support for this legislation, that they not get \nconfused between the two bills. This is not a long editorial, but I \nwould like to read it so that everyone will understand exactly what the \nissue is. The title is ``More on the Mandates Issue.''\n\n       House Republicans partly disarmed critics of their unfunded \n     mandates bill by keeping a promise and quietly fixing one \n     defect last week in committee. They should fix another when \n     the bill comes to the floor, perhaps this week.\n       The mandates bill could well be the first major building \n     block of the Republican congressional agenda to pass. The \n     Senate's version is on the floor as well, and the president \n     has said while avoiding details that he too favors such a \n     measure.\n\n  Mr. President, I would add that I entered the President's letter to \nus into the Record last week.\n\n       The Republicans look upon it in part as the key to \n     achieving other goals such as a balanced budget amendment to \n     the Constitution and perhaps welfare reform. Governors and \n     other state and local officials are fearful of being stranded \n     by the spending cuts implicit in both of these and \n     conceivably could block them. The promise that at the same \n     time they will get relief from federal mandates is meant to \n     assuage them.\n       In fact, the legislation doesn't ban unfunded mandates as \n     so much of surrounding rhetoric on both sides would suggest. \n     It would merely create a parliamentary presumption against \n     them and require explicit majority votes in both houses to \n     impose them. That's the right approach.\n\n  Mr. President, I see our distinguished colleague, Senator Byrd, is on \nthe floor. I know he has some comments to make on this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial out of the Washington Post \nbe printed in the Record in its entirety, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 17, 1995]\n\n                       More on the Mandates Issue\n\n       House Republicans partly disarmed the critics of their \n     unfunded mandates bill by keeping a promise and quietly \n     fixing one defect last week in committee. They should fix \n     another when the bill comes to the floor, perhaps this week.\n       The mandates bill could well be the first major building \n     block of the Republican congressional agenda to pass. The \n     Senate's version is on the floor as well, and the president \n     has said while avoiding details that he too favors such a \n     measure. The Republicans look upon it in part as the key to \n     achieving other goals such as a balanced budget amendment to \n     the Constitution and perhaps welfare reform. Governors and \n     other state and local officials are fearful of being stranded \n     by the spending cuts implicit in both of these and \n     conceivably could block them. The promise that at the same \n     time they will get relief from federal mandates is meant to \n     assuage them.\n       In fact, the legislation doesn't ban unfunded mandates as \n     so much of surrounding rhetoric on both sides would suggest. \n     It would merely create a parliamentary presumption against \n     them and require explicit majority votes in both houses to \n     impose them. That's the right approach. Though there is a \n     genuine problem that needs fixing here, not all unfunded \n     mandates are unjustified, nor are state and local \n     governments, which receive a quarter trillion dollars a year \n     in federal aid, always the victims they portray themselves to \n     be in the federal relationship. What would happen is simply \n     that future bills imposing mandates without the funds to \n     carry them out would be subject to a point of order. A member \n     could raise the point of order, another would move to waive \n     it and there would be a vote. That works in the Senate. The \n     problem in the House was that the rules would not have \n     allowed a waiver motion. A single member, raising a point of \n     order that the chair would have been obliged to sustain, \n     would have been enough to kill a bill. The Rules Committee \n     found a way around that rock last week. The bill now provides \n     expressly for the majority \n     [[Page S964]] votes that the sponsors say are its main point.\n       The other problem involves judicial review. The Senate bill \n     would rightly bar appeals to the courts by state and local \n     officials or others on grounds the terms of the bill had been \n     ignored, the theory being that is mainly an internal matter--\n     Congress agreeing to change its own future behavior--and a \n     political accommodation of the sort that courts should have \n     no role in. The House bill contains no similar ban, in part \n     because a section would require the executive branch to do \n     certain studies before issuing regulations and the sponsors, \n     or some of them, want that to be judicially enforceable. But \n     Congress has power enough to enforce these requirements \n     itself; it needn't turn to the courts. The Republicans \n     rightly say in other contexts that there is already too much \n     resort to the courts in this country. They ought to stick to \n     that position. In fact, because the House bill is silent on \n     the matter, it isn't clear whether it would permit resort to \n     the courts or not. The House should say not.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I have an inquiry, and that is, am I \ncorrect that the amendment that is currently before us is a committee \namendment that is found on page 15, lines 6, 7, 8, and 9?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in light of the objection to the prior \nunanimous-consent agreement, I would like to ask the Senator from West \nVirginia if he wishes to debate the committee amendment found on page \n15, beginning on line 6. I would like to make that inquiry without \nlosing the floor. And I ask this with all due respect to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, who has been forthright with me in communicating \nhis concerns. So I just wanted to try to establish a process so that we \ncan proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator, who is manager of \nthe bill, for his courtesies extended to me. I want to assure him that \nit is not my desire to frustrate him. He is trying diligently to move \nthis bill forward, and the bill, of course, will move forward.\n  I am not in a position at this point to accede to the unanimous-\nconsent request. I do not have any particular amendment in mind, may I \nsay in response to the able Senator's question.\n  I do not want to accede to the request. For one thing, I do not want \nto agree to the adoption of committee amendments en bloc and that they \nbe considered as original text for further amendment. Committee \namendments that are in place as they are now, as long as they are in \nplace can be amended by second-degree amendments. They are open to an \namendment in the second degree. And it may be that some Senators would \nwant to offer second-degree amendments and not have their amendments \ntopped with an amendment.\n  Once the committee amendments are adopted en bloc, then, of course, \nthey are open to amendments in two degrees. I have no particular \namendment in mind at this point. I just feel that there are some areas \nof the bill that we need to understand. I probably will, in the final \nanalysis, vote for this bill if there are certain amendments adopted \nthereto. I do not say at the moment that I will do that exactly for \nsure, but I may very well vote for the bill.\n But for now, I do not choose to agree to the request. I may agree to \nit at a later point. I do not have any particular question with respect \nto a specific amendment. That will be for others on the committee who \nunderstand the bill better than I do to more clearly explain.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I appreciate that.\n  To the Senator from West Virginia I would point out that the \namendment that is before the Senate was unanimously agreed to by the \nBudget Committee, and with this amendment properly being before the \nSenate now as our item of business, if the Senator from West Virginia \ndoes not feel compelled to debate the particular specifics of that \namendment then I would seek or ask the Chair to put the question on the \ncommittee amendment before the body.\n  Again, I want to assert, because of my respect for the Senator from \nWest Virginia, if the Senator has a desire to debate that issue; if \nnot, I would like to put that question before the Chair so that we can \nproceed.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator is certainly within his rights \nto hope the Chair will put the question, and I can understand that. I \nfully appreciate his desire to do that. The Chair is not only entitled \nto put the question but the Chair is required to put the question if no \nSenator seeks recognition.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Based on that, Mr. President, I ask the Chair to put \nthe question on committee amendment No. 9.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? \nHearing none, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as I have indicated to my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho, I have no particular thoughts with \nrespect to this specific amendment, but I do want to say a few things \nin regard to the bill and other matters.\n  Mr. President, first on another matter. There is an adage among \ncomputer users that says ``garbage in, garbage out.'' What that means, \nof course, is that if unreliable or incomplete information is put into \na computer, then unreliable or incomplete information will come out of \nthat computer. Although ``garbage in, garbage out'' comes from the \nworld of computers, the basic theory applies to other disciplines as \nwell.\n  For example, consider the question: ``Do you support or oppose a \nconstitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget?'' As of \nJanuary 4, 1995, 80 percent, we are told, 80 percent of the American \npeople say that they support such an amendment. My source is an article \nin the Friday, January 6, edition of the Washington Post.\n  According to a poll taken for the Washington Post and ABC news, that \noverwhelming percentage buys on to the concept of a balanced budget \namendment. Amazing, one would think that on the face of it, this \nextremely popular idea would have nearly no opponents. On the surface, \nif one went solely by that overwhelming percentage, one could say that \nthis surely is an idea whose time has come.\n  What is wrong with this Congress that it has not already passed this \nfabulous balanced budget amendment? How can anyone question its wisdom? \nThat is the problem with simplistic questions. They usually provoke \nequally simplistic answers. But there is nothing simple about the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget. If one looks a \nlittle closer at the same poll, the problem with any balanced budget \namendment becomes glaringly apparent. There exists no consensus as to \nhow actually to get to a balance of the budget.\n  Of those who support a balanced budget amendment in the poll, the \nfurther question was asked: ``Would you still support a constitutional \namendment to require a balanced Federal budget if it meant cuts in \nFederal spending on welfare, or public assistance, for the poor?'' \nFifty-nine percent said yes, they would. Now, this is not 59 percent of \nthe 100 percent. It is not 59 percent of the total number of persons \nwho are included in the poll. It is 59 percent of those who support a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  In other words, it is 59 percent of the 80 percent of those who say \nthey support a balanced budget amendment.\n  Then the same supporters were asked if they would support the \namendment if it meant cutting national defense or the military budget. \nFifty-six percent said yes, they would. Again, that is not 56 percent \nof the total. That is 56 percent of the 80 percent who support a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Then the same supporters were asked if they still would support the \namendment if we had to cut Federal funds for education. Only 37 percent \nsaid yes, they would. Now, that is not 37 percent of the 100 percent. \nThat is not 37 percent of all those who were polled. That is 37 percent \nof the 80 percent who support a constitutional amendment. That makes a \ndifference.\n   [[Page S965]] Then the same supporters were asked if they were still \non board if we had to cut Social Security; only 34 percent said they \nwould. We will say there are 100 apples on the table here and that the \n100 apples represent the total number of persons who were polled on the \nvarious questions. Eighty percent support, that would mean 80 of the \n100 apples taken off the table. They all support the balanced budget \namendment.\n  But if Social Security is increased, of those who support a balanced \nbudget amendment, only 34 percent then would support the amendment. So \nif Social Security is included, only 34 percent of the 80 apples, or \napproximately 27 percent of the whole number favor the amendment.\n  So that would mean less than 34 percent of the 100 percent; in other \nwords, only approximately 27 or 28 percent of the whole number would \nthen support the balanced budget amendment.\n  I ask the rhetorical question, are we beginning to see a pattern \nemerge here? There is vast agreement on a goal; in other words, \nbalancing the Federal budget, but virtually no agreement on how to \nachieve that goal among the general public.\n  Let us understand one thing, if Congress passed the amendment today \nand we had to start moving toward that goal, virtually all talk of tax \ncuts would have to be abandoned. If Congress passed the amendment today \nand we had to start moving toward that goal, virtually all talk of tax \ncuts would have to be abandoned.\n  There is a lot of talk about tax cuts in the air. Both Republicans \nand Democrats seem--according to what I have read--to be racing toward \nthe finish line to see who can get there first with a tax cut. And \nthere may be a bidding war on that subject in due time.\n  But this Senator from West Virginia thinks it is absolute folly--\nfolly--to talk about a tax cut at a time when we are talking about \npassing a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget.\n  We seem to be going in two different directions all at once, and we \nare going to meet ourselves head on. If we have a tax cut and then if \nthe constitutional amendment on the balanced budget is adopted, we may \nhave to increase taxes to balance that budget. It cannot be ruled out.\n  So what is going on here? We cut taxes one day and raise them the \nnext. It is going to be much more difficult to raise taxes than it will \nbe to cut them.\n  I think we ought to stay on the course we are on; that being to \nattempt to balance the budget. And we have had two good efforts in 1990 \nand 1993, in both of which years Congress passed legislation that \nreduced the rates by which the deficits were growing and actually made \nreductions over a period in the deficits. That is the course we ought \nto stay on, and that is not an easy course.\n  But now to forsake that course and say, ``Well, let's have a tax \ncut,'' that is flying in the face of the strong efforts that have been \nmade in 1990 and 1993 to bring about a reduction in the deficits and to \nmove on a glide path toward a balanced budget. It does not make sense. \nWe ought to be thinking of our children and grandchildren. No, we want \nto cut taxes now for political purposes, cut taxes now, do something \nfor ourselves, forget about the kids, forget about the children down \nthe road; let us shift this burden over on them, shift it over to them; \nlet us have the tax cut now, though; let our children, and \ngrandchildren and their children worry about it.\n  That seems to me to be very shortsighted, very shortsighted.\n  I would rather see the President and the Democratic Party stay on the \ncourse we were on of balancing the budget, of reducing the deficits. I \nthink it is not only poor judgment but it is wrong to talk about a tax \ncut now. It is easy to cut taxes. Nobody likes to vote to increase \ntaxes. I do not like to vote to increase taxes, but I am not going to \njoin in the rush to cut taxes at a time when we have budget deficits in \nthe $200 billion range and a national debt that is $4.5 trillion. Talk \nabout declaration of rights, petition of rights, bills of rights, and \nall these things, I think we might better focus on a petition of \nrights, declaration of rights or bill of rights for our children's \nchildren and their children. I would not think that a tax cut for those \nof us in our generation would be wise. It certainly would not be a part \nof my declaration of rights for posterity.\n  We should not have a tax cut at this time, in my view, and we \ncertainly should forgo that idea if Congress adopts a balanced budget \namendment. Now, if we did that, if we abandoned all thoughts of a tax \ncut, we would still need to cut spending or raise taxes from projected \nlevels by more than $1 trillion over 7 years, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, in order to balance the budget.\n  We could go ahead and cut welfare. That seems to be popular, but it \nwould not be nearly enough. We could go ahead and slash defense \nspending. That also seems to have a fair amount of support among \nbalanced budget enthusiasts, but that would not get us to balance \nwithout massive tax increases either. How popular does anyone within \nthe sound of my voice think massive tax increases are?\n  My point is that no one area of cuts would get us anywhere near a \nbalance by the year 2002. The cuts would have to hit most all of the \nextremely popular Federal programs and those cuts would have to be \nsevere.\n  It is obvious on its face from the results of the ABC poll that the \nAmerican people have no real understanding of what passing this \namendment means in reality. The conventional wisdom around here is that \nthe balanced budget amendment is a forgone conclusion; that its \nadoption is foreordained. Mr. President, it may be that a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget will be adopted. It may \nbe, but I am not going to concede that yet.\n  We heard that same thing last year being said. It was said last year \nthat the balanced budget amendment would be adopted, but it was not. \nThe constitutional amendment to balance the budget may or may not be \nadopted. That is something that will be decided as we go down the road.\n  I am not going to join in the stampede to adopt a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. I am in favor of balancing the budget \nfrom time to time when we can, but I do not think that can be done \nevery year in the normal course of things, for fiscal reasons, cyclical \nand countercyclical fiscal reasons.\n  I am not in favor of a constitutional amendment on the balanced \nbudget. That is not news to anyone. But let me just say again that I do \nnot concede at this point that such an amendment is going to be riveted \ninto the Constitution. Perhaps it will be. We shall see.\n  We in the Congress have not adequately educated our people about what \nthe amendment really means. It means enormous changes in the lifestyles \nand in the opportunities available to every man, woman, and child in \nthis Nation. Furthermore, if the economy goes into a recession, which \nsimultaneously increases spending on programs such as unemployment \ncompensation and decreases revenues coming into the Treasury because of \npoorer performance in the private sector, spending cuts will have to be \nsteeper and the tax increases will have to be larger than anticipated. \nAny first-year economic student knows that raising taxes or cutting \nspending during a recession is a recipe for plunging the economy into a \ndepression.\n  It is the height of irresponsibility to avoid speaking very plainly \nto the American people about what is at stake here. We have to form a \nconsensus about how to continue to reduce the Federal deficit rather \nthan pass a constitutional amendment that would place our Nation's \neconomic policy in a straitjacket. There has to be a national debate \nabout the available options and their consequences. Honesty and \nintegrity demand it.\n  I have heard it said that we were sent a message with this most \nrecent congressional election. I believe that is a true statement. The \nmessage was: Involve the American people. Involve the American people \nin decisions that affect their lives and their livelihoods. The message \nwas: Do not dictate to us, the people, from on high anymore. That \nWashington crowd must stop trying to tell us, the American people, what \nis best for us to do, what is always best. That is one of the reasons \nwhy we have this bill on the floor. The American people are tired of \nbeing bossed around from Washington, told what to do, when to do it, \nhow much to do.\n   [[Page S966]] When I was in the State legislature 49 years ago, my \nfeeling as to my associates in the legislature was--and I think it was \na consensus among the West Virginia legislators in the House at that \ntime and also in the West Virginia Senate where I later served--those \nfellows up in Washington, we do not need them to tell us what to do. We \ndo not even want our Senators, who were Democrats like most of us were \nin the legislature, we do not want them telling us legislators at the \nState level what to do. They have enough to do. We will take care of \nour work here.\n  Well, that just applied to the members of the legislature. But the \nAmerican people generally are tired of the heavy hand of Washington. \nThey do not want to be dictated to anymore. They are tired of it. They \nare fed up to the earlobes with being told from Washington how to \nplant, when to plant, and how much to plant. And here we are caught in \na headlong rush to pass, to adopt, a balanced budget amendment, rivet \nit into the Constitution.\n  Now we have a bill before the Senate that deals with unfunded \nmandates, and it is going to pass the Senate. As I say, my vote may be \none of the votes that helps it to pass. But the balanced budget \namendment will be the largest unfunded Federal mandate of all time--the \nlargest Federal unfunded mandate of all time. A constitutional \namendment to balance the budget would dump huge new responsibilities on \nthe States because of massive and precipitous cuts in Federal dollars. \nAt virtually the same moment in time when we are poised to pass \nlegislation curtailing the Federal Government's ability to enact \nunfunded Federal mandates on the States, here we are hot and bothered \nabout passing a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget \nwithout a hint as to how we will actually bring the budget into \nbalance.\n  ``Oh,'' they say, ``well, let's get the amendment into the \nConstitution and then we will talk about that.'' Well, then it is too \nlate. Once that amendment is in the Constitution, it will take some \nyears--it will not be a matter of days or weeks or months to remove \nthat constitutional amendment, but it will take some years to remove \nthat amendment from the Constitution if it develops, as I think it very \nwell may be develop, that the amendment proves to be unpopular with the \nAmerican people in the long run.\n  It is arrogant, Mr. President, it is the acme of arrogance for us as \nMembers of the Senate and the House of Representatives to put forward a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget without laying on the \ntable, so that the American people can see what it is, the plan by \nwhich we expect to achieve that balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  It has been said, ``Oh, well, we must not do that. If the American \npeople know the details, we will never get that amendment adopted \naround here.'' Well, that is the height of arrogance--arrogance. If we \nlet the American people know what is good, what is bad about balancing \nthe budget under a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, we \nlet them know, we will not pass it. We will not have the votes to adopt \nthe amendment. In other words, do not let the American people know. \nKeep them in the dark as to where the pain will be, keep them in the \ndark as to where the cuts will have to be made, keep the American \npeople in the dark as to what tax increases will have to be made,\n because if the American people are told that, the 80 percent of those \nwho answered the polls to which I earlier alluded will dwindle away. We \nwill not have the votes even here in the Senate to adopt that \namendment, because the American people will rise up. They will be \ndisturbed. They will become excited. And they will contact their \nSenators and House Members and tell them to slow down, slow down. So, \n``We do not want to tell them that. They are just like children.'' That \nargument assumes the attitude that the American people are children; \nthey should not be told the truth, if the truth hurts. It takes the \nattitude that the American people do not have a right to know what the \nproblems will be, what their burdens will be, where the cuts will be \napplied, where the taxes will be increased if a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget passes.\n\n  That is superarrogance, on the part of those of us who are not \nwilling to lay out the course which the American people will have to \nfollow in order to balance that budget. That is being superarrogant.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I would like to just note and acknowledge what the \nSenator from West Virginia stated, in the fact that he has been a State \nlegislator. I think as State legislators across the United States \nrealize that he has sat in their very circumstances, he has an empathy \nfor what they are trying to do in establishing their priorities, I \nthink they take courage in knowing that we have another champion who \nhas been in their shoes, whom we hope will help champion this unfunded \nmandate legislation.\n  I would like to make an inquiry then. Because we are having this \ndiscussion--and I point out that there are points the Senator has made \nwhich I agree with and I appreciate the Senator has stated them--since \nwe are having this discussion as this amendment is pending, would the \nSenator be willing to enter into a time agreement so we could have some \nsense as to how long we would have discussion before we would put this \namendment to a vote?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, that is a legitimate question. I would not \nbe willing to do so at this point.\n  May I make it clear to my friend and to all who are listening and \nviewing what is going on here, I am not out to kill this bill. I may \nvote for it. And I am in no position to know--I am in no position to \nsay how soon we will pass this bill. It may be today, it may be \ntomorrow, it may be Friday. I do not know.\n  Others who are on the committees that were involved, the Governmental \nAffairs Committee and the Budget Committee, are very much closer to the \nfacts and to the problems that are being addressed than I am. I am not \na member of either of those committees.\n  But, first of all--and I hate to say this again, but sometimes \nrepetition bears being repeated--I was a bit astonished and taken aback \nwhen both committees, the Governmental Affairs Committee and the Budget \nCommittee in the Senate, by rollcall votes declined to submit committee \nreports. I was, in a manner, offended as a Senator, as a Senator who \nhas been here many years, who is accustomed to having committee reports \non major bills, as a Senator who has always stood for the rights of the \nminority. I have always stood for the rights of the minority in this \nbody. I felt that the rights of the minority were being trampled \nunderfoot by the rejection in both committees of minority requests that \nthere be committee reports, and the minorities in both committees were \nrefused. That was not in accordance with my views as to what the \nminority has a right to expect here. I understand that the votes were \nparty-line votes.\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. By denying the minority, the American people were likewise \ndenied. Again, this is arrogance, arrogance, to deny the minority the \nright to present its individual and minority views in a committee \nreport.\n  I thought that was what the American people, in part, were sending us \na message about. They are tired of this arrogance: ``They know it all, \nin Washington. They know it all.'' No, there was such a hurry, such a \nbig rush. ``We have a Contract With America. It has to be accepted \nwithin 100 days.'' That seems to be the big rush. Up to this point I \nhave been remonstrating and protesting that kind of procedure in the \ncommittees. I hope it will not be done again.\n  I am not saying that the same thing may not have happened in times \ngone by. I would never be one to defend the trampling of a minority's \nrights in this respect on a major bill, a bill which may be \ncontroversial. I think that my colleagues on this side of the aisle \ndeserve to have some time to study the committee report. We finally \nreceived the committee reports and over the weekend I have had an \nopportunity to read them.\n  I am not a major player on this bill at all. But I just think we \nought to slow down and take a little while to study what this is all \nabout and know what is in the bill. I can best understand the pros and \ncons by reading the committee reports. That is why we \n[[Page S967]] have committee reports--one reason why we have committee \nreports. I cannot just read the bill and understand it fully. I need to \nread the committee reports. I need to see what the minority thinks. I \nalways--always look to see what the minority is saying in a committee \nreport because if there are problems with the bill, with a given bill, \nthe minority is likely to raise those problems, give them visibility. \nSo that, by way of explanation, again, is why I have become involved \nhere. I want to hear what my colleagues on this side of the aisle have \nto say about this bill. I will probably hear a little of that, or some \nexplanation in the conference that is coming up.\n  But I do not propose to be rushed. I may be run over by the \nsteamroller, but I do not propose to get out of its way or just jump \nupon it and ride along with it, necessarily, at least. There may be \nsome parts of the Contract With America that I will support. Mr. \nPresident, I do not put it on the level however, with the Federal \nConstitution. I do not put it on a level with the Declaration of \nIndependence. I do not put that document--I have not read it, as I say. \nI have never read a Democratic platform. Why should I read this \nContract With America? I did not have anything to do with it. I am not \na part of it. I do not put it on a level with the Federalist Papers. So \nit does not have all of that aura of holiness about it or reference \nthat I would accord to some other documents.\n  I say to my friend from Idaho that he is doing what he thinks is \nright. I assume that he believes in all particulars of the bill. Or he \nmay not. He may not believe in every particular. And the Senate will \nhave its opportunity to work its will on that bill. I fully recognize \nthe need to do something about unfunded mandates. I recognize that \nneed. We have gone down that path too far in many instances.\n  I just have a little more to say on this particular subject, and then \nI will talk a little about the matter before the Senate.\n  But here we all are hot and bothered about passing a constitutional \namendment to balance the Federal budget without a hint as to how we \nwill actually bring the budget into balance. Furthermore, there are \nthose in this body who are completely unwilling, as I have said, to \nshare the details of any plan to balance the budget with the people \nbefore we pass the amendment. Now I ask Senators. How does that comport \nwith the so-called ``message'' that we just got in the November \nelection? How is this bringing Government back to the people? How is \nthis putting vital decisions back into the hands of the voters of \nAmerica?\n  A member of the other body's leadership was quoted in the newspaper \nlast week as admitting that, if the details of getting to a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002 were public, there would be virtually no \npossibility--no possibility--of passing the amendment. Is it all that \nbad? In other words, for Heaven's sake, do not tell the people what we \nare about to do to them. Do not tell them. Keep them in the dark. They \nwant the amendment. Eighty percent said so in that poll. Keep them in \nthe dark. Let us give it to them. They do not need to know what getting \nto balance entails. They do not need to know that. They do not need to \nbe bothered with that.\n  If we exempt further tax increases or cuts in Social Security and \ndefense, then what are we left with? In fiscal year 1995, the current \nfiscal year, Federal expenditures will total slightly more than $1.53 \ntrillion. Excepting Social Security at $334 billion, defense at $270 \nbillion, and of course, interest on the national debt of $235 billion, \nany cuts required to balance the budget would have to come out of the \nremaining $692 billion. It has been estimated, with a fiscal year 1995 \nbudget deficit of $175 billion, those cuts would have to total 25.4 \npercent across the board on that $692 billion. And in fiscal year 2002, \nusing the same assumptions, those cuts would have to equal 28 percent \nin order to eliminate a projected deficit of $322 billion.\n  Not discussing the options with the American people is like a suitor \ntelling his prospective bride, ``Marry me and I will make you happy.'' \nBut when she asks what he has in mind, he simply answers, ``Trust me, \nbaby. You don't need to know the details. Trust me baby, you don't need \nto know the details.'' Talk about a pig in a poke; that is a hog in a \nrucksack.\n  This is big, arrogant Government going completely hog wild. This is \nus big guys, we big guys in Washington, saying to the American public, \n``We refuse to give you any idea of how we are going to enact over $1 \ntrillion of spending cuts and tax increases over the next 7 years.'' \nNote carefully that the 7-year period puts many of us in this body \nsafely through the next election, by the way. It puts us safely through \nthe next election. If this constitutional amendment is going to be sent \nout to the people, why do we not amend it; instead of having 7 years, \nmake it 5. Make it 5 years. That is not customary. But there is no \nreason why it cannot be done. Make it 5 years so that the chickens will \ncome to hatch during the terms of those of us who are here now who were \nelected in the past election, and they will certainly come to hatch \nduring the terms of those who will be running next year, those who will \nbe reelected or those who will be elected. It does not have to be a 7-\nyear period. Make it a 5-year period. The 7 years puts us all safely \nthrough the next election.\n  Any plan to do that kind of violence to the Federal budget and to the \nnational economy simply must be shared with the American people before \nwe take an action that mandates that the violence be done. Let us not \nbe a party to trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the people who \nsent us here. We do not allow it in other matters. We do not expect \nanyone to buy a used car without knowing whether or not that car has \ndefects.\n We do not expect anyone to buy a house without knowing if the roof \nleaks. We could not allow anyone to take out a mortgage on that house \nwithout requiring the lending agency to fully disclose the terms of the \nloan. Mr. President, we have truth-in-advertising statutes in this \ncountry. We have truth-in-lending requirements. Why, then, should the \nAmerican people be expected to accept the constitutional balanced \nbudget amendment that would lock this Government into a rigid and \nunforgiving economic straitjacket without knowing precisely what that \nmeans?\n\n  Mr. President, in August 1993, the Congress passed a reconciliation \nbill that accomplished well in excess of $450 billion of deficit \nreduction, certainly well in excess of $400 billion. Every single \ndollar of spending cuts and every single dollar of revenue increases \nwere laid out in plain language for Members and the American public to \nsee. Obviously, those cuts were difficult to vote for. The revenue \nincreases were difficult to vote for. But that package is something \nthat needed to be enacted then, and it is something that needs to be \nenacted now.\n  Most importantly, Mr. President, that deficit reduction was passed \nwithout a balanced budget amendment in the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, if those who have signed on to the Contract With \nAmerica are so sure that they have the necessary 67 votes to pass the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment, then they should lay down a \nplan that will actually balance the budget. If they have 67 votes to \npass the constitutional amendment on a balanced budget in both Houses, \nthey should not have any concern that their budget plan would not pass. \nAfter all, a budget resolution requires only 51 votes, only a simple \nmajority--16 votes less than would be required for a constitutional \namendment, if all Members were present and voting.\n  So why not accomplish through a statute a plan which can begin to \ntake effect immediately, instead of waiting for the year 2002? If they \ncan produce 67 votes for a constitutional amendment, they can produce \n51 votes to pass the tough legislation required to achieve that \nbalanced budget. Why do they not do it?\n  Let us not undermine the Constitution of the United States and the \npeople's faith in that Constitution by putting off the bitter medicine \nthat will surely come if a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget passes in the House and Senate and is ratified at the State \nlevel. There will have to be some tough, tough decisions. Well, why not \nmake those tough decisions now? We do not need a constitutional \namendment, if there are 67 votes in this body now. And if two-thirds of \nthe 435 Members of the other body can \n[[Page S968]] produce the votes for a constitutional amendment now, or \nnext week, or the week after, or next month, why go through all these \nmotions and why go to all that extent to fool the American people and \nto perpetrate on the American people a hoax? If they have the 67 votes, \nlet them bring forward their budget plan now; let us adopt it. Sixty-\nseven votes can pass any budget plan in this Senate.\n  If we are going to go down this road, we need to begin to take the \nfirst steps now. Waiting will only make the tough decisions tougher for \nthe proponents. I say let them showdown now if they are really serious \nand they have the votes.\n  So let us involve the American people. Let us hear their voices. Let \nus have them weigh in on this most critical of decisions. Let us heed \ntheir wisdom, once they fully understand the ramifications of such a \nmassive endeavor. Let us not literally thumb our noses at the very \npublic who just put us into office and who also put us on notice they \nwere tired of our arrogance, with this most arrogant and disingenuous \nof acts--a constitutional amendment on a balanced budget.\n  I favor a balanced budget as much as anybody favors it. There are \nthose who say, ``Well, the American families out there have to balance \ntheir budgets, why should we not?'' That is a bit disingenuous, also. \nNot many families, relatively speaking, really balance their budgets. I \nhave been married 57 years, going on 58 years, and it was only \nyesterday that I came across an old contract that I kept--not the \nContract With America but the contract with Kopper Stores. I was a meat \ncutter. I worked at Kopper Stores. I married on May 29, 1937. And on \nMay 25, 1937, I entered into a contract with the store at which I \nworked for some bedroom furniture, a bedroom suite--four or five \npieces, I believe it was. I will bring up the contract one day and \nspeak of it again briefly. But in that contract I was to pay $5 down on \na new bedroom suite, and I was to pay $7.50 every 2 weeks, either in \ncash or in script; $5 down, $7.50 every 2 weeks. That was to continue \nuntil I had paid the entire amount of $189.50 for that bedroom suite.\n  Now, did I balance my budget? I had to go into debt. I was in debt. I \nhad to go into debt to buy a bedroom suite. Most people in this country \nhave to go into debt to buy a car, to buy a bedroom suite, to buy a \nliving room suite, to buy a house. So, if the American families who are \nwatching via that electronic eye there will stop and think, they will \nagree with me. We do not really balance our budgets, do we? ``Now, \nthose politicians up there are saying that the American people balance \ntheir budgets. Why don't we balance the Federal budget?''\n  Well, I will go into that more at a later time.\n  But I have had a hard time at times in my life making ends meet, even \nwith borrowing money.\n  So we are in debt. The American people have to go into debt. They do \nnot all balance their budgets and end up at the end of the year, scot-\nfree, slate-clean, not owing a penny.\n  The public trust is low, but it will surely sink lower if we go down \nto this unworthy path of insisting on a constitutional amendment on a \nbalanced budget without laying out the roadmap, without laying out the \nplan.\n  If we have the 67 votes to pass a constitutional amendment, then we \nhave the votes to pass the bitter pills of cutting programs or raising \ntaxes. And we can begin to do that now.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to give my attention to the committee \nreport on the budget.\n  Mr. GLENN. Would the Senator yield for a comment?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/17/senate-section/article/S961-4", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              OBJECTION TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEETING\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Ohio [Mr. \nGlenn] has asked me to yield for a question. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I just want to comment briefly.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield for \nthat purpose and retain my rights to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my distinguished colleague and I thank the Chair.\n  I just wanted to comment briefly on his comments on the balanced \nbudget amendment before he moves on to his comments on the \nconsideration of S. 1.\n  I share his concerns in this area about whatever we do with regard to \nvoting on the balanced budget amendment when this comes before us here \nin the Senate. We have to know what we are voting on and what we are \ndoing, or the forcing action that we are taking and the impact that it \nis going to have on many, many programs that I think people have not \nyet really come to grips with.\n  We talk about this Contract With America as though it is something \nsacrosanct here. I think each one us here--I have a contract with the \npeople of Ohio and I, in turn, as a U.S. Senator, have a contract with \nthe people of this country myself, a contract with the people of the \nUnited States I take very, very seriously.\n  And I think that we have to know what impact that is going to have on \nthe people out there in our respective States and across the country. \nWe do not know that now.\n  To just vote, as my distinguished colleague said, on a pig in a poke \nhere without knowing what is going to happen--I would say, as far as \nthe Contract With America, we have been down that track of voting on \nsomething without knowing what was going to happen before, and we are \n$3 trillion additional in debt now to prove that it did not work \nbefore. And if we did not know how to make it work before, how are we \ngoing to make it work again?\n  We trusted the Reagan administration. Many of us here voted for that, \nvoted for the tax decrease of 25 percent over a 3-year period, with the \nidea that if it did not work, if all the new, higher level of economic \nactivity did not occur as was predicted at that time, then we would be \nable to come back to the Senate floor and we would be able to address \nthat and say, ``OK, so it didn't work the way it was advertised. We are \ngoing to correct it.''\n  The problem is, we have never been able to get the votes to correct \nit. So here we are some additional $3 trillion in debt right now, not \nknowing which way to turn.\n  Let me say this on a little bigger worldwide scale. Prime Minister \nThatcher had the same problem. She wanted to reduce the size of their \nGovernment at the same time President Reagan wanted to reduce the size \nhere. What happened is, she went about reducing the programs first and \nthen said we will have the tax reduction. It is just the opposite here.\n  The proposal of President Reagan was, we will reduce the taxes and \nthat will force us into other action which never occurred. So now we \nare being asked once again to take this on faith and we will be able to \nwork this thing out.\n  I would say to my constituents in Ohio and indeed all across the \ncountry, I think we do have to have the definition of this, as my \ndistinguished colleague from West Virginia says.\n  Can anybody say that Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, those big \nitems in the budget--that takes up over half of the Federal budget \nright there. Then when you add the interest on the national debt and \ndefense, we are up to almost two-thirds or 60 percent. So where are the \ncuts going to occur?\n  If we say those things that everybody is concerned about across the \ncountry are off limits, then where do the limits apply? What do we take \nin to consideration then?\n  Well, is it educational funds to the States? Is it higher education \nfunds that we administer mainly out of the Federal Government but \nthrough the States? Are we going to cut the FAA, their consideration of \nflying safety in this country? Are we going to consider highways for \ncuts? That is 90 percent of \n[[Page S969]] the Federal funding that goes to highways and only a 10 \npercent match. Do the people of this country want us to cut health \nfunds for the Centers for Disease Control that is working so hard to \ntry to get a solution to the AIDS problem? Are we going to cut the Food \nand Drug Administration that is looking at things that might create \nanother thalidomide crisis in this country? All of these things are \ngoing to have to be cut if we pass a balanced budget amendment.\n  I have not positively said that I am going to vote against it here. I \nam still considering that. So I would say we are just buying a pig in a \npoke when Social Security is off base, when Medicaid is off base, when \nMedicare is off base, and when interest on the national debt is off \nbase.\n  So it just does not work. I would say to the people in Ohio in \nparticular that are on Social Security: Watch out. I think they are \ngoing to have to get into that, if we vote a balanced budget amendment, \non Medicare. They are going to have to get into limiting Medicare in \none way or another, and Medicaid. We cannot say do not pay the interest \non the national debt.\n  And I would say the reason this ties into our debate here on the \nfloor today on unfunded mandates is I think the estimate is we put out \nabout $230 billion per year to the States for various programs. I \nbelieve the figure is that about $70 billion of that is in \ndiscretionary funding, the remainder in entitlements, mainly in the \nMedicaid Program.\n  Now, it seems to me, if we pass a balanced budget amendment without \nknowing in advance what the plans are for where the cuts are going do \ncome from with this unfunded mandates legislation, of which I am a \ncosponsor, coauthor of here, I do not see how we avoid getting into \nthose payments to the States right now if we vote ourselves a \nguillotine balanced budget amendment. And that is that. Then we will \nhave to look to cutting down these entitlements and the $230 billion \nper year that goes to the States right now. Can we afford to continue \nthat kind of funding if we have a balanced budget amendment and cannot \ncut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the national \ndebt and defense? I would submit that it will be very, very difficult \nto do that.\n  So I think in fairness, to make sure that some of the other programs \nare not cut, I think we have to look at the balanced budget amendment \nvery, very carefully.\n  I think people will start asking their own questions, once they look \nat these things, as to how it will affect them. If we are going to have \nto balance the Federal budget at least in part by cutting out what we \nsend to the States right now, then it undercuts what we are trying to \ndo with this unfunded mandates bill. I do not want to do that.\n  I am trying to treat the States fairly, as is my distinguished \ncolleague from Idaho, who pushed this bill for the last couple of \nyears, brought it out of committee last fall, and could not get it \nthrough on the floor. I am a supporter, absolutely and unequivocally, \nof the unfunded mandates bill. I know there are some questions. We have \nsome amendments to correct some of those. Senator Levin wants to \naddress this sometime today. And there are others concerned. The \nSenator from Nebraska has some concerns. I see him here. I have some \nconcerns.\n  I have a couple of amendments that I think will take out some of the \ndoubts about how this would be administered. I am very concerned, along \nwith my colleague from West Virginia, about the balanced budget \namendment. I think it does tie over into unfunded mandates, because I \nthink once we enact a balanced budget amendment, the States will have \nto look very carefully at what goes to the States right now. They are \nbeing too hard pressed now. I think there is a tie in that direction.\n  I wanted to make those comments, and I appreciate the Senator from \nWest Virginia yielding to me for that purpose, to raise some of the \nsame questions he has raised. I hope we can get on with S. 1 sometime \nthis afternoon or sometime today so we can deal with the number of \namendments we have. I hope we can get done with it this week. That \nmeans we will have to move expeditiously or we will not be able to \nbring up all the amendments this week.\n  Some of the amendments that are proposed are real busters, I guess I \nwould call them. Some of them are not germane, necessarily, to this \nbill and deal with other matters that are of very major import. Some on \nthe other side of the aisle and some on our side of the aisle will \nrequire considerable debate. Some over there, for instance, go back and \nsay that we have to take up all past mandates, not make it prospective \nbut go back. That would cost trillions of dollars. I do not know \nwhether these amendments are talking amendments, talk a little bit and \nare not serious, but when you have things like that, it will require \nsome time on this bill.\n  It all comes back, though, to whether we are dealing fairly with the \nStates. I think this bill, even in its present form without amending, \ngoes a long, long way toward addressing some of the sins of the Federal \nGovernment, if we want to put it that way, of the past 50 or 60 years.\n  There were good reasons why a lot of these provisions or a lot of the \nsocial services--a lot of reasons why some of those things moved to the \nFederal levels. Because the States back in those days, back in the days \nof the Great Depression, either could not or would not move to address \nsome of the concerns when many of our people were bordering on \nstarvation. Roosevelt came in with a package, the New Deal, that moved \na lot of these responsibilities out of the community and away from the \nStates, because communities and localities and States were not able to \naddress those programs at that time. So these things moved to the \nFederal level.\n  Well, have some of them grown too far? I am the first to say they \ncertainly have. Are the States now willing to pick up all these \nresponsibilities that 50 or 60 years ago they were not able or could \nnot pick up? We have to be careful with that and monitor what is going \non to make certain that, as we move this unfunded mandates legislation \nthrough, we do not see a lot of people fall in the cracks, that we are \ndepending on the Federal programs, excessive though they may have been. \nWe just want to make sure that we monitor this very, very carefully.\n  I am all for the unfunded mandates bill. I hope we can work out all \nthese details that people have concerns about.\n  Tying that back to the balanced budget amendment, once again, if we \npass the balanced budget, it seems to me, there will be big pressure on \nthe Federal Government to reduce what we send to the States now, which \nis about $230 billion a year.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague yielding for those remarks. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Ohio, \n[Mr. Glenn].\n  Today's Washington Post has an editorial titled, ``More On the \nMandates Issue.'' It reads in part:\n\n       The mandates bill could well be the first major building \n     block of the Republican congressional agenda to pass. . . . \n     The Republicans look upon it in part as the key to achieving \n     other goals such as a balanced budget amendment to the \n     Constitution and perhaps welfare reform. Governors and other \n     state and local officials are fearful of being stranded by \n     the spending cuts implicit in both of these and conceivably \n     could block them. The promise that at the same time they will \n     get relief from Federal mandates is meant to assuage them.\n       In fact, the legislation doesn't ban unfunded mandates as \n     so much of surrounding rhetoric on both sides would suggest. \n     . . .  Not all unfunded mandates are unjustified, nor are \n     state and local governments, which receive a quarter trillion \n     dollars a year in Federal aid, always the victims they \n     portray themselves to be in the Federal relationship.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire editorial from \nthe Washington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       More on the Mandates Issue\n\n       House Republicans partly disarmed the critics of their \n     unfunded mandates bill by keeping a promise and quietly \n     fixing one defect last week in committee. They should fix \n     another when the bill comes to the floor, perhaps this week.\n       [[Page S970]] The mandates bill could well be the first \n     major building block of the Republican congressional agenda \n     to pass. The Senate's version is on the floor as well, and \n     the president has said while avoiding details that he too \n     favors such a measure. The Republicans look upon it in part \n     as the key to achieving other goals such as a balanced budget \n     amendment to the Constitution and perhaps welfare reform. \n     Governors and other state and local officials are fearful of \n     being stranded by the spending cuts implicit in both of these \n     and conceivably could block them. The promise that at the \n     same time they will get relief from federal mandates is meant \n     to assuage them.\n       In fact, the legislation doesn't ban unfunded mandates as \n     so much of surrounding rhetoric on both sides would suggest. \n     It would merely create a parliamentary presumption against \n     them and require explicit majority votes in both houses to \n     impose them. That's the right approach. Though there is a \n     genuine problem that needs fixing here, not all unfunded \n     mandates are unjustified, nor are state and local \n     governments, which receive a quarter trillion dollars a year \n     in federal aid, always the victims they portray themselves to \n     be in the federal relationship. What would happen is simply \n     that future bills imposing mandates without the funds to \n     carry them out would be subject to a point of order. A member \n     could raise the point of order, another would move to waive \n     it and there would be a vote. That works in the Senate. The \n     problem in the House was that the rules would not have \n     allowed a waiver motion. A single member, raising a point of \n     order that the chair would have been obliged to sustain, \n     would have been enough to kill a bill. The Rules Committee \n     found a way around that rock last week. The bill now provides \n     expressly for the majority votes that the sponsors say are \n     its main point.\n       The other problem involves judicial review. The Senate bill \n     would rightly bar appeals to the courts by state and local \n     officials or others on grounds the terms of the bill had been \n     ignored, the theory being that is mainly an internal matter--\n     Congress agreeing to change its own future behavior--and a \n     political accommodation of the sort that courts should have \n     no role in. The House bill contains no similar ban, in part \n     because a section would require the executive branch to do \n     certain studies before issuing regulations and the sponsors, \n     or some of them, want that to be judicially enforceable. But \n     Congress has power enough to enforce these requirements \n     itself; it needn't turn to the courts. The Republicans \n     rightly say in other contexts that there is already too much \n     resort to the courts in this country. They ought to stick to \n     that position. In fact, because the House bill is silent on \n     the matter, it isn't clear whether it would permit resort to \n     the courts or not. The House should say not.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the fact is that States receive massive \namounts of Federal funds. In fact, we provide so much money to the \nStates that it takes a separate 373-page report--right here it is, a \nseparate 373-page report--from the Office of Management and Budget to \nlist all the grants, talking about grants which we provide to States.\n  On page 1 of this report entitled ``Budget Information for States \nFiscal Year 1995,'' there is a table that provides a State-by-State \nlisting of the total Federal dollars going out in fiscal year 1995. The \ntotal for all States is $208,910,820.\n  Does anyone really believe that if we try to balance the budget \nwithout cutting defense or social security and without raising taxes \nthat these State grants will not be cut? West Virginia, estimated for \nfiscal year 1995 is shown on the list as receiving 0.85 percent of the \ntotal for the United States, $1,765,000. The fiscal year 1993 total to \nthe States was $177,984,295.\n  So all the States are listed with indications of the States' shares \nas a percentage of the total. If one excludes interest on the debt, \nthat would be over $200 billion, and if we exclude defense, which is \nover $270 billion, and if we exclude Social Security, which is $334 \nbillion, where can we find the cuts? We will have to cut State grants \ndramatically, and this unfunded mandates bill will not stop these \nmassive cuts that will come as we proceed to balance the budget over \nthe next 7 years.\n  So you Governors out there beyond the beltway, you State legislators \nout there beyond the beltway, hear this: Friends, Romans, countrymen, \nif we pass a balanced budget amendment and even if the Congress passes \nthe bill that is now pending before the Senate, which it will pass, do \nnot think you are getting off scot-free out there in the States. You \nare still going to have to give a pound of flesh. It is still going to \ncome out of your hide. We will have to cut State grants that are not \nmandates dramatically--dramatically--and this bill will not stop these \nmassive cuts as we proceed to balance the budget over the next 7 years.\n  Unfunded mandates are not a new thing. Indeed, one might easily argue \nthat unfunded mandates are as old as law itself. When the Lord told \nIsrael that on the seventh day thou shalt not do any work, he was \nimposing an unfunded mandate on the 12 tribes. The tribes may have \nperceived a short-run loss in productivity, and that may have been only \npartly made up for by God's provision of manna and quails, but surely \nthe benefits of keeping the Sabbath far outweigh the mere economic \ncosts of doing so.\n  That can also be said about a number of other mandates. We can learn \na lot by going back to that old book that our fathers and mothers read. \nWe think that our constitutional forebears came up with something new \nwhen they and the Members of the first Congress set up the Federal \ncourt system. That legislation was initiated in the United States \nSenate in the very first Congress.\n  But those Senators and House Members were not coming up with \nsomething that was entirely new. One needs only to read the 18th \nchapter of Exodus to understand that there was a court system \nestablished by Moses hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years ago \nthat was, in many ways, somewhat like our own Federal court system.\n  Moses was hearing all of the people's cases himself. It is a little \nlike Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, who was the seventh and last king of \nRome, who heard capital cases himself. He did not take the advice of \nthe Senate at that time.\n  But Moses was hearing all of these cases himself, and the people \nstood in long lines waiting to adjudicate their grievances. Jethro, the \nfather-in-law of Moses, came to see Moses and saw all of what was \nhappening and saw that the people were waiting and Moses was being \nrequired to take an inordinate amount of time to deal with these cases.\n  Jethro suggested to Moses that he should break down this work, divide \nit, have a division of the work and that he should appoint rulers or \njudges over tens, rulers over fifties, rulers over hundreds, and rulers \nover thousands, and let those rulers over the various categories judge \nthe people and that Moses confine himself only to the hard causes--not \nthe minor matters--or to those cases that were appealed up to him.\n  And Moses took Jethro's advice, and instead of deciding every small \nmatter himself and keeping the people waiting, there would be a \ndivision and speeding up of the work. Justice delayed is justice \ndenied. Moses established this plan that Jethro, his father-in-law, had \nsuggested. Moses appointed judges to deal with tens of people, those \nwho would deal with fifties, those who would deal with hundreds, those \nwho would deal with thousands, and he himself, Moses, would take the \nmajor matters or those that were appealed.\n  And so we have somewhat the same system. We have the Federal district \ncourts, and we have the Federal appeals courts. We have the Supreme \nCourt. We also have municipal judges, county judges, district judges, \nState supreme court judges.\n  There are Federal district judges in West Virginia. We used to have \none in the north and one in the south and we had what they called a \nroving judge or rotating judge. So you have district judges and then we \nhave the appeals court level and then we have the United States Supreme \nCourt.\n  We can learn a lot by going back into history and seeing how the \nIsraelites did things.\n  The Federal Government's wage and hour restrictions on State and \nlocal governmental units can trace their lineage to the Lord's \nadmonition to observe a weekly day of rest. But the Federal Government \ndoes not compensate Federal, State, and local governments for imposing \nthose rules. We can probably all agree that some unfunded mandates \nyield more in benefits to society than their simple economic costs \nwould reflect.\n  Mr. President, over the weekend I looked at the committee\n   reports, studied them carefully. This is what the committee report \nfrom the Committee on the Budget has to say with respect to the \nadditional views of Senator Jim Exon. Here is what Senator Exon says. \nIn the first paragraph he speaks of his \n[[Page S971]] support for S. 1, which is before the Senate. But then he \nsays:\n\n       Although I am an ardent supporter of this legislation I \n     feel compelled to criticize the procedure under which it was \n     taken up.\n       The Senate Budget Committee met on January 9th to mark up \n     this legislation. We adopted 8 amendments in the committee. \n     At the end of the markup, I asked Chairman Domenici whether \n     we would be filing a report on this important measure. \n     Senator Domenici answered that the Republican leader had \n     asked that the committee not file a report, so as to expedite \n     the Senate's consideration of the bill by Wednesday morning, \n     January 11th. Several members on our side of the table \n     objected to this procedure.\n       Senator Domenici then made a motion that the committee \n     report the bill without a report. The committee adopted that \n     motion on a straight party-line vote of 12-9. The following \n     evening, January 10th, the majority asked us whether they \n     could file a report on the following night, on the condition \n     that there be no objection to shortening the normal 3 day \n     period for the submission of minority views. Two Senators \n     objected to that request. They wanted the full 3 days to do \n     their minority views and review the report. The majority then \n     filed a statement in the record in lieu of the report.\n\n  ``This morning''--this was the morning of January 12th, which would \nhave been Thursday of last week.\n\n       This morning, January 12th, the majority extended us the \n     opportunity to review the proposed report and add minority \n     views until January the 17th. [That is today.] Yet, this \n     afternoon [meaning the afternoon of January 12th] on the \n     Senate floor they announced that they intended to file the \n     report immediately. While the majority may have been prepared \n     to file its report, the members of the committee in the \n     minority did not have a straight story on when their views \n     were due.\n\n  This is Senator Exon.\n\n       The members of the committee in the minority did not have a \n     straight story on when their views were due.\n       For this reason, I objected to the unanimous consent \n     agreement requested on the Senate floor because I was not \n     sure that all the minority members had the opportunity to \n     submit their views and I was concerned that members might \n     still be working on their minority views. I believe that it \n     is extremely important that anything purporting to be a \n     report on this bill include such minority views.\n       Unfortunately despite my objects, I have been informed that \n     the report will be filed at 6 PM tonight, January 12th.\n\n  This is the ranking minority member of that committee who is speaking \nand who is writing, Senator Exon of Nebraska.\n  ``I was concerned,'' Senator Exon stated, ``that members might still \nbe working on their minority views. I believe that it is extremely \nimportant that anything purporting to be a report on this bill include \nsuch minority views.'' Unfortunately, he said he had been informed that \nthe report would be filed at 6 p.m. on the evening--p.m. on January 12. \nContinuing:\n\n       And so we have discovered a means to evade both the \n     Committee's requirement of 3 days for the preparation of \n     minority views and the Senate Rules requirement for a report \n     to be available for 48 hours before proceeding to a bill. You \n     simply say that you are not going to file a report. Then you \n     proceed to the bill, as early as the next day. Then you file \n     a report. This procedure evades both the Committee and Senate \n     rules----\n\n  Why all this hurry? Why all the rush? It is the 17th day of January. \nWe have 11 months and 14 days to go yet in this year. Why all this \nrush?\n  Senator Exon says, again:\n\n       This procedure evades both the Committee and Senate rules, \n     but apparently cannot be enforced in either forum.\n\n  Have they gained anything? Has any time been gained by this thumbing \nof the nose at the committee rules and at the Senate rules? Has \nanything been gained? Senator Exon continues, ``I find this practice \nvery troubling and am extremely concerned about the precedent that it \nsets.''\n  He continues. This time he speaks of the sunset provision.\n\n       Last year's version of the Unfunded Mandates Bill, S. 993 \n     contained a sunset date. It was my understanding, and also \n     that of many of the negotiators who hammered out this bi-\n     partisan compromise, that we would have a sunset date. It is \n     unclear why the provision was not included in the bill \n     introduced to the Senate. Despite former assurances that a \n     sunset provision would be included in the legislation or \n     added during markup, a sunset provision was voted down 3 \n     times during the Budget Committee markup in a straight 12-9 \n     party line vote.\n       I believe a sunset provision is crucial to the success of \n     this bill. A sunset provision will help--not hurt--this \n     important piece of legislation. Sunset provisions are a \n     common sight on the legislative landscape. For example, the \n     revenues used to fund to the superfund program sunset this \n     year. We have sunset provisions in everything from the crime \n     bill to school to work to the 1990 farm bill.\n       We are dealing with an entirely new concept. It is untried \n     and untested. This bill needs a trial period so that any \n     problems and bugs can be worked out. The Congressional budget \n     office has expressed concern over the analyses that are \n     required in the bill. In testimony before the Senate \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs, Director Reischauer gave a \n     candid assessment of the difficulty in completing these \n     analyses on a timely basis, not to mention, culling reliable \n     information for them.\n       A sunset provision in 1998 would allow Congress to pause \n     and examine the job that CBO has performed to date. We could \n     then fine tune and if necessary retool the process to make \n     this bill even more effective.\n       A sunset provision is not going to kill the unfunded \n     mandates program. The bill's time has come and there is no \n     reason to believe that the bill would be scrapped four years \n     from now. Currently the legislation has 57 co-sponsors. If \n     the legislation lives up to its expectations, there should be \n     no problem marshalling the same support in 1998.\n       Lastly, the unfunded mandates bill does not operate in a \n     vacuum. It must be viewed in the context of the budget act. \n     The caps and other major provisions in the Budget Act--\n     including the supermajority points of order--expire in 1998. \n     Since we will have to revisit the entire Budget Act in 1998, \n     it makes sense to be consistent and provide for a 1998 sunset \n     provision in this piece of legislation as well.\n\n  Mr. President, may I without losing my right to the floor inquire of \nthe managers as to whether or not they anticipate an amendment to be \noffered that will provide a sunset provision and, if so, if they feel \nthat there is a reasonable chance of its being accepted.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I would be glad to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. I believe Senator Levin brought that up in committee and \nhas talked about putting an amendment in to that effect. And I think \nthat is what we addressed.\n  I favor a sunset because I think this is really landmark legislation. \nI think it is the first real piece of legislation that readdresses the \nrelationship between the State, local, and Federal governments. As such \nI think the impact of this is going to be enormous. I do not disagree \nwith making certain that we take another look at this because, if it is \nworking well, we can reauthorize it at that time. If it is not working \nwell, we can either make appropriate changes, or we can do away with \nit, if it is just fouling things up and having unintended effects. I do \nnot think that is going to be the case.\n  I have supported Senator Levin. I do not want to speak for him. It is \nmy impression that at the appropriate time he will present a 3-year \nsunset provision.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Does the Senator from Idaho wish me to yield under the same \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. With regard to the sunset provision, yes. I think we \nfully anticipate that there will be an amendment offered. I do not know \nhow many years will be offered. I know that in the Budget Committee an \namendment was offered for 3 years, and I believe also for 5 years and \nalso for 7 years. All of those were rejected by majority vote.\n  I will tell the Senator from West Virginia that I resist a sunset \nprovision. To me this is going back to the fundamentals of what the \nFounding Fathers intended; that is, that we have this sort of \npartnership in the federalism program between the States, localities, \nand the Federal Government.\n  If there is a problem with Senate bill 1, once it is implemented and \nit is clearly identified that there is a problem, I would not contend \nto wait 3 years. There is nothing to preclude us from going in and, if \nthere is need for modification, make any modification as necessary.\n  But I am reluctant to say that after we have worked so hard, and the \nSenator from West Virginia has referenced the rush and the 100 days \nmeasured that has been put on this. I would just say that this bill in \ngetting to this point has taken 600 days in the making because much of \nthe core of Senate bill 1 comes from Senate bill 993 of the last \nsession.\n   [[Page S972]] So again, I resist the idea that we are just going to \nget it implemented and in 3 years it will sunset. If there are problems \nwith it, I would like to see us modify them. There is nothing to \npreclude that from happening.\n  Mr. BYRD. Were there not sunset provisions in the legislation last \nyear?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. The Senator from West Virginia is correct. I can tell \nhim that is something that--and I will defer to the Senator from Ohio \nwho was chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee at that time \nwhen that provision was included. Again, I was not a strong proponent \nof it being placed in that. But that was not my decision at the time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both Senators.\n  I personally favor a sunset provision in this legislation. We are \nreading and hearing a great deal about welfare reform. I think that if \nwe had had a sunset provision in the laws regulating and governing \nwelfare in this country we would have had sunset provisions. A great \nmany of the perceived flaws in the legislation would have been \ncorrected.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, without losing my right to the floor. I do not intend \nto hold the floor much longer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wanted to inquire of the Senator if he \nhad perhaps seen the testimony of the Governor of Michigan in the House \nof Representatives last week. I saw it replayed this weekend.\n  As we start out the discussion of the proper relationship between the \nFederal Government and the States, his testimony in the House is very \nimportant. He told the House of Representatives that the role that he \nsaw for the Federal Government was just to send the money. He said, you \nin the Federal Government, you just send the money back and we will \ndecide how it is spent at the State level. I must say I was very \ntroubled when I saw this notion of what the Federal-State relationship \nis supposed to be. I was very troubled by the Governor of Michigan, who \nwas on the committee determining the welfare reform policy for the \nparty on the other side of the aisle, suggesting that the role ought to \nbe that the Federal Government levies the taxes, raises the money, and \nhas nothing to say about how the money is spent. Now, if that is not a \nperverse notion of Federal-State relations, I do not know what is. I \ntold my staff this morning, ``in his dreams,'' as far as this Senator \nis concerned.\n  My own notion is that there should never be a separation between the \nresponsibility for raising the money and the responsibility for \nspending the money. That ought to be a fundamental principle that we \nadhere to in this Chamber. And I believe that because, if we raise the \nmoney and the States decide how to spend it, it is free money for the \nStates. They did not have to go through the political risk of levying \nthe taxes to raise the money. They just eat the dessert. They just \nspend money. Oh, no. That is not going to be the relationship, at least \nif this Senator has anything to say about it. I must say that I thought \nit was arrogant in the extreme for a Governor to say all we ought to do \nis write the checks. We raise the money, levy the taxes, and then send \nthem the money and they will decide how to spend it.\n  I was going to ask the distinguished Senator from West Virginia his \nreaction to this notion that we raise the money, and then have no say \nin how it is spent. We just send it back to the States and they will \ndecide how to divvy it up. I am very interested in the Senator from \nWest Virginia's reaction to that notion.\n  Mr. BYRD. I reacted the same way that the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota reacted. It is arrogance. It is a new ``Caesarism.'' It is \nthe same arrogance that is displayed by those who beat the drums for a \nconstitutional amendment on the balanced budget without at the same \ntime being willing to lay out the plan to let the American people know \nwhat is in the offing, what is the price to be paid for this approach. \nHow would the taxes be cut? What taxes will be cut? How much will they \nbe cut? What cuts will there be in programs? What programs will be \nexempted? What programs will not be exempted? And it is an arrogance \nthat is being manifested within this institution, the Congress of the \nUnited States, when it says you folks up there just pass a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, and do not tell us what \nit entails; do not tell the people in the legislatures what action we \nare going to have to take to continue programs from which we are \npresently receiving grants in our States, and so on. Do not tell us \nthat. We do not want to know that.\n  So the big folks up there in Washington--us big folk--we know it all. \nThat Governor is saying: You fellows just send the money down to the \nStates with no strings attached. That is the same thing on both \nsubjects. Just pass a constitutional amendment and let the American \npeople find out, in due time, where the pain is.\n  (Mr. SMITH assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BYRD. With the same understanding, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am asking a question. First of all, with respect to \nwhat the Governor from Michigan was saying, I would say to him, look, \nif the Federal Government raises the money, the Federal Government is \ngoing to have something to say about how the money is spent. If the \nGovernors want to make all the decisions on how the money is to be \nspent, then they raise the money. That is an appropriate State-Federal \nrelationship. It is ridiculous and extreme to say that the Federal \nGovernment should levy the taxes and raise the money but the States \nwill decide how it is spent.\n  I will follow up with a question on the matter of a plan to balance \nthe budget. Last week, I came down to the floor and gave a speech on \nsomething I have detected that I call the Republican credibility gap. \nIt is more than a gap now. It is a chasm. In fact, it is approaching \nGrand Canyon size. This chart shows what would need to be done to \nbalance the budget over the next 7 years. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, we would need over $1 trillion in cuts \nover the next 7 years. That is if we did nothing to make the problem \nworse before we started.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to \nthe Senator briefly--I only want to hold the floor for a few more \nminutes--without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am interested in the Senator's reaction to the \ncredibility gap I have detected. This chart shows we need $1 trillion \nover the next 7 years if we do not do anything to make the situation \nworse before we start to solve the problem. But look what happens with \nour Republican friends' plan. The first thing they do is propose $364 \nbillion of tax cuts, not spending cuts, but $364 billion of tax cuts. \nThis is according to the Treasury Department. So now the $1 trillion \nproblem over the next 7 years is nearly $1.4 trillion.\n  The next thing they do is say, well, we want to cut spending \nsomeplace. We do not want to be too clear on exactly where we are going \nto cut spending, but before we start cutting spending, we want to \nincrease spending. We want to increase spending on defense by $82 \nbillion. So now the problem that started out as a $1 trillion problem \nhas turned out to be a $1.48 trillion problem. That is the amount that \nwould have to be cut in order to balance the budget over the next 7 \nyears. We start with $1 trillion, and we add their $364 billion in \nproposed tax cuts, according to the Treasury Department, then we add \nthe $82 billion of increased defense spending, and the problem now is \n$1.481 trillion. That is a big number. That is not a million; that is \nnot a billion; that is a trillion.\n  The interesting thing is to look at what they have come up with by \nway of specific proposals to cut spending. This is where we get to what \nI call the credibility gap. The credibility gap really is a chasm, \nbecause we need to find $1.481 trillion of cuts. But so far the \nRepublican side has identified $277 billion in specific spending cut \nproposals. It is a paltry amount in comparison to what is needed to get \nthe job done.\n  So I say to the Senator from West Virginia, it looks to me like they \nhave \n[[Page S973]] a $1.2 trillion credibility gap--the difference between \nwhat is necessary to balance the budget over 7 years and what they have \noutlined to balance the budget over 7 years. I say to my colleague from \nWest Virginia, $1.2 trillion--that is one thousand two hundred \nbillion--is a lot of money. Even in Washington talk that is a lot of \nmoney.\n  I think our friends on the other side owe it to us, and they owe it \nto the American people, to come forward with a plan to tell us \nspecifically, precisely, how are they going to cut an additional $1.2 \ntrillion. Are they going to take it out of Social Security? They say \nnot. Are they going to take it out of Medicare? They say not. They say \nthey are not going to take it out of defense. They cannot take it out \nof interest on the debt. That means well over half of all Federal \nspending is off the table.\n  I ask the Senator from West Virginia for his reaction to what I see \nas this enormous credibility gap by our friends from the other side.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. The $1.2 trillion, it \nseems to me, represents $1,200 per minute since Jesus Christ was born. \nTo count $1 trillion--so that we might have a little better sense of \nthe numbers that the Senator is talking about--at the rate of $1 per \nsecond would require about 32,000 years. It would take 32,000 years to \ncount $1 trillion at the rate of $1 per second.\n  So the Senator is talking in terms of big money. There is a gap.\n  But there is another gap I am thinking about, also. If those from \nbehind this steamroller--this constitutional amendment on a balanced \nbudget--if they can mount 67 votes--and the conventional wisdom around \nof late is that that amendment is a sure thing and it is going to be \nadopted. In the discussion, they are already talking about how it will \nfare at the State level. If the 67 votes are found in this Senate, and \ntwo-thirds of the 435 Members of the House are going to vote for that \nconstitutional amendment, why can those who support the amendment not \nlay out the road plan now? Why do they not bring in their plan now if \nthey have 67 votes in the Senate and two-thirds of the 435 votes in the \nHouse that will vote for a constitutional amendment on a balanced \nbudget? Why do they not simply bring in the plan now and start voting \non it? It would only take 51 votes in the Senate. It only takes a \nmajority to pass legislation. Why do they not do that? They have all \nthe votes. They have all the votes that are necessary to raise taxes \nnow. Instead they are going in the opposite direction and everybody is \ntalking about cutting taxes--not everybody.\n  The administration is for cutting taxes, the Republican Party is for \ncutting taxes. But also the Republican Party wants--the Republican \nParty on the Hill--a constitutional amendment on a balanced budget. Why \nnot start on it today? Why not start to deal with balancing the budget \ntoday, next week, next month? All they need is a majority of the votes \nto do that. They do not need two-thirds to do that, as they will need \nfor a constitutional amendment. So that is a big gap. I cannot \nunderstand why it is easier to get 67 votes than it is to get 51.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am going to give up the floor shortly. I will yield, if I \nmay, without losing my right to the floor. I just wanted to ask another \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Hearing \nnone, the Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I just want to go further on this point. \nIt just strikes me there are those of us who very much want a balanced \nbudget. I am in that camp. The Senator from West Virginia knows that I \nfeel strongly that we ought to balance this budget; we ought to do it \nthe right way.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is why I voted for the 1990 package that was developed \nat the summit among the Republicans and the Democrats, when Mr. Bush \nwas President. That is why I voted for the 1993 package. Not a Member, \nnot one of our friends on the other side of the aisle, voted for the \n1993 package, as I recall. I voted for it. It was tough to do it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think we should say that that 1993 package has, in \nfact, reduced the deficit. We had a Federal budget deficit in 1992 of \n$290 billion. In 1993, that was reduced to $255 billion. Last year, it \nwas further reduced to just over $200 billion. This year, the estimate \nis it will be further reduced to some $176 billion.\n  The fact is, on that plan that the Senator from West Virginia and I \nboth voted for, we did not get a single vote from the other side of the \naisle; not a single vote. And voting for that plan took political \ncourage, because it did cut spending. It cut over 100 programs by over \n$100 million. It also raised taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent.\n  People, of course, do not want to pay more taxes. I do not want to \npay more taxes. I levied more taxes on myself in that vote; I wound up \npaying more in taxes. But I did it because I recognized we have a \nnational crisis. We have to get our fiscal house in order. And if we \nare to do that, it requires a plan.\n  The point I wanted to make is that our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle say they are for a balanced budget, but they have not come \nforward with a plan to do it. Talk is cheap. Talk is cheap. It is easy \nto say, ``I am for it.'' The difficult thing is to put down a plan that \nactually starts to do it.\n  I think it is terribly important that the American people know that \nthere is this extraordinary gap between what our friends on the other \nside have said they are going to do and what they have identified to \nget the job done--a $1.2 trillion gap.\n  I said last week that gives a whole new meaning to the phrase, \n``don't ask, don't tell,'' because that is what they are asking here. \n``Don't ask, don't tell'' the American people. They are saying to the \npeople, ``We are going to pass this balanced budget amendment, but we \nare not going to tell you how we are going to do it. We are not going \nto tell you where we are going to make $1.2 trillion in cuts over the \nnext 7 years.''\n  I think the American people deserve better; I think our colleagues \ndeserve better. I know the Senator from West Virginia believes that \nthey have an obligation to come forward and be specific. I think that \nought to be central to any debate we have.\n  I again thank the Senator from West Virginia for his courtesy and \njust ask him once again: Does not the other side have an obligation to \ncome forward with a plan? Do not the American people deserve to know \nwhere they intend to cut $1.2 trillion over the next 7 years? Do not \nthe people have a right to that plan?\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator, Mr. President.\n  Of course they are entitled to know what is in the plan. And we have \na responsibility, in my judgment, before we rivet this piece of garbage \ninto the Constitution, we have a responsibility to tell them what our \nplans are, how we expect to achieve this goal.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I hope he will \nexpound further at some point on the subject matter concerning the \nconstitutional amendment on the balanced budget. I hope he will use \nthose charts. I hope he will elaborate on the matter further.\n  I do not intend to discuss that matter further right now. There will \nbe a time, when we will be talking about the constitutional amendment \non the balanced budget, that like Shallow, in ``The Merry Wives of \nWindsor'', ``I will make a star chamber matter of it.''\n  Right now I just want to ask one more question of the distinguished \nmanagers. In looking over Mrs. Boxer's views, minority views, I have \nnoted--and I will not read her entire views as expressed in the report, \nbut she says, in part:\n\n       I am also disappointed that the bill fails to directly \n     address one of the biggest unfunded Federal mandates faced by \n     California: the costs imposed by illegal immigration. I \n     therefore plan to offer an amendment on the floor to ensure \n     that the costs to States and local governments of illegal \n     immigration be addressed in the bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I share her viewpoint on this. I share the view that \nshe has expressed with regard to the costs imposed by illegal \nimmigration. As a matter of fact, the full Appropriations Committee, \nunder my chairmanship last year, conducted some hearings on this \nmatter. The members were very concerned about illegal immigration, \nabout the costs of illegal immigration that are being imposed on States \nlike \n[[Page S974]] California, and the various Governors appeared at that \ntime.\n  Do the managers feel that it is likely that we will have an \nopportunity to debate this amendment? Mrs. Boxer says she is going to \noffer an amendment ``to ensure that the costs to States and local \ngovernments from illegal immigration be addressed in the bill.''\n  What is the likelihood of such an amendment being adopted?\n  She also expresses concern that the amendments to sunset the bill \nwere rejected by a party-line vote. What can we expect? Can we expect \nany relief for those States that have such humongous problems at this \ntime with respect to illegal immigration? Can we expect them to get any \nrelief?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from California \nraises a very important issue when she raises this question of \nimmigration. The Senator from Florida, the Senator from Texas, the \nSenator from Arizona, and many others have raised this issue.\n  But in listening to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia as \nhe talks about the process and the fact that he believes there is a \nprocess where the committee should be involved, this issue of \nimmigration is a monumental issue. I do not know that, by bringing that \nto the floor, this is the forum for us to finally resolve that.\n  I have also spoken to the distinguished Senator from Wyoming [Mr. \nSimpson] who has also been providing leadership on this issue. My \nconcern is that I do not believe this is the bill to attach it to.\n  But, am I empathetic to what those Senators are saying? Absolutely. \nThis Nation needs to deal with that issue of immigration, but I do not \nbelieve this is the vehicle to accomplish that.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not mean for the Senator to address that particular \naspect of it. That was not my point. I do not expect this bill to \naddress that aspect of it.\n  But Mrs. Boxer and others are obviously very concerned with respect \nto the unfunded mandate or mandates that are being placed upon the \nStates to deal with this problem. My question goes to that aspect, not \nto dealing with a solution to the overall problem.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I would just read to the Senator about 10 lines from \nthe bill. This is on page 3, under the purpose of the bill. It states:\n\n       (A) providing for the development of information about the \n     nature and size of mandates in proposed legislation; and\n       (B) establishing a mechanism to bring such information to \n     the attention of the Senate and the House of Representatives \n     before the Senate and the House of Representatives vote on \n     proposed legislation;\n       (4) to promote informed and deliberate decisions by \n     Congress on the appropriateness of Federal mandates in any \n     particular instance.\n\n  I believe, I say to the Senator, that if S. 1 were in place right \nnow, this would be the process that would help, for example, the \nSenator from California in dealing with what may be further Federal \nmandates where there are costs imposed on the States under that title \nof immigration.\n  This is a process before we cast our vote. Because, the Senator is \nwell aware of how many times, when we have a 15-minute rollcall vote, \nwe will go down there and we may confer with one another during those \n15 minutes and we will ask, ``Is there a mandate in here?'' That is the \nextent of the knowledge we have today.\n  This is going to give us a process so that we will know that there is \na mandate or there is not. We will know the cost of it. We will know \nthe impact on both the public and private sector. And we will know that \ninformation up front before we cast our vote.\n So that is why I am so desirous to get on with the implementation of \nS. 1, because then we can take some of these very important issues that \nthe Senator has raised.\n\n  Now we have a process to allow Members to deal with it so that it is \ninformed as opposed to the current process.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield for an additional reply to his \nquestion?\n  This bill is prospective. It does not try to go back and undo what \nmay have happened or what may have built up in the past.\n  I see our distinguished colleague from Iowa on the floor, and I am \nsure he may want to address this because I understand he had a proposed \namendment that we go by. But this bill is strictly prospective. It \ntries to address what has been the major problem with regard to the \nFederal-State relationship, and that is that we have specifically \npassed a lot of laws that impose mandates on the States.\n  Now, we do not propose in this legislation to try to correct the \nsituation where the Federal Government has had a responsibility--for \nexample, immigration control--and that responsibility has been \ninadequately met to the point where it is developing into a major \nproblem, at a major cost to States. We do not try to address some of \nthose things.\n  Now, that has to be addressed. I do not think it necessarily needs to \nbe addressed in this legislation, because if it is, then, we are into a \nreal quagmire of considering every situation where States or particular \nSenators from States have a feeling that because the Federal Government \ndid not meet the States' responsibilities--say, in flood control or in \nwhatever area it might have been--that we then have to come back and \nassume responsibilities for that later in this legislation.\n  Now, I think it is very fair and proper that we address the \nimmigration problem, but we made no attempt in this bill, nor do I \nreally feel that we should in this bill, to address something like \nimmigration, which is where the Federal Government, obviously, has not \nmet its responsibility to control immigration for the United States of \nAmerica. We have not been doing it, particularly in California, Texas, \nthe border States along our southern border, and to some extent in \nother States, also.\n  That is where the major problems have occurred, because the Federal \nGovernment did not meet its responsibilities. Then I think there should \nbe separate legislation that deals with this. But this bill is not set \nup to address something that is of that nature and that is already \nbehind us.\n  I would say this: The major problem for most States--although that is \na major problem for California, for instance--but the major problem for \nmost States has not been of that nature where the Federal Government \ndid not meet its responsibilities. The major problem we are trying to \naddress here is where the Federal Government has in many respects gone \ntoo far, maybe, in meeting this responsibly and tossing this \nrequirement downhill to the States and local communities and saying, \n``You pick it up''--the States--``we are not going to do it.'' That was \nnot done intentionally from the Federal Government with regard to \nimmigration, although we have to address that.\n  So, what we are trying to do, and the major cost to most States has \ncome from the unfunded mandates where we have passed laws that require \nclean air, clean water, clean whatever it was, and said, ``OK, States, \nbut you pick up the bill on this.'' We have not tried to address \nsomething that has happened where a Federal responsibility is not met \nand tried to address that in helping States like California, or Texas, \nor New Mexico--Arizona in particular, pick up the costs that they have, \nI feel, unfairly, been saddled with. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator. I thank both \nSenators for their responses to my questions.\n  I have over the weekend, as I say, read the reports. I found some \npositive things in the reports which have an attraction with respect to \nthis legislation.\n  At some point I would like to ask some further questions, but I yield \nthe floor at this time. I thank both Senators for their courtesy.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, again, many of the points raised by \nthe Senator from West Virginia I may happen to agree with. In fact, I \ndo agree with many of the points that were made this morning.\n  The discussion about the balanced budget amendment, now while that is \nan important issue, this is not the legislation dealing with the \nbalanced budget amendment. That will come sometime in the future. This \nis about \n[[Page S975]] Senate bill 1. This is about a process so that we can \nfinally start casting votes around here based upon information before \nthe act instead of after the act.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, with all due respect, I now move to table \nthe amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, under the previous order, I believe it was \nagreed that we would go out for our recess for the respective party \nconferences at 12:30. The hour of 12:30 having arrived, is it the \nChair's opinion we should recess?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair will \nrecess.\n  Mr. GLENN. The hour of 12:30 having arrived, are we in recess now \nthen, or does the Chair propose to put us in recess?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 12:30 \nhaving arrived, the Senate is prepared to stand in recess, but the \nSenator from Iowa is seeking recognition.\n  Mr. GLENN. Is it, Mr. President, under the previous order or is it \nthe desire of the Senator from Iowa to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, as a courtesy, will recognize the \nSenator from Iowa first. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, \nirrespective of the previous order, I be granted 7 minutes to speak as \nin morning business on a subject unrelated to unfunded mandates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, on the condition that upon the completion of the Senator's \nstatement, the Senate then stand in recess under the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 7 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/17/senate-section/article/S968-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               AMERICORPS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have recently heard in the news quite \na bit about AmeriCorps, and that is President Clinton's new program on \nvoluntarism.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I spent several months investigating \nthis whole matter, and I continue to review and will continue to review \nfor a long time into the future the merits of AmeriCorps. There has \nbeen bipartisan criticism of this program and this concept of so-called \nvoluntarism.\n  This administration seems to have learned nothing from its recent \nefforts to force a top-down solution to programs, for instance, like \nhealth care. The American people rejected at the ballot box last \nNovember a bureaucratic solution that the administration had for health \ncare reform.\n  Now the administration believes the answer to voluntarism is to have \nit driven from the top down. They want to bureaucratize voluntarism. In \nhealth care reform, they wanted to make the choice for each citizen's \nhealth care. In this program, they want to make the moral choice for \neach volunteer, and they want to pay him for that.\n  That subverts the concept of voluntarism, in my view. It turns the \nnotion of voluntarism on its head. Nevertheless, the administration \nwants to go forward despite the fact that 1.9 million Americans are \nalready volunteering on their own and doing it without pay and they are \ndoing it all over the United States because they are doing it by making \ntheir own moral choices within their own communities as they see the \nneeds of those communities.\n  Mr. President, it is discouraging that the President has completely \ndisregarded the findings of Vice President Gore's National Performance \nReview when it comes to the question of AmeriCorps or the expansion of \nthe program. A founding principle of reinventing Government is that, \naccording to Vice President Gore, you should not increase funding a \nprogram until it is a proven success. This administration has sought \ndramatic increases for AmeriCorps with little to no support the \nproposition whether or not it is succeeding.\n  The problem with AmeriCorps is the same problem that I see in the \nboondoggles of the Defense Department. As you remember, a decade ago, \n$500 hammers got a lot of attention, the $500 hammers that the Defense \nDepartment was buying.\n  In AmeriCorps, we recently uncovered that President Clinton's \nAmeriCorps is paying over $70,000 for one--yes, Mr. President, that is \none--volunteer for AmeriCorps. That $70,000 could instead be used to \nprovide dozens of young people Pell grants so that they could attend \ncollege. This point was made on this very floor 2 years ago by the then \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, and that was when we were considering authorizing \nAmeriCorps at that particular time.\n  Instead, we are spending this money on creating one job with the \nPhiladelphia Bar Association. That $70,000 job in Philadelphia is, \nunfortunately, not an anomaly. AmeriCorps has already provided me with \nmany, many grants where the costs will be over $40,000 per year per \njob.\n  I am very pleased to announce to my colleagues today that the General \nAccounting Office has agreed to my request made in behalf of myself and \nSenator Mikulski to initiate an investigation into the actual costs of \nAmeriCorps. I am confident that the GAO investigation into AmeriCorps \nwill help us all be better informed about the tremendous costs of this \nprogram.\n  As I read reports on the President's remarks, he intends to draw a \nline in the sand on this program. He intends to use this program to \ndelineate the two political parties. I welcome this challenge because I \nbelieve the American people just repudiated the approach exemplified by \nthe AmeriCorps Program. Just as they did not want to have a top-down \nbureaucratic solution on health care reform, they cannot fathom the \nsame approach to voluntarism.\n  The American people do not want Government to make their moral \nchoices for them. They do not want Government telling them for whom \nthey should and should not volunteer, and they certainly can see \nthrough the rather thinly veiled attempt to subvert voluntarism by \npaying for it rather than using moral suasion.\n  Mr. President, I have received much data already from AmeriCorps \npertaining to their grants. That data only further fuels my skepticism. \nI have also asked the General Accounting Office to independently \nanalyze and evaluate the program. I will await their report this spring \nuntil I render a final judgment about the program.\n  But I must say, the celestial bodies seem to be aligned against the \nprogram, and the American people are against the approach embodied \nhere. The administration would do better to more accurately apply the \nprinciples of reinventing Government to this concept. Rather than \nbureaucratizing and rather than drawing a line in the sand, we can be \nworking together to make voluntarism work the way it has--and quite \neffectively and quite amazingly--since the earliest days of the \nRepublic.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/17/senate-section/article/S975-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I am wondering if I could engage the managers in \nsome colloquy and dialog as to how this bill will function in the real \nworld. There are some real problems in terms of the process.\n  This bill is different from last year's bill. First, I want to make \nsure that our colleagues are aware of the fact that this is not Senate \nbill No. 993. There is a new point of order which is incorporated in \nthis bill which is going to have some very serious ramifications in the \nway we function around here.\n  I am somebody who voted for last year's bill. I would like to vote \nfor this year's bill. I came out of local office. I was in local \ngovernment for 8 years. I understand the impact of unfunded mandates. I \nbelieve we have to do more than what we have done and that last year's \nbill was about the right balance to accomplish a greater awareness on \nour part to create a point of order in order to ensure that we would \nhave an estimate before us. But this year's bill goes significantly \nbeyond that. And that point of order in this year's bill is frequently \nan impossibility.\n  We are building into the structure here something which, at times, \ncannot be accomplished. The Congressional Budget Office has told us \nthat. They have written to us that it is impossible, or nearly \nimpossible, to make estimates as to the cost of mandates 5 or 10 years \ndown the road on State and local government. They just simply cannot do \nit.\n  This bill says that on every bill and amendment--not just every bill, \nbut every amendment--that comes to the floor, it will not be in order \neven to offer the amendment, or to offer the bill, unless there is an \nestimate in that amendment and in that bill which we know, going in, \ncannot be made at times. We know it. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas told us.\n  We can all close our eyes around here and pretend that these \nestimates can be made all the time. We know they can be made some of \nthe time. By the way, it is current law that the Congressional Budget \nOffice make these estimates whenever they can, whenever feasible. They \nhave been making estimates for the last 10 years. They have made \nhundreds of estimates at the cost of these mandates on local and State \ngovernment. I do not know how many times folks around here have looked \nat those estimates. But they have made hundreds of them. It is not new, \nattempting to make the estimate.\n  What is new in this bill is that there is so much that hangs on that \nestimate for the first time. A point of order will be available. It \nwill be out of order to offer an amendment on this floor that does not \ncontain an estimate. What happens if you cannot get the estimate? What \nhappens if you just cannot get the estimate, or the Congressional \nBudget Office cannot make an estimate? Can they tell us they cannot \nmake an estimate? Oh, no; they cannot tell us they cannot make an \nestimate.\n  If it were in the private sector, they can tell us. If this were a \nmandate that applied to the private sector, the bill says, yes, then \nthey can tell us that they cannot do the estimate. But when it comes to \nthe intergovernmental sector, to the State and local government, if the \nCongressional Budget Office cannot make the estimate, they are not \nallowed to tell us.\n  But the point of order still lies. You cannot offer an amendment \nunless it contains an estimate, and we know going in--I think each one \nof us knows--that there will be times when an estimate cannot be made \nof the cost of something 5 or 10 years down the road on 87,000 local \njurisdictions.\n  We have to spend some time on this mechanism. This is too serious a \nchange. This was not in last year's bill.\n  This year's bill, in Governmental Affairs, at least, was offered on a \nWednesday night. This was filed on a Wednesday night. The hearing was \non a Thursday, and the markup was scheduled for Friday. Well, we \nresisted, some of us, and said, ``There just isn't enough time. Can you \nat least give us a few more days on the markup?'' We fought for that \nand got a markup on a Monday.\n  We asked for a committee report. No, that was denied on a party line \nvote. We could not get a committee report in Governmental Affairs on \nthe Monday markup. So we did not have a committee report. And then we \nhad to delay consideration here using whatever means were available to \nus until we could at least get a committee report.\n  The same process in the Budget Committee. A request for a committee \nreport. No effort to try to defeat this bill. Most of us are cosponsors \nof this bill. I think this bill has something like 60 or 70 cosponsors. \nMost of us, maybe 80 of us, would like to vote for this bill. This is \nnot an effort to kill a bill. This is an effort to produce a bill that \nis workable, that has a decent balance in it that we can live with on \nthe floor.\n  As I said, I cosponsored the bill last year. But this is a different \nbill this year, and it has a mechanism in it which is potentially going \nto create havoc for us, which we are either going to have to ignore, \nwhich no one should want to put in place. We do not want a point of \norder that is constantly ignored around here or it is going to have so \nmuch bite it is going to strangle this process. ``I send an amendment \nto the desk.'' Someone jumps up, ``Point of order. It does not contain \nthe language that says that local and State governments will not have \nto comply with the mandate.'' ``There is no mandate in this \namendment.'' ``Yes, there is.'' ``No, there isn't.''\n  Is the Parliamentarian going to decide whether there is a mandate? \nAnd then who is going to decide how much that mandate costs 5 or 10 \nyears down the road? Is that just going to be decided here at 8 o'clock \nat night after an \n[[Page S977]]  amendment is sent to the desk, how much it will cost \n87,000 jurisdictions 5 years from now? Are we seriously legislating \nwhen we put into place a point of order like that?\n  No provision for saying that they cannot make an estimate when we \nknow full well they cannot. What about a range? Can we get a range? \nWell, some say yes, some say no. Some say this bill will allow for a \nrange; some say it will not. What happens if it does? What happens if \nthe CBO throws up its hands and says, ``You are asking us to figure \nwhat this will cost 87,000 local jurisdiction 5 years down the line. We \nsay it will cost somewhere between $1 and $500 million. That is the \nbest we can do.''\n  Well, now you have to have an estimate in a specific amount and you \nhave to pay for it or you have to waive it as to local government, \nState government. Or you have to say, in order to avoid the point of \norder, if the Appropriations Committee 5 or 10 years down the line does \nnot appropriate what you estimate today or what CBO estimates today, \nthen it will be ineffective at that time.\n  We are building in a nightmare for ourselves. We have to try to solve \nthe problem for State and local governments, and we can, I believe. We \ncan force a greater awareness upon ourselves as to what they go through \nwhen we adopt a mandate. But we just cannot simply here, without \nspending some time on how a point of order would work such as has been \nconstructed in this bill, unlike last year's bill, we cannot simply put \nourselves into a potential grinder here where we have to ignore a point \nof order, routinely ignore it.\n  Since this is 50-vote point of order, some people say, ``Well, you \ncan just vote down the point of order.'' Well, we do not want to put \nourselves, on amendment after amendment after amendment, where a point \nof order lies because the amendment does not contain those words which \nare required, either ignoring it routinely or having this thing that \nhas so much force that we are in a straitjacket. We have to be able to \nlegislate.\n  Should we force ourselves in some way to consider what the costs are? \nYes, I would like to do that. I used to have to live with these \nmandates. For 8 years in local government in Detroit, I had to live \nwith these mandates.\n  One of the reasons I came to this town was because I was so upset \nwith Federal mandates and the way Federal programs were operating. That \nwas one of the reasons I ran for the Senate. I understand local \nofficials and Governors who have to deal with what we do.\n  So we have tried in the last few years to put estimates into law and \ninto the committee reports. We have required CBO to come up with \nestimates. And CBO has tried, with bills, at least, reported out of \ncommittee, to come up with estimates. Sometimes they cannot do it. They \nare unable to tells us. They just cannot do it. But we will not let \nthem do it here on the intergovernmental mandates. We will not let them \nbe honest. We are adding to the bills as they come to the floor a \nrequirement that that same estimate in a specific amount be made by the \nCBO on every amendment that comes to the floor.\n  So, Madam President, what I would like to do, and before I go \nfurther, let me just commend the managers and the sponsors of this \nbill. While I have problems with certain aspects of the new bill, I \nmust say they have been steadfast in their determination that we do a \nlot better to force ourselves to consider the costs of these mandates \non State and local and tribal governments.\n  And while I have some disagreements with the new bill, I must say \nthat they deserve a tremendous amount of credit and thanks of this \nSenate and of this country for keeping the issue before us. It is an \nimportant issue. And no one that I know of is trying to sink this bill. \nA number of people are trying to make this bill look more like last \nyear's bill in terms of the balance that was struck, and that is going \nto take some time and I think legitimately should take some time of the \nSenate.\n  This bill simply goes too far. Unlike last year's bill, which had a \npoint of order if there was no estimate and if the estimated amount was \nnot authorized. This year's bill, in effect, requires that you either \nfund it or put language in your authorization bill which will direct \nthe agency to ignore it for State and local governments unless the \nappropriators downstream put in the amount of money which the estimates \nindicate will be required for State or local governments.\n  Now, there is a very basic philosophical issue. What about cases \nwhere you have businesses competing with local government? My friend \nfrom Kentucky just mentioned the word ``business,'' which raises a very \nimportant point that I want to address. And I am not sure it is exactly \nthe same point that crossed his mind, but there is a very significant \nissue here.\n  You have two incinerators that are competing for the same business. \nYou have a government-run incinerator and you have a privately run \nincinerator. Do we want to imply or suggest that there will be a \nmandate that is either not applied to the government-run incinerator--\non clean air for instance, a new clean air requirement--but it will be \napplied to the private incinerator? Do we want to create a presumption \nthat when you have business competition between a private and public \nfacility such as that, be it an incinerator or a hospital, that we are \ngoing to apply a new mandate to the private sector but not to the \npublic sector?\n Is that the assumption we want to make? Is that the presumption we \nwant to create?\n\n  That, I believe, creates a real problem. This is real, folks. We have \nprivate and public hospitals all the time. Are we saying that there \nwill be a presumption that a new increase in the minimum wage will \napply to the private hospital but not to the public hospital? Is that \nthe message we want to send? Should we consider the impact on the \npublic? Of course. Should we consider the impact on both public and \nprivate? I believe we should.\n  I hope that this bill will succeed in another one of its purposes, \nwhich is to get Members to look at the impact on the private sector, as \nwell as on the public sector. That is one of the purposes of this bill.\n  This bill goes beyond that when it comes to the public sector. On the \npublic sector, it creates this point of order that I just described, a \npoint of order which does not exist relative to the private sector. I \nthink there is a serious problem, philosophically, which is raised when \nwe do that in areas where we have competition, where the greater impact \nof a mandate is on the private rather than on the public.\n  It seems to me that we have a serious issue philosophically as to \nwhether we want to create the expectation that this mandate is going to \nbe waived or paid for when it comes to that public incinerator or to \nthe public hospital, but not going to be waived or paid for when it \ncomes to that private incinerator or that private hospital.\n  What I would like to do, if I could, with my friends from Idaho and \nOhio, is to take a hypothetical case and walk through the steps. What I \nhave done is just set forth a hypothetical Senate bill. I believe I \nhave given a copy of this description to each Senator so they can have \nit in front of them. This hypothetical bill mandates controls on \ndangerous levels of mercury from incinerator emission after October 1, \n2005. That is the bill. It also designates the EPA to determine what \nconstitutes a mercury level dangerous to human health.\n  I would like to focus on that hypothetical and ask a number of \nquestions of the managers. First of all, what is the effective date of \nthat mandate? Now, the reason that that becomes critical is that that \ntriggers the estimate, the estimate upon which so much hangs--including \na point of order--the estimated cost to State and local governments in \nthe first fiscal year after a mandate is effective, and in each of the \n4 fiscal years thereafter.\n  So the first question I would like to ask the Senators from Idaho and \nOhio is, what is the effective date of that mandate?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, will the Senator repeat the last part \nof the precise question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am sorry, I did not give a copy of this \nto my friend from New Mexico. Let me get this to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, Members may engage \nin a colloquy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n   [[Page S978]] Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, \nthen, that I be allowed to engage in a colloquy with the managers \nrelative to the way in which this bill would be implemented, without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, in response, first a few points.\n  I appreciate the fact that both the chairman of the Budget Committee \nand the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee are here. I \nthink what is most important, as the Senator from Michigan poses these \nquestions, is that either myself, the ranking member on Governmental \nAffairs, the Senator from Ohio, or the two chairmen respond to that so \nwe can lay this issue out there.\n  Also, a couple of other points I will make, because the Senator from \nMichigan gave a bit of an overview. One of the points that was stated \nis what if CBO simply cannot estimate this? What if we cannot come to \nterms with it?\n  The alternative, then, is that we will continue the process we now \nhave, which is we do not require this information and we do not really \nmake the effort. So we want to have as much information as possible \nbefore the vote, instead of after the vote, so that if at some future \npoint we know the impact to local or State government after the fact, \nthen we do the calculation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I wonder if my friend will yield on that \npoint.\n  We do require such a calculation now. We have had something like 850 \nof those calculations, I think, in the last 12 years. There is a law, \nthe Congressional Budget Act, which requires the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office, to the extent practicable--very important \nwords, to the extent practicable--to prepare for each bill or \nresolution an estimate of the cost, which would be everything incurred \nby State or local governments.\n  We do currently require these estimates. Now, sometimes, those \nestimates cannot be made. We have gotten a report from the \nCongressional Budget Office that they cannot make the estimate at \ntimes. They just simply cannot estimate. They say it. When they cannot \nestimate it, they say they cannot estimate it.\n  What this bill does, is say, ``You have to estimate.''\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, if I may, to continue our \ndiscussion; yes, we do ask CBO to make an estimation. The Senator is \ncorrect. Since about 1981, CBO has been required to do some estimating. \nThey have begun to build some years of information that will help them, \nI think, in making future estimates.\n  Now, in the event that CBO undertakes to accomplish what is required \nin this bill, to estimate the cost of the mandate, we asked them to \nmake that effort. If they come back and their report says, ``We are \nunable to do so for these reasons,'' then they have fulfilled their \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. LEVIN. With an intergovernmental mandate.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. With an intergovernmental mandate. If they simply \ncannot--but they must make the effort. That is the point.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, that is not the way I read this \nbill, because this bill explicitly permits in the private sector that \nstatement. But there is no such explicit permission to make that \nstatement with the intergovernmental sector.\n  As a matter of fact, I believe the committee report explicitly notes \nthe difference. I think the Budget Committee report explicitly takes \nnote of the fact that in the private sector, we do permit the Director \nof the CBO to say that he cannot make the estimate.\n  On page 20, line 24, of the bill, it says:\n\n       If the Director determines that it is not feasible to make \n     a reasonable estimate that would be required, the Director \n     shall not make the estimate but shall report in the statement \n     that the reasonable estimate cannot be made and shall include \n     the reasons for the determination in the statement.\n\n  That is referring to ``private sector mandates,'' subsection B. That \nprovision is explicitly part of the private mandates section. When it \ncomes to the intergovernmental mandates, there is no such language \nwhich allows the Director to be honest. We have an honesty provision \nwhen it comes to the private sector. We say, ``If you cannot do it, you \ncan tell us,'' but when it comes to the intergovernmental sector, there \nis no such language.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Again, Senator, that is correct. We require, on an \nintergovernmental, that there not be an estimate. But in going through \nthat process, it may be that the conclusion of that estimate is that \nthey just cannot provide the data that we are after.\n  So, Senator, because of the process, there is a waiver. That may be \nthe rationale, the justification, to come to the floor and to seek a \nwaiver of that point of order.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Why, then, do we not have the same language on the \nintergovernmental as we do on the private?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. If there is no estimate for CBO, the Chair will have \nno alternative but to rule that the point of order will not lie, \nbecause there would be nothing upon which to base a decision.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But the question is, if we allow for the fact that a \ndirector in the private sector is unable to make the estimate, why do \nwe not have the same language relative to the intergovernmental \nmandates? Why not the same honesty? Why not the same honesty allowance \nrelative to the intergovernmental mandate as we have in the private \nsector? Why that distinction in the bill?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for an observation?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Sure.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, first of all, I want to say to my good \nfriend, who is managing the bill, I would very much like to be here for \nthe whole dialog. I am not sure I can. I have to leave for a little \nwhile, but I will just address this one this way.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could interrupt, I will be happy to try to schedule \nthis to accommodate my friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, if \nthat would be helpful. Please just let us know and we can try to \nschedule this.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am one who has been preaching reform measures around \nhere that the Senate floor ought to come first, and here I am telling \nthe Senate that I have something else that, obviously, is more \nimportant. But I already had these appointments, and I cannot get out \nof them.\n  Let me just answer the precise question and then try to come back \nhere.\n  I say to both Senators and the managers, if there is something \nfurther that I might accomplish later on, I will come down again and I \nwill go back through the Record and answer them as I see them.\n  First of all, let me suggest, on your last question about why in one \nsection and not in the other, with reference to the impossibility of \ndoing it, we have 11 years, my staff tells me, of experience in \nestimating the cost of public mandates. We do not have any experience \nin estimating the cost of private sector mandates, to speak of. That \nmeans that clearly the Congressional Budget Office, which has to gear \nup for this entire episode, both public and private--we know it is \ngoing to take some additional money, but we also know it is going to \ntake brand-new staff, and we are fully aware, while we are cutting \neverything, that has to go up a little. We need to give some latitude \non the private end because we have not done it, and we follow up and \nsay since we have been doing it on the public we ought to be able to.\n  Let me proceed and take your specific statute and just give a few \nobservations. Frankly, while I understand we have passed environmental \nlaws in the past that are even harder to estimate than this, because we \nleave to the EPA or some other department almost full latitude, I am \nadvised that probably the way the Congressional Budget Office would \nhandle this--this is from people who have been there and are \nexperienced. I went and called when the Senator from Michigan started \nasking questions--they would get in touch with each other and maybe \neven visit and talk about this mandate. The Environmental Protection \nAgency would hopefully give every bit of information they have as to \nthe parameters of this mercury level. It is apt to be here or at least \ngive them something to work with. Then they would probably take that, \nin terms of that level and they would give us the best estimate they \ncould with reference to maybe either of two levels, but we would get \nsomething.\n   [[Page S979]] If they said it is absolutely impossible, then it \nappears to me that we cannot ask for anything more, and one of two \nthings will happen: Either what the distinguished manager has said, \nthat the Chair would rule that a point of order cannot be made against \nit, or the point of order could be made and waived on the basis that we \ndo not know.\n  But let me suggest that there might be a third thing that could \nhappen. It may very well be that the looseness with which we delegate \nmight be tightened up somewhat. I am not suggesting that a bill with \nthat in it is wrong, but I am suggesting that if this bill is saying to \nthe American people, ``We want to honestly tell you the cost before we \npass it to the maximum extent,'' then we may be finding that we have to \nget more clarity in the legislation that passes so it can be evaluated \nmore properly.\n  I thank the Senator, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I certainly agree with the third point that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico made. Let me go back to the first point, the fact we \nhave had experience with these estimates. This is not new, making \nestimates on intergovernmental mandates. We have had hundreds of them. \nWe are required by current law. What we have never done is hung a point \nof order on it the way this bill does when it is impossible, in some \ncases--and we know it will be--to make the estimate.\n  This is the experience of the Congressional Budget Office. Based on \ntheir experience in intergovernmental mandates, they have told us it is \nimpossible sometimes to make these estimates. That is on a bill where \nthey are being given a bill in advance of consideration of the floor. \nMultiply that by 100 times when it comes to amendments, because this \ncurrent bill, S. 1, does not just cover bills that come to the floor, \nit covers amendments.\n  I believe if we are going to be straight with ourselves, we have to \nacknowledge two things: That with this experience that the \nCongressional Budget Office has in making estimates, they are telling \nus there are times when they cannot make estimates on intergovernmental \nmandates. That is based on their experience.\n  Second, I think if we are being straight with ourselves and with this \nprocess, we are going to have to acknowledge that there is no way that \nwhen you include all amendments under this point of order process that \nwe are going to be able, with any intellectual accuracy, to get an \nestimate of the cost of every amendment and its mandate which is \noffered here so it can be properly considered.\n  Every amendment is subject to a point of order. The language of the \nbill is it will not be in order to offer a bill or an amendment unless \ncertain language exists in that amendment, unless there is an estimate \nof the cost of an intergovernmental mandate in that estimate.\n  There are a number of questions: Can I even get an estimate as an \nindividual Member of the Senate so I can offer my amendment? There is \nno provision for an individual Senator to get an estimate. The way I \nread this, the only estimates that are required by the Congressional \nBudget Office are estimates after a bill is marked up in committee and \nis sent to the floor. The chairman and ranking members of committees \ncan also seek estimates, as I read the bill. But there is no provision \nin this bill which gives me any assurance as an individual Member, or \nit gives 100 of us an assurance that we can even get the estimate, and \nif we do not get the estimate, a point of order lies.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield. I will just conclude this point.\n  What this bill requires us to do, unlike last year's bill, is to get \nan estimate which at times we know is impossible to make from the \nexperience of CBO, even on a bill, and we know it is even more \nimpossible on more amendments to get. There is no provision in the bill \nthat we even have standing as individual Members of the Senate to \nobtain the estimate, in any event, since the only ones that seem in the \nbill to be guaranteed that estimate from the CBO would be bills that \ncome to the floor that have been approved by committees and, to the \nextent practicable, Chairs and ranking members of committees.\n  I will be happy to yield. I do want to go back, however, to my first \nquestion, which is, what is the effective date of the mandate in this \nhypothetical that I have given? And again, so that we are all working \nfrom the same hypothetical, it mandates reductions of dangerous levels \nof mercury from incinerator emissions after October 1, 2005, and the \nEPA is designated to determine what constitutes a mercury level \ndangerous to human health.\n  My specific question is, What is the effective date of that mandate \nsince that is what triggers the estimate? It is critical that we know \nthe effective date because that is when the 5 fiscal year estimates \nbegin.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. We are calculating that so we can respond to that \nspecifically.\n  I also, though, want to respond to the point that we are creating \nsomething unusual, we are creating--I do not know what terms were \nused--but suddenly we are going to make this very difficult for \nlegislation to proceed or for amendments.\n  If I may, I think this is important. Yes, S. 1 establishes a new \npoint of order under the Budget Act against incineration mandate \nlegislation in the Senate unless the mandate is paid for. I believe \nstrongly in that. So do local and State governments and tribal \ngovernments. The point of order--this applies to all legislation \nincluding bills, joint resolutions, amendments, motions or conference \nreports and can be waived by majority vote. It is a process.\n  This point of order and the Budget Committee's role in its \nenforcement are modeled after similar provisions in the 1974 Budget \nAct. The language in S. 1, and I think this is very important, applying \nthe mandate point of order to amendments, is identical--identical to \nlanguage in the Budget Act. Madam President, 21 separate provisions of \nthe Budget Act provide a point of order in the Senate against \nconsideration of amendments; five of these provisions establish points \nof order that only apply to amendments.\n  This is not new ground. This is not something unprecedented. Madam \nPresident, 21 separate provisions have a point of order. The Senate, \nthe Senate Parliamentarian's office, the budget committees, have 20 \nyears of experience with these Budget Act points of order and their \napplication to amendments.\n  In practice, the Senate Budget Committee staff monitors legislation, \nworks with the Parliamentarian's office to determine violations, and \nworks with CBO to provide the Parliamentarian's office with estimates \nto determine whether legislation would violate the Budget Act. In \ninstances where the press of Senate business does not allow CBO \nsufficient time to prepare such estimates, the Senate Budget Committee \nis called on to provide them. Regardless of what estimate is used, the \nSenate is the final arbiter of its rules, that is the rules of the \nSenate. Should a Senator disagree with the estimate, he or she could \nappeal the ruling of the Chair. But as these amendments are brought \nforward, the burden of proof that they exceed--in case of \nintergovernmental, a $50 million threshold--that burden of proof lies \nwith the Senator who would make the point of order.\n  You can bring your amendment to the floor of the Senate without \nhaving had it scored by CBO. But, in all reality, it just seems to me \nand it seems to a lot of other folks that if you have an amendment that \nis somehow close to this threshold, it makes sense that you would call \nand get CBO to give you an estimate of the cost, or that you would work \nwith the Budget Committee because soon we would be voting on that \namendment.\n  Are we saying that because we may want to take a few minutes to call \nand get that estimate that we should not do that because the hour is \nlate? And it is a multimillion-dollar decision that we are going to \ncast votes on, and the implications that it would have?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am saying quite the opposite, if the Senator would \nyield. Quite the opposite.\n  It is worth getting an estimate. It is worth getting an honest \nestimate. And \n[[Page S980]] there is no way that in a few minutes, or in a few \nhours--indeed in a few days, if you listen to the Congressional Budget \nOffice--that you can get an estimate of the cost of a mandate on 87,000 \njurisdictions. Of course we have points of order in the Budget Act. \nThey have to do with levels of Federal spending of the Federal \nGovernment. What is new here is that a new point of order is going to \nbe created, unless you have an estimate in a specific dollar amount of \nthe cost. It could be years away--on 87,000 State and local units of \ngovernment. That is very new.\n   Is it worth getting? Of course it is worth getting, if you can. But \nyou say you can bring an amendment to the floor even without an \nestimate. The way I read the bill: ``It shall not be in order in the \nSenate to consider''--and then the words are ``any bill, joint \nresolution, amendment, motion, or conference report.''\n  It is not in order for the Senate to consider those.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I am sorry. If I could just complete that thought. It \nis not self-executing.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Someone could raise a point of order.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Someone could raise a point of order but you could \nallow amendments in a given event without anybody making that point \norder.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is that the intent of the Senator, that a point of order \nnot be raised when an estimate is not present?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I think I have made it clear. I think it is a \nresponsible thing. But if you are going to offer a multibillion-dollar \namendment, certainly that did not just come to mind that night. \nCertainly you have talked with either the Budget Committee or CBO.\n  But, again, it is not self-executing. That would be the basis that a \nruling could be made that the point of order lies. Then you could seek \nthe waiver.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think we are in a way on the same wavelength because I \nthink it is important that we get honest estimates, too. My question \nis, If the CBO cannot estimate it--cannot estimate it, it is still out \nof order.\n  Let me put it a different way. If the CBO cannot estimate it--it is \ntough. They have to. Because you do not have the language on the \nintergovernmental side that you do on the private side that allows them \nto say they cannot make the estimate. You could still keep your point \nof order, because there is no estimate that meets your test. But what \nyou do not do in this bill, for the intergovernmental sector, is to \nallow the CBO to be honest the way you do in the private sector.\n  We tried this amendment in conference, to simply say if the CBO \ncannot make the estimate in the--excuse me. We offered an amendment in \nmarkup, where we said if the CBO cannot make the estimate--which has \nbeen true in many cases before--that they should be allowed to say so \non the intergovernmental side, the same as they are allowed to do on \nthe private side, so we can know that.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield. This may be something where we \nhave asked weeks in advance, by the way, not just minutes in advance, \nweeks or months in advance, assuming we can get answers as individual \nSenators from the CBO, which we have no right to do in this bill.\n  But assuming we could get an answer from the CBO, they may tell us \nthey cannot make this estimate. We have been diligent. We have tried \nfor weeks and weeks and weeks and months to get an estimate and cannot \nget it because they say there is no way they can make this estimate for \nvarious reasons. It may be that the EPA is going to determine a level \nafter a public hearing, notice and comment, as to what an unsafe level \nof mercury is. And they are not willing to say in advance of a public \nhearing and comment what that unsafe level of mercury is. And the CBO \ncomes back to us and says we cannot make this estimate.\n  Why not allow them to say that in the intergovernmental side the way \nwe allow them on the private side? The Senator from New Mexico says \nthey have more experience on the intergovernmental side. That works \nexactly the opposite way because their experience tells them they \ncannot do it in some cases. Why not let them say it? We offered an \namendment in committee to allow them to say it, allow them to be honest \non the intergovernmental side the way we do on the private mandate. But \nthat was defeated.\n  So, I think it is a matter of just honesty, frankly, in legislating, \nto allow the CBO to say what we all know is true. That there are times \nthat, even with a lot of notice, they cannot estimate the cost of \nintergovernmental mandate the way they cannot do a private mandate. I \nwill be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, If the Senator will yield, I think, \nbacking up the Senator from Michigan, I would have to say, in law--\nwhether being misconstrued or not--but to leave any doubt that CBO can \nsay there are things we cannot score, there are things we do not know \nthe answers to, there are things we cannot make estimates on, and they \nsay that--and to say, ``but you have to whether you can or not,'' or \nsomething is not going to apply on the floor here, I think is the \nheight of folly. I do not see the point of this, in trying to say if \nyou cannot make an estimate that you have to anyway.\n  What is the worst thing that happens if we say OK, we recognize the \nfact that you cannot make an estimate and if the CBO, with all their \nexpertise cannot, I am not going to say that the Budget Committee is \ngoing to be any more able to do some of these things? There will be \noccasions where the Budget Committee also will say CBO could not and we \ncannot either.\n  Does that say that a bill cannot come to the floor? No. I will tell \nyou what it says. It says we will not have the waiver and the point of \norder and the waiver vote on it. But the worst that happens is a bill \ncomes to the floor like it does now. We say, Here is what we think, and \ndebate it, and we pass it or we do not pass it. But to say that a bill \nthat CBO has considered and the Budget Committee has considered and say \nthere is no estimate we can possibly make on this just by the nature of \nit--we already have a letter from CBO saying that would be the case \nsometimes--but to say you have to have one no matter what or you cannot \nbring a bill to the floor sort of seems to me a little bit ludicrous.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have just been called by the leader, so I am leaving. \nBut I wanted to make an observation, and then I will come back. If you \nwant to come, you and I, sometime to further clarify, I will be here.\n  First of all, everybody should know that since the Budget Act has \nbeen in existence--how many years?--20 years, this same puzzle has been \nthere. Some things cannot be estimated--very difficult to do it, I \nshould say. Amendments are hard to examine. I give you the best example \nof just forcing it to work. That is health care. The Senator spoke of \nhow many thousands of jurisdictions? About 87,000 would be affected. We \nhad millions in health care. We never took up an amendment without an \nestimate. In our debate some things had to wait awhile. Some amendments \nhad to be set aside. CBO had to beef up. They had to ask for lots of \nhelp.\n  I think those of us who are looking at the effect of mandates on the \nFederal Government versus the States in terms of governance and a lot \nof other things are saying times must change, we have to find a system. \nThis system is not perfect, but let me suggest that if the Senate \ndesires in the future to offer a bill or an amendment that is so tough \nto estimate that as hard as we try somebody comes down here and says, \n``Senators, that is it,'' what it will permit is for the U.S. Senate to \nwork its will, not this bill. The Senate will then have before it what \nis probably an onerous mandate. If it is not very onerous on its face, \nnobody would ever be worried about it. So you probably will have an \nonerous mandate. It is going to cost a lot of money. And the Senate \nwill be put to the test. Do you want to pass it anyway? That is by a \nsimple majority. Or do you want to say something different for a \nchange, and you probably, in living up to the spirit of this, will do \nsomething different for a change. You will probably say we are not \ngoing to pass this. I would think that is one alternative. We have to \nget some better way to define what we are \n[[Page S981]] trying to do. Or you might find another way. You might \npass it and put an amendment in that 3 years from now we will come back \nto the floor because by then we ought to have mandates and it still \nwill not be in effect. Then we will pass on that.\n  In other words, we will make the kind of senatorial, in the Senate, \non-the-floor changes to accommodate. But it will be an accommodation to \na very, very different set of precepts--which I believe my friend \nagrees with--precepts of getting it done if you can, not hanging them \nout there without anything about them, if you can do other business. I \nthink he agrees with that. I think that is what this process is going \nto yield. It has been tried a long time.\n  Sometimes it is very befuddling when we try to use a point of order. \nBut I also say that those who want to amend the 51-vote point of order \nto 60, there is another example why whoever crafted it crafted it well \nbecause a point of order is a majority vote, not a 60-vote point of \norder. That clearly makes the U.S. Senate work its will on the kind of \ncases you are describing which are brought up by this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield on that point, it is fine for \nthe Senate to work its will, but it ought to have an estimate in front \nof it, if it is feasible, which is reasonably accurate when it works \nits will because a point of order is hanging on this unlike any point \nof order in the Budget Act. This point of order does not relate to \nFederal spending and the level thereof. It relates to what it would \ncost 87,000 jurisdictions. This is a different kind of an animal from \nanything that we have ever had in the Budget Act, No. 1.\n  No. 2, I think here my friend would agree with me. If the Senate is \nexpected to work its will on waiving the point of order--and both the \nSenator from Idaho and the Senator from Ohio are absolutely correct; \nthis is not a no money/no mandate. This says under some circumstances, \nif there is no money, there will be no mandate.\n  But what is unique about this is that you are not allowing in this \nbill the Congressional Budget Office to say that you cannot make the \nestimate. We do it in the bill for the private sector. We do it in the \nbill for the private sector, but it does not allow the CBO to be \nhonest. Why not allow the CBO to be honest when it comes to the \nintergovernmental mandate?\n  It is true, we still have a 50-vote point of order. If they say they \ncannot make the mandate, that point of order still lies. But now you \nhave something that you can be aware of. The CBO says it is impossible \nto estimate the cost of that mandate and why. That may cause some \npeople to vote no. I think my friend from New Mexico is right. A lot of \npeople will vote ``no'' if the CBO says it is impossible to estimate \nthe cost. It may on the other hand cause other people to vote to waive \nthe point of order because there had been an honest effort made to get \nthe estimate and it is simply impossible; it is too far out. It depends \nupon agency determination to have closed rulemaking.\n  My question is why not allow honesty on the part of the CBO and, if \nthey cannot make an estimate, to say so in the intergovernmental \nmandate the way we do in the private mandate? We being the bill. If the \nbill says, CBO, be honest, if you cannot estimate the cost in the \nprivate sector, tell us for whatever impact that has on the Senate \nfloor, that may cause some of us to vote no on the whole bill. That may \ncause others to vote ``yes.'' We do not know the impact of that \ninformation. But we do know that, when it comes to the private sector, \nwe allow the CBO to tell us if they cannot make the estimate, but when \nit comes to the intergovernmental side, there is no such authority to \nCBO; you must make an estimate. And I want the Senate to work its will. \nBut I want it to work its will on the basis of information which is \nsolid. If we are going to force the CBO to make an estimate when they \ncannot make an estimate, we are going to be getting bum information \nfrom the CBO. They are going to take wild, out-of-the-blue guesses as \nto what this thing costs. In order to comply with the law, they must \nmake an estimate.\n  Is that legislating in the light? Is that legislating knowing the \ncost of estimates? No; what that is saying is we are going to go \nthrough a formalistic process forcing the CBO to do something which \nthey have told us at times they cannot do, and somehow or other we are \ngoing to feel better if we therefore now know the estimated cost of a \nmandate on State and local government. Do we really feel then that we \nnow have information which is usable to us, that we can make a decision \nbased on information because we have forced the CBO to do something \nthat they have told us at times they cannot do? So what happens if they \ncome up with a range? They just throw up their hands. This will cost \nfrom $1 million to $500 million. That is their estimate.\n  By the way, it is unclear that they can even give us a range. But to \nthe extent that they are allowed to give us a range--again it is very \nunclear in the bill. We get two different answers on that question. But \nassuming they are allowed to give us a range, is that helpful to us? \nThis will be from $1 million to $500 million. Now, are we really \nlegislating knowing the impact on local government? That does not tell \nus anything. What level does the appropriations have to reach in order \nto avoid the requirements of this bill? Is it the $1 million or the \n$500 million? Is it a range?\n  So, again, I agree with what this bill is trying to do. I think last \nyear's bill did it. Last year's bill had the support of all the \nGovernors, by the way. This year's bill has even stronger support of \nthe Governors, I am sure. But the Governors association and local \ngovernments supported last year's bill where we did not have this point \nof order that we have in this year's bill. We had the estimates. We had \na requirement that they get an estimate.\n But we did not say that a point of order would lie, unless there is an \nestimate in a specific amount with certain ramifications.\n\n  I know my friend from Delaware is the chairman of the committee, and \nhe has been attempting to get the floor. I certainly do not want to, in \nany way, control the floor. I am in the middle of a colloquy, with the \nunanimous consent of the body, with the manager of the bill. I will be \nhappy to either yield further, or whatever it requires, to allow the \nSenator from Delaware to get a question in here.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I say to my distinguished friend and \ncolleague, if he will yield without his losing the floor, it does seem \nin a very real way to me that you are comparing apples and oranges. The \nreason I say that is that in the case of a mandate being imposed on the \npublic sector, then it is the rule or the general requirement of this \nlegislation that funds be provided to finance it.\n  On the other hand, in the case of the private sector, while they are \nasking that an estimate be made, if there is no estimate, there is no \nrequirement that funds be provided. So there is a very real difference \nbetween the public sector and the private sector.\n  I do not think there is anything being said that says the \nCongressional----\n  Mr. LEVIN. If my friend will yield----\n  Mr. ROTH. If I may finish. What we are saying is that in the case of \na mandate on the public sector, it is the general rule that either \nfunds be made available to finance it, or a waiver be obtained. So \nthere is a very real difference in the policy between the two \nsituations.\n  But I do not think anything is being said that the Congressional \nBudget Office cannot come back and say: We cannot make an estimate. But \nif they come back and say they cannot make an estimate, and it is a \nmandate on the public sector, then I, as author of that legislation or \nthat amendment, either have to clarify the amendment so an estimate can \nbe made, or I have to make sure that funds are provided. Or the third \noption is, of course, to get a waiver.\n  So it seems to me we are hanging up on whether or not the CBO, in the \none case, can say it cannot make an estimate. If it cannot make an \nestimate, then we have those three options. Otherwise, we cannot move \nahead. In the case of the private sector, we can still move ahead \nbecause the legislation does not require funding.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the point the chairman makes, it seems to \nme, cuts exactly the opposite way. Since an appropriation is hanging on \nthe estimate when it comes to the intergovernmental money, it seems to \nme that is more of a reason that estimate should be accurate.\n   [[Page S982]] We should not force the CBO to make wild guesstimates \nin order to comply with the requirement. They have told us over and \nover again that there are times when they cannot make estimates. But \nthis bill says, ``Tough.'' That is what you are basically telling the \nCBO when it comes to the intergovernmental estimate: Make it anyway.\n  Mr. ROTH. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes, I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. ROTH. What I am saying is, if the Congressional Budget Office--in \neither situation, whether it involves the private or public sector--can \nmake the statement that it cannot make an accurate estimate----\n  Mr. LEVIN. I beg to differ with the chairman, because the bill \nexplicitly says----\n  Mr. ROTH. Where does it forbid CBO, in the case of the public sector, \nfrom coming back and advising the author or authorizing committee that \nit cannot make an estimate? What this legislation----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Here is where it does it, if I may tell you.\n  Mr. ROTH. I will make one further statement, and then yield back to \nthe Senator who has the floor.\n  What we are saying in that situation is that, as a general rule, \nwhoever is authorizing the legislation should clarify it so that an \nestimate can be made. What we are really trying to provide and really \nrequire is a reasonable estimate so that when Congress acts, it knows \nwhat it is acting on. That is the whole intent, as I understand this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, it is a very good intent. We have a \ncurrent law which says exactly the same thing. The Budget Act now \nrequires the Congressional Budget Office to make the estimate, where \npracticable. The chairman, my friend from Delaware, asks, ``Where does \nthis bill say that they have to make an estimate in the \nintergovernmental sector?''\n  The answer is what it does is it has the explicit language relative \nto the private sector that:\n\n       If the Director determines it is not feasible to make a \n     reasonable estimate that would be required, the Director \n     shall not make the estimate but shall report in the statement \n     that the reasonable estimate cannot be made, and shall \n     include the reasons therefore.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I may read from the committee report of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee on this point.\n  It says:\n\n       If the Director determines that it is not feasible for him \n     to make a reasonable estimate that would be required with \n     respect to Federal private-sector mandates, the Director \n     shall not make the estimate but shall report in the statement \n     that the reasonable estimate cannot be reasonably made.\n\n  And then the committee report goes on to say this:\n\n       No corresponding section applies for Federal \n     intergovernmental mandates.\n\n  That is very clear. We allow them to be honest when it comes to the \nprivate sector, yet do not permit them to be honest when it comes to \nthe intergovernmental sector. It says they shall estimate. It does not \nhave the possibility that they cannot make an estimate in the \nintergovernmental sector the way it does to the private sector.\n  Mr. ROTH. If the Senator will yield, the point I was trying to make \nis that nowhere, as far as I am aware, does the legislation forbid \nexpressly the CBO from saying that it cannot make an estimate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Why not allow it to do so, to say that?\n  Mr. ROTH. The important fact is what flows from that determination. \nThe present language permits, in my judgment, CBO to say exactly that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. May I then ask the chairman why do we not explicitly say \nthat?\n  Mr. ROTH. One reason is that it is difficult. You cannot fund a \nmandate for which there is no estimate. So what we are trying to----\n  Mr. LEVIN. The point of order would lie.\n  Mr. ROTH. So we are trying to require the authors of the legislation \nto go back and spell out the legislation in such a manner that an \nestimate indeed can be made.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Which is a good goal. But if the author of the legislation \nattempts to obtain that estimate, and it is impossible for the CBO to \nmake it, even if there is a diligent request, why not allow the \nDirector to be honest? Why force the Director to make an estimate which \nis absolutely a wild, out-of-the-blue estimate, just so he can comply \nwith the law? Is that helpful to us in terms of our legislative \nprocess?\n  Do we really know more about the cost of intergovernmental mandates \nwhen a Director of the CBO, faced with this kind of a requirement that \nhe estimate the specific amount of a mandate, throws up his or her \nhands and says, ``I cannot do it, and if I have to do it--and that is \nwhat the law says when it comes to intergovernmental mandates--I am \ngoing to say it is from $1 million to $1 billion; that is the best I \ncan do''; is that really helpful to us in terms of understanding the \nimpact of mandates?\n  I do not think it is helpful. I think we ought to be honest and \nacknowledge that there will be occasions when the Director of the CBO \ncannot estimate. The point of order would still lie if we want to keep \nthe point of order in this area, because there is no estimate. But at \nleast you would have had the statement as to why there is no estimate.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. If the Senator will yield, I think that may be the \ncrux of this. When it is a public-sector mandate, we are saying that we \nshould pay for that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Unless it is waived.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Unless it is waived. On the private sector, we say we \nwill not be paying for that, but we ought to know the cost and impact \nup front.\n  With the private sector, if the Congressional Budget Office comes \nback and says, ``We just cannot make an estimate,'' then no point of \norder can lie. The Chair will not rule. They have no alternative. It \ndoes not lie, because the CBO has said there is no estimate, and so \nthere can be no point of order.\n  That is the difference with the public sector. The CBO may come back \nand, in their report of estimate, state, ``We have tried this method \nand we have tried that, and we have consulted with the public entities, \nour partners, and this is the conclusion: Our estimate is that we \ncannot come to some conclusive information.''\n  But then we have a report. We have a report. We have not allowed a \nloophole that we are not going to deal with the issue of whether or not \nwe should still fund it.\n  It may cause us to rethink this because if in fact you have the \nCongressional Budget Office--and I underscore the term ``Budget'' in \nCongressional Budget Office--and they say, ``We don't know what this \nwill cost; it may well be beyond $50 million,'' if we allow them the \nsame language as in the private sector, then we are not going to deal \nwith it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Why?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. We are just going to vote. There is no point of order \nbecause the Chair cannot rule that a point of order lies.\n  Mr. LEVIN. May I ask my friend from Idaho why not? Why cannot the \nChair rule that there is no estimate?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Because there will be nothing upon which to base the \ndecision. There would be nothing to base the decision upon.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is a failure of the amendment to have an estimate.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. But I say to the Senator, with the process as \nprescribed, you will have that report from CBO. You then, as the Chair \nof that committee, can use that and come down to this floor, and you \ncan get a majority to vote to waive that. Because you now have a report \nfrom CBO saying, ``We do not know what it is going to cost. We do not \nknow how to estimate this.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. What is the amount going to be, then?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. That is what we are going to decide. The will of the \nSenate is going to determine that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senate has no basis. The CBO told us that they cannot \nmake the estimate. You say they can be honest. You ought to say that in \nthe bill, they can be honest. But you do not want to say that in the \nbill because then the point of order might be in effect.\n  But then my question is, you say they can be honest and tell us they \ncannot make the estimate, but you do not want to put that in the bill \nthe way we have for the private sector; then what is the amount of the \nestimate \n[[Page S983]] upon which the point of order will be based? What are we \ngoing to vote on?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I say to the Senator, it might cause us to then \nrethink the mandate.\n  But the Senator keeps going back, saying, let us be honest; let us be \nhonest. S. 1 gives us this process to be honest. it is going to give us \nthe best information possible.\n  Mr. LEVIN. With one exception.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. By allowing the private sector process which is \nprescribed here, if you were to apply that to the public sector, then \nwe will not come back for that sort of discussion because there is no \nbasis from which to make that decision. The Chair cannot rule that a \npoint of order exists. But, again, I say this with all sincerity, if \nthe Congressional----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Why would the Chair rule there is no estimate?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. If the Congressional Budget Office comes back and \nsays, ``We have run the calculations on the estimate and our conclusion \nis we cannot give you a good number,'' what is wrong with that, to come \nback here with that information?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think that is exactly what they should say, but you do \nnot allow for it. I am the one who says the bill should allow for it.\n  Let me make sure there is no confusion as to who is saying what. I am \nthe one who says that we ought to allow them to do precisely what the \nSenator from Idaho said they should be allowed to do.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. The difference, I say to the Senator, is he is saying \nthe same language used in the private sector. If you do so, then there \nis no way the point of order can lie.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator from Idaho believe if they cannot make \nthe estimate, that they should be allowed to tell us that?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Of course they should.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Should we so state in the bill?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. We do not want to provide it so that the CBO can make \nthe determination that we do not come back here and deal with the point \nof order. That is what I am saying. I mean, there may be some way we \ncan craft this.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GLENN. It would seem to be going the route my colleague from \nIdaho wants to go on this, where you cannot say there is no cost, which \nseems to me preeminently sensible that you are going away from the $50 \nmillion threshold, because on every single thing that comes before the \nSenate, the $50 million threshold would mean nothing. It means there is \nsome expense, even if it is on a postage stamp. If they say they cannot \nestimate this, but you are going to bring it to the floor on a point of \norder, the $50 million threshold means nothing.\n  We are now saying, in effect, that on every single bill, every single \nthing that comes before the Senate, even though we cannot make an \nestimate on it, that it is going to have a point of order and it is \ngoing to have the same treatment as everything else, and the $50 \nmillion threshold, it seems to me, just went down the drain.\n  I do not see what is wrong with doing exactly, by amendment, what the \nSenator from Michigan is doing. All he is saying is that where the \nauthority is charged with making these estimates, they can say they \ncannot make it. And we have a letter here from them that says on \noccasion it is going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to \nmake that kind of a judgment.\n  If it is impossible, who are we to say you have to do it anyway? \n``You do what you say you don't have the staff, don't have the people, \ndon't have the estimates to do on some of these 87,000 communities \naround the country.''\n  Why would we tell them to do something that they say they cannot do, \nor the Budget Committee itself say, ``Well, if CBO cannot do it, we \nwill,'' just to get a figure out there, when it would be an absolutely \nfictitious, false figure on which nobody could base any vote on the \nfloor.\n  It seems to me the way to go, which I thought you were about to agree \nto a moment ago, is with language that would say if the CBO cannot make \nan estimate, then they just say that. They say we cannot make an \nestimate and the bill would come to the floor and everybody would know \nthat they cannot make an estimate. They would make their own judgment \non the bills, just as we do now when they come to the floor without an \nestimate.\n  But the point is, probably 95 or 98 percent of the bills that would \ncome before us would in fact have an estimate hooked up with them, and \nwe would have taken much better cognizance of the cost in advance, \nwhich is the purpose of this bill.\n  I think we are all bogged down here on sort of a technicality. The \npurpose of this bill was really to say, we are going to force the \nSenate, where possible--and I underline that; where possible--to take \naccount up front of what the cost of the bills are going to be and what \nthe Federal mandates to the States are going to be, which we have never \ndone before. And that will cover probably 95 or 98 percent of the bills \nthat come before us.\n  It would seem to me just sensible that when the Budget Committee says \nit cannot make an estimate, with the people and the expertise and \nexperience they have had for the last 20 years, and they say, ``We \ncan't do that,'' and we are, in effect, telling them, ``You have to do \nit; we are forcing you to do it, even though you cannot do it,'' what \nare they going to do?\n  Well, they come up with some fictitious figure just to comply with \nwhat we have told them to do, and that figure will not mean anything \nbecause it will not be based on their best judgment. It will be based \non what they somehow had to do when they told us they could not.\n  I think it would be common sense to me to do exactly what the Senator \nfrom Michigan is saying: Permit them in law--no fudging around; no \nalternate message here or no unclear message to them--to say that if \nyou cannot make a judgment, you cannot make a judgment. You tell us \nthat, and then the Senate proceeds to work its will, as we do now when \nwe have bills where we do not have an estimate.\n  So it seems to me very fair to do that. I do not yet see the logic, \nwith all due respect, of saying we are going to force them to say \nsomething that they tell us they cannot say. It just does not make any \nsense to me.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. If the Senator will yield, I really believe that--and \nthe good Senator from Michigan keeps referencing the 87,000 \njurisdictions--they would be arguing what I am trying to say. Maybe I \nam not very eloquent in saying it.\n  It is not in any stretch of the imagination to say that CBO is to \ncome up with some number, no matter how fictitious it is. I am saying \nthere is a process that says they are to do their best effort in coming \nup with that estimate. That is the report they will receive. But it \ndoes not stop there.\n  Mr. GLENN. What If their estimate is zero?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. That is the report, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. GLENN. But they just say: We cannot say whether it is zero or $50 \nbillion. Then what do we do?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Then I think we ought to rethink the mandate itself.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is a good argument on the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Exactly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The question is, should they be able to tell us they \ncannot make an estimate. The Senator from Idaho keeps saying sure, they \nought to. A minute ago, he said a good-faith effort. The words ``good-\nfaith effort'' are not in the bill.\n The words ``good faith effort'' are not in the bill. It says they \nshall make an estimate in a specific amount, acknowledging in the \nprivate sector it may be impossible. They have told us in the public \nsector it may be impossible. They told us that over and over again for \nthe last 12 years.\n\n  Most of the time they can do it, by the way, and should do it. And 95 \nor 98 percent of the time they can do it.\n  The Senator from Idaho keeps saying if they cannot do it, they should \ntell Members they cannot do it. All I am saying is, great, let Members \nput that in the bill. If they cannot do it, they should tell Members \nthey cannot do it. And it is up to Members whether we waive a point of \norder.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I agree with that but it is up to \nMembers not CBO to certify by note that they cannot do it. So there is \nno \n[[Page S984]] point of order, there is no basis for the Chair.\n  I think we may be caught in a bit of a technicality or semantics \nissue. I would be happy to sit down with the Senator and see if we \ncannot craft something here. Again, I am simply saying I do not want to \nsee the Senate go with the same procedure as prescribed on the private \nsector because it will then allow the Senate to no longer deal with \nwhether or not, as the Senator just said, we ought to come to the floor \nand seek a waiver. We would not be required to do that. I think we \nshould when we are using the taxpayers' money in the million- and \nbillion-dollar categories.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the Senator from Michigan simply said we \nshould allow the CBO to state that they cannot make an estimate in the \nintergovernmental site, in the same way they are allowing Members to \nsay that on the private sector.\n  I did not say we should use the same procedure, but I say we allow \nthem to be honest when it comes to the inability to estimate the cost \nof a private mandate. We should allow them to be honest when it comes \nto the cost of an intergovernmental mandate. That is all I am saying. \nIt is an honesty amendment.\n  By the way, it will allow the Senate to legislate a lot better. We \nwill not be gaining useful information if we force someone to make an \nestimate which is impossible to make. We are not doing ourselves a \nfavor legislatively. Believe me, we are not legislating in a \nknowledgeable way, which is one of the purposes of this bill, and I \nhave to say I totally agree with, that we know, where feasible, the \ncost of these estimates to State and local governments. By the way, \nwhere it is not feasible to know it, that it is a pretty good argument \nfor not imposing.\n  There may be circumstances, by the way, where you still want to \nimpose it. It may be the reasoning it is not feasible is it is \ndependent upon EPA estimates and there is no way, prior to a public \nhearing, prior to notice, prior to an administrative procedure, that \nEPA is going to whisper into the ear of the Budget Committee what their \nlevel of mercury will be 3 years in advance of their decision. So, \nthere may be good reasons to just simply vote ``no\" on the mandate \nbecause we cannot get an estimate.\n  On the other hand, the majority may say, no, that would be \nunreasonable in this case to require and we do want to impose that \nmandate on local and State governments. We want all levels to reduce \ntheir level of mercury in incinerators, not just the local.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, as I understand, the Senator from Michigan \nretains his right to the floor regardless of the colloquy here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, the Senator from Michigan has \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am not trying to control the floor here \nat all. I am trying to have a colloquy which will help to illuminate, \nhopefully, and I would be happy to ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to yield the floor to the Senator from Kentucky, or if there is \nobjection to this process from any one of the colloquies, I am happy to \nyield the floor, period.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, the \nSenator wanted a couple of minutes, and I wanted to make another point \non this before we leave this.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, I will be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, go ahead and we will come back.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, the thing that disturbs me here, and I \nthink it is a legitimate disturbance, that those in the Senate that \nwould like to help business, those that would like to see that business \ngets a fair shake, I think applying the laws to the Senate, that we \napply to our constituents, was something that was very significant.\n  Now in this language we are saying that we can stick it to business \nout there as hard as we want to because we cannot get an estimate. But \nto reverse that and say to the intergovernmental agencies, the \ncommunities, the counties, and the States that they are going to be \nexempt. So we are coming down as a business-oriented climate, I hope, \nand we are saying that we are going to stick it to business, but we \nwill let Government, intergovernmental agencies, cities, counties, \nStates, et cetera, I just think that this is wrong.\n  If it is fair for Members to say that business--the regulations, et \ncetera, will be imposed on business, but not imposed upon public \noperations, then we have a real problem. It is my judgment, if I was \nbusiness, I would be up here trying to defeat this bill because then I \nwould not be allowed to compete because the regulations and fees, or \nwhatever, to be imposed upon business, would be excluded from the \npublic sector.\n  Therefore, we are in competition with incinerators, and Lord, do we \nhave problems out there trying to find disposal sites. It would just be \nhorrendous in my opinion.\n  Hospitals. I see hospitals now trying to make it work where they have \na private hospital and a public hospital trying to come together on \nsome sort of HMO and it makes it difficult. So, in that category we \nwould apply rules to the private hospital that we would not apply to \nthe public hospital and, therefore, they would not be able to come \ntogether in an ability to cover communities with health care.\n  Schools. What are we going to do to asbestos and all its removal in \nprivate schools? And the cost is over $50 million, so therefore we \nexclude public schools.\n  I think it is time that we all sit down and rethink this. When people \nsay we are trying to filibuster this, we are not. I am not. I am for \nthe bill. I am for the bill that says we should not put in unfunded \nmandates. I introduced a bill 8 years ago, 6 years ago. The Senator \nfrom Ohio and I have been on there for a long time. Got two cosponsors \nfirst time I introduced this legislation. And $50 million was a \nthreshold then. Still is the threshold.\n  So I am not against this legislation. But we have just gone so far, \nso far and attempted to jam it down our throat here, that some have \njust said, ``No, let's wait a minute.''\n  I think the public has benefited, particularly business has \nbenefited, by the debate that has developed here. Now this, in my \nopinion, is what the Senate is all about: The right to debate. Now that \nwe have had the right to debate, even though we are trying to be \npainted into a different position here, different image, I think this \ndebate has been very successful and very useful, particularly as it \napplies to the business community.\n  So I want people who are saying this is a filibuster, it is not. Want \nto file cloture? Members can file cloture. Thirty-six amendments are \nfloating out there in various and sundry types, on both sides of the \naisle.\n  So we have, I think, played the role that our forefathers expected of \nthe Senate when we are now questioning the aspects of this particular \npiece of legislation. So, it is not a filibuster. Not a filibuster in \nany stretch of the imagination. But it sure is, in my opinion, \ndeveloping into something we better take a second look at because it \nhas become so broad.\n  So I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Michigan. I hope there \nwill be a way to accommodate each side here so that the public and \nprivate sectors of our economy, both will be treated the same. Right \nnow they are not.\n  If we are going to help business, we better sit down and try to help \nit out so business will not be placed at a disadvantage rather than the \npublic being placed at an advantage. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, if I could just briefly, to my friend \nfrom Ohio, thank the Senator from Kentucky, my good friend, for \nfocusing on a very important fundamental issue, which is whether or not \nwe want to send a message, create a presumption, however we want to \nphrase it, that we are going to put the private sector at a competitive \ndisadvantage in those areas where there is a lot of competition.\n And there are a lot of those areas. In the environmental area, we have \ngotten letters, by the way, from the environmental disposal community--\nI think three or four associations-- strongly opposing what we are \ndoing \n[[Page S985]] here because it could put them at a competitive \ndisadvantage.\n  So there is some real concern in the private sector, or at least \nparts of the private sector that compete with the public sector, about \neither the assumption or the presumption that we will be funding their \ncompetitors while we are not funding them.\n  And so Senator Lieberman and I, and some others, will be offering \nsome amendments later on in this debate to try to address that very \nsignificant point that the Senator from Kentucky has made.\n  Madam President, I am going to yield the floor in just 1 minute. I \nwould just like to, before I yield the floor--and I have many more \nquestions that I would like to pursue with the managers of the bill as \nto the way in which this process works, but I understand that they wish \nto make a unanimous-consent request, and I do not want to totally just \ndominate here. I want to try to clarify this process because it is very \nimportant what we are about to undertake.\n  My question of the manager of the bill, the Senator from Idaho, is \nthis: The first question I asked had to do with when was that mandate \neffective. What is the effective date of that mandate in my \nhypothetical? I am wondering whether or not we can have that answer \nyet.\n  Mr. GLENN. Might I respond to that first? I did not get in that \ndiscussion before. If I might give my view on that, it seems to me you \ndo this a couple of ways. The committee should have some idea of how \nlong it is going to take for a State or local community to get ready \nfor whatever the mandate is. In other words, if it is a water system, a \nsewer system or whatever it is that we are dealing with, they would \nhave an idea of how long it is going to take in advance of the \nrequirement date, such as the Senator puts down here, the year 2005.\n  If there was not a time put in, it would be my opinion that you would \nmake an estimate of how many years it would take them to comply, and \nour sharing of the cost of that would start at whatever that time is. \nIn other words, if the time limit that the Senator used in his example \nof the year 2005, if it was going to take 3 years in advance of that, \nthe Federal funding portion of this, or whatever we worked out on that, \nwould take the 3 years or 4 years or whatever the estimate was that \nwould help them comply with that, or it would be worked out with the \nStates. You could not wait until the mandate is to go into effect, in \nthe year 2005 in his example, you could not wait until the year 2004\\1/\n2\\ and then say, ``OK, we are now going to help a little bit because \ntheir expenditures, if they are going to comply with that mandate, have \nto be made many times years in advance to allow them to comply.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is the reason, if my friend will yield, the reason I \nrequested this information is exactly that. If the law or the bill \nstates that after October 1, 2005, emissions of mercury at an unsafe \nlevel will be permitted and delegates the EPA to make the determination \nof what level is unsafe to human health, my question is: Now you are \nCBO. Is there any way of knowing what is the first year that any local \ngovernment will modify its incinerator? Some local governments may \nstart in the year 1998, 2000, 2001. Does it just take a wild stab in \nthe dark as to how many incinerators that are publicly owned will be \nmodified in each of the 5 years up to 2005? How can it possibly make \nthat estimate?\n  And if--if--the managers of this bill are saying, in that case, the \neffective date of that mandate is before October 1, 2005, there better \nbe a definition in this bill--there is not now--as to how you arrive at \nan effective date. It just simply says ``the effective date of the \nmandate.'' I think anybody reading that mandate that requires \nreductions of dangerous levels of mercury from incinerator emissions \nafter October 1, 2005, would say the effective date of that is October \n1, 2005.\n  The Senator from Ohio very correctly points out that a lot of the \nexpenditures would have to be made in the years up to then. Absolutely. \nBut we are triggering a point of order. We are triggering a required \nappropriation in order to avoid a very serious result from occurring.\n  The Appropriations Committees in each year, up to 2005--if my friend \nfrom Ohio is correct, which I think he is--would have to appropriate \nmoney to local governments. They have to be told how much to \nappropriate and they have to be told that 10 years in advance. This \nestimate of costs to State and local governments must be made in the \nauthorization bill now. Someone has to figure out what is the effective \ndate. This is not just some casual report. This triggers a point of \norder and a mandatory appropriation downstream in specific amounts, \nsome of which are, again, impossible to estimate. But that is the \nearlier debate we had, the earlier discussion.\n  The question here is: If we are going to say the effective date is \nearlier than October 1, 2005, which is the first date that they must \ncomply with a new mandate, if the effective date is going to be earlier \nthan that, we better define ``effective date'' in this bill, because \nthere is a lot that hangs on this. There is a point of order and there \nare appropriations downstream in specific amounts which must meet those \nestimates if certain things are going to follow.\n  So, again, we are not just talking about reports here. We are talking \nabout points of order and specific appropriations that are going to be \ndependent on when this mandate is effective.\n  I thank the managers of the bill and, again, they have requested that \nI yield so that they can make a unanimous-consent request, and I am \nhappy to yield the floor, but I do hope that at some point after their \nrequest, I will be able to again seek or obtain recognition so we can \npick up our colloquy at that point.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from \nMichigan. It is very apparent that his background in local government \nhas helped him to understand. I think we were trying to communicate \ntogether. I think there may be a way that we can resolve this, and it \nmay be something other than what he is recommending and may be \nsomething other than what I was recommending. I think we may be able to \nresolve this.\n  Mr. President, I am going to put in a quorum call just for the \npurpose of notifying a Senator who may have an interest in what will be \na unanimous-consent request that I will make. I ask unanimous-consent \nthat during the quorum call, I will have the right to retain the floor \nso that when we lift the quorum call, I will again have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Therefore, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded and that I be allowed to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am sorry, I cannot see the Senator.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I certainly have no reason to not allow the Senator \nfrom Maryland to proceed.\n  But, again based on my earlier unanimous consent, I would again ask \nthat upon completion of her remarks that I would have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, knowing there is important legislative \nwork to be done on the issue of unfunded mandates, I will not take \nunduly the time of the U.S. Senate. However, I do wish to speak on two \nitems, one, an unsung hero from Maryland who has just passed away and \nthe other on the issue of national service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/17/senate-section/article/S976-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S985-S986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SISTER MARY ADELAIDE SCHMIDT\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

But I wish to speak about another hero, a hero by \nthe name of Sister Mary Adelaide Schmidt, school Sister of Notre Dame \nwho taught me in Catholic elementary school. Sister passed away in the \nlast few days at age of 97. She was born in 1898, when we did not even \nhave the right to vote, but she certainly knew how to empower women, \nempower us with the message of the gospel, empower us with the skills \nthat we needed to make it in the world, and to know how to claim our \nwomanly virtue and at the same time make a difference.\n  Sister Adelaide played a special role in my life.

As a result, I was shy about speaking up because my voice was \nlower than the other girls' in the classroom, when boys voices were \nchanging.\n  Sister Adelaide asked me to stay after school, brought this out in \nher kindly way, to have me share that with her. And then for the next \ncouple of weeks she said, let us make sure you know how you sound and \nhow good it is going to make you feel.

Mr. President, I wanted to speak on the issue of \nnational service. The new issue of Newsweek quotes the new Speaker of \nthe House as unequivocally opposing national service because it is, in \nhis words, ``coerced voluntarism.''\n  I believe the new Speaker does not understand national service or the \ngrounding that went on behind it.\n  As one of the founding godmothers of this initiative, I rise this \nafternoon to express my dismay at yet another attempt by Republican \nleaders to distort a bold approach to solving our country's problems.\n  It appears from these recent comments and others made earlier on the \nfloor today, that some in this Congress will try to lump national \nservice in with every other program headed for the chopping block as \npart of our institution's budget cutting fever.\n  Well, I am here today to say that national service is not a \nGovernment-run social program. And that is the point that the Speaker \nand some of national service's critics misunderstand.\n  It is not a program but a new social invention created to provide \naccess to the American dream of higher education and to help create the \nethic of service and civic obligation in today's young people.\n  Under national service, young Americans receive a reduction in their \nstudent debt, or a voucher for higher education, in exchange for full- \nor part-time community service. Service projects are driven by the \nchoices of local nonprofits organized around one of four broad themes--\npublic health, the environment, public safety, or education.\n  National service began as a concept with the Democratic Leadership \nCouncil and other Democrats like myself in the 1980's. But its purpose \nwas not born of political gamesmanship or partisan advantage. It was \ndesigned to address two of the most pressing needs that our country \nfaces. One, how can students pay off their student debt; and how can we \ncreate a sense of voluntarism.\n  The first is the issue of student indebtedness and access to higher \neducation. Most college graduates today face their first mortgage the \nday they leave college--it is called their student loans. That debt \noften forces them to make career choices oriented strictly to getting \nthem financially fit for duty.\n  Worse yet, for many the high cost of higher education simply denies \nthem access to college at all.\n  By providing a post-service benefit, national service members can \nease their student debt, or accrue savings that will help them go to \nschool. It is not an entitlement, and it is not a hand out.\n  Educational benefits are linked to work service. Participants are \neligible only when they have finished their work service commitment.\n  The second problem national service is designed to address is more \nidealistic. It is how to instill in young Americans what de Tocqueville \ncalled the habits of the heart. To address the sharp drop over the last \ntwo decades in the number of Americans who volunteer in their own \ncommunities, a fact representative of Americans disinvesting in those \nsocial institutions which helped build our country.\n  Bob Putnam, a Professor at Harvard, has written an article called \n``Bowling Alone.'' He says more people bowl today than a decade ago but \nfew belong to bowling leagues. So, Senator Mikulski, what does that \nhave to do with national service?\n  The point is bowling alone is a metaphor for the way Americans have \ncome to view civic involvement and citizenship. There has a been an \nabsolute decline in developing community involvement. People have less \ntime available because many households have two wage earners instead of \none. They are more mobile. We have a society that is more influenced by \nTV. And they are also less committed. There is a serious lack of a \nsense of civic obligation.\n  Fewer people attend PTA, groups like Red Cross and the Boy Scouts \nhave fewer volunteers.\n  My point in saying this is that national service is an idea that \npromotes exactly the values that the Republican leader wishes to \ninstill. The fact that we should not rely on Government, that there \nshould be a role for nonprofit organizations, that there should be for \nevery opportunity, an obligation; for every right, a responsibility.\n And that is what national service is about. It is not coercive. Nobody \nis forced to get into the national service program. But I will tell you \nwhat they do. Their lives are significantly changed by it and their \ncommunities are significantly changed by it.\n\n  Young American men no longer have the shared experience of military \nservice that served for the men of my generation as a rite of passage \ninto adulthood. Where they learned that there was more to being a good \ncitizen than just staying out of trouble. That instead, civic \nresponsibility meant uniting with people of all different walks of life \nfor a common purpose to help people help themselves; to be part of an \nAmerican effort bigger than themselves.\n  National service is the latest in a long series of social inventions \nwe have created to help provide access to higher education. We created \nnight schools to teach immigrants English. We created the GI bill for \nreturning veterans, and we invented community colleges to bring higher \neducation close to home at a modest cost.\n  The argument that national service is coerced voluntarism is a knee-\njerk statement that belies the facts. I chaired the Appropriations \nSubcommittee which has funded national service in the past. In the \nfirst 2 years of the Clinton administration, no one coerced anyone to \nparticipate. Instead, people were knocking down the doors to join.\n  Two facts make this point. First of all, there are more people who \nwant to participate than there are opportunities.\n  In national service's first 2 years, about 1,500 organizations \napplied for funds. Only 300 were selected because of lack of funds. \nThat is a selection rate of just 20 percent--a lower selection rate \nthan peer-reviewed research grants at either the National Science \n[[Page S987]] Foundation or the National Institutes of Health.\n  Second, in the current fiscal year, we provided enough funds to get \nabout 23,000 people participating in full- or part-time national \nservice. Yet since the President launched his call for a season of \nservice, the Corporation for National Service has received calls from \nnearly 200,000 different persons wanting to participating in the \nprogram. So just 1 in 10 who have wanted to voluntarily participate \nhave been able to do so.\n  Now some discount the kind of work undertaken through national \nservice. They say it is trivial, or unnecessary, or even irrelevant. \nBut I can tell you that in my own State of Maryland, national service \nis making a difference--not with fancy bumper sticker programs or \nactivities that simply touch the surface of what is needed.\n  For example, 30 national service volunteers in Montgomery County are \nworking with cops as victim assistance advocates for 1,000 senior \ncitizens. They help teach crime prevention techniques and organize \nneighborhood watch activities. They work every day to make Montgomery \nCounty, MD, a safer place to live.\n  National service is helping senior citizens avoid crime by teaching \ncrime prevention, organizing neighborhood watchdogs and rural, urban. \nIn suburban areas they have service corps related to conservation. They \nare rehabilitating houses for low-income families. When we were hit by \ntornadoes, the National Service Corps moved in and helped families help \nthemselves to be able to pull themselves out of the tragedy that \naffected them. There are many criticisms of national service, and \nSenator Grassley raised a few related to bureaucracy. I do think we \nneed to make sure that bureaucracy is kept at a minimum.\n  Mr. President, regardless about how one feels about it as an \norganization, let us not lose sight of the mission. We need new social \ninventions in this country to take us into the 21st century just like \nwe need new technological inventions. We have continued creating social \ninventions that have provided access to the American dream around \nowning a home and acquiring higher education. In terms of acquiring \neducation, we in the United States of America invented night school so \nimmigrants could be able to learn English, citizenship, and move ahead. \nNo other country in the world had it until we invented it. There is the \nGI bill that said ``thank you'' to Americans who made sacrifices in \nWorld War II, and part of that was to be able to have a VA mortgage and \na VA opportunity to seek higher education. We even invented the \ncommunity college system to make sure that you did not have to go away \nto be able to learn.\n  National service is an opportunity. It is an organization right now \nthat is providing volunteer slots of 20,000 people a year to actually \nwork hands on in their own community, primarily working through \nnonprofits and enabling themselves to pay off their student debt, \nhelping the community. Mr. President, I believe their lives will be \nchanged. I believe that when the voucher part of this program is over \nthey will go on volunteering the rest of their lives.\n  I think it is an important program. I hope that before we go around \nattacking some of these programs that we take a look at their mission. \nIf we have to fine tune the administrative aspects of it, so be it. But \nI believe national service is an important part of our national agenda \nand should have bipartisan support.\n  In rural, urban, and suburban places around Maryland, the Maryland \nservice corps--like the Maryland Conservation Corps, Civic Works in \nBaltimore, and Community Year in Montgomery County--are teaming up to \nrehabilitate houses for low-income families.\n  These are but two examples of hundreds of ones that are taking place \nacross America in 49 of the 50 States. They are fighting to make a \ndifference in people's lives, 1 day at a time, one person at a time. \nBecause in today's culture of mass marketing, mass production, and mass \nadvertising, we need to teach every young American that he or she can \nmake a difference. Whether they are from a middle-class suburb, a tough \ninner-city neighborhood, or a rural county that's economy is driven by \nthe labor of the land.\n  Earlier today, one of my colleagues alluded to a General Accounting \nOffice study that I initiated when I chaired the VA-HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee. It is a routine review of the administrative costs of \nnational service activities designed to help us improve it where \npossible, and guarantee as much money goes into service activities \ninstead of overhead.\n  The fact that we began it in the last Congress demonstrates the long-\nstanding desire of those who support the program to make it bipartisan, \nand focused on results, not rhetoric. It doesn't indicate any evidence \nthat this initiative is off-track or funds wasteful service efforts.\n  To suggest otherwise is simply to let one's rhetoric get ahead of the \nfacts.\n  So, I for one, look forward to the GAO's findings and intend to use \nthem to improve national service, not undermine it.\n  As the new Republican majority takes shape in both Houses of \nCongress, I hope that they keep an open mind on national service. \nRather than criticizing it, national service seems to be the kind of \nprogram they should like.\n  Service choices are selected on the basis of merit, not political \nmuscle. And those choices are made at the State and local level, not by \nbureaucrats in Washington.\n  It rewards the kind of values like sweat equity and hard work that \nare the heart of American family life. It does not identify with \nvictims, but instead calls people to self-responsibility--by helping \nnot just yourself, but others too.\n  What better way to help a young woman on welfare but to help her \nunderstand that she can not only receive help, but provide it to others \nas well.\n  Benefits are earned through work, not a Government handout. There is \nno entitlement.\n  And national service promotes the kind of social cohesion--rich and \npoor, black and white--best achieved by people working together, a \ntheme the new Speaker outlines so eloquently in his maiden speech as \nSpeaker.\n  I worked for many years as a social worker and community organizer in \nBaltimore. I learned from that experience more than I have ever learned \nfrom memos and briefings in Washington. I am a better Senator because \nof what I learned from the people and the communities I worked with \nevery day. The people who work in national service are also learning \nand being changed by their experience too.\n  It was 35 years ago that President Kennedy challenged Americans to \nask not what their country could do for them, but what they could do \nfor their country. In that spirit, I will join the President and my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle in fighting to preserve national \nservice in the days and months ahead.\n  I yield the floor under the unanimous-consent agreement that we had \nagreed to.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/17/senate-section/article/S986-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S987-S998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      UNFUNDED MANDATE REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The first made the Budget Committee responsible for \ndetermining mandate costs and the second amendment gave the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee a role in deciding issues related to the \npoint of order.\n  As I understand the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's view, the \ncommittee expects that during those instances when the Parliamentarian \nmust rule on a point of order under this section, there may be \noccasions when there is a need for consultation regarding the \napplicability of this law.\n  These two amendments provide that on all such questions that are not \nwithin the purview of the House and Senate Budget Committees, it is the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee or the House Government Reform \nand Oversight Committee that shall make the final determinations.\n  For example, on the question of whether a particular mandate is \nproperly excluded from coverage of the act or is a bill which enforces \nconstitutional rights of individuals, the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee would be the appropriate committee to consult. On a question \nregarding the particular cost of such mandate, the Budget Committee \nwould be the appropriate committee to consult.\n  Now, the Senate Budget Committee took a different view. The Senate \nBudget Committee struck these two amendments. The Senate Budget \nCommittee's view is that the reference to the Budget Committee's role \nis unnecessary, for it is similar to language already in the Budget \nAct. In other words, the Budget Committee already has the \nresponsibility to do the work that the Governmental Affairs Committee \ngave it.\n  About the issue of having the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee \nconsulted about points of order, the view of the Senate Budget \nCommittee is that it is not needed. For the past 20 years the Senate \nParliamentarian and the Senate Budget Committee have 20 years of \nexperience with these Budget Act points of order. S. 1 follows the \nexact same process now used in Budget Act estimates.\n  The Budget Committee does not believe there is a precedent for two \ncommittees to resolve Budget Act points of order. That is the issue as \nsimply as I can explain it.\n  Since the markups, Senators Domenici and Roth, the Budget and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee chairmen, have discussed this issue and \nboth have agreed to support the Budget Committee amendments. I believe \nthat Senators Glenn and Exon, the ranking members of these two \ncommittees, have yet to reach agreement.\n  With that as an overview, Mr. President, I believe that we have the \nchairmen of the committees, the ranking members and other Senators that \nwould like to address this issue. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, could I ask the Senator to correct \nsomething? I heard the Senator say Senator Exon has not decided. He \nsupported the amendment that I put forth in the committee, so I believe \nhe is here to speak in favor of the amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico is certainly \ncorrect.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I accept that correction.\n  Really, my intent there was to point out that Senator Exon and \nSenator Glenn, as ranking members, have not yet come to an agreement. I \nthink that is fair to say.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Budget Committee's \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I was elected to the Senate the same year that the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, then called Government Operations, \nenacted the Budget Act and the Budget Committee. The Senate rules \nprovide that changes to the Budget Act are the joint responsibility of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee and the Budget Committee.\n  We gave the Budget Committee the responsibility to provide estimates \non direct spending and created the Congressional Budget Office to help \ndetermine the costs of legislation to the Federal Government, and we \nnow require that committee reports contain CBO estimates of such costs.\n  We have seen for many years that there have been some controversy \nthat has resulted over different opinions as the costs of a particular \nbill, joint resolution, or regulation. We went through months of stormy \ndebate last year over the costs of health care legislation, as my \ndistinguished colleague, the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nmentioned earlier on the floor today.\n  Why did we do that? Because cost estimates in most cases are highly \nsensitive to underlying assumptions as to how a piece of legislation or \nregulation will be implemented and enforced. A so-called expert in \nmaking cost estimates who uses an underlying assumption that is wrong \nor highly speculative will provide a cost estimate that is no better \nthan a wild guess by an amateur.\n  Nonetheless, for the purpose of having an orderly budget process, we \nhave agreed to use CBO figures and in their absence, Budget Committee \nestimates in dealing with Budget Act estimation requirements. So we \ncreated the Budget Committee, gave them the jurisdiction and \nresponsibility to oversee and provide technical cost estimates. And \n[[Page S989]] now here we are some 20 years later, and the claim is \nmade that their experience enables them to do estimation of the costs \nof Federal mandates on some 87,000 States, localities, tribal \ngovernments, as well as the private sector.\n  We in the minority of the Governmental Affairs Committee did not \nchallenge the decision made without our input to have last year's \nunfunded mandates' bill rewritten as an amendment to the Budget Act. It \nwas not written as an amendment to the Budget Act last year. Last year \nthe Budget Committee did not seek or claim any jurisdiction over S. \n993, a bill that in substance forms the basis for S. 1. I repeat, we \ndid not object when that was proposed that it be rewritten as an \namendment to the Budget Act.\n  Despite this decision, our staff worked with the staffs of Senator \nKempthorne and the Budget Committee to produce another bill that we \ncould support. When the minority staff on our committee were confronted \nwith the fait accompli that the bill was now to be an amendment to the \nBudget Act and the demand that last year's bill had to be strengthened \nto make it more difficult to avoid a point of order on a bill, the \nminority staff worked with their Democratic and Republican colleagues \non both the Governmental Affairs and Budget Committees to try to \nproduce a bipartisan result that we could all support.\n  In that spirit, the Governmental Affairs Committee produced a bill \nthat recognized the varied interests of those supporting the principle \nthat we should legislate unfunded mandates only with full realization \nof the burdens being imposed by such mandates. As we worked through the \nbill it became clear that the procedures in the bill had the potential \nfor providing significant delays that could be exploited for purposes \nnot of clarifying the effects of legislation, but for purposes of, in \neffect not lobbying but filibustering for purposes of perhaps stopping \nthe legislation. Accordingly, we in Governmental Affairs felt wherever \npossible, the bill's procedures should be very clearly spelled out \nalong with who has responsibility for what.\n  We recognize that making estimates of the cost of mandates is \ncomplicated and has the built-in conflict of interest produced by \ndependence on the States and local governments for most of the cost \ndata. Because of the profound changes in the Senate procedures that the \nbill would allow in the case of legislation containing mandates, there \nis a quite legitimate question as to whether the Budget Committee \nalone, since budget process jurisdiction is shared with the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, should determine if a threshold has \nbeen breached by an amendment of a bill.\n  Nonetheless, since someone should be responsible for cost data and \nfor overseeing the CBO State and local cost estimating process we \nagreed in S. 1 to give the Budget Committee explicit responsibility for \nthis, which in my view I think they should have but they do not \nuniquely have, under the Budget Act.\n  This responsibility is actually shared with the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. We felt we had an agreement with Senator Roth and myself, \nthe chair and ranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and \nSenators Domenici and Exon, chair and ranking member on the Budget \nCommittee, on language in S. 1 that details the responsibilities of \neach committee in overseeing implementation of S. 1. All four of us \ncosponsor the bill.\n  Then, the Budget Committee took this explicit language out of the \nbill and I thought broke the agreement that we had. They thereby \ncreated a situation in which the chair, advised by the Parliamentarian, \nwould be the entity that would determine whether the cost of a mandate \nexceeds the threshold. In other words, is it a Federal mandate or not?\n  Now, I have no doubt that the Parliamentarian would probably tend to \nlook to the Budget Committee for guidance on this despite the fact that \nit is the Budget Committee's experience estimating the cost of Federal \nintergovernmental mandates is not significantly different than that of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee which under rule XXVI has had the \njurisdiction over intergovernmental relations and federalism for many \nyears going beyond the length of time we have had a Budget Committee in \nexistence. In other words, our committee on Governmental Affairs has \nthe mandate as part of our mandate, written into law and rules of the \nSenate here, that we deal with intergovernmental matters--Federal, \nState, and local matters--and that is written into our reason for \nbeing.\n  Should we depend on the uncertainty of the Parliamentairan's approach \nand our belief as to how he might act based on precedence dealing with \nthings other than the cost of the mandates? I believe the \nParliamentarian should be given explicit instructions in the bill to \nlook to a specific committee for guidance on estimates. Since they want \nto do it, I support the Budget Committee having the responsibility to \ndo the estimates. That is why both committees explicitly agreed to \nwrite that responsibility into the bill, not only for the Senate Budget \nCommittee but also for the House Budget Committee in the case of \nlegislation containing Federal mandates that come before the House.\n  Now, unfortunately, what has happened in this legislation is the \nSenate Budget Committee has taken out the reference we put in giving \nthem and the House Budget Committee the responsibility for doing \nestimates but then in a later section they put language back there \ngiving the House Budget Committee explicit responsibility to do the \nestimates, suggesting that the Budget Act does not need something in it \nclarifying committee responsibilities in this area.\n  That raises the question of why the House Budget Committee is treated \ndifferently than the Senate Budget Committee in this Senate amendment. \nI do not believe they should be treated differently. But, frankly, the \nquestion before us is not only who should do the estimates that we may \nagree on, but who determines whether a bill contains a mandate.\n  This is not a trivial matter, and the Governmental Affairs Committee \nworked hard, in cooperation with Senator Kempthorne and State and local \ngovernment organizations, to produce a definition that we think makes \nsense.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee has been in existence since 1920 \nand, under rule XXVI, has jurisdiction over intergovernmental \nrelations. It has worked on this legislation for the better part of a \nyear and is in the best position to make judgments about whether a bill \ncontains a Federal intergovernmental mandate, meeting the definition in \nS. 1.\n  So in S. 1, we gave Governmental Affairs the explicit responsibility \nto make this determination for the Senate, and we gave our counterpart \ncommittee in the House, the Committee on Government Reform and \nOversight, the same authority with respect to House bills.\n  The Senate Budget Committee, in marking up S. 1, now has removed the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee from determining for the Senate \nwhether a mandate exists but has not removed the authority of the House \nCommittee on Government Reform and Oversight from the bill. The result \nis that the House will have a process whereby the determination of \nwhether a mandate exists will be made by a House Committee on \nGovernment Reform and Oversight. But in the Senate, the \nParliamentarian, backed up by the entire body, will have to make the \ndecision every time a challenge arises.\n  How will the Parliamentarian rule and to whom should he turn for \nconsultation before making his ruling? There is no precedent, and there \nis no process. I think it is illogical and I think it is inefficient. I \nthink it will result in further procedural delays in passing \nlegislation through the Senate and more misunderstanding about what \nthis process is that we are putting into place.\n  If the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight is \nconsidered the appropriate body to make a final determination for the \nHouse on whether a mandate exists in a bill, it makes sense for the \nSenate to turn to its sister committee, the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, for that purpose. That is a responsibility, I would add, \nthat we are given under the rules of the Senate as to what that \ncommittee is responsible for.\n   [[Page S990]] Mr. President, this is more than just a jurisdictional \nissue, although jurisdiction has been injected into the issue by \nrewriting last year's bill as an amendment to the Budget Act which, in \nmy view, was unnecessary. The issue here is what is logical and what is \nefficient.\n  Many people have concerns that the procedures of this bill may be \nused to delay or kill legislation opposed on ideological grounds. I \nhave those concerns myself, even though I am a supporter of the thrust \nof S. 1. Accordingly, I believe it is a disservice to good process to \neliminate from this bill the specific responsibility of a Senate \ncommittee, the Senate committee assigned to intergovernmental \nrelations, to make determinations of applicability of this legislation \nand turn that responsibility over to the Parliamentarian with no \nguidance and no precedent.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge the defeat of the Budget Committee \namendment.\n  What this boils down to is, is the Senate assignment of \nresponsibilities to the Governmental Affairs Committee, in this regard, \none that the Senate wishes to carry out, or do we permit, because the \nbill was written as a change to the Budget Act, is it now to go to the \nParliamentarian, which I think is unjustified?\n  So I urge the defeat of the Budget Committee amendment for those \nreasons, as well as the fact that we are treating the House and the \nSenate differently. The responsibilities do lie over in the House, \nsplit between the Budget Committee and the Government Reform and \nOversight Committee over there, as it should be here.\n  I think to make the processes conform and to prevent any further \nmisunderstanding about this bill, I urge defeat of the Budget Committee \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Domenici amendment, \nwhich was reported from the Budget Committee. The amendment has the \neffect of deleting any reference in the legislation to the Senate \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs and the Senate Committee on the \nBudget in deciding whether a point of order may lie under the proposed \nsection 408 of the Budget Act.\n  The Domenici amendment, reported from the Budget Committee, is \nidentical with an amendment I filed but did not offer during \nGovernmental Affairs' consideration of S. 1. I did not offer it because \nof opposition from the minority side of that committee and I wished to \nexpedite reporting the legislation to the floor.\n  Under the precedents of the Senate, the Chair rules on all points of \norder except a few that it submits to the body itself and except where \na statute may otherwise require. The only example of the latter is the \nBudget Act, which gives the Budget Committee a special role on certain \npoints of order.\n  S. 1 as introduced would create a new exception for Governmental \nAffairs while making clear that the Budget Committee's role on budget \nissues also carried over to ``the levels of Federal mandates'' for any \nfiscal year under proposed section 408.\n  At first look, one might assume that both committees should have \ndistinct and equal roles in deciding points of order--that Governmental \nAffairs opine on whether a provision is a mandate covered by proposed \nsection 408 and that Budget opine on whether provision contains \nsufficient funding. But the roles are not parallel at all. For the \nBudget Committee allows its chairman to act on its behalf because all \nthat the chairman does is present the CBO figures to the presiding \nofficer. The Governmental Affairs Committee would have no similar role \nin conveying its determination on whether section 408 applies or not to \nthe provision against which a point of order is lodged.\n  All types of questions might arise as to whether or not a bill or \namendment falls under this legislation. S. 1 contains a list of \nexemptions on matters affecting constitutional or civil rights, \nemergency relief, other emergencies, national security, and so on. \nThese questions involve a lot more discretion than matching up a CBO \nestimate of costs with a provision's level of funding.\n  When an amendment is offered and a point of order is made under S. 1, \nhow is it possible for an entire committee to meet and decide in time \nfor the Chair to rule? It is not possible at all.\n  Suppose the point of order is made against an amendment that requires \nStates to buy computers and software to create a database that \nfacilitates registering to vote. Does such a provision fall within the \nexclusion in section 4 of S. 1 for those that ``enforce constitutional \nrights?'' Does the provision enforce a right to vote or only make it \neasier to enjoy? Is the exclusion limited to constitutionally required \nrights or does it cover any extra measures that simply involve \nconstitutional rights?\n  Equally nettlesome questions may arise in determining whether a \nprovision increases the ``stringency of conditions of assistance'' to \nStates with respect to certain entitlement programs. Every change in \nsuch conditions will raise the stringency issue. Suppose some changes \nincrease stringency and some relax stringency. These are not always \nquantifiable issues and may be difficult to assess.\n  Since answering such questions is a far cry from delivering a CBO \nestimate to the presiding officer, I support the Domenici amendment \ndeleting language which I believe is both unworkable and inappropriate.\n  The crux of the distinction is that S. 1, as introduced, would allow \nthe subjective decision of one committee, or even one Senator, on a \nqualitative matter to be the final authority. In contrast, the language \nof S. 1 does not give the Budget Committee's determination on the \nlevels of Federal mandates the status of finality even though its \ndetermination is a quantifiable one informed by input from CBO, whose \nevaluations are thought to be politically unbiased. In view of such \nconsiderations, the language in question should be deleted. It is, as I \nsaid unworkable and inappropriate.\n  For that reason, I support the Domenici amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am not going to speak long. Senator \nExon is here and he wants to speak also. I want to thank Senator Roth, \nas chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, for supporting the \ncommittee amendment that is pending now, which amendment, essentially, \nwould take out all reference to either the Budget Committee or the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee having any new powers to pass judgment \non a bill's relevance, on this bill fitting the definition, and on this \nbill exceeding the amount of money that are the limits in this bill.\n  It essentially is saying that we do not need to create new authority \nin a new committee, and certainly not of the type found on page 25, \nwhich I really do not believe that the Senate, under any circumstance, \nwould have approved. Because it says that the Government Reform and \nOversight Committee in the House and Governmental Affairs Committee in \nthe Senate would make final determinations.\n  Essentially what we want on points of order is whether a bill or an \namendment or resolution fits the definition of a mandate, and then what \nwe need is to find out if it breaks the $50 million mark in terms of \ncost to local government--we need that decision made by the U.S. \nSenate, not by a committee.\n  Essentially what our amendment will do, and Senator Roth encapsulated \nit perfectly, is it will put the decision on what is a mandate to be \nmade by the Chair upon advice of the Parliamentarian. And we have, over \nand over, tried to write language as to what a mandate is in this \nlegislation. We have written language in this legislation as to what \nexceptions there are. So what Senator Roth quite properly is saying is \nthat decision as to whether a piece of legislation fits that or not \nshould be made by the Chair upon advice of the Parliamentarian. That is \nwhat happens in many instances here. A question of germaneness under \nthe budget. There is language, there is germaneness language, and the \nquestion is put to the Chair.\n  The Parliamentarian advises the Chair and the Chair rules. And if the \nSenate wants to get involved it then proceeds thereafter to say we do \nnot like the decision, we will overrule it.\n   [[Page S991]] The Parliamentarian determines whether a question is \ndivisible. The Parliamentarian also determines questions about \nextraneous provisions under the Byrd rule. We do not send that to the \nBudget Committee to make that determination. We do not send it to the \nGovernment Ops Committee. We send it to the desk and the \nParliamentarian informs the Chair based upon precedent, based upon \nlanguage. The Chair says that matter is extraneous.\n  And then who makes the final decision? The final decision is made by \nthe Senate of the United States.\n  What we are doing by adopting the so-called Domenici amendment is \nsaying: This bill creates no new authority in any committee to \ndetermine the relevancy of an amendment or a bill or resolution--that \nis, is it a mandate or not. It creates no new authority. We rely on the \ndefinitions and the exceptions and approach the Chair. If somebody \nbrings something down here and we are wondering whether it is really a \nmandate, we will just have to say I raise a point of order. I will read \nit and then read the language that is in here, in the bill itself, and \nsay this seems not to be a mandate.\n  The Parliamentarian will do what he does on many such occasions and \nadvise the Chair. And then we will proceed as I have described before.\n  Let me get to the cost issue. Frankly, I think the role of the Budget \nCommittee and the Budget Committee's chairman or chairperson--the role \nis not quite understood. The reason the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee has a role is because he has the Congressional Budget Office \nstanding behind him. It is not his role, but the role of the \nCongressional Budget Office, CBO, to furnish the information under the \nBudget Act that is to do the numerical evaluation. The chairman then \ndelivers that to the Parliamentarian and says here is what CBO says.\n  The Parliamentarian then says to the Presiding Officer: CBO says \nthis. We are obliged to accept CBO's information, unless the Senate \nchanges it, this is the ruling. And the Chair so rules.\n  What is the chairman of the Budget Committee going to do when we have \nstricken the language? He is going to do the same thing with reference \nto what? With reference to having the CBO standing behind him or her, \nbecause they are charged with doing the economic evaluation and coming \nup with what? With dollar numbers. They are going to say this mandate \nonly will cost local government $42 million. They are going to say \nthat.\n  The chairman is going to take it up to the Chair. What is the \nchairman going to tell the Parliamentarian? ``Mr. Parliamentarian, they \nsay 42. The statute says unless it exceeds 50 it is not subject to the \npoint of order.''\n  And the Parliamentarian will not take my word or the chairman's word. \nThe Parliamentarian will read it and he will turn around and say to the \nChair, ``The Congressional Budget Office, whom we are bound to accept \nnumbers from on this, has spoken. And they say 42.'' He will say to the \nChair, ``This does not come within the purview.'' Let us not have any \nmore mandates unless we pay for them.\n  What is the other role? The other role has to do with when the CBO \nsays it is going to cost $250 million. Therefore it is within the \npurview of the mandate legislation.\n  What is the chairman of the Budget Committee going to do when the \nDomenici amendment is adopted that does not give this authority to \nanyone new--no new committee, no new chairman? The very same thing. He \nwill be backed up by the CBO, who will tell him $250 million. He will \ncarry it to the Chair in the same manner I have described.\n  The second part of this legislation has to do with regulations on \nbusiness. Therein, there are no points of order but, again, we have to \nknow what we are doing before we pass the legislation. And to know what \nwe are doing requires that we actually understand the economic impacts.\n  Where are we to get them? We are not going to get them from a \ncommittee. No committee has final determination of that. The Government \nOps, Foreign Affairs, Budget--we get them from the Congressional Budget \nOffice. Because that is what this bill says. The chairman will bring \nthat, through the Parliamentarian, to the Chair; and thus from the \nChair the Senate will be advised.\n  So frankly I do not believe we need to change the practices. I \nbelieve we have the Congressional Budget Office and the Parliamentarian \ninterpreting the intent of legislation vis-a-vis definitions in this \nbill or exclusions in this bill and we communicate those in one way or \nanother. And we are suggesting that we have had 20 years of experience \nin communicating it through the CBO--from the CBO, through the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, to the Parliamentarian, to the Senate through \nthe Chair, through the Presiding Officer.\n  So I would think that the issue here has both support of the chairman \nof Government Operations, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Exon, whom I will yield to momentarily, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee--and I hope we will dispose of this amendment without \ntaking a lot of time tonight. But clearly that is not for me to decide. \nI do not intend to try to use any more time than I absolutely feel is \nnecessary for me. With that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time is needed in \nsupport of the amendment offered by myself and Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee and the amendment unanimously recommended by the \nBudget Committee regarding the role of the Budget and Governmental \nAffairs Committee in the application of this legislation.\n  My friend and colleague, the Senator from New Mexico, makes a lot of \nsense. When we write legislation such as the broad fresh brush of this \nlegislation, we must be vigilant not to set dangerous precedents. \nUnfortunately in one very troubling area, we have let down our guard. \nGranting the Government Affairs Committee sole jurisdiction to \ndetermine whether or not a piece of legislation is an unfunded mandate \nis a very dangerous precedent. However, if we strike the Budget \nCommittee amendment we would be vesting in one committee, the \nGovernment Affairs Committee, the authority to make final \ndeterminations on the applications of a point of order.\n  I am very uncomfortable with such a radical change. I have always \nrelied on the good wisdom of the Parliamentarian on such matters and \nthat is the time-tested course of action we should take with us on S. \n1. Currently, for all other points of order under the Budget Act, the \nChair turns to the Parliamentarian for any such determination of law. \nThe Senate Parliamentarian's office is staffed with skilled and able \nlawyers, learned in the precedents of the Senate. They do an admirable \njob, often on very short notice. When the Parliamentarian determines \nthat the budget estimates are required, the Parliamentarian turns to \nthe Budget Committee as required by the Budget Act.\n  I am not a lawyer. But for my colleagues who are lawyers, I am \nadvised that the Parliamentarian decides questions of law much as does \na judge in a trial. The role of the Budget Committee is limited by law \nand precedent to questions of fact, not questions of law. The Budget \nCommittee merely provides the budgetary numbers to the Parliamentarian, \nwho then takes these numbers into account in advising the Chair. This \nsystem has worked well for 20 years. Over the years, the Chairs of the \nBudget Committee have fulfilled this advisory role with objectivity and \nwithout regard to partisan advantage. By and large, the Chair of the \ncommittee merely passes along a Congressional Budget Office estimate \nand only rarely does an analyst for the committee have to extrapolate \nfrom such estimates.\n  I have full confidence that Senator Domenici will continue to fulfill \nthis role with objectivity and evenhandedness now that he has regained \nthe chair of the committee. He did that previously. I think he will do \nso again. But let me say parenthetically that I shall be sure to point \nout most vocally any instance in which he does not.\n  Let me also say that it is altogether fitting that a single Senator \nbe charged with this estimating responsibility. \n[[Page S992]] The Presiding Officer must be able to turn to someone in \nthe Chamber who can provide these estimates, sometimes long after the \nCongressional Budget Office has gone home for the night. Giving two \ncommittees this authority would almost certainly lead to confused \nadvice to the Parliamentarian. The Chair must know who to turn to, as \nthey have in the past, on such matters.\n  The amendment proposed by the chairman of the Budget Committee and \nunanimously approved by that committee would merely continue that \npractice, indeed. If the language slipped into the draft of S. 1 that \nthis amendment corrects were merely dropped and there were no \nreferences to the committees at all, the Parliamentarian would continue \nhis practice of turning to the Budget Committee for budgetary \nestimates. What is more reasonable than that?\n  I believe stripping the Domenici amendment from the bill would \nneedlessly complicate the enforcement procedures in S. 1. With the \nDomenici amendment, we have the right mechanism to enforce violations \nof S. 1. Why clutter it up with a very cumbersome, clumsy, and untested \nprocess? The Budget Committee has for 20 years done this. They have the \nexperience in dealing with language such as that contained in S. 1. We \nhave served as the liaison with the Congressional Budget Office to \nprovide the Parliamentarian with CBO cost estimates for all of that \nperiod.\n  Mr. President, there is no compelling reason to set such a dangerous \nprecedent as that suggested by the underlying governmental affairs \nlanguage. There is no compelling reason to grant one Senate committee \nsuch unprecedented power over matters better left to the \nParliamentarian. There is no compelling reason to change what is not \nbroken.\n  I urge my colleagues to accept the Budget Committee's amendment as \nunanimously accepted by the Budget Committee and clearly endorsed by \nSenator Roth, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n                    s.1 and budget committee's role\n\n  Mr. ROTH. The Budget Committee's amendment strikes the roles of both \nthe Budget Committee and the Governmental Affairs Committee in making \ndeterminations regarding the point of order in this bill. The bill \nwould, with the amendment, become silent on how these determinations \nshould be made. I wonder if the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee would respond as to how the determinations of levels of \nmandates would be made under this legislation?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be happy to respond to the distinguished \nchairman's question. First of all, the Budget Act generally provides \nthat the determinations of budget levels for the purposes of Budget Act \npoints of order are based on estimates made by the Budget Committee. In \npractice, the Budget Committee works with CBO to provide these \nestimates to the Presiding Officer for the purposes of determining \nwhether a point of order lies against legislation. In those instances \nwhere a CBO estimate is not available, the Presiding Officer turns to \nthe Budget Committee for an estimate.\n  While this legislation does not explicitly give the Budget Committee \nthis authority. I do not think this authority is necessary. The Budget \nAct generally assigns this responsibility to the Budget Committee. The \ncommittee's intent in this amendment is that the Presiding Officer \ncontinue to seek the advice of the Budget Committee for a determination \nof the budgetary levels in order to determine whether legislation \nviolates this point of order.\n  Mr. ROTH. I understand that the Budget Committee would retain \nauthority for making estimates for the purposes of determining the \nlevels of mandates, but some may still have a question about the impact \nof striking the Governmental Affairs Committee's role. By striking the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee's role in the bill, are we now giving \nthe Budget Committee the authority to determine what constitutes a \nmandate?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The determination on what constitutes a mandate would \nreside with the Presiding Officer. The Budget Committee's role would be \nlimited to providing estimates on mandate levels.\n  Mr. ROTH. I wonder if the distinguished ranking minority member of \nthe committee, the senior Senator from Nebraska, could respond to these \nquestions?\n  Mr. EXON. I concur with the remarks made by the Senator from New \nMexico. Let me reiterate several points. In this legislation, the \nauthority given to the Budget Committee for the purpose of determining \nestimates coincides with the authority already granted by the Budget \nAct. The Budget Committee would continue to work with the Congressional \nBudget Office to produce the estimates of mandate levels. This bill \ngrants the committee no new authority.\n  The Presiding Officer would have the final determination as to the \napplicability of this legislation. The Budget Committee would not be \ninvolved in this process. The committee's role would be confined to \nproviding estimates.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I would like to respond to my friend from \nNebraska briefly because I think there is some misunderstanding about \nwhat the provisions in this bill are, as well as to how the provisions \nwere put into the bill. Nothing was slipped into, as he said, S. 1. \nNothing was slipped into S. 1. It was in the bill submitted to the \ncommittee. We did not put it in. It was not an amendment in committee. \nIt was placed into the legislation in the original language of the \nbill.\n  A little while ago, the statement was made that this particular \nportion of the language was introduced in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. That is just not true. The language was put in as a part of \nthe original legislation that was submitted, the part on page 25.\n  So any indication that something was slipped into S. 1, as though we \nwere trying to get somebody else's jurisdiction, is just flat not true. \nThere was basically an agreement made by all parties that were working \non this bill that the division of responsibilities on this would be \nthat the costs would be gone through and would be monitored by the \nBudget Committee. I had no objection to that. The mandates part of \nthis, though, was part of the responsibilities the Senate, in our \nwritten instructions to the committee, the intergovernmental relations \npart, should be a responsibility of the Governmental Affairs Committee. \nThere was no taking of somebody else's jurisdiction; quite the \nopposite.\n  What is in the bill now is that the amendment would provide for \ntaking responsibility away from the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nwhere it logically resides and where Senate instructions would normally \nbe interpreted, where it should reside, and give it to the \nParliamentarian to make a judgment on what is a mandate or what is not \na mandate.\n  I did not object to making this an amendment to the Budget Act. I did \nnot expect at that point that making it a part of the Budget Act would \nmean that the Budget Committee then would insist that the mandates part \nof this or a judgment on the mandates part would be taken away from the \nresponsibilities of the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  If this makes sense, then let me make one other reference to change \nthat was made and is included in the language on page 27 of the bill. \nIt is in heavy print. This was not in the original bill. It \nspecifically gives the responsibility for making cost judgments over in \nthe House to the Budget Committee. And also in the House, on any \njudgment regarding mandates, it gives that responsibility to the House \nCommittee on Governmental Reform and Oversight.\n  That was not in the original bill. That is, the Budget Committee here \nthat we are mandating to the House that the Budget Committee over there \nwill take up costs, and that the Committee on Governmental Reform and \nOversight will deal with mandates. That was not even in the original \nbill.\n  So we are saying: House of Representatives, here is how you have to \ntake up this legislation, and here is the division of responsibilities \non making judgments on it.\n   [[Page S993]] At the same time, we come to the Senate, and instead \nof having the comparable committees in the Senate responsible for \nsimilar judgments over here, we say what is OK on the Budget Committee \nover here, we take it away from Governmental Affairs and give it to the \nParliamentarian. Over in the House, you specifically made changes to \nprovide specifically where the responsibilities would go and made them \ndifferent than here in the Senate. I think that is wrong.\n  I do not see why we specify that over there. If it is so wrong here, \nwhy is it so right in the House of Representatives? I just do not see \nthe logic of this at all. So what the Budget Committee did in its \nmarkup was to vitiate an agreement that we had made prior to the \nintroduction of the bill. There was no language introduced in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee at all. This all came out of the changes \nthat the Budget Committee insisted upon. I am sorry that our committee \nchairman, Senator Roth, has left the floor because all this language we \nare talking about here was in the bill over there. Yet, he did not \ndisagree with it in committee. He voted for the bill coming out of \ncommittee, supported the bill, moved it to the floor and wanted a vote \non it. I was for that. I did not disagree.\n  We had lost on several amendments we proposed that we thought would \nhave made it stronger over there. Now we come to the floor and suddenly \nwhat is good for the House of Representatives, in the wisdom of the \nBudget Committee in giving it to the oversight committee over there, \njurisdiction over mandates and jurisdiction over costs over there, when \nthey come out of CBO; yet when we come to the Senate, we say the Budget \nCommittee would consider costs over here. I do not quarrel with that \none bit. I think that is a logical place to be.\n  Suddenly, for reasons beyond my understanding, the Budget Committee \ntells the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, without any action on \nthe Senate floor, your jurisdiction is down the tubes, and it goes to \nthe Parliamentarian. It does not make any sense to me. That is the \nreason I think we were dealt with very unfairly over here.\n  I will not ask the Parliamentarian, but I do not know whether the \nParliamentarian prefers to have this particular responsibility, as a \nmatter of fact. This puts an enormous responsibility on the \nParliamentarian that is supposed to rule on Senate order and rules and \nnot get off into the legislative function of making judgments that no \nParliamentarian in the Senate has ever made except on points of order \nprovided under the Budget Act. We are giving House committees specific \nresponsibilities, but we are saying the Senate cannot have those same \nresponsibilities in our comparable committees. So that is the reason I \nget exercised on this when I think it is a little bit ridiculous. I \nrepeat that this was not something slipped into S. 1, as my colleague \nreferred to. This was in the bill as submitted to the committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, it may be a misunderstanding and we may be \ntalking by each other on some of these matters. I simply point out what \nI think the ranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee just \nalluded to, and that is the fact that what we are trying to do is leave \nthe process the way it was. There can be no argument but what if you \nwould follow the position taken by the ranking member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, we would not be making a change. The \nnormal order is for the Parliamentarian to rule. The Governmental \nAffairs Committee bill would differ with that and change it. We \nobjected to this Governmental Affairs proposal during negotiations. We \ndid not control the process. They said they would take out the \nlanguage, as we understood it, between meetings of the staff.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EXON. I will say this, and then I will be glad to yield. I also \nsimply say that with regard to the House of Representatives, we merely \nincluded what we understood our colleagues in the House wanted to do. \nWe do not choose to impose any solution on the House of \nRepresentatives. We think we are doing here what our colleagues in the \nHouse want to do. Also whether it is unanimously agreed to over there \nor not, I know not. I simply say that I am not confusing the ranking \nmember of the Governmental Affairs Committee in bad faith. It might be \nthat we are talking past each other.\n  I simply point out that S. 993 did not include the Governmental \nAffairs' language that is in S. 1 that we are asked to vote on. So a \nchange, therefore, has been made. Maybe there is some misunderstanding \non the part of the Governmental Affairs Committee on this. I simply \npoint out, Mr. President, that not only the total Budget Committee--\nMembers on both sides of the aisle, including myself as the ranking \nDemocratic Member, and Chairman Domenici, and our position is supported \nby Senator Roth, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nsupport the amendment. I would like at this time, Mr. President--and \nthen I will yield and be glad to respond to any questions from my \nfriend from Ohio that I might--to refer to part of a colloquy that will \nbe included in the Record, which indicates a question Senator Roth \nasked me as part of the colloquy, and my response was--I hope this \nmight help clear up the matter--``I concur with the remarks made by the \nSenator from New Mexico. Let me reiterate several points. In this \nlegislation, the authority given to the Budget Committee for the \npurpose of determining estimates coincides with the authority already \ngranted in the Budget Act. The Budget Committee would continue to work \nwith the Congressional Budget Office to produce the estimates of \nmandated levels. The bill grants the committee no new authority. The \nPresiding Officer would have the final determination as to the \napplicability of the legislation. The Budget Committee would not be \ninvolved in that process. The committee's role would be confined to \nproviding estimates, which is a role the committee has always played, \nand we hope the Senate, by supporting the amendment offered by the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, will continue in that traditional \nrole.''\n  Mr. GLENN. The Senator from Nebraska answered the question I was \ngoing to ask. But I do not understand yet why it is right for the \nSenate to dictate to the House, when it is in the legislation what the \njurisdictions of different committees will be.\n  My friend from Nebraska says, ``We understand they wanted it that \nway.'' Well, I do not automatically accede to the House having \nlegislation over there that says, well, we think somebody in the Senate \nwants it, so that is the way we will do it. Yet, we dictate in this \nthing very specifically. The language is even almost identical from one \npart to the other in the language that provides for the assignment of \nresponsibilities here in the Senate. It was in the legislation. And \nthat is over in the House. Yet, we very specifically said, by action of \nthe Budget Committee, OK, that is alright over in the House, we agree \nwith that in the House. This is a logical definition of where things \nshould go in the House. In the Senate we have to take the \nresponsibility away from the Governmental Affairs Committee that, by \nthe rules of the Senate, deals with matters of intergovernmental \nrelations up and down the line, and we are going to take that \nresponsibility away, without saying anything about it, and put it in \nthis legislation and give that authority to the Parliamentarian. I just \nthink that is illogical. I cannot accept the explanation by my friend \nfrom Nebraska as to exactly why we are doing this when it seems to me \nso logically in the other direction. If it is logical for assigning \nthis to the House the way we did, then it is logical to assign it to \nthe Senate the way we did.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, as we may be beginning to make progress on \nthis, maybe we can agree to this amendment. I advise my friend from \nOhio that this Senator did not negotiate with the House of \nRepresentatives on this matter. I understand that the majority side has \nbeen negotiating with them. I have been told by the majority side that \nthe House of Representatives endorses and wants us to leave this \nmatter. We are checking on that right now. I hope that I can reach \nSenator Domenici so he can come back on the floor, since I believe it \nwas he or one of the Republican members of the Budget Committee who did \nthe actual negotiations with the House on this and not \n[[Page S994]] this Senator, or as far as I know any Democrat or \nminority member of the Budget Committee.\n  Let me emphasize once again that the Budget Committee has always \nfollowed the procedure, as has the Senate for 20 years, that when \nmatters with regard to points of order have been raised on the figures \nsupplied to the Budget Committee--which most people would agree is the \nauthority on this, has the staff to follow it, and has the \nresponsibility to work with CBO to get exact numbers--that those \nmatters have traditionally been decided by the Parliamentarian, \nadvising the Chair. We simply want to leave that the way it has always \nbeen and not change it.\n  I hope that we will have a more definitive answer to the legitimate \nquestion raised by the Senator from Ohio with regard to what is the \npleasure of the House of Representatives on this matter. It was not our \nintention to be doing anything except to try to parallel the processes \nthat will be necessary to work out, I suggest, some parliamentary \nquestions that are going to be raised and to which points of order \nmight lie. In that instance, the Parliamentarian would be advising the \nPresiding Officer as to what the situation was.\n  I emphasize again, as has Senator Domenici and as has Senator Roth, \nthe chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, that all we are \ndoing is trying to leave this the way it was.\n  Now, I happen to think that the Budget Committee should legitimately \nplay a role when budgetary matters are considered, and it is simply the \nposition of the Budget Committee that we should leave well enough alone \nand not try to fix something that is not broken.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I agree completely with what the Senator \nfrom Nebraska just said. I do not propose to change the point of order \nat all. We do not change that. There is nothing about a point of order \nin this particular section of this thing. It has worked well for 20 \nyears. I agree with that, with the Budget Committee, with the cost \nestimate and whether points of order lie, and the Parliamentarian makes \nthat judgment.\n  What we are talking about is what happens when it is not clear as to \nwhat is a mandate and what is not. Now, I think this problem would \noccur only very infrequently. I think most of the legislation put in \nwill appear to be very clear when there is a mandate or when there is \nnot a mandate.\n  But what happens when there is a question about what is a mandate or \nwhat is not a mandate? That is the question.\n  We do not propose to change the point of order that has worked well \nfor 20 years. I agree with that. The language we are talking about here \nhas nothing to do with points of order. It has to do with who makes the \ndetermination on what is a mandate and what is not.\n  Over in the House, by the wisdom of the Budget Committee here, we \ngive that authority to the Budget Reform and Oversight Committee in the \nHouse to make that determination in the few times it may come up. We \nsee no reason why over here that should not be in the committee that \nhas the assigned jurisdiction over intergovernmental matters--Federal, \nState, and local--assigned by the rules of the Senate, and the \ncommittee does its best to carry those out.\n  So I submit it does not have anything to do with points of order. I \nsupport the points of order, the procedure we have had in the Senate \nfor 20 years. I see nothing wrong with that. This is a whole different \nmatter from that.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, with regard to the question of whether the \nParliamentarian can do what this bill would ask him to do, let me say \nthat we have given the Parliamentarian even more difficult tasks in the \npast than this one.\n  For example, the Byrd rule that we are familiar with, on extraneous \nmatters on reconciliation bills, which are very important, and it is a \nvery complicated statute that requires many decisions of law.\n  Furthermore, the War Powers Resolution, to cite another example, \nrequires the Parliamentarian to make hard choices.\n  In the Senate, the Parliamentarian can consult with whatever \ncommittee he wishes.\n  The point that we are making here as members of the Budget Committee, \nsupported by the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, is \nthat the process in place has worked well.\n  Why do we find ourselves in this debate that has taken the last \nhour's time of the Senate? Because we are passing an important new \npiece of legislation called S. 1, which has to do with mandates on \ngovernmental agencies. What we are simply saying, Mr. President, is \nthat we are not trying to interfere at all with the responsibility that \nwe in the Budget Committee recognize fully is in the prerogative and \nresponsibilities of the Governmental Affairs Committee with regard to \nthe affairs of different levels of Government.\n  What we are simply saying, Mr. President, is that we, as a Budget \nCommittee, feel that we should leave well enough alone with regard to \npoints of order that would affect the budget. We think that it has \nworked very well to leave that authority completely in the hands of the \nPresiding Officer with the advice and counsel of the Parliamentarian. \nIt has worked well in the past and we want to continue it that way.\n  I suggest, absolutely, that we think there is a matter of \njurisdiction here, but more important than the matter of jurisdiction \nis keeping a system in place that works well. We still feel that the \nattempts by the Senator from Ohio, the ranking member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, would complicate a process that we \nthink has worked very well under the jurisdiction of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Now, I would certainly emphasize once again that if we have a point \nof order--and we hope that the Presiding Officer, under the advice of \nthe Parliamentarian, would go back to the Budget Committee for the \nexact figures and numbers--there is nothing to say that if it is the \nopinion of the Chair or the Parliamentarian that other committees \nshould also be consulted about this, then that would be something that \ncould be done.\n  I will simply say that what we are objecting to is the specific \ninclusion of the provision the Governmental Affairs Committee is trying \nto get approved in this legislation. That is why we have offered the \namendment authored by the Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, and supported by Senator Roth, the chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n  I hope with that background, Mr. President, that we could come to a \nvote quite soon on this. I hope and I urge the Senate to support the \nrecommendations made unanimously by the Budget Committee, by the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Domenici, by myself, the ranking \nmember, and strongly supported also by the chairman of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, the distinguished Senator from Delaware.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to comment on some of \nthe remarks of my friend from Nebraska by making a parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  I make the inquiry of the Chair as to whether the Parliamentarian has \npreviously ruled as to whether or not language in a bill or an \namendment has constituted a mandate on State and local governments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Parliamentarian has not so ruled.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Now, when we say, ``Just keep doing it the way we have \ndone it before,'' let us understand what we are talking about.\n  We have a Budget Act--and I will get to that in a minute, because the \nBudget Act makes specific references to the Budget Committee.\n  I will come to that one in a minute. What we have heard on this issue \nis just leave it the way it has been done. Let the Parliamentarian rule \nthe way he has ruled for 20 years on these points of order.\n   [[Page S995]] The Parliamentarian has never ruled on whether or not \nthere is an intergovernmental mandate. The Parliamentarian has never \nruled, and I will make this a parliamentary inquiry of the Chair, Has \nthe Parliamentarian ever ruled whether or not a provision in a bill \nrequires compliance with accounting and auditing procedures with \nrespect to grants or other money or property provided by the U.S. \nGovernment? Have we ever had a ruling like that from the \nParliamentarian?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I can go on and on through these \nexemptions. I think the point is clear. We are skating out on a new \npond.\n  The Parliamentarian has never ruled on these issues, whether or not \nlanguage constitutes a mandate; whether or not, because it is an \nexception to the requirement provision if a bill enforces the \nconstitutional rights of individuals, establishes or enforces a \nstatutory right that prohibits discrimination based on rights. I can go \nthrough all of these with the Parliamentarian but I know the answer.\n  This is a new process that is being undertaken. The Parliamentarian \nhas not ruled on this type of thing before. And we are asking the \nParliamentarian to undertake on every bill, resolution, amendment, et \ncetera, every one, subject to a point of order. This is not just a Byrd \nrule on reconciliation. This is not just a War Powers Act.\n  I agree the Parliamentarian has some difficult decisions to make. I \nfully agree with my good friend from Nebraska on that issue. This is on \nevery bill that comes to this floor, every amendment that comes to this \nfloor, the Parliamentarian will have to rule as to whether or not there \nis a mandate on that. Because if there is, it is out of order.\n  When I say he will have to rule, he may have to rule on every bill. \nHe may have to rule, and will have to, if somebody raises a point of \norder. But if the language which exempts local government from paying \nfor a mandate is not in a bill or resolution, and if it does not have \nthat other language relative to the appropriations, and if it does not \nhave an estimate, it is subject to a point of order. Anybody can raise \na point of order on every amendment, every bill, that comes to this \nfloor.\n  The Parliamentarian, for the first time in history, is going to have \nto rule as to whether or not language in a bill constitutes an \nintergovernmental mandate. The Parliamentarian has never ruled on \nanything like that before. We have just heard from the Parliamentarian \nthrough the Chair. I could go on and on and on, by the way, as to other \nelements of the bill which constitute exceptions to the mandate \nrequirement where the Parliamentarian has never ruled. The argument \nthat, look, this thing has worked for 20 years, why change a good \nthing, does not work when it comes to the question of what constitutes \na mandate or an exception to the mandate requirement. The argument \nsimply is not applicable to that.\n  Now, should the Parliamentarian on that issue consult with \nGovernmental Affairs? I use the term ``consult'' with Governmental \nAffairs? I think the answer is ``yes.'' I think we ought to provide \nlanguage which, in effect, says that. That is the intent of the \nlanguage which is in the bill which would be struck by the Budget \nCommittee amendment.\n  While my dear friend from Nebraska is on his feet I am wondering \nwhether or not I might have unanimous consent to ask the Senator from \nNebraska a question and not lose my right to the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the Chairman \nof the Budget Committee and to the ranking member, Senator Exon.\n  Is it my understanding that the way the Senator from Nebraska reads \nthis bill, that the Budget Committee is bound to accept the estimate of \nthe Congressional Budget Office relative to the cost of an \nintergovernmental mandate, and is simply the transmission belt or the \nliaison to transmit the data from the Congressional Budget Office?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the answer to my very dear friend is that, \nno, the Budget Committee does not have to accept in toto the dollars \nand cents on anything submitted by the Congressional Budget Office to \nthe Budget Committee.\n  But for all practical purposes, we do it that way.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nebraska.\n  Now, the next question would be, is the Parliamentarian bound under \nthe Budget Act to accept the figures given to it by the Budget \nCommittee?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, my answer would be that obviously I would \nthink that since the Parliamentarian does not have an estimating \norganization under his control, I would think the precedent, as the \nSenator from Michigan fully well knows, that the Parliamentarian would \ngo along with whatever information he had at hand from the reliable \nsource which we think in this instance is the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, is it the Senator's understanding of the \nBudget Act that in determining a figure under the Budget Act in ruling \non scoring, for instance, that the Parliamentarian must accept the \nfigure given to it by the Budget Committee?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am not an authority on that as the Senator \nfrom Michigan knows. I am not a lawyer so I cannot give him a \nlegalistic answer to the question.\n  I would simply amplify what I said before: in practice, that is the \nway it has always worked. It has worked very, very well. We do not \nthink it should change.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me make a parliamentary question, \nwhether or not under the Budget Act the Parliamentarian is required to \naccept the scoring figure from the Senate Budget Committee?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Budget Act does authorize the \nParliamentarian to accept the figures given by that Budget Committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My parliamentary inquiry is, is the Parliamentarian bound \nto accept the figure from the Senate Budget Committee?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Where the law authorizes the Budget Committee \nto make those estimates, the Parliamentarian is then obliged to accept \nthose estimates.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Now, that becomes a very critical point because the law in many \nplaces does not just simply throw the budget number at the \nParliamentarian and say, ``here, you figure it up.'' It assigns that \nresponsibility to the Budget Committee.\n  I was interested in the Senator from New Mexico's comment about \nleaving this to the Parliamentarian, as though the law assigns certain \nresponsibilities to the Budget Committee. The way I read the law, the \nfour references out of the five in the Budget Committee's report, it is \nthe Budget Committee--not the Parliamentarian, but the Budget \nCommittee--which makes the determination at the budget level when there \nis a point of order.\n  Suddenly, it becomes unnecessary to be specific about assigning this \nfunction to the Budget Committee. Why are we shy here about assigning \nthe same function to the Budget Committee, which is to try to figure \nout what a mandate costs, when we have made that same assignment to the \nBudget Committee--not the Parliamentarian--to the Budget Committee over \nand over and over and over again, in the Budget Act? I said four \n``overs'' because I got four sections of the Budget Act.\n  For instance, section 311(C) for purposes of this section, and this \nis a point of order section, ``the levels of new budget authority, \nbudget outlays, new entitlement authority and revenue for fiscal year \nshall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the committee on \nthe budget of the House of Representatives or of the Senate,'' as the \ncase may be. Why are we shy about doing it in this bill?\n  Why are we shy about being explicit in this bill the way we have been \nexplicit over and over again in the Budget Act, assigning a \nresponsibility to the Budget Committee, so it is clear?\n  Do we want to leave ambiguity--there is enough ambiguity in this bill \nalready, I must say. We have a new point of order which is incredibly \ncomplex which, in many instances, is going to be made against a bill \nfor not containing an estimate which cannot be made. A point of order \nis going to lie \n[[Page S996]] against a bill for not containing an estimate when we \nknow now some estimates cannot be made. We have been told by the Budget \nOffice. And yet a point of order is going to lie.\n  We are creating a point of order for the absence of something which \ncannot be supplied. That is pretty complicated for being straight with \nourselves and with all those local officials and State Governors. It is \npretty complicated. We know it cannot be supplied at times, and yet we \nare telling them that a point of order is going to be made for the \nfailure to supply an estimate which is impossible to be made. You watch \nthose points of order being waived like mad down the road. But that is \nneither here nor there. The point is we have a complicated bill.\n  We have a complicated bill with a new point of order which was not in \nlast year's bill. And, by the way, the reason for the language which \nthe Senator from Nebraska objects to in the bill and seeks to strike \nthrough the Budget Committee amendment is, there is a new point of \norder and there was an effort made to clarify who would make a \ndetermination.\n  Do we want to just leave it to the Parliamentarian and kid ourselves? \nThe Parliamentarian is not in a position to determine how much it would \ncost 87,000 local governments to put in a new scrubber on an \nincinerator to get rid of mercury. Come on. That is not the job of a \nParliamentarian. The Parliamentarian is going to be handed a number by \nthe Budget Committee and they will have been given a number, maybe, if \nwe are lucky, by the CBO. That is the way it is going to happen, just \nthe way the Senator from Nebraska has indicated. The CBO will try to \nmake an estimate. If it cannot, precedent is the Budget Committee is \njust going to be the liaison, the transmission belt. Even though \nlegally, I think the Senator from Nebraska is correct, it is not \nobligated to do so, it will as a matter of precedent.\n  But this is a very, very complicated bill, and we should not leave \nambiguity on purpose. We should not leave it on purpose. If it is going \nto be the Senate Budget Committee which is going to make a \ndetermination and hand it to the Parliamentarian, let us say it is the \nBudget Committee. Let us just say it. We do it in other places in the \nBudget Act. I read one of them, and I will not read the other. There \nare many places in the Budget Act. We say that the Budget Committee \nshall make the estimate.\n  We know where the Budget Committee gets it. That is where they should \nget it: the Congressional Budget Office. That is exactly the right \nplace to look. But why be ambiguous.\n  I was intrigued by the committee report of the Budget Committee, \nwhere it says that:\n\n       The committee does not believe that the authority needs to \n     be explicitly stated . . .\n\n  Why?\n\n       In the absence of a CBO estimate--\n\n  Here they talk about an absence of an estimate, which is news to me \nbecause we did not think it was possible. Now there is acknowledgement \nthere may not be one.\n\n     the committee intends that the determinations of levels of \n     mandates be based on estimates provided by the Senate Budget \n     Committee.\n\n  The argument here is you do not have to make it explicit because it \nis implicit that the Senate Budget Committee is going to give to the \nParliamentarian the figures, if it has any, from the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  What everybody knows would happen. That is what my friend from \nNebraska referred to when he said it has worked for 20 years. Estimates \ncome in from the Congressional Budget Office to the Budget Committee, \nthe Budget Committee hands them over to the Parliamentarian, and the \nParliamentarian rules. But we have been explicit about that. We have \nsaid that the estimates would be made by the Budget Committee.\n  One of the sections which is being stricken by the amendment before \nus makes it clear that it is the Senate Budget Committee which will \nmake the estimate. I do not know why there is any reluctance to do \nthat. It has been done over and over again.\n  But I think what the Senator from Nebraska is saying is that there is \nsome reluctance to have the Governmental Affairs Committee be involved \non the question of whether or not there is a mandate. This is no longer \na question of the number of or the cost of something. This is now a \nquestion of whether or not there is a mandate at all. The cost issues \nunder the language of the bill are left for the two committees. How \nmuch is for Budget; whether it was left to the Governmental Affairs.\n  I believe that it is proper for Governmental Affairs to be at least \nconsulted--at least consulted--on the question of whether or not an \nintergovernmental mandate exists when the Parliamentarian has had no \nexperience in doing that, and I think properly should not be put in a \nposition where they are going to have to make decisions of this nature.\n  So I hope that the committee amendment from the Budget Committee will \nbe defeated and that we can work out some language which would at least \nrequire consultation with the Governmental Affairs Committee on the \nquestion of whether there is a mandate or whether or not there is an \nexclusion from the mandate, leaving it to the Budget Committee to, \nagain, determine the amount of the cost, which is the traditional thing \nthat the Budget Committee has determined.\n  So I thank my friend from Nebraska for responding to my questions, \nand I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have listened with keen interest to my \nfriend from Michigan and the points he has made.\n  I will simply reply that in the first interest, several sections vest \nthe Budget Committee with decisions on matters of fact, not matters of \nlaw. Under the situations we are talking about, the Parliamentarian is \nthe chief legal advisor to the Presiding Officer. He is the official in \nwhom we should vest this power. I believe from the beginning that is \nwhat we intended to do. It is inappropriate to vest that power in \nanother committee.\n  I will simply say that the Senator from Michigan could have conducted \na similar set of inquiries with regard to any new point of order. Of \ncourse, the Parliamentarian has not ruled on a point of order that has \nnot yet been adopted or enacted into law. I do not know that there \nwould be a different ruling from a Parliamentarian in the future, but I \nhope that that Parliamentarian will continue to rule on the precedents \nof the past.\n  But neither does the Governmental Affairs Committee have any \nexpertise at all in this matter. And certainly I would simply say to \nthe U.S. Senate that regardless of the twists and turns of this matter, \nand regardless of this debate, which has carried not so much on the \nspecifics of the amendment offered by the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici from New Mexico, but has carried over into \nsome concerns that I know the Senator from Michigan has on the whole \nmatter of mandates and how they are going to be enforced.\n  I simply say that those kinds of considerations and arguments that \nare going to be made in very articulate fashion, I suggest, by my \nfriend from Michigan, probably refer to--and may be appropriate on--\npassage of the whole mandate bill. I have talked with the Senator from \nMichigan. He has done a lot of research on this. I was very much \ninterested and impressed with the information that has been brought to \nhis attention in the form of a letter, after inquiry by the Senator \nfrom Michigan, from the Congressional Budget Office that raises a whole \nset of new questions about whether or not CBO can make these estimates, \nand they have said in some instances they have no way of making these \nestimates.\n  I believe part of the argument that is being made against the \namendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico are arguments that \nwill be made along the same lines, but possibly in a little different \nfashion, by the Senator from Michigan. The Senator from Michigan talks \nabout allowing consultation with the Government Affairs Committee. I \nhave no objection to that. But the language of the bill provides no \nsuch compromise. The bill says that the Government Affairs Committee, \n``shall have the authority to make the final determination.'' That is \nwhat we are trying \n[[Page S997]] to strike in the pending committee amendment.\n  It is open to a compromise, I suggest, regarding consultation. But to \nget to the compromise first we have to adopt the Budget Committee \namendment to page 25 that strikes the exclusive power--and I emphasize, \nMr. President, exclusive power--of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nthat they want to maintain as they wrote S. 1, and is a part that the \nBudget Committee and chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee is \ntrying to correct for the reasons that we have outlined.\n  The basic reason is why change a system that has worked well? Leave \nwell enough alone. That is the heart of the argument. And that is why \nwe hope the Senate will adopt the amendment offered by the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I had hoped and had agreed earlier, a couple of hours \nago, on a time agreement--an hour equally divided. I think the Record \nwill clearly show the Senator from Nebraska felt, when we started this \ndebate, we were on controlled time. I find out later that has not been \nthe case.\n  May I suggest in the interests of moving the Senate along in \nexpeditious fashion, since we have been on this a long time and I \nsuspect not a great deal new is going to be said pro and con on the \namendment by the Senator from New Mexico, that we agree to, I suggest, \na 20-minute extension of time equally divided from this time forward \nand then have a vote? Is there any objection to that?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, 5 minutes; 3 minutes?\n  Mr. EXON. How about right now?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I need about 3 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. OK. I still have the floor. Before I lose the floor, let me \nmake one more try.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 10 more minutes of debate, 5 \nminutes controlled by the Senator from Ohio or his assignee and 5 \nminutes controlled by the Senator from Nebraska?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I agree to a time limit but I want to make \na couple of phone calls first before I agree to a specific time limit. \nI think the Senator from Michigan had a couple of comments to make and \nI will make the phone calls while he is doing that.\n  Mr. EXON. Let the Record show I tried.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I just have one additional question \nof the Senator from Nebraska. That has to do with the House of \nRepresentatives. We are in a position here where he, as ranking member \nof the Budget Committee, has said it is inappropriate to vest power in \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee. Yet that is exactly the power that \nis being vested in the House Committee on Government Operations in this \nbill. And this amendment does not touch that.\n  If it is inappropriate to vest that power in a committee of the \nSenate, it seems to me it is equally wrong to vest it in a committee of \nthe House.\n  But in terms of vesting power in committees, the Budget Act vests \npower in the Budget Committee. I want to just make reference to four \nsections of the Budget Act where, on points of order, the power is \nvested in the Budget Committee.\n  I think I have made reference before to section 311(c), for purposes \nof this section the levels of new budget authority--et cetera:\n\n       Shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the \n     Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives or \n     the Senate, as the case may be.\n\n  There is power vested right in the Budget Committee.\n  In section 313(e), and these are points of order sections: For \npurposes of this section the levels of new budget authority, budget \noutlays, et cetera, ``shall be determined on the basis of estimates \nmade by the Committee on the Budget of the Senate.''\n  Power is vested in the Budget Committee directly, right in the Budget \nAct. Yet one of the two sections which is being stricken here is \nexactly that. It puts the power to make the estimate of the cost of any \nmandate in the Budget Committee, exactly as we have done over and over \nagain. There is nothing unusual about that at all. The Budget Committee \nhas explicit power vested in it over and over again in the Budget Act \nto make these kinds of determinations of outlay. Yet in the bill as \nintroduced, it wants to put that precise power of the Budget Act here--\nsuddenly we find there is a committee amendment by the Budget Committee \nstriking that clear grant of power.\n  I think it is useful, just in terms of avoiding ambiguity itself. \nThis thing is going to be complicated enough. We might as well not \nbuild in an ambiguity. Make it clear. The budget committee has the \npower. Relative to Governmental Affairs, there is this power granted in \nthe House which is left in place. The Budget Committee apparently does \nnot want this power to be granted to the Governmental Affairs Committee \nhere. It seems to me what is sauce--fair for the goose is fair for the \ngander. If it is right for the House, it is right for the Senate. My \nunderstanding was the Senator from Ohio had worked out an agreement \nrelative to this kind of reference and if that, in fact, was correct, \nthen it seems to me this would be a move away from what was in the \noriginal bill agreed to by the Senator from Ohio.\n  Finally, I would say, Mr. President, I hope that this amendment would \neither be defeated or be tabled, because unless you have clarity as to \nwhere the responsibility lies to both determine whether there is a \nmandate or an exception, and to determine the amount of the mandate--\nunless you have clarity on that, we are making into law ambiguities \nwhich are going to bedevil us just about every day we operate around \nhere.\n  We ought to clarify where the responsibility lies. We have done it \nbefore. It was in the original bill. We should leave it the way it was \nin the original bill and defeat the Budget Committee amendment. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmy suggestion of the absence of a quorum, that when we come back after \nthe order for the quorum call is rescinded that I retain the right to \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I will look to \nthe Senate from Ohio to make a request.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 11th reported committee amendment is the \npending question.\n  Mr. GLENN. I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. \nFaircloth], the Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], the Senator from Oregon \n[Mr. Hatfield], and the Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] would vote ``nay.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] \nand the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] are necessary absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] is absent \nbecause of illness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 27, nays 66, as follows:\n               [[Page S998]] [Rollcall Vote No. 22 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--27\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--66\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Exon\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--7\n\n     Bradley\n     Faircloth\n     Gramm\n     Hatfield\n     Hutchison\n     Kennedy\n     Pryor\n  So the motion to lay on the table the committee amendment on page 25, \nlines 11 through 25, was rejected.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from Idaho \ngive me just a moment of his time so I might ask him a question or be \ninvolved in a colloquy?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President two things have happened that bother this \nSenator considerably.\n  Last week, I made an effort to stop the House from using frequent \nflier miles that were paid for by taxpayers for personal use. I was \nadmonished by my friends on the majority side for trying to tell the \nHouse what they should do or should not do. The amendment was amended. \nI lost.\n  It said to the Senate that under those circumstances, the Senate \nought to take care of itself and we ought not to tell the House what to \ndo. Now, as we are, in this amendment and in this bill, setting out a \nlot of proposals that the House must comply with--change their rules, \nassign to committees, things of that nature--I keep hearing that this \nis what the House is asking the Senate to do.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like for the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho to respond to who in the House is telling the Senate what to do, \nor what the leadership over there is saying, whether they want this in \nthe bill so that it will apply to the House. Can you give the Senate \nthis information tonight? If not, in the morning. I would like to have \nan answer.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Sure, Mr. President. The Members of the House with \nwhom we have been working closely, and I will name them, are the \nChairman, Bill Clinger; Congressman Robert Portman, and Congressman \nGary Condit. Those are the individuals with whom we worked most closely \non this companion legislation in the House.\n  Mr. FORD. So they are saying to put it in the Senate bill to make the \nHouse comply with the rules of the bill we passed?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, to further answer that, that is \ncorrect. They have said in the inquiry, Could you put this in the bill?\n  However, I tell you there has been further clarification that if the \nSenate were to determine that it just did not feel appropriate for the \nSenate to put that House language in there, they can deal with it in a \ndifferent setting.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's being candid with \nme because I think we are making a mistake. One week, we will not apply \nthe rules to the House and the next week we apply the rules to the \nHouse. Something has to be consistent. One was not a very important \namendment. This one is.\n  So I hope that in the discussion with the Senators, between now and \nmaybe working out something on this amendment in the morning, I \nunderstand, I hope Senators will look at the whole aspect of saying to \nthe House ``You must comply with the rules that we pass.'' I am not \nsure that that is right.\n  I might say to the Senator, with all respect, that I think we are \ngoing to have to start being consistent, regardless of what bills we \nare on, and we will have to say that these rules passed on the Senate \ndo not apply to the House unless the House wants to do that.\n  So, at some point, if there is not an agreement to the imposition of \nour rules on the House, we will offer an amendment that will take the \napplication of this legislation to the House.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FORD. I will be glad to. I have no problem.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, just in response to that--and I \nappreciate the idea of consistency--in this particular legislation, it \nwas really many, many hours of working together with the House.\n  I was not privy to what sort of arrangements the Senator had worked \nout with the House on his amendment last week.\n  One of the things that I think may help us to be consistent is when \nwe see that it deals with the House of Representatives, probably part \nof our information that we exchange with one another is to state to \nwhat extent this really is coming from the House. This was a strong \nrequest.\n  Mr. FORD. The Senator says he is working with the chairman. That is \nfine. The House leadership, at some point, is going to have to put it \nall together. I would not want to take a chairman here and say that his \nadvice to me is above the majority leader's. I would go to the leader \nand to the Senator's elected leadership, and I would get my direction \nfrom them rather than a committee chairman, unless they have acquiesced \ntheir authority to them.\n  I am glad the Senator and I wanted to know that. We keep saying, ``As \nthe House has advised us, as the House has advised us.'' I just wanted \nto know who was advising the Senator, and I am still concerned about \napplying our rule to the House or passing legislation saying the House \nmust comply. Oh, it has been done, but I think if we are going to stay \nout one way, we ought to stay consistent. I will be observing it very \nclosely.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, at the heart of the unfunded mandates \nlegislation we continue to debate today is the 10th amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  This is an amendment that many here in Washington seem to have \nforgotten over the years, as more and more power has been taken away \nfrom the States and placed in the hands of Federal bureaucrats.\n  As I said in my remarks on the first day of this session, if I have \none goal for the 104th Congress, it is that we will dust off the 10th \namendment and restore it to its rightful place in our Constitution.\n  As a reminder of that goal, I also promised to insert the 10th \namendment into the Congressional Record every week that we are in \nsession, and I would like to do so now.\n  Mr. President, the 10th amendment to the U.S. Constitution reads:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States, respectively, or to the people.\n\n  Let us always keep those simple yet powerful words in mind, as we \ncontinue our work of returning government back to the American people.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/17/senate-section/article/S987-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S998-S1000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, having said that, I send a cloture motion to \nthe desk.\n  Let me say before I send it to the desk, it is obvious to me what is \nhappening here is nothing is happening. We had amendment after \namendment on congressional coverage, on which we wasted all of last \nweek, and part of last week on unfunded mandates.\n  We are told there are 40, 50, 60 amendments. I am not certain how \nmany are germane. This is an issue supported by the Governors, \nsupported \n[[Page S999]] by the mayors, supported by the county commissioners, \nsupported by people all across America--Republicans and Democrats--and \nsupported by the President of the United States.\n  It is pretty obvious we are not going to be able to move it quickly \nin the Senate because people are using the rules to frustrate efforts. \nThat is the way it works. I do not fault that. I think we may have done \nthat in the past a time or two.\n  This is something where there is broad bipartisan support. We would \nlike to complete it this week. If we can get cloture, we may be able to \ncomplete it this week.\n  So I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 1, the \n     unfunded mandates bill:\n         Bob Dole, Dirk Kempthorne, Don Nickles, Connie Mack, \n           Trent Lott, Thad Cochran, Alfonse D'Amato, Al Simpson, \n           Strom Thurmond, Pete Domenici, Ted Stevens, Bill Cohen, \n           Christopher S. Bond, Frank Murkowski, Jesse Helms, \n           Spencer Abraham, Bob Smith, Larry E. Craig, Mike \n           DeWine, and Bill Frist.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I say to my friend, I was not aware until just now, in \nlistening to the distinguished leader's comments, that there was any \nnecessity for a cloture motion to be entered. I did not realize that \nthere was a filibuster occurring.\n  Mr. DOLE. I began to realize it, if I may say to my friend. I can \njust see maybe the beginning of one.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thought progress was being made on the bill. It seems to \nme that the Senate was working its will.\n  Mr. DOLE. If the Senator will yield, I might say to my good friend \nfrom West Virginia, I have indicated to the Democratic leader that if \nwe can reach some agreement--I do not disagree with the Senator from \nWest Virginia totally. I will withdraw the motion if we can agree on \nlimited amendments so we at least have some finite number of \namendments, hopefully germane amendments. But not having that, and \nlooking at the fact that my colleagues on the other side would like to \nhave a retreat on Friday of this week, I would like to be \naccommodating, but I do not know how we can accommodate that request \nunless we make some progress on what is a bill that enjoys strong \nbipartisan support.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is there a list of amendments? I have not seen any list. I \nheard there might be a list of amendments, so I suggested that I have \nthree. I may not call up any of them. So I thought we were making \nprogress.\n  Mr. DOLE. It may be progress, depending on how it is defined. I have \nnot checked Webster's lately. But it would be slow progress if it is \nprogress. But it is my hope we can put a list together, with staff \nworking on each side, and submit a copy of that to the Democratic \nleader and also the Senator from West Virginia, and others who have an \ninterest, and see if we can reach some agreement on a list of \namendments. If it is going to be 40, 50, or 60, probably half are \nnongermane. I hope in the interest of expediency, we will have support \nfor the vote of cloture, which would eliminate all the nongermane \namendments.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this kind of underlines everything I was \nsaying earlier today and last Friday and Thursday. What is all this big \nhurry? Here we are, this is the 17th of January, and why can we not be \nlegislators and take time to understand what is in a bill? I was \nseeking to have the committees provide committee reports, and it was \nmainly for that reason that I took the floor and complained that the \nminority in both committees had been denied that opportunity to have \nreports in which they could file views, individual views and minority \nviews. Now that has been accomplished.\n  I say, therefore, that the distinguished leader has done, what he has \nevery right to do--he is the leader and he has introduced a cloture \nmotion. But it seems to me that the Senate is now beginning to work its \nwill, now that it has had access to the committee reports, and I do not \nknow what all the rush is. What is there that is coming behind this \nmeasure?\n  Mr. DOLE. I think the Senator from West Virginia may have some \ninkling. There may be--I would not suggest that, but I know, knowing \nthe Senator from West Virginia is a master of the game, and I say that \nin a complimentary way--he knows that a balanced budget amendment may \nbe somewhere on the horizon. And I assume that the further away the \nbetter for the Senator from West Virginia. And one way to keep it at a \ndistance is not to rush through anything else that may be on the Senate \nfloor.\n  I am not suggesting that might motivate the Senator from West \nVirginia, but it is something that has occurred to me a few times, and \nI had the same problem on this side of the aisle.\n  Mr. BYRD. But it is my understanding that the balanced budget \namendment has not yet been reported out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. DOLE. But we hope it may be by the time we complete action on \nthis bill. We will be coming in later tomorrow morning to accommodate \nthe Judiciary Committee. And we may adjourn in the afternoon to \naccommodate the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, as I said earlier, I may vote for this unfunded \nmandates bill. I probably will. I do not know yet. I still want to \nstudy it some, and may offer an amendment or so. But I am a little bit \nsurprised that the leader is implying that a filibuster has been going \non.\n  Mr. DOLE. I say to my friend, I do not think there is a filibuster in \nthe real sense. We have not had a real filibuster, as the Senator said \nthe other day, around here for years. I think I would know a real one \nif one occurred.\n  It seemed to me, with the broad support we have for this unfunded \nmandates bill, it is not only filed because of what the leader may \nconsider delay, but also to avoid a lot of nongermane amendments. We \nwent through that turkey shoot last week and the week before.\n  So it seems to me that one way to talk about unfunded mandates and \ngermane amendments to unfunded mandates is to get cloture and 30 or 40 \nof those amendments will disappear. We can have the debate the Senator \nfrom West Virginia wants. If necessary, I would be willing to see--we \ncan extend the 30 hours by consent. I am not trying to shut anything \noff, but I would like to eliminate some of these nongermane amendments.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield, of course \nthe majority leader knows as well as I do that there is no rule on \ngermaneness in the Senate except with respect, in a small way, to \nappropriations bills. But this cloture motion just underlines what I \nsaid earlier, that there is an effort to ram this bill through, an \neffort to steamroll it through.\n  It seems to me that a good legislator would seek to know what is in a \nbill. I am just trying to play the part of what I think a good \nlegislator ought to do. A good legislator ought to try to understand \nwhat is in a bill. And we have been deprived, to a degree, of knowing \nearlier what was in this bill; having the benefit of a committee report \nas an explanation of what is in the bill. We were deprived of that, not \nthrough my fault, not through anybody's fault on this side of the \naisle, but actually against the wishes of certain Senators on this side \nof the aisle who are on those committees.\n  A good legislator, it seems to me, would want to know what is in a \nbill. He would want access to a committee report. I have been in \nlegislative bodies now going on my 49th year and I have found it \nbeneficial to have committee reports. I think the American people want \ntheir legislators to know what is in a bill. We owe that to the \nAmerican people.\n  So the distinguished majority leader has the right to offer a cloture \nmotion. He is the leader. If he thinks that there is a slowdown here \nand if he thinks that necessity requires that we have a cloture vote on \nthis bill and then limit it to nongermane amendments, that is his \nright. Senators from time to time offer cloture motions when there is \nno filibuster. Their sole objective is to create a situation in which \nthere will not be nongermane amendments.\n   [[Page S1000]] Our friend Russell Long used to do that from time to \ntime when he was managing a Finance Committee bill on the floor. He \nwould offer a cloture motion, not for the purpose of shutting off \ndebate so much but more so for the purpose of ruling out nongermane \namendments. So the distinguished Republican leader has a point there \nand that may be his goal.\n  But let me just say, lest the Record be left to appear that there is \na filibuster going on here, we have been making progress. We will \ncontinue to make progress. But it just underscores my concerns that the \nidea here is to ram things through. Do not take the time to study the \nbill. Do not take the time to understand what is in the bill. Just get \nthe bill passed.\n\n       How poor are they that have not patience!\n       What wound did ever heal but by degrees?\n\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor. I hope we will have an \nopportunity before the cloture vote to offer other amendments and I \nhope the leader will not put us on any other measure until we finish \nthis one, so we will really have 2 days in which to discuss the bill \nand offer amendments.\n  I thank the leader for yielding. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/17/senate-section/article/S998-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, a year ago yesterday, an earthquake \nmeasuring 6.8 on the Richter scale wreaked havoc on the southern \nCalifornia counties of Los Angeles, Orange, and Ventura. The Northridge \ntemblor brought about the collapse of apartment buildings, hospitals, \nand schools, and destroyed major portions of that area's transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  Within hours of the earthquake, our former Senate colleague Gov. Pete \nWilson proclaimed a state of emergency in those counties, and set in \nmotion the implementation of what is now widely viewed as an \nextraordinary recovery from the earthquake's crippling impact on the \nmovement of people and goods in one of the most populous areas of the \ncountry.\n  In addition to executing the necessary recovery measures to protect \npublic safety and ensure for the food and housing of earthquake \nvictims, Governor Wilson signed a series of innovative Executive orders \nthat cut through the redtape of State bureaucracy and either \nstreamlined or eliminated statutes and regulations governing everything \nfrom highway contracts to mobile schools.\n  As a result, California's recovery from the Northridge earthquake has \nproceeded at a record pace. Among the most impressive of the recovery \nefforts was the opening of the world's busiest freeway, the Santa \nMonica Freeway, in less than 3 months, and 74 days ahead of schedule, \nafter it was destroyed by the quake. Governor Wilson heralded this \naccomplishment by proclaiming it the most stirring symbol yet of \nCalifornia's endurance. I would add that it is also a symbol of what \ncan happen when government gets out of the way and is willing to break \nold molds and explore new and innovative approaches to challenges.\n  There is no doubt as to the resiliency of spirit of the people of \nCalifornia. Over the course of the past 4 years, they have endured more \nthan their fair share as a result of natural disasters, but they \ncontinue to emerge victorious time and time again from the ashes of \ndestruction wrought by earthquakes, fires, droughts, and floods. I \nmight add that Governor Wilson is already taking similar steps in the \nface of the current California floods, using emergency authorities to \nspeed rebuilding in flood areas. Moreover, he has asked the President \nto suspend operation of the Endangered Species Act for the purposes of \nrepairing and replacing flood damaged facilities.\n  It is with respect for this indomitable California spirit, and with \nadmiration for a State and its Governor who together forged a better, \nsmarter avenue to disaster recovery, that I mark the first year \nanniversary of the Northridge earthquake. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe materials detailing the Northridge disaster and recovery efforts, \nwhich have been prepared by Governor Wilson's staff, be reprinted in \nthe Record immediately after my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   The Wilson Administration's Response to the Northridge Earthquake\n\n       On January 17, 1994, at 4:31 a.m. (PST) southern California \n     experienced a major earthquake (6.8 Richter) in the \n     Northridge area of Los Angeles.\n       Within hours of the earthquake, Governor Pete Wilson issued \n     a Proclamation directing all agencies of state government to \n     utilize available resources in responding to the emergency.\n       Jim van Loben Sels, Director of the California Department \n     of Transportation (Caltrans), delegated authority and \n     accountability to the Director of Caltrans, District Seven \n     for all restoration and repair work estimated to cost less \n     than $4 million.\n       Seven Caltrans Director's Orders were approved and \n     subsequent force account contracts were let to remove damaged \n     structures, construct detours and install shoring to insure \n     the safety of existing, standing structures.\n       Within minutes of the tremblor, Caltrans staff began \n     inspecting the freeway system throughout Los Angeles and \n     Ventura counties. More than 1,000 structures were checked--\n     that day alone.\n       Tuesday, January 18, Director van Loben Sels called \n     together representatives of the Los Angeles County \n     Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA), Los Angeles \n     Department of Transportation (LADOT), the Federal Highway \n     Administration (FHWA), and Caltrans to discuss emergency \n     response strategies and to identify earthquake-related damage \n     to local transportation facilities.\n       January 19, Governor Wilson appointed Dean R. Dunphy, \n     Secretary of the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, \n     as Chairman of the Emergency Transportation Task Force. This \n     group included the California Highway Patrol, Caltrans, Los \n     Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority \n     (LACMTA), Metrolink, Los Angeles Department of Transportation \n     (LADOT), the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and \n     eventually numerous other local transportation agencies. The \n     group originally met daily and became a control point of \n     information about damage, detours, cost estimates, and other \n     emergency transportation control measures.\n       On January 23, Governor Wilson issued a further \n     Proclamation which suspended the operation of all statutes, \n     rules and regulations which apply to Caltrans contracts that \n     would hinder or delay the restoration of facilities and \n     services as a result of the Northridge earthquake.\n       The Governor's emergency proclamation modified contracting \n     procedures and enabled \n     [[Page S1001]] Caltrans to respond more effectively and \n     efficiently to the emergency. Innovative emergency contract \n     procedures allowed the Department to put contractors to work \n     immediately. The informal and streamlined bid process\n      initiated by the Governor's emergency proclamation cut the \n     time for advertising, awarding and approving contracts \n     from a standard time frame of four to five months to as \n     little as three days.\n       On January 24, Governor Wilson issued an emergency \n     proclamation suspending certain limitations on hours that \n     commercial vehicle operators could drive and work. This \n     allowed greater flexibility for commercial truck traffic that \n     was critical for maintaining the economic stability of the \n     region and delivering rebuilding materials.\n       On January 24, at the behest of Director van Loben Sels, a \n     draft Memo of Understanding (MOU) was finalized between \n     Caltrans and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). This \n     MOU outlined the contractual process and established criteria \n     for issuing emergency contracts.\n       Pursuant to the Governor's executive order and following \n     FHWA approval on critical projects, Caltrans limited the \n     number of contractors bidding on the five major \n     reconstruction projects to firms that were experienced bridge \n     builders with a record of working in Los Angeles and the \n     ability to meet the ambitious minority and disadvantaged \n     business participation goals. At least three bidders were \n     asked to complete for each project. Companies were restricted \n     to receiving the contract for only one of the emergency jobs. \n     Emergency contracting procedures for repair and construction \n     also included a commitment to obtain a 20%-40% goal of \n     participation by Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs). \n     Governor Wilson challenged Caltrans to meet the 40% \n     participation goal.\n       Caltrans suggested and obtained FHWA support to utilize the \n     A+B bid process on selected projects. This process combines \n     the contractor's proposal for construction costs (A) with the \n     cost per day of loss in use multiplied by the number of days \n     bid (B). This process empowers the innovative contractor to \n     use a combination of construction costs and construction days \n     to achieve the lowest possible bid. The benefit to the State \n     is a reduction in total cost and the potential of reopening \n     the facility to the public's use in the shortest amount of \n     time.\n       For the first time in the history of the Department, \n     Caltrans contractual timelines required contractors to work \n     24 hours a day, seven days a week, without allowances for bad \n     weather or holidays.\n       Caltrans also initiated incentives and disincentives on \n     selected projects, with FHWA concurrence, to provide bonuses \n     to contractors who completed construction early and to \n     penalize contractors who could not meet their anticipated \n     deadline. These assigned incentives and disincentives ranged \n     from $8,500 to $200,000 per day and represent the highest \n     ever used nationwide. Providing bonuses and penalties further \n     encourages contractors to complete\n      their projects early and return the facility to the \n     traveling public in the shortest time possible.\n       Within days of the earthquake, Caltrans engineers hand-\n     delivered bid packages and contract plans to selected \n     contractors at the nearest airport to their home office.\n       In the initial week following the earthquake, Caltrans \n     worked with the FHWA to develop an accelerated funding \n     procedure that provided the Department with an initial \n     funding allocation of $15 million on January 19, 1994. Two \n     additional requests were approved on January 21, and January \n     27, for $30 million and $55 million respectively. Within ten \n     days of the earthquake, Caltrans received $100 million in \n     Emergency Relief funds. Once Congress approved the additional \n     funding and the funds were allocated to FHWA, Caltrans \n     requested that FHWA make an additional $250 million available \n     for obligation. This $250 million was based upon Caltrans' \n     estimate for additional funding needed through the end of its \n     current fiscal year.\n       On January 27, pursuant to Governor Wilson's Emergency \n     Proclamation, Caltrans Director van Loben Sels issued \n     guidelines to suspend usual contracting procedures. These \n     guidelines included provisions to protect the public welfare, \n     for example--ensuring ample competition, compliance with OSHA \n     regulation, licensing, and participation by DBE firms.\n       Saturday, January 29, the first A+B contract was opened, \n     awarded, executed and approved for Interstate 5. This process \n     was completed in one day instead of the standard five to \n     seven weeks. On January 29, Caltrans also opened a newly \n     paved, four-lane detour for the traffic on Interstate 5. This \n     reopened a vital bypass both to and from Los Angeles.\n       Sunday, January 30, less than two weeks after the \n     earthquake, construction began on the bridge replacement at \n     Interstate 5.\n       As of February 17, 1994, 30 days after the earthquake, \n     Caltrans had successfully acted upon the emergency \n     contracting powers that were granted by Governor Wilson's \n     executive orders. With the concurrence of PHWA, Caltrans \n     awarded: 35 Emergency Contracts worth $9.6 million, (these \n     are Force Account contracts for small demolition and debris \n     clean-up); 5 Informal Bid contracts, worth $47.3 million, \n     (for major construction and some demolition); and\n      2 Architectural and Engineering contracts worth $18.5 \n     million, (for private consultants to assist in design of \n     structural repairs and to manage traffic around the \n     damaged parts of the transportation system).\n       As of April 7, 1994 Caltrans had approved a total of \n     twenty-two informal Bid contracts worth $113 million, for the \n     restoration and repair of transportation facilities damaged \n     in the Northridge Earthquake.\n       Construction was completed on the busiest freeway in the \n     Nation, the I-10 Santa Monica Freeway, on Tuesday, April 12. \n     The I-10 is the busiest roadway in the Nation. This vital \n     artery was reconstructed in 66 days, a total of 74 days prior \n     to the anticipated completion date, resulting in a bonus \n     payment of 13.8 million for the contractor, C.C. Meyers of \n     Rancho Cordova. By opening the I-10 Freeway earlier than \n     anticipated, Caltrans saved the Los Angeles economy \n     approximately $1 million a day.\n       Construction was completed on the I-5 Golden State Freeway \n     at Gavin Canyon on May 17, 1994, 33 days ahead of schedule. \n     By opening the I-5 earlier than anticipated Gavin Canyon, \n     Caltrans saved the Los Angeles economy approximately $400,000 \n     a day.\n       Construction was completed on the first phase of the I-5/\n     Route 14 Interchange on July 8, 1994, 20 days ahead of \n     schedule. By opening the Interchange earlier than \n     anticipated, Caltrans saved the Los Angeles economy \n     approximately $1.6 million each day.\n       The Simi Valley Freeway (State Route 118) in Granada Hills \n     was partially restored to original traffic patterns on \n     September 3, 1994. By September 7, total access to the entire \n     10-lane facility was complete.\n       Construction was completed on the second phase of the I-5/\n     Route 14 Interchange (the southbound to northbound connector \n     ramps) on November 4, 1994. This opening of this arterial was \n     the last major project in the Northridge Earthquake response \n     effort. The entire response was amazingly completed in less \n     than 10 months.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Governor Wilson's proactive leadership to empower Caltrans \n     with the tools necessary to get Los Angeles moving again has \n     brought great success, Los Angeles recovered in record time. \n     While the initial goal for completing the earthquake recovery \n     was the end of 1994, many of the vital structures damaged or \n     destroyed by the quake were returned to service in less than \n     six months.\n       The Wilson Administration's emergency response to the \n     Northridge Earthquake not only streamlined, but reinvented \n     the contracting process at Caltrans. This enabled the \n     Department to respond to the restoration and reconstruction \n     efforts of Los Angeles in an unprecedented, accelerated \n     fashion.\n       By cutting red tape, Governor Wilson moved bureaucracy out \n     of the way and empowered Caltrans, in coordination with the \n     private sector, to respond effectively to the Northridge \n     Earthquake. Now it is our challenge to ensure that the \n     lessons learned from this tragic disaster are implemented \n     into every day business at Caltrans.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Two \n     additional requests were approved on January 21, and January \n     27, for $30 million and $55 million respectively. Within ten \n     days of the earthquake, Caltrans received $100 million in \n     Emergency Relief funds. Once Congress approved the additional \n     funding and the funds were allocated to FHWA, Caltrans \n     requested that FHWA make an additional $250 million available \n     for obligation. This $250 million was based upon Caltrans' \n     estimate for additional funding needed through the end of its \n     current fiscal year.\n       On January 27, pursuant to Governor Wilson's Emergency \n     Proclamation, Caltrans Director van Loben Sels issued \n     guidelines to suspend usual contracting procedures. These \n     guidelines included provisions to protect the public welfare, \n     for example--ensuring ample competition, compliance with OSHA \n     regulation, licensing, and participation by DBE firms.\n       Saturday, January 29, the first A+B contract was opened, \n     awarded, executed and approved for Interstate 5. This process \n     was completed in one day instead of the standard five to \n     seven weeks. On January 29, Caltrans also opened a newly \n     paved, four-lane detour for the traffic on Interstate 5. This \n     reopened a vital bypass both to and from Los Angeles.\n       Sunday, January 30, less than two weeks after the \n     earthquake, construction began on the bridge replacement at \n     Interstate 5.\n       As of February 17, 1994, 30 days after the earthquake, \n     Caltrans had successfully acted upon the emergency \n     contracting powers that were granted by Governor Wilson's \n     executive orders. With the concurrence of PHWA, Caltrans \n     awarded: 35 Emergency Contracts worth $9.6 million, (these \n     are Force Account contracts for small demolition and debris \n     clean-up); 5 Informal Bid contracts, worth $47.3 million, \n     (for major construction and some demolition); and\n      2 Architectural and Engineering contracts worth $18.5 \n     million, (for private consultants to assist in design of \n     structural repairs and to manage traffic around the \n     damaged parts of the transportation system).\n       As of April 7, 1994 Caltrans had approved a total of \n     twenty-two informal Bid contracts worth $113 million, for the \n     restoration and repair of transportation facilities damaged \n     in the Northridge Earthquake.\n       Construction was completed on the busiest freeway in the \n     Nation, the I-10 Santa Monica Freeway, on Tuesday, April 12. \n     The I-10 is the busiest roadway in the Nation. This vital \n     artery was reconstructed in 66 days, a total of 74 days prior \n     to the anticipated completion date, resulting in a bonus \n     payment of 13.8 million for the contractor, C.C. Meyers of \n     Rancho Cordova. By opening the I-10 Freeway earlier than \n     anticipated, Caltrans saved the Los Angeles economy \n     approximately $1 million a day.\n       Construction was completed on the I-5 Golden State Freeway \n     at Gavin Canyon on May 17, 1994, 33 days ahead of schedule. \n     By opening the I-5 earlier than anticipated Gavin Canyon, \n     Caltrans saved the Los Angeles economy approximately $400,000 \n     a day.\n       Construction was completed on the first phase of the I-5/\n     Route 14 Interchange on July 8, 1994, 20 days ahead of \n     schedule. By opening the Interchange earlier than \n     anticipated, Caltrans saved the Los Angeles economy \n     approximately $1.6 million each day.\n       The Simi Valley Freeway (State Route 118) in Granada Hills \n     was partially restored to original traffic patterns on \n     September 3, 1994. By September 7, total access to the entire \n     10-lane facility was complete.\n       Construction was completed on the second phase of the I-5/\n     Route 14 Interchange (the southbound to northbound connector \n     ramps) on November 4, 1994. This opening of this arterial was \n     the last major project in the Northridge Earthquake response \n     effort. The entire response was amazingly completed in less \n     than 10 months.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Governor Wilson's proactive leadership to empower Caltrans \n     with the tools necessary to get Los Angeles moving again has \n     brought great success, Los Angeles recovered in record time. \n     While the initial goal for completing the earthquake recovery \n     was the end of 1994, many of the vital structures damaged or \n     destroyed by the quake were returned to service in less than \n     six months.\n       The Wilson Administration's emergency response to the \n     Northridge Earthquake not only streamlined, but reinvented \n     the contracting process at Caltrans. This enabled the \n     Department to respond to the restoration and reconstruction \n     efforts of Los Angeles in an unprecedented, accelerated \n     fashion.\n       By cutting red tape, Governor Wilson moved bureaucracy out \n     of the way and empowered Caltrans, in coordination with the \n     private sector, to respond effectively to the Northridge \n     Earthquake. Now it is our challenge to ensure that the \n     lessons learned from this tragic disaster are implemented \n     into every day business at Caltrans.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania established a new administration with a new Governor, Tom \nRidge, and a new Lieutenant Governor, Mark Schweiker, in very ornate \nand interesting ceremonies at the State capital in Harrisburg, PA. That \nevent is worth a comment for our colleagues for permanency in the \nCongressional Record.\n  Tom Ridge is a man well known to those of us in the Congress because \nCongressman Ridge served for 6 terms, 12 years in the House of \nRepresentatives, and takes an extraordinarily fine record to the \nGovernor's chair in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n  Governor Ridge had served in Vietnam, he had served as a prosecuting \nattorney in Erie County, PA, and he had served as a distinguished trial \nlawyer. Today he became the Governor of Pennsylvania.\n  Pennsylvania is a State which is now in its 314th year, some 100 \nyears-plus more than the United States of America. And Governor Ridge \nmade a very, very profound speech in outlining his aspirations and \ngoals for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He talked about the \nproblems of an expanding economy, talked about the issue of crime, \ndiscussed the future of education, talked about environmental control \nwith an appropriate balance for an expanding economy and for job \nopportunities in what was a profound and distinguished speech.\n  He said that tomorrow he will call a special session of the \nlegislature of Pennsylvania to deal with the issue of crime. And was \neloquent in his determination to hold accountable, as he put it, \n``those who prey on the weak,'' and expressed his determination as the \nnew Governor of the Commonwealth that they would be called to account \nand firm action would be taken.\n In his \n[[Page S1002]] definition he talked about addressing the social and \neconomic causes of crime as well on a very broad approach to the \nproblem. He called for a redefinition of the relationship between State \ngovernment and the local communities, articulating on the State level \nthe kind of legislation which is now being considered here in the U.S. \nSenate on trying to redefine the federalism and the relationship \nbetween the United States Government and the States.\n  What Governor Ridge was talking about was leaving more authority in \nlocal communities to try to bring government down to the grassroots so \nthat people in the townships and in the ``burbs'' or in the cities who \nknow best what their problems are and can best address them in trying \nto reach as much revenue as possible, cutting taxes at the Federal \nlevel, cutting taxes at the State level, to leave the resources as \nclose to the people as possible so that the problems are addressed by \nthe people who know the most about them.\n  He said in eloquent terms that, ``Government has gone too far in \ntreating people as the servants rather than as the served,'' an \nobjective which really ought to be the standard for all governments. He \nsaid again in eloquent terms, ``What government can do for people is \nlimited. What people can do for themselves is limitless.''\n  I think in that articulation he is talking about more accountability \nfor the individual, more opportunity for the individual, and really \nmore responsibility for the individual.\n  Sworn in alongside Governor Ridge today was a distinguished \nPennsylvanian, Mark S. Schweiker, who came to that position having \nserved as a commissioner in Bucks County. Mark Schweiker made a very \ndistinguished speech as well in his induction ceremony in the ornate \nPennsylvania Senate an hour-and-a-half before Governor Ridge took the \noath of office. One of Lieutenant Governor Schweiker's statements, \nwhich was very profound, was, ``A government big enough to give you \neverything you want is a government big enough to take everything you \nhave.''\n  I think in Pennsylvania today with the legislature, both houses, the \nState house of representatives and the State senate, under Republican \ncontrol, and the newly elected Governor being a Republican, mirrors \nvery much what happened in the elections nationwide last November.\n  If I may say, not in a partisan sense, but in a recognition of what \nthe voters did, returning to what would be called core Republican \nvalues as expressed by the people in the historic election of the \nRepublican U.S. House of Representatives and in a change in leadership \nin the U.S. Senate now controlled by the Republicans and an effort to \nreturn to core values of limited Government, less spending, lower \ntaxes, strong crime control, that is the pledge which was made by two \nvery distinguished Pennsylvanians today, Gov. Tom Ridge and Lieutenant \nGov. Mark Schweiker.\n  Mr. President, if anyone else seeks recognition at this point, I \nwould be glad to yield. If not, I would like to proceed to a discussion \nof another subject.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed again in morning business \nfor a period not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] is \nrecognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the submission of Senate \nResolution 60 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of \nConcurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/17/senate-section/article/S1001-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARREST OF RAOUL WALLENBERG\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, there are still many puzzles left \nunsolved from the cold war. Perhaps one of the most frustrating is the \ndisappearance of Raoul Wallenberg. To this day, a full account of why \nRaoul Wallenberg was arrested and what has become of him is still not \nforthcoming from the Russian government. I rise today to commemorate \nthis brave hero of the Holocaust who worked tirelessly and with great \ncourage to save thousands of Jews from Nazi concentration camps in \nHungary.\n  It is 50 years ago today since Mr. Wallenberg was arrested by agents \nof the Soviet Union at the time of the invasion of Budapest by the Red \nArmy. He disappeared while in Soviet custody and despite the collapse \nof the Soviet Union, many questions concerning his fate are unresolved.\n  This is matter which has long held my attention. In the summer of \n1979, I met with Nina Lagergren, Raoul Wallenberg's sister. Shortly \nthereafter, Senators Pell, Church, Boschwitz and I founded the Free \nWallenberg Committee. This working group, with the active involvement \nof my wife Liz, Lena Biorck Kaplan and others, strongly encouraged the \nadministration to pursue the facts of the Wallenberg case with the \nSoviet Union. Support from then Secretary of State Vance was strong, \nbut the Soviets were not cooperative. In August 1980 I introduced \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 117, calling upon the President to raise \nthe Wallenberg case at the Madrid Review Conference of the Helsinki \naccords which took place that year. Ambassador Max Kampelman and the \nother U.S. officials made several overtures to the Soviets at the \nMadrid Conference but found them to be as unyielding as ever.\n  We too are unyielding. I later joined Senator Pell and other members \nof the Free Wallenberg Committee in sponsoring Senate Joint Resolution \n65 to grant Raoul Wallenberg U.S. citizenship. When President Reagan \nsigned that legislation into law, Raoul Wallenberg became only the \nfourth person ever to be granted honorary U.S. citizenship.\n  A truly remarkable man, Raoul Wallenberg was undaunted in his efforts \nto undo or prevent some of the evil done by Nazis. He was a hero of the \nbest and boldest kind, and demonstrated what free men, even when acting \nalone, can accomplish against those who would crush the freedom of \nothers.\n  We await answers. Until there is satisfaction that we have the most \nthorough accounting of his life and whereabouts since being taken into \nSoviet custody 50 years ago, we will not let this rest. This is not a \nproblem of the Russian Government's making, but of their Soviet \npredecessor. They should take it upon themselves to undo the nefarious \ndeeds of the Soviet Union. The world deserves to know the fate of this \nbrave Swedish soul.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/17/senate-section/article/S1002-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 5:47 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2.

A bill to modify the boundaries of Walnut Canyon National \nMonument in the State of Arizona; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n THE WALNUT CANYON NATIONAL MONUMENT BOUNDARY MODIFICATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I introduce today with my colleague from \nArizona, Senator John McCain, the Walnut Canyon National Monument \nBoundary Modification Act of 1995. Identical legislation is being \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Representative J.D. \nHayworth.\n  This legislation is based upon consensus reached last year among \ninterested parties, including local officials in Arizona, as well as \nresidents of the Walnut Canyon area, the National Park Service and U.S. \nForest Service, with respect to modification of the monument boundaries \nfor the purpose of better protecting important archeological resources.\n  Walnut Canyon National Monument was originally established by \nPresidential proclamation in 1915 to preserve and protect numerous \nSinaguan cliff dwelling and associated sites. The canyon includes five \nareas where archeological sites are concentrated around natural \npromontories extending into the canyon, areas which early archeologists \nreferred to as forts. Three of the five forts are within the current \nboundaries of the monument, but the two others are located on adjacent \nlands administered by the U.S. Forest Service. The legislation I am \nintroducing today would redraw the monument boundaries to include those \nareas and provided the protection that those resources need and \ndeserve.\n  About 1,239 acres of forest land would be transferred to Park Service \nadministration. No State or private land would be affected.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 231\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Walnut Canyon National \n     Monument Boundary Modification Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1) Walnut Canyon National Monument was established for the \n     preservation and interpretation of certain settlements and \n     land use patterns associated with the prehistoric Sinaguan \n     culture of northern Arizona.\n       (2) Major cultural resources associated with the purposes \n     of Walnut Canyon National Monument are near the boundary and \n     are currently managed under multiple-use objectives of the \n     adjacent national forest. These concentrations of cultural \n     resources, often referred to as ``forts'', would be more \n     effectively managed as part of the National Park System.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to modify the \n     boundaries of the Walnut Canyon National Monument (hereafter \n     in this Act referred to as the ``national monument'') to \n     improve management of the national monument and associated \n     resources.\n     SEC. 3. BOUNDARY MODIFICATION.\n\n       Effective on the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     boundaries of the national monument shall be modified as \n     depicted on the map entitled ``Boundary Proposal--Walnut \n     Canyon National Monument, Coconino County, Arizona'', \n     numbered 360/80,011, and dated September 1994. Such map shall \n     be on file and available for public inspection in the offices \n     of the Director of the National Park Service, Department of \n     the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 4. ACQUISITION AND TRANSFER OF PROPERTY.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to acquire \n     lands and interest in lands within the national monument, by \n     donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or \n     exchange. Federal property within the boundaries of the \n     national monument (as modified by this Act) is hereby \n     transferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the \n     Secretary of the Interior for management as part of the \n     national monument. Federal property excluded from the \n     monument pursuant to the boundary modification under section \n     3 is hereby transferred to the administrative jurisdiction of \n     the Secretary of Agriculture to be managed as part of the \n     Coconino National Forest.\n\n     SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director \n     of the National Park Service, shall manage the national \n     monument in accordance with this Act and the provisions of \n     law generally applicable to units of the National Park \n     Service, including ``An Act to establish a National Park \n     Service, and for other purposes'' approved August 25, 1916 \n     (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1, 2-4).\n\n     SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 232. A bill to provide for the extension of the Farmers Home \nAdministration program under section 515 of the Housing Act of 1949 and \nother programs relating to housing and community development; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n THE FARMERS HOME ADMINISTRATION SECTION 515 RURAL MULTIFAMILY HOUSING \n                     PROGRAM EXTENSION ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am today introducing, along with \nmy colleagues Senators Sarbanes and Bond, the Farmers Home \nAdministration Section 515 Rural Multifamily Housing Program Extension \nAct of 1995. The Section 515 Program, now administered by the Rural \nHousing and Community Development Service [RHCDS] at the Department of \nAgriculture, is an important rural affordable housing program. It \nprovides long-term, low interest rate direct government loans for \nnonprofit and for-profit developers to develop multifamily rental \nhousing for low-income families in rural America. Moreover, this \nprogram is one of the few sources for low-income rental housing in \nrural America, with over 440,000 rental units in rural America to its \ncredit.\n  This simple legislation permanently reauthorizes the Section 515 \nProgram and allows RHCDS to administer $220 million in funding \nappropriated as part of the HUD/VA fiscal year 1995 appropriations \nbill. While providing funding \n[[Page S1005]] for projects in the section 515 pipeline, it also will \nhelp with pressing rehabilitation needs. In addition, this bill enjoys \nstrong bipartisan support and deserves quick action to help ensure the \navailability of low-income affordable housing in rural America.\n  This program is of particular importance to my State, New York. Many \npeople may not realize that New York is a very rural State, with a \nlarge number of persons below the poverty line living in rural areas. \nOf the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers below the poverty line, \none-third live in rural communities. This program has been of great \nassistance to working families and the elderly who live in rural areas. \nThere are currently 473 section 515 developments with 12,281 units in \nNew York. Nearly 7,000 of these units are reserved for elderly citizens \nand 4,500 units are used by families. There is approximately a 4-year \npipeline of projects in New York that are awaiting funding. \nReauthorization of this program will help address this backlog in New \nYork, as well as nationwide.\n  The Section 515 Program has received widespread support. In addition \nto helping working families and the elderly obtain rental housing in \nrural areas, the program has provided construction and management \nemployment opportunities. These jobs are desperately needed in States, \nsuch as New York, with rural areas that have been hit hard \neconomically.\n  I know there have been some concerns in recent years about possible \nprogram abuses in the Section 515 Program. In response to these \nconcerns, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 made a \nnumber of reforms to ensure that developers would not be receiving \nunreasonable or windfall profits. The Department of Agriculture, \nthrough Farmers Home and RHCDS, has also been implementing a series of \nregulatory reforms to combat fraud and abuse in the Section 515 \nProgram. Moreover, I expect that all rural housing programs, including \nthe Section 515 Program, will be included in this Congress' overall \nreform of Federal housing policy.\n  Finally, this legislation provides the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development with authority to renew, for up to 18 months, certain \nsection 8 project-based contracts on terms identical to the current \ncontract. This is a temporary provision. Section 8 contract renewals \nwill be a major part of any housing reform considered by Congress this \nyear.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Section 515 Rural \n     Multifamily Housing Program Extension Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RURAL HOUSING.\n\n       (a) Underserved Areas Set-Aside.--Section 509(f)(4)(A) of \n     the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1479(f)(4)(A)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``fiscal years 1993 \n     and 1994'' and inserting ``fiscal year 1995''; and\n       (2) in the second sentence, by striking ``each''.\n       (b) Rural Multifamily Rental Housing.--Section 515(b) of \n     the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1485(b)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraph (4); and\n       (2) by redesignating paragraphs (5) and (6) as paragraphs \n     (4) and (5), respectively.\n       (c) Rural Rental Housing Funds for Non-profit Entities.--\n     The first sentence of section 515(w)(1) of the Housing Act of \n     1949 (42 U.S.C. 1485(w)(1)) is amended by striking ``fiscal \n     years 1993 and 1994'' and inserting ``fiscal year 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 3. TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF EXPIRING SECTION 8 CONTRACTS.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--Subject only to the availability of \n     budget authority to carry out this section, not later than \n     October 1, 1995, the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development shall make an offer to the owner of each housing \n     project assisted under an expiring contract to extend the \n     term of the expiring contract for not more than 18 months \n     beyond the date of the expiration of the contract.\n       (b) Terms of Extension.--Except for terms or conditions \n     relating to duration, the terms and conditions under an \n     extension provided pursuant to this section of any expiring \n     contract shall be identical to the terms and conditions under \n     the expiring contract.\n       (c) Definition of Expiring Contract.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``expiring contract'' means a contract for \n     assistance pursuant to section 8(b)(2) of the United States \n     Housing Act of 1937 (as such section existed before October \n     1, 1983), including a contract for assistance referred to in \n     section 209(b) of the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of \n     1983, having a term that expires before October 1, 1996.\n       (d) Displacement Assistance.--The Secretary of Housing and \n     Urban Development may make available to tenants residing in \n     units covered by an expiring contract that is not extended \n     pursuant to this section, either--\n       (1) tenant-based assistance under section 8 of the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937; or\n       (2) a unit with respect to which project-based assistance \n     is provided under section 8 of the United States Housing Act \n     of 1937.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this section.\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleagues from the Banking Committee as an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  The bill we are introducing today would extend the rural rental \nhousing program authorized under section 515 of the Housing Act of \n1949. This program, now administered by the Rural Housing and Community \nDevelopment Service [RHCDS] at the Department of Agriculture, is a \nvaluable and critical source of funding for the development of \naffordable housing for low-income families who live in rural areas. The \nlegislation is needed because the authorization for the Section 515 \nProgram expired at the beginning of this fiscal year. The \nAppropriations Act provided $220 million for this program. With this \nauthorization, the RHCDS will be able to address pressing needs for the \nrehabilitation and preservation of existing housing, as well as provide \nfunding for a large pipeline of worthwhile projects. I am particularly \npleased that this bill also extends two important features of the \nSection 515 Program--a set-aside for nonprofit developers and a set-\naside for underserved areas.\n  The bill we are introducing today will also provide the Secretary of \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] with the \nauthority to extend the section 8 contracts on low-income housing \nprojects whose subsidy contracts will expire before October 1, 1996. \nUnder the current section 8 contracts, owners must provide their \ntenants with a 12-month notice before the expiration of the subsidy \ncontract. The contracts on a relatively small number of projects \nnationwide will expire in the next 12 months or the owners of the \nprojects will be required to provide notice in the next 12 months. It \nis important to note, Mr. President, that this provision is temporary \nand the extension of the contracts cannot exceed 18 months. The \nprovision's inclusion in this legislation will give the Administration \nand the Congress time to review the Section 8 Program and examine long-\nterm strategies for dealing with contract expirations, without causing \nuncertainty for residents or the inadvertent displacement of low-income \nhouseholds who reside in section 8 developments.\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I support the Farmers Home \nAdministration Section 515 Rural Multifamily Housing Program Extension \nAct of 1995. The Section 515 Program, now administered by the Rural \nHousing and Community Development Service [RHCDS] at the Department of \nAgriculture, is an important program that makes multifamily rental \nhousing available for low-income families in rural America. I emphasize \nthe importance of this program. Since the program's inception in 1963, \nsection 515 has financed some 440,000 affordable, low-income rental \nunits in rural America.\n  This legislation permanently reauthorizes the Section 515 Program and \nallows RHCDS to administer $220 million in funding appropriated as part \nof the HUD/VA fiscal year 1995 appropriations bill. I believe the \nfiscal year 1995 $220 million appropriation provides adequate authority \nfor RHCDS to administer the Section 515 Program. Nevertheless, RHCDS \nrefused to administer this program without a new reauthorization. \nTherefore, I ask my colleagues for their support of this legislation. I \nemphasize that this bill enjoys strong bipartisan support and industry \nsupport. I ask for quick consideration of this bill to help ensure the \ncontinued availability of low-income affordable housing in rural \nAmerica.\n  Moreover, I want to rest the concerns of my colleagues about reported \nproblems with the Section 515 Program. In response to past concerns, \nthe Housing \n[[Page S1006]] and Community Development Act of 1992 made a number of \nimportant reforms to the program, including reforms to safeguard the \nprogram from unscrupulous developers. The Department of Agriculture, \nthrough Farmers Home and RHCDS, has also recently put in place a number \nof additional needed regulatory reforms. Finally, I expect all rural \nhousing programs, including the Section 515 Program, to be part of a \nmajor housing policy overhaul during this Congress.\n  This bill also allows the Department of Housing and Urban Development \nto extend, for up to 18 months, certain expiring section 8 project-\nbased contracts. These contracts can only be renewed on terms identical \nto the current contracts. This is a stop-gap measure designed to \nprovide some certainty to the section 8 project-based programs as \nCongress considers major reforms to address the cost and designs of \nthese programs. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. \n        Campbell, and Mr. Exon):\n  S. J. Res. 18. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution relative to contributions and expenditures intended to \naffect elections for Federal, State, and local office; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                CAMPAIGN REFORM CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to address a problem with \nwhich we are all too familiar--the ever-increasing cost of campaign \nspending. The need for limits on campaign expenditures is more urgent \nthan ever, with the total cost of congressional campaigns skyrocketing \nfrom $446 million in 1990 to well over $590 million in 1994. For nearly \na quarter of a century, Congress has tried to tackle runaway campaign \nspending; again and again, Congress has failed.\n  Let us resolve not to repeat the mistakes of past campaign finance \nreform efforts, which have bogged down in partisanship as Democrats and \nRepublicans each tried to gore the other's sacred cows. During the 103d \nCongress there was a sign that we could move beyond this partisan \nbickering, when the Senate in a bipartisan fashion expressed its \nsupport for a limit on campaign expenditures. In May 1993, a nonbinding \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution was agreed to which advocated the \nadoption of a constitutional amendment empowering Congress and the \nStates to limit campaign expenditures. During the 104th Congress, let \nus take the next step and adopt such a constitutional amendment--a \nsimple, straightforward, nonpartisan solution.\n  As Prof. Gerald G. Ashdown has written in the New England Law Review, \namending the Constitution to allow Congress to regulate campaign \nexpenditures is ``the most theoretically attractive of the approaches-\nto-reform since, from a broad free speech perspective, the decision in \nBuckley is misguided and has worsened the campaign finance \natmosphere.'' Adds Professor Ashdown: ``If Congress could \nconstitutionally limit the campaign expenditures of individuals, \ncandidates, and committees, along with contributions, most of the \ntroubles * * * would be eliminated.''\n  Right to the point, in its landmark 1976 ruling in Buckley versus \nValeo, the Supreme Court mistakenly equated a candidate's right to \nspend unlimited sums of money with his right to free speech. In the \nface of spirited dissents, the Court drew a bizarre distinction between \ncampaign contributions on the grounds that `` * * * the governmental \ninterest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption \noutweighs considerations of free speech.''\n  I have never been able to fathom why that same test--the governmental \ninterest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption--\ndoes not overwhelmingly justify limits on campaign spending. However, \nit seems to me that the Court committed a far graver error by striking \ndown spending limits as a threat to free speech. The fact is, spending \nlimits in Federal campaigns would act to restore the free speech that \nhas been eroded by the Buckley decision.\n  After all, as a practical reality, what Buckley says is: Yes, if you \nhave personal wealth, then you have access to television, you have \nfreedom of speech. But if you do not have personal wealth, then you are \ndenied access to television. Instead of freedom of speech, you have \nonly the freedom to shut up.\n  So let us be done with this phony charge that spending limits are \nsomehow an attack on freedom of speech. As Justice Byron White points \nout, clear as a bell, in his dissent, both contribution\n limits and spending limits are neutral as to the content of speech and \nare not motivated by fear of the consequences of the political speech \nin general.\n\n  Mr. President, every Senator realizes that television advertising is \nthe name of the game in modern American politics. In warfare, if you \ncontrol the air, you control the battlefield. In politics, if you \ncontrol the airwaves, you control the tenor and focus of a campaign.\n  Probably 80 percent of campaign communications take place through the \nmedium of television. And most of that TV airtime comes at a dear \nprice. In South Carolina, you are talking between $1000 and $2,000 for \n30 seconds of primetime advertising. In New York City, it is anywhere \nfrom $30,000 to $40,000 for the same 30 seconds.\n  The hard fact of life for a candidate is that if you are not on TV, \nyou are not truly in the race. Wealthy challengers as well as \nincumbents flushed with money go directly to the TV studio. Those \nwithout personal wealth are sidetracked to the time-consuming pursuit \nof cash.\n  The Buckley decision created a double bind. It upheld restrictions on \ncampaign contributions, but struck down restrictions on how much \ncandidates with deep pockets can spend. The Court ignored the practical \nreality that if my opponent has only $50,000 to spend in a race and I \nhave $1 million, then I can effectively deprive him of his speech. By \nfailing to respond to my advertising, my cash-poor opponent will appear \nunwilling to speak up in his own defense.\n  Justice Thurgood Marshall zeroed in on this disparity in his dissent \nto Buckley. By striking down the limit on what a candidate can spend, \nJustice Marshall said, ``It would appear to follow that the candidate \nwith a substantial personal fortune at his disposal is off to a \nsignificant head start.''\n  Indeed, Justice Marshall went further: He argued that by upholding \nthe limitations on contributions but striking down limits on overall \nspending, the Court put on additional premium on a candidate's personal \nwealth.\n  Justice Marshall was dead right. Our urgent task is to right the \ninjustice of Buckley versus Valeo by empowering Congress to place caps \non Federal campaign spending. We are all painfully aware of the \nuncontrolled escalation of campaign spending. The average cost of a \nwinning Senate race was $1.2 million in 1980, rising to $2.1 million in \n1984, and skyrocketing to $3.1 million in 1986, $3.7 million in 1988, \nand up to $4.1 million this past year. To raise that kind of money, the \naverage Senator must raise over $13,200 a week, every week of his or \nher 6-year term. Overall spending in congressional races increased from \n$403 million in 1990 to more than $590 million in 1994--almost a 50-\npercent increase in 4 short years.\n  This obsession with money distracts us from the people's business. At \nworst, it corrupts and degrades the entire political process. \nFundraisers used to be arranged so they didn't conflict with the Senate \nschedule; nowadays, the Senate schedule is regularly shifted to \naccommodate fundraisers.\n  I have run for statewide office 16 times in South Carolina. You \nestablish a certain campaign routine, say, shaking hands at a mill \nshift in Greer, visiting a bid country store outside of Belton, and so \non. Over the years, they look for you and expect you to come around. \nBut in recent years, those mill visits and dropping by the country \nstore have become a casualty of the system. There is very little time \nfor them. We are out chasing dollars.\n  During my 1986 reelection campaign, I found myself raising money to \nget on TV to raise money to get on TV to raise money to get on TV. It \nis a vicious cycle.\n  After the election, I held a series of town meetings across the \nState. Friends asked, ``Why are you doing these down meetings: You just \ngot elected. You've got 6 years.'' To which I answered, ``I'm doing it \nbecause it's my first chance to really get out and meet with the people \nwho elected me. I didn't get much of a chance during the \n[[Page S1007]] campaign. I was too busy chasing bucks.'' I had a \nsimilar experience in 1992.\n  I remember Senator Richard Russell saying: ``They give you a 6-year \nterm in this U.S. Senate 2 years to be a statesman, the next 2 years to \nbe a politician, and the last 2 years to be a demagogue.'' Regrettably, \nwe are no longer afforded even 2 years as statesmen. We proceed \nstraight to politics and demagoguery right after the election because \nof the imperatives of raising money.\n  My proposed constitutional amendment would change all this. It would \nempower Congress to impose reasonable spending limits on Federal \ncampaigns. For instance, we could impose a limit of, say, $800,000 per \nSenate candidate in a small State like South Carolina--a far cry from \nthe millions spent by my opponent and me in 1992. And bear in mind that \ndirect expenditures account for only a portion of total spending. For \ninstance, my 1992 opponent's direct expenditures were supplemented by \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in expenditures by independent \norganizations and by the State and local Republican Party. When you \ntotal up spending from all sources, my challenger and I spent roughly \nthe same amount in 1992.\n  And incidentally, Mr. President, let's be done with the canard that \nspending limits would be a boon to incumbents, who supposedly already \nhave name recognition and standing with the public and therefore begin \nwith a built-in advantage over challengers. Nonsense. I hardly need to \nremind my Senate colleagues of the high rate of mortality in upper \nChamber elections. And as to the alleged invulnerability of incumbents \nin the House, I would simply note that more than 50 percent of the \nHouse membership has been replaced since the 1990 elections.\n  I can tell you from experience that any advantages of incumbency are \nmore than counterbalanced by the obvious disadvantages of incumbency, \nspecifically the disadvantage of defending hundreds of controversial \nvotes in Congress.\n  I also agree with University of Virginia political scientist Larry \nSabato, who has suggested a doctrine of sufficiency with regard to \ncampaign spending. Professor Sabato puts it this way: ``While \nchallengers tend to be underfunded, they can compete\n effectively if they are capable and have sufficient money to present \nthemselves and their messages.''\n\n  Moreover, Mr. President, I submit that once we have overall spending \nlimits, it will matter little whether a candidate gets money from \nindustry groups, or from PAC's, or from individuals. It is still a \nreasonable--``sufficient,'' to use Professor Sabato's term--amount any \nway you cut it. Spending will be under control, and we will be able to \naccount for every dollar going out.\n  On the issue of PAC's, Mr. President, let me say that I have never \nbelieved that PAC's per se are an evil in the current system. On the \ncontrary, PAC's are a very healthy instrumentality of politics. PAC's \nhave brought people into the political process: nurses, educators, \nsmall businesspeople, senior citizens, unionists, you name it. They \npermit people of modest means and limited individual influence to band \ntogether with others of mutual interest so their message is heard and \nknown.\n  For years we have encouraged these people to get involved, to \nparticipate. Yet now that they are participating, we turn around and \nsay, ``Oh, no, your influence is corrupting, your money is tainted.'' \nThis is wrong. The evil to be corrected is not the abundance of \nparticipation but the superabundance of money. The culprit is runaway \ncampaign spending.\n  To a distressing degree, elections are determined not in the \npolitical marketplace but in the financial marketplace. Our elections \nare supposed to be contests of ideas, but too often they degenerate \ninto megadollar derbies, paper chases through the board rooms of \ncorporations and special interests.\n  Mr. President, I repeat, campaign spending must be brought under \ncontrol. The constitutional amendment I have proposed would permit \nCongress to impose fair, responsible, workable limits on Federal \ncampaign expenditures.\n  Such a reform would have four important impacts. First, it would end \nthe mindless pursuits of ever-fatter campaign war chests. Second, it \nwould free candidates from their current obsession with fundraising and \nallow them to focus more on issues and ideas; once elected to office, \nwe would not have to spend 20 percent of our time raising money to keep \nour seats. Third, it would curb the influence of special interests. And \nfourth, it would create a more level playing field for our Federal \ncampaigns--a competitive environment where personal wealth does not \ngive candidates an insurmountable advantage.\n  Finally, Mr. President, a word about the advantages of the amend-the-\nConstitution approach that I propose. Recent history amply demonstrates \nthe practicality and viability of this constitutional route. Certainly, \nit is not coincidence that all five of the most recent amendments to \nthe Constitution have dealt with Federal election issues. In elections, \nthe process drives and shapes the end result. Election laws can skew \nelection results, whether you are talking about a poll tax depriving \nminorities of their right to vote, or the absence of campaign spending \nlimits giving an unfair advantage to wealthy candidates. These are \nprofound issues which go to the heart of our democracy, and it is \nentirely appropriate that they be addressed through constitutional \namendment.\n  And let us not be distracted by the argument that the amend-the-\nConstitution approach will take too long. Take too long? We have been \ndithering on this campaign finance issue since the early 1970's, and we \nhaven't advanced the ball a single yard. It has been a quarter of a \ncentury, and no legislative solution has done the job.\n  The last five constitutional amendments took an average of 17 months \nto be adopted. There is no reason why we cannot pass this joint \nresolution, submit it to the States for a vote, and ratify the \namendment in time for it to govern the 1996 election. Indeed, the \namend-the-Constitution approach could prove more expeditious than the \nalternative legislative approach. Bear in mind that the various public \nfinancing bills that have been proposed would all be vulnerable to a \nPresidential veto. In contrast, this joint resolution, once passed by \nthe Congress, goes directly to the States for ratification. Once \nratified, it becomes the law of the land, and it is not subject to veto \nor Supreme Court challenge.\n  And, by the way, I reject the argument that if we were to pass and \nratify this amendment, Democrats and Republicans would be unable to \nhammer out a mutually acceptable formula of campaign expenditure \nlimits. A Democratic Congress and Republican President did exactly that \nin 1974, and we can certainly do it again.\n  Mr. President, this joint resolution will address the campaign \nfinance mess directly, decisively, and with finality. The Supreme Court \nhas chosen to ignore the overwhelming importance of media advertising \nin today's campaigns. In the Buckley decision, it prescribed a bogus \nif-you-have-the-money-you-can-talk version of free speech. In its \nplace, I urge passage of this joint resolution, the freedom of speech \nin political campaigns amendment. Let us ensure equal freedom of \nexpression for all who seek Federal office.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BROWN:\n  S.J. Res. 19. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to limiting congressional \nterms; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  term limits constitutional amendment\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I rise to offer a joint \nresolution calling for the adoption of a constitutional amendment \nlimiting congressional terms.\n  Congress is considering several measures that will change the way \nCongress does business. Congressional accountability will apply the \nlaws to Congress. Unfunded mandate reform will reduce burdens on the \nStates. The balanced budget amendment will fundamentally alter our \nbudget process, and the line-item veto will end an era of midnight \npork-barrel spending.\n  My amendment offers change of a different sort. Instead of changing \nour procedures, term limitations will change the way we think.\n  [[Page S1008]] Following ratification of term limits, politicians \nwould no longer view Congress as a lifetime career. The era of constant \ncampaigning and the shortsighted policy making that comes with it would \ncome to an end. Incumbent advantages would be limited. Elections would \nbecome more competitive. Voters would have a wider electoral choice as \nmore and more people run for office. Instead of making political \nchoices to preserve their seats, Members would be more likely to make \nthe tough choices necessary to preserve our Nation.\n  When our Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, they limited \nGovernment by disbursing power between the branches of Government. \nChecks and balances were created to provide oversight amongst the \nbranches, and to ensure that Government remained loyal to the people, \nall other powers were specifically reserved for the people.\n  Over 80 percent of Americans favor limiting congressional terms; 22 \nof 23 initiative States have passed term limits for their Federal \ndelegations and the 23d State should pass term limits this year.\n  Despite this overwhelming support, this body has voted on term limits \nonly three times this century. Even worse, term limits has never made \nit to the floor of the House of Representatives. I was responsible for \ninitiating two of the three votes in the Senate. The first time we \nreceived 30 votes, the second time 39 voted with us.\n  It is now time for the whole of Congress to answer the call of the \npeople. The success of grass roots groups is impressive but incomplete. \nCongress must act to bring term limits to the millions of Americans \nwhose wishes for a citizen legislature have been ignored at the State \nlevel.\n  My amendment would impose term limits on all Members of Congress. \nSenators would be limited to serving no more than two consecutive 6-\nyear terms and Representatives would be limited to six consecutive 2-\nyear terms.\n  Only elections following the amendment's ratification would be \ncounted, and appointments and special elections would be excluded from \nthe limits.\n  Mr. President, it is time we return to the fundamental belief of our \nFounders--that holding public office is a public service, not a \nlifetime career.\n  Term limits will restore the competition, responsiveness, and \ndiversity intended by the Framers of the Constitution and demanded by \nour constituents.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/17/senate-section/article/S1004-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 15\n\n  At the request of Mr. Moynihan, the names of the Senator from Florida \n[Mr. Graham] and the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 15, a bill to provide that professional \nbaseball teams and leagues composed of such teams shall be subject to \nthe antitrust laws.\n\n\n                                 S. 38\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from New York \n[Mr. D'Amato] was added as a cosponsor of S. 38, a bill to amend the \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 194\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Brown] was added as a cosponsor of S. 194, a bill to repeal the \nMedicare and Medicaid Coverage Data Bank, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                          Senate Resolution 31\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Boxer, the name of the Senator from Maryland \n[Ms. Mikulski] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Resolution 31, a \nresolution to express the sense of the Senate that the Attorney General \nshould act immediately to protect reproductive health care clinics.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/17/senate-section/article/S1008-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 54--ORIGINAL RESOLUTION REPORTED AUTHORIZING \n             EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\n\n  Mr. HATCH, from the Committee on the Judiciary, reported the \nfollowing original resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nRules and Administration:\n\n                               S.

Res. 60\n\n       Whereas Federal spending and the Federal budget deficit \n     have reached unreasonable and insupportable levels;\n       Whereas a line-item veto would enable the President to \n     eliminate wasteful pork-barrel spending from the Federal \n     budget and curb the deficit before considering cuts in \n     important programs;\n       Whereas evidence may suggest that the Framers of the \n     Constitution intended that the President have the authority \n     to exercise the line-item veto;\n       Whereas scholars who have studied the matter are not \n     unanimous on the question of whether the President currently \n     has the authority to exercise the line-item veto;\n       Whereas there has never been a definitive judicial ruling \n     that the President does not have the authority to exercise \n     the line-item veto;\n       Whereas some scholars who have studied the question agree \n     that a definitive judicial determination on the issue of \n     whether the President currently has the authority to exercise \n     the line-item veto may be warranted: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should exercise the line-item veto without awaiting \n     the enactment of additional authorization for the purpose of \n     obtaining a judicial determination of its constitutionality.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, earlier today the Constitutional Law \nSubcommittee of the Judiciary Committee had hearings scheduled on the \nline-item veto, and regrettably those hearings were not held because an \nobjection was lodged under the rule which prohibits committee hearings \nfrom going forward or subcommittee hearings from going forward if they \nare in process more than 2 hours after the U.S. Senate commences its \nbusiness.\n  I thought it was unfortunate that the hearings were canceled on that \nground because a great many witnesses had come, and some from far \ndistances, such as the distinguished Governor of Wisconsin, Gov. Tommy \nThompson, to testify about this very important measure.\n  Mr. President, as the Congressional Record will show, this Senator \nhas \n[[Page S1010]] long supported the line-item veto. That is a provision \nwhich would give the President of the United States the authority to \nstrike a given line of expenditure without vetoing the entire bill.\n  There was a very dramatic presentation made by President Reagan a few \nyears ago when the Congress submitted to the President a continuing \nresolution which was all 13 of the appropriations bills. And it was an \nenormous pile, about 20 or 24 inches in size. President Reagan at his \nState of the Union speech was expressing his concern that, instead of \nsending 13 individual appropriations bills which the President might \napprove or veto one at a time, this continuing resolution had been \nsent, so that it was not even the line-item veto but it was a \ncircumstance where the President had this massive legislation.\n  He had the bill precariously positioned on the edge of the\n   podium, and I became somewhat concerned that it was going to fall. \nThen after 1 minute or 2, I realized that it was President Reagan's \nmethod--perhaps you might call it a theatrical method--to underscore \nthe volume and size of the bill. And I think the people watching around \nthe country on national television were concerned that the bill might \nfall as well.\n\n  That was a very dramatic way of depicting the problem the President \nfaces with a continuing resolution with some 13 appropriations bills. \nBut the same principle applies to a single bill. I believe that it is \nvery much in the national interest so that the President would have the \nauthority to strike an individual item one by one without vetoing the \nentire bill.\n  It is my view, Mr. President, that the President of the United States \npossesses constitutional authority under existing law to exercise the \nline-item veto. That proposition has been supported by very intensive \nlocal research which my staff and I have undertaken, and also by very \nextensive research which has been undertaken by distinguished leading \nscholars, including Professor McDonald, who has written extensively on \nthis subject.\n  The constitutional approach that the Constitution currently gives the \nPresident the line-item veto arises from the fact that clause 3 of \narticle I, section 7, of the U.S. Constitution is an exact copy of the \nMassachusetts Constitution. The Massachusetts Constitution was enacted \nsubstantially before the U.S. Constitution. It goes back to the \nMassachusetts fundamental charter of 1733, and was implemented \nspecifically to give the royal governor a check on the unbridled \nspending of the colonial legislature.\n  Professor McDonald points out that at the time of the Constitution's \nratification process anti-Federalist pamphleteers opposed the U.S. \nconstitutional provision because it ``made too strong a line-item veto \nin the hands of the President.'' Federalists, on the other hand, saw \nthis clause, clause 3, and the power to veto individual items of \nappropriations, as an important executive privilege.\n  James Bowdoin, the Federal Governor of Massachusetts, argued that the \nveto power conferred upon the President in the Federal Constitution was \nto be read in light of the Massachusetts experience which did give the \nU.S. President the line-item veto. In the Federalist Paper No. 69, \nAlexander Hamilton, a member of the Constitutional Convention, who was \nsoon to become the first Secretary of the Treasury, wrote that the \nconstitutional veto gave power which ``tallies exactly with the \nrevisionary authority of the council of revision'' in New York, which \naccording to Professor McDonald had the power to revise appropriation \nbills and in effect exercise the line-item veto.\n  Without going into great detail--and I will put in the Record a \nstatement which will amplify this--in the early days of the Republic \nthe President did in effect exercise the line-item veto. President \nWashington and Treasury Secretary Hamilton acted upon the authority to \nshift appropriated funds from one account to another.\n  And Thomas Jefferson as President also embraced that practice and on \nat least two occasions refused to spend money that the Congress had \nappropriated. President Andrew Jackson declined to enforce provisions \nof a constitutional enactment, in effect exercising the line item veto, \nand similarly in 1842, President John Tyler signed a bill which he \nrefused to execute in full--there again, really exercising the line-\nitem veto. It was not until after the Civil War that the President \nassumed that he did not have the individual line-item veto when \nPresident Grant urged Congress to grant him such authority.\n  Mr. President, that is an abbreviated statement of the reasoning that \nthere is constitutional authority presently for the President of the \nUnited States to exercise the line-item veto. I had occasion to discuss \nthis matter with President Bush when he was in office on a long plane \nride, and the President said that his lawyer told him he did not have \nthe power to line-item veto. I suggested, perhaps somewhat cavalierly, \nthat perhaps he should change lawyers. I quickly suggested that \nPresident Bush not tell the bar association because I might want to \npractice law again some day.\n  In 1993, I had occasion to travel with President Clinton to western \nPennsylvania and discussed with him the issue of the line item veto, \nand upon my saying to President Clinton that he had the authority to \nexercise the line-item veto, he asked me to send him a memorandum on \nthe subject, which I did.\n  I think it useful at the conclusion of my presentation to include \nthat memorandum together with the letters I sent to President Clinton \nand his reply to me on the subject.\n  I am introducing, Mr. President, two resolutions, so that the \nJudiciary Committee will have these resolutions before them when they \nnext have deliberation on the line-item veto. We had a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing last year on a resolution which I had introduced, \nwhich would propose:\n\n       The Constitution grants to the President the authority to \n     veto individual items of appropriation and the President to \n     exercise that constitutional authority to veto individual \n     items of appropriation without awaiting the enactment of \n     additional authorization.\n\n  When that matter was pending before the constitutional law \nsubcommittee, there was considerable sentiment among other Members that \nthat might have gone a little farther than they wanted to go. But they \nwere prepared to vote out a resolution which would say that there was \nat least sufficient authority so that the President should exercise the \nline-item veto. I am introducing the first resolution again which was \nbefore the 103d Congress, and then the second resolution which would \nprovide that it is the sense of the Senate that the President should \nexercise the line-item veto without awaiting the enactment of \nadditional authorization for the purpose of obtaining a judicial \ndetermination of its constitutionality.\n  In my opinion, Mr. President, the line-item veto is very, very \nimportant and ought to be exercised now. I think anyone who is \nPresident ought to move forward because of the legal authority that the \nPresident currently has that authority. But at a very minimum, there is \nsufficient legal authority for the law to be submitted for a judicial \ntest.\n  Mr. President, I have long supported a line-item veto for the \nPresident, I have proposed constitutional amendments to grant the \nPresident such authority, and I have supported statutory enhanced \nrescission authority.\n  As these measures have failed, after extensive legal research and \nanalysis, I now urge the President to exercise the line-item veto \nwithout further legislative action. I do so because I believe, after a \ncareful review of the historical record, that the President already has \nthe authority under the Constitution to veto individual items of \nappropriation in an appropriations bill and that neither an amendment \nto the Constitution nor legislation granting enhanced rescission \nauthority is necessary.\n  The line-item veto would be effective in helping to reduce the huge \ndeficit that now burdens our country. While alone it is no panacea, its \nuse would enable the President to veto specific items of appropriation \nin large spending bills, thereby restraining some of the pork-barrel or \npurely local projects that creep into every appropriations bill. With \nthe broad national interest rather than purely local concerns at work, \nthe President's use of the line-item veto would cut significant amounts \nof this type of spending.\n  [[Page S1011]] The line-item veto would also have a salutary effect \non Members of Congress. Knowing that their attempts to insert items \ninto appropriations bills will be subjected to presidential scrutiny, \nMembers are likely to become more reluctant to seek special favors for \nthe home district at the expense of the Nation at large. While such \ndiscretionary programs and earmarks do not account for a large part of \nFederal spending, getting control over them will improve the \nauthorization and appropriations process. The President could use the \nveto to eliminate funding for unauthorized programs. Such a message \nwould motivate Congress to reauthorize programs with regularity, \nimproving our oversight and the effectiveness of the Government.\n  The line-item veto is not a partisan issue. It is a good Government \nissue. Many Democrats support the line-item veto; some Republicans \noppose it. As a candidate in 1992, Bill Clinton firmly embraced the \nline-item veto. As President, he has the opportunity to make effective \nuse of it to help control in some small measure the deficits we \naccumulate. By exercising this option, the President can provide a \ncheck on unfettered spending and carve away many of the pork-barrel \nprojects contained in both versions of the budget that serve primarily \nprivate, not national interests.\n  Beyond the specific savings, the presence and use of the line-item \nveto by the President could give the public assurances that tax dollars \nwere not being wasted. Each year the media report many instances of \ncongressional expenditures which border, if in fact they do not pass, \nthe frivolous. Those expenditures are made because of the \nimpracticality of having the President veto an entire appropriations \nbill or sometimes a continuing resolution. That creates a general \nimpression that public funds are routinely wasted by the Congress.\n  The line-item veto could eliminate such waste and help to dispel that \nnotion. The resentment to taxes is obviously much less when the public \ndoes not feel the moneys are being wasted. Notwithstanding the so \ncalled taxpayers' revolts in some States, there is still a willingness \nby the citizenry to approve taxes for specific items where the \ntaxpayers believe the funds are being spent for a useful purpose. The \nline-item veto could be a significant factor in improving such public \nconfidence in governmental spending even beyond the specific savings.\n  I now turn to the basis for my position that the President already \nhas authority under the Constitution to exercise the line-item veto, \nwithout a need for additional constitutional or statutory legislation.\n  The constitutional basis for the President's exercise of a line-item \nveto is found in article I, section 7, clause 3 of the Constitution. \nClause 2 of article I, section 7 provides the executive the authority \nto veto bills in their entirety. The question of conferring on the \nPresident the power to veto specific items within a bill appears not to \nhave been discussed at the Constitutional Convention. During the \ndrafting of the Constitution, however, James Madison expressed his \nconcern that Congress might try to get around the President's veto \npower by labeling bills by some other term. In response to Madison's \nconcern, Edmund Randolph proposed and the Convention adopted the third \nclause of article I, section 7, whose language was taken directly from \na provision of the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780.\n  Clause 3 of article I, section 7 provides that in addition to bills--\nthe veto of which is set forth in clause 2:\n\n       Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence \n     of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary \n     (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to \n     the President of the United States; and before the same shall \n     take effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved \n     by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and \n     House of Representatives, according to the Rules and \n     Limitations prescribed in the case of a Bill.\n\n  While the clause does not explicitly set out the executive authority \nto veto individual items of appropriation, the context and practice are \nevidence that that was its purpose. According to noted historian Prof. \nForrest McDonald of the University of Alabama, the clause was taken \ndirectly from a provision of the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780. In \nhis article entitled ``The Framers' Conception of the Veto Power,'' \npublished in the monograph, ``Pork Barrels and Principles: The Politics \nof the Presidential Veto'' 1-7 (1988), Professor McDonald explains that \nthis provision dates back to the State's fundamental charter of 1733 \nand was implemented specifically to give the royal Governor a check on \nthe unbridled spending of the colonial legislature,\n which had put the colony in serious debt by avoiding the Governor's \nveto power by appropriating money through ``votes'' rather than through \nlegislation.\n\n  Professor McDonald also points out that at the time of the \nConstitution's ratification process, anti-Federalist pamphleteers \nopposed the proposed Constitution and in particular clause 3 of article \nI, section 7, precisely because it ``made too strong a line-item veto \nin the hands of the President.''\n  Federalists, on the other hand, saw clause 3 and the power to veto \nindividual items of appropriation as an important executive privilege--\none that was essential in assuring fiscal responsibility while also \ncomporting with the delicate balance of power they were seeking to \nachieve. For example, during his State's ratifying convention, James \nBowdoin, the Federalist Governor of Massachusetts, argued that the veto \npower conferred to the President in the Federal Constitution was to be \nread in light of the Massachusetts experience under which, as I have \nalready noted, the Governor had enjoyed the right to veto or reduce by \nline-item since 1733.\n  In the Federalist No. 69, Alexander Hamilton, a member of the \nConstitutional Convention who was soon to become the first Secretary of \nthe Treasury, wrote that the constitutional veto power ``tallies \nexactly with the revisionary authority of the council of revision'' in \nNew York, which, according to Professor McDonald, had the power to \nrevise appropriations bills, not merely accept or reject legislative \nenactments in their entirety. This power was not unique to New York, as \nthe Governors of Massachusetts, Georgia, and Vermont--soon to be the \nfirst new State admitted to the new union--also enjoyed revisionary \nauthority over legislative appropriations.\n  As many of my colleagues know, our distinguished colleague from West \nVirginia, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, has made a \nseries of speeches on the Senate floor drawing on his vast knowledge \nabout the historical underpinnings of our republican form of government \nand on the Framers' rationale for the checks and balances they created. \nHis review of Roman history is apt, because, as he knows, the Framers \nwere acutely aware of Roman history. This awareness helped them develop \ntheir government of limited powers and of checks and balances. The \nFramers knew that the vice of faction, the desire to pursue one's \nprivate interest at the expense of the public interest, had helped \nbring on the downfall of the Roman Republic. Madison and others were \nconvinced that by diffusing power and balancing it off in different \nbranches of government, we might avoid to the fullest extent possible, \nthe defects of faction.\n  In another sense, however, the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, overlooks the fundamental differences between \nRome's ancient government and ours. In ours, the people have a direct \nsay. In Rome's the male citizens had a limited, indirect say, but \nmostly the ruling class was hereditary or was based on wealth. We have \na democracy; Rome did not.\n  This fundamental difference between our Nation and ancient Rome means \nthat there are more factions with which our Government must contend. \nWith so many different factions, or ``interest groups'' as we call them \ntoday, it is much easier for one of them to capture a single Member of \nCongress to advance its cause and to fund it. Each Representative has a \nmuch narrower focus than a Senator, each of whom has a much narrower \nfocus than the President. Thus, Congress is more susceptible to \npressure from factions, as one Member who wants a favor for a \nparticular faction trades his or her support for another Member's \npreferred faction. We all know that this appropriations log-rolling \noccurs. Ultimately, the President is presented with one large spending \nbill, much of which reflects the political horse-trading that occurs.\n  [[Page S1012]] The line-item veto sheds light on the power of private \ninterests that seek to use the appropriations process for their own \nprivate benefit. By excising line items and making Congress vote on \nthem individually in an effort to override the veto, the President can \nshed light directly on these private interests and force Members to be \nmore accountable to their constituents by voting on the projects \nidentified by the President as unnecessary and wasteful.\n  Some, like the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, contend that the line-item veto would result in an \nintolerable shift of power from Congress to the Executive. To this \nargument, I have two responses. The first is that, as I believe I show, \nthe Framers of the Constitution intended that the President have the \nauthority to veto individual items of appropriations. Thus, in their \nconcept, the line-item veto does not offend the balance of powers.\n  The second response is related to the entire structure of the \nGovernment. The Constitution places the power of the purse in the hands \nof Congress. It is a peculiarly legislative function to decide how much \nmoney to spend and how to allocate these expenditures. In this regard, \nhowever, spending is no different than any other legislative function. \nThus, there is no reason to consider the line-item veto any more of an \ninfringement of the separation of powers than the President's ability \nto veto bills at all. Hamilton recognized the structural importance of \nthe veto in the Federalist 73, when he wrote that the veto provides \n``an additional security against the enaction of improper laws * * * to \nguard the community against the effects of faction, precipitancy, or of \nany impulse unfriendly to the public good, which may happen to \ninfluence a majority of [the legislative] body'' from time to time. The \nFramers were acutely aware that it is the legislative branch that is \nmost susceptible to factional influence. Thus, they understood that the \nveto served a critical role.\n  But, opponents of the line-item veto argue, Hamilton's point went to \nbills as a whole, and not simply pieces of them. The legislative \nprocess necessarily relies on horse-trading to get things done, and \nnowhere is such trading more important than in the appropriations \nprocess. This response, while acknowledging\n the reality, is an answer that directly contradicts the Framers' \nintent and leads to bad government, for it accepts the premise that \nfactions and the prominent Members of Congress who support their causes \nmust be bought off with goodies in appropriations bills. But that is \nprecisely the evil that the Framers sought to insulate against with the \nveto.\n\n  Given the role of factions in the appropriation process, the use of \nthe line-item veto is completely consistent with the Framers' \nconception of the veto power. Indeed, that is not surprising, as the \nFramers believed they had granted the President a line-item veto. \nDespite the arguments of the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee to the contrary, the line-item veto was not \nonly intended by the Framers but is an appropriate limitation on \ncongressional authority to combat the force of faction.\n  This process would not surprise the Framers of the Constitution. \nMadison and the others who met in Philadelphia in 1787 were not just \nknowledgeable about history. They were practical men of affairs and \npolitics who understood human nature. They knew the dangers of faction \nand the likelihood that faction would influence Congress more so than \nthe President, who is responsible to the entire Nation, not a single \ndistrict or State.\n  Thus, it is only to be expected that the Framers provided Congress \nwith the power to appropriate funds, tempered with executive authority \nto line-item veto as a means of expunging special interest spending was \ntheir resolution, and history bears this out. The line-item veto is \nentirely consistent with the Framers' conception of government and the \ndangers of faction.\n  Shortly after the new Federal Constitution was ratified, several \nStates, including Georgia, Vermont, Kentucky, and my home State of \nPennsylvania, rewrote their constitutions to conform with the Federal \none and specifically incorporated language to give to their executives \nthe authority to exercise a line-item veto. These States were in \naddition to the States like Massachusetts and New York, where the \nGovernor's power to revise items of appropriation was well-established. \nFor example, article II, section 10 of the Georgia Constitution of 1789 \ngave the Governor the power of ``revision of all bills'' subject to a \ntwo-thirds vote of the general assembly. Section 16 of chapter II of \nthe Vermont Constitution of 1793 vested in the Governor and council the \nright to revise legislation or to propose amendments to the \nlegislature, which would have to adopt the proposed amendments if the \nbill were to be enacted. Article I of the Kentucky Constitution of 1792 \nand section 23 of article I of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1790 \ntracked the language of article I, section 7, clause 3 of the new U.S. \nConstitution.\n  The chief executives of both the State and new Federal governments \nimmediately employed the line-item veto. On the national level, the \nearly practice was one in which the President viewed appropriations as \npermissive rather than mandatory. President Washington and his Treasury \nSecretary Hamilton assumed the authority to shift appropriated funds \nfrom one account to another. Although his party had at one time opposed \nsuch transfers, once he became President, Republican Thomas Jefferson \nalso embraced the practice, and at least on two occasions, he refused \nto spend money that the Congress had appropriated.\n  The practice continued. As late as 1830, President Andrew Jackson \ndeclined to enforce provisions of a congressional enactment. Likewise \nin 1842, President John Tyler signed a bill that he refused to excute \nin full. It was not until after the Civil War that a President assumed \nhe did not already have the authority to veto individual items of \nappropriation, when President Grant urged the Congress to grant him \nsuch authority.\n  But President Grant's view was anomalous. The Framers' understanding \nand their original intent was that the Constitution did provide the \nauthority to veto or impound specific items of appropriation. The \nStates understood that to be the case, and many in fact embraced the \nFederal model as a means of providing their own executives this same \nauthority.\n  I believe that the evidence strongly supports the position that under \nthe Constitution the President has the authority to employ the line-\nitem veto. At the very least, the President's use of the line-item veto \nwill almost certainly engender a court challenge if the veto is not \noverridden. The courts will then decide whether the Constitution \nauthorizes the line-item veto. If they find it does, then the matter \nwill be settled. If they find it does not, then Congress may revisit \nthe issue and decide whether to amend the Constitution or grant \nstatutory enhanced rescission authority to the President.\n  In conclusion, I urge the President to employ the line-item veto if \nhe is seriously committed to deficit reduction. As I have argued here \ntoday, the authority to exercise this power is not dependent on the \nadoption of a constitutional amendment or any additional legislation; \nit already exists. The Framers' intent and the historical practice of \nthe first Presidents serve as ample evidence that the Constitution \nconfers to the Executive the authority to line-item veto. Given \nPresident Clinton's use of the line-item veto as Governor and his \nsupport of it as a candidate, I urge him to act on that authority \nconsistent with his rightful power to do so.\n  Mr. President, with these documents in the Record, there will be a \nreasonably full explanation of the legal basis for the line-item veto \nand the two resolutions which I am submitting for consideration of the \nSenate and which will be on the record when the Judiciary Committee \nnext holds its hearing on this subject.\n  I thank my colleagues for the time I have taken.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                               Memorandum\n\n     Re Presidential authority to exercise a line-item veto\n       The President currently enjoys the authority under the \n     Constitution to exercise a line- \n     [[Page S1013]] item veto without any additional \n     constitutional or statutory authority. The consistutional \n     basis for the President's exercise of a line-item veto is to \n     be found in article I, section 7, clause 3 of the \n     Constitution.\n       The first article of the Constitution vests legislative \n     authority in the two Houses of Congress established \n     thereunder. Clause 2 of section 7 of the first article \n     provides the presidential authority and procedure to veto \n     ``bills.'' This is the basis for the President's clearly \n     established authority to veto legislation. The provision also \n     established the procedure under which Congress may override \n     the President's veto.\n       The question of conferring authority on the President to \n     veto specific items within a bill was not discussed at the \n     Constitutional Convention. During the drafting of the \n     Constitution in 1787, however, James Madison noted in his \n     subsequently published diary that he had expressed his \n     concern that Congress might try to get around the President's \n     veto power by labeling ``bills'' by some other term. In \n     response to Madison's concern and in order to guard the \n     President's veto authority from encroachment or being \n     undermined and preserve the careful balance of power it \n     sought to establish, Edmund Randolph of Virigina proposed and \n     the Convention adopted language from the Massachusetts \n     Constitution which became article I, section 7, clause 3.\n       This clause requires that in addition to bills:\n       ``Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence \n     of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary \n     (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to \n     the President of the United States; and before the Same shall \n     take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved \n     by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and \n     House of Representatives, according to the Rules and \n     Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill [these being set \n     forth in article I, section 7, clause 2].''\n       In combination with the preceding clause 2 of section 7, \n     this third clause gives the President the authority to veto \n     any legislative adoption of Congress, subject to \n     congressional override.\n       The historical context of its adoption supports the \n     position that clauses 3 vests the President with authority to \n     veto individual items of appropriation.\n       According to the noted historian Professor Forrest McDonald \n     in his paper ``The Framers' Conception of the Veto Power,'' \n     published in ``Pork Barrels and Principles: The Politics of \n     the Presidential Veto'' 1-7 (1988), clause 3 was taken \n     directly from a provision of the Massachusetts Constitution \n     of 1780. This provision set in the State's fundamental \n     charter Massachusetts law dating to 1733 first implemented to \n     give the Royal Governor a check on unbridled spending by the \n     colonial legislature, which had put the colony in serious \n     debt by avoiding the governor's veto power by appropriating \n     money through ``votes'' rather than legislation. Professor \n     McDonald has also noted in an op-ed article published in the \n     Wall Street Journal, that the agents of the King of England \n     could disapprove or alter colonial legislative enactments \n     ``in any part thereof.''\n       Discussion and debate at the Constitutional Convention over \n     the meaning of clause 3 was scant. In his notes of the \n     proceedings of the Convention, our main source for the intent \n     of the Framers of our fundamental Charter, Madison noted only \n     that Roger Sherman of Connecticut ``thought [article I, \n     section 7, clause 3] unnecessary, except as to votes taking \n     money out of the Treasury.'' No other member of the \n     Convention appears to have discussed the clause. Sherman's \n     comment was important, as it demonstrates the context in \n     which the Framers saw the newly added provision: it was \n     needed only insofar as it pertained to votes appropriating \n     money from the Treasury. Perhaps discussion was so scant \n     because the meaning of the clause was clear to the Framers.\n       In his 1988 article, Professor McDonald notes that two \n     Anti-Federalist pamphleteers opposed the proposed \n     Constitution in part because article I, section 7, clause 3 \n     ``made too strong a line-item veto in the hands of the \n     President.'' The Federalist Governor of Massachusetts, James \n     Bowdoin, argued during the Massachusetts ratifying convention \n     that the veto power was to be read in light of the \n     Massachusetts experience in which, as noted, the lint-item \n     veto was exercised by the governor. In ``The Federalist'' No. \n     69, Alexander Hamilton wrote that the constitutional veto \n     power ``tallies exactly with the revisionary authority of the \n     council of revision'' in New York, which, according to \n     Professor McDonald, had the power to revise appropriations \n     bills, not merely turn down the entire legislative enactment. \n     Massachusetts, Georgia, and Vermont also gave their \n     executives revisionary authority over legislative \n     appropriations.\n       Roger Sherman's comment was prescient, as he focused on the \n     issue confronting us over 200 hundred years later. The \n     language of clause 3 has proven to be redundant, as Congress \n     has not attempted to avoid the strictures of the second \n     clause. But\n      clause 3 is not superfluous as regards, in Sherman's \n     language, ``votes taking money out of the Treasury.'' In \n     order to give effect to this provision, the President must \n     have the authority to separate out different items from a \n     single appropriation bill and veto one or more of those \n     individual items.\n       This reading is consistent with the early national \n     practice, under which Presidents viewed appropriations as \n     permissive rather than mandatory. President Washington and \n     his Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton, assumed that the \n     President had the authority to shift appropriated funds from \n     one account to another. The former Anti-Federalists, having \n     become the Republican party, objected to these transfers. \n     Once a Republican, Thomas Jefferson, became President, \n     however, he too considered appropriations bills to be \n     permissive and refused on at least two occasions to spend \n     money that had been appropriated by Congress.\n       Professor McDonald points out in his 1988 article that \n     shortly after the new Federal Constitution was ratified, \n     several of the States rewrote their constitutions to conform \n     their basic charters to the new Federal one. The \n     contemporaneous experience of these States is highly relevant \n     to the Framers' understanding of the text they had devised. \n     Several States adopted new constitutions in 1789 or the early \n     1790's. Of these, Georgia and Pennsylvania, and the new \n     States of Vermont and Kentucky all adopted constitutions that \n     included the phrasing of article I, section 7 to enable their \n     governors to exercise the line-item veto.\n       According to a 1984 report of the Committee on the Budget \n     of the House of Representatives, ``The Line-Item Veto: An \n     Appraisal,'' the practice at the national level of the \n     President's exercise of a line-item veto continued. President \n     Andrew Jackson declined, over congressional objection, to \n     enforce provisions of a congressional enactment in 1830. In \n     1842, President John Tyler signed a bill that he refused to \n     execute in full. Instead, he advised Congress that he had \n     deposited with the Secretary of State ``an exposition of my \n     reasons for giving [the bill] my sanction.'' Congress issued \n     a report challenging the legality of the President's action.\n       Professor McDonald noted that between 1844 and 1859, three \n     northern States, responding to fiscal problems, adopted \n     constitutions explicitly providing their governors with power \n     to veto individual items of appropriation. Building on this \n     history, the provisional Constitution of the Confederate \n     States of America also made explicit that the President of \n     the Confederacy had line-item veto authority.\n       It was only after the Civil War that President Grant \n     suggested that he did not already enjoy the authority to veto \n     individual items of appropriation and other specific riders \n     to legislation and urged that he be granted such authority. \n     President Grant's position that he did not enjoy a line-item \n     veto under the Constitution was directly contradictory to the \n     original understanding of the Constitution, a position \n     endorsed by Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Jackson, and \n     Tyler through usage. It ignored the original understanding of \n     the Framers of the Constitution and the historical context in \n     which that document was drafted. Proposals for a Federal \n     line-item veto have been made intermittently since the Grant \n     Administration.\n       An alternative argument based on the language of article I, \n     section 7, clause 2, but consistent with the original \n     understanding of the veto power, has also been made to \n     support the President's exercise of a line-item veto. In \n     discussing why the issue of a line-item veto was not raised \n     during the Constitutional Convention, Professor Russell Ross \n     of the University of Iowa and former United States \n     Representative Fred Schwengel wrote in an article ``An Item \n     Veto for the President?'' 12 Presidential Studies Quarterly \n     66 (1982), ``[i]t is at least possible that this subject was \n     not raised because those attending the Convention gave the \n     term `bill' a much narrower construction than has since been \n     applied to the term. It may have been envisioned that a bill \n     would be concerned with only one specific subject and that \n     subject would be clearly stated in the title.''\n       Professor Ross and Mr. Schwengel quote at length the former \n     Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Hatton W. Sumners, \n     who defended this view in a 1937 letter to the Speaker of the \n     House that was reprinted in the Congressional Record on \n     February 27, 1942. Chairman Sumners was of the view that the \n     term ``bill'' as used in clause 2 of section 7 of the first \n     article was intended to be applied narrowly to refer to \n     ``items which might have been the subject matter of separate \n     bills.'' This reading he thought most consistent with the \n     purpose and plan of the Constitution. Thus, Chairman Sumners \n     believed that clause 2, as originally intended, could also be \n     relied upon to vest line-item veto authority in the \n     President.\n       Chairman Sumners' reading is also consistent with the \n     practice in some of the colonies. Professor McDonald cites to \n     the Maryland constitution of 1776, which expressly provided \n     that any enacted bill could have only one subject. Several \n     other States followed Maryland during the succeeding decades \n     and limited legislative enactments to a single subject.\n       A review of the contemporary understanding of the veto \n     provisions of the Constitution when drafted supports the view \n     that the President currently enjoys line-item veto authority, \n     which several Presidents have exercised.\n\n[[Page S1014]]\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 9, 1993.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Following up on our conversation on Air \n     Force One enroute to Pittsburgh last week, I am enclosing for \n     you a copy of a statement which I presented on the Senate \n     floor today together with a memorandum of law on your power \n     to exercise the line-item veto without a constitutional \n     amendment or statutory authority.\n       The essence of the position is that Article I, Section 7, \n     Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution adopted language from the \n     Massachusetts Constitution which authorized the line-item \n     veto. Pennsylvania, Georgia, Vermont and Kentucky included \n     that phrasing to enable their governors to exercise the line-\n     item veto. Presidents Jefferson, Jackson and Tyler refused to \n     execute portions of congressional appropriations enactments \n     constituting a line-item veto.\n       Again my thanks for including me in last week's trip to \n     Pennsylvania.\n       My best.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 18, 1993.\n     Hon.

I appreciate your sharing \n     them with me.\n       As you know I have supported granting the President line-\n     item veto authority legislatively. I believe that H.R. 1578 \n     as passed by the House, which provides for a modified line-\n     item veto, represents a good compromise that would go a long \n     way toward achieving the purposes of a line-item veto. I hope \n     that I will continue to have your support in the effort to \n     control spending and eliminate undesirable items of spending.\n       With best wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/17/senate-section/article/S1009-5", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        SENATE RESOLUTION 61--RELATIVE TO THE PRESIDENTIAL VETO\n\n  Mr. SPECTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.
